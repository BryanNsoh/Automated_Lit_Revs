  description: The agricultural industry has been transformed by the Internet of Things
    (IoT) revolution, which has brought about cutting-edge solutions to problems relating
    to crop monitoring and management. This article provides a thorough analysis of
    a smart agricultural IoT system created for effective crop monitoring of crop
    moisture and temperature. The objective of this research is to create a comprehensive
    system that can continuously track temperature and moisture levels in agricultural
    fields, giving farmers useful information for smarter crop management decisions.
    To continually monitor and analyse important environmental parameters impacting
    crop growth, the created system incorporates several IoT components, such as wireless
    sensors, actuators, and cloud-based data analytics. Temperature and moisture are
    the two main factors that determine the health, yield, and general quality of
    the crop. Real-time temperature and moisture data are gathered from various points
    inside the agricultural field by the use of wireless sensors. The information
    is subsequently processed and interpreted by sophisticated data analytics algorithms
    on a cloud-based platform. According to the study, the IoT-based system effectively
    regulated environmental temperature, resulting in an average decrease to 26.2°C,
    while concurrently maintaining or improving soil moisture content, evidenced by
    an increase to 45%. Farmers with this guidance can therefore improve their decision-making
    processes and ultimately increase agricultural yield, sustainability, and economic
    consequences by utilising IoT capabilities. Further research and development in
    this area could revolutionized global agriculture and help ensure food security
    in the face of shifting climatic circumstances and rising population demands as
    IoT continues to develop.

    rights and content Abstract One of the principal objectives of Integrated Water
    Resources Management (IWRM) is to solve water and development problems using methods
    that are environmentally sustainable, socially equitable, and efficient. In this
    chapter, we demonstrate how the principles of citizen science—the intrinsic involvement
    of nonscientist local stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of a project—have
    the potential to complement and benefit those of IWRM; in particular, in relation
    to creating scientific evidence that underpins the governance of water resources.
    The rapid, recent development of information and communication technologies such
    as the Internet, smartphones, and social media has already demonstrated their
    capacity to make knowledge creation and governance more multidirectional, decentralized,
    diverse, and inclusive. We show how such new technologies can be harnessed with
    a citizen science approach to interrogate different aspects of the water cycle.
    One particularly promising development is to support citizen science with robust
    and low-cost sensor and networking technology. Such networks offer not only improved
    data coverage (especially in remote or data-scarce regions) but also enhanced
    sustainability at a time when monitoring networks are in decline globally. We
    argue that, in certain cases, citizen science and polycentric governance approaches
    can enrich and complement IWRM and merit greater attention. Previous chapter in

    Evolution Between Citizen Science, Sensor Networks, and Integrated Water Resources
    Management Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) emphasizes long-term sustainable
    approaches to water governance, focusing on co-ordinated decision-making and integrated
    approaches across all sectors (e.g., government, agriculture, and sanitation)
    and scales.1, 2 Exclusively top-down and supply-led water management techniques
    have been recognized as imposing high economic, natural, and social costs on the
    environment and society that are increasingly unsustainable.2, 3 IWRM can be viewed
    as a means of achieving three strategic objectives4: • Equity in water allocation
    to different stakeholders (e.g., social and economic groups); • Efficiency in
    water transfer and use; • Environmental sustainability and protection of the water
    resources base. These salient pillars of IWRM provide an excellent fit with the
    emerging trend of democratizing science and hydrology in particular, in the context
    of citizen science-led research projects.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 While the manner by which
    “citizen science” is interpreted can vary widely depending on the project context,
    they generally involve citizens in at least one of steps of the knowledge generation
    process, that is, data collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination
    of results (Section 2). Although the practice of citizen science in hydrology
    and water resources has lagged behind other disciplines, as hydrological data
    are often difficult to interpret intuitively, while measurements tend to be expensive
    (e.g., using highly technical instruments), complex, spatially sparse, and temporally
    dense (for instance, long time series of discharge and precipitation), there is
    an increasing body of examples of citizen-led measurements, such as for precipitation,
    river water, and soil moisture levels.8 This process has been greatly aided by
    rapid technological development over the past 10–15 years, with small, cheap sensors
    now widely available and easy to connect to smartphones, which themselves are
    generally fully Internet-connected and come with sophisticated cameras as standard
    (Section 3.1).10, 11, 12 We therefore identify sizeable potential to combine the
    principles of citizen science with new technologies such as low cost, networked
    sensors that measure variables as disparate as precipitation, soil moisture, dissolved
    oxygen content, and streamflow, within IWRM (Section 3.2).13, 14 At the same time,
    a sensor network has been defined in a hydrological context by the WMO15 as a
    group of data collection activities for different components of the hydrological
    cycle that are designed to address a single objective: this definition shares
    similarities with the fundamentals of IWRM. It is therefore opportune to reflect
    on how the advent of citizen science and emerging sensor network technologies
    can be leveraged jointly to support IWRM. 1.2. The Advent of Low-Cost Networked
    Sensors in IWRM In the past decade, the use of in situ sensors in environmental
    monitoring has increased rapidly16, 17, 18; however, data gaps still exist at
    scales ranging from individual watersheds to the globe. Indeed, recent reviews
    have noted a marked decline in the amount of hydrological data (e.g., precipitation
    and streamflow) being collected in many parts of the world.16, 17, 18, 19, 20
    Moreover, guidance on sensor deployment, use, and data management remains limited.18,
    21 As such, the choice of sensor for a particular activity and the design of a
    suitable network play a crucial role in decision-making in IWRM, for example,
    operational streamflow forecasting, irrigation, flood early warning systems, and
    water quality testing.18, 22, 23 Several such projects have already successfully
    integrated participatory data collection as a means to expand the observational
    database in both space and time.18, 21, 22 Moreover, the physical design of the
    sensor networks themselves for hydrological purposes is also increasingly enriched
    by citizen science approaches to data collection.8, 13, 24, 25 The iterative and
    long-term process of IWRM finds similarities with many citizen science-led projects,
    many of which are more successful when long-term sustainability is considered.13
    These rapid developments contrast against the fact that, over the same very recent
    period, IWRM has remained and still remains highly data scarce. In many regions,
    the lengths of existing time series are insufficient.26 IWRM encompasses many
    areas where a major need for better data availability persists, a lack that entails
    high societal cost (as it has a direct impact upon livelihoods). Also, institutional
    methods often struggle to create “actionable” knowledge at a local level. For
    instance, level and discharge monitoring is usually based on a sparse network
    of gauges that require extensive and technologically complex maintenance, which
    confines it to large institutions and government entities. This restriction often
    entails administrative and even legal issues over data access, which can frustrate
    community-level users.8, 13 The purpose of this chapter is therefore to explore
    the opportunities and potential challenges of citizen science and the use of low-cost
    hydrological sensors as a means to complement institutionalized data collection.
    We demonstrate and elaborate upon the intrinsic link between the two and how they
    can be embedded within a polycentric approach to water resources management, especially
    in remote, impoverished, data-scarce regions. 2. Citizen Science in IWRM 2.1.
    Principles and Background While the concept of citizen science is well established,
    several different definitions, both formal and informal, exist.13 Citizen science
    is most commonly defined as science by nonscientists: it is “… a form of science
    enacted and developed by citizens themselves”27, 28 or “[t]he participation of
    the general public in the research design, data collection and interpretation
    process together with scientists.”8 While there is a wealth of literature on the
    subject,29, 30, 31, 32 true citizen science projects can be differentiated from
    more general stakeholder engagement by the active involvement of citizen volunteers
    throughout the entire lifecycle of the IWRM project, requiring one or more motivational
    aspects, such as improving living standards or fostering a sense of national pride.8
    Such approaches have been encountered in water resources management well before
    IWRM was coined as a term: a bottom-up approach was recognized as key in the sustainable
    management of water resources as early as the 1970s.30, 33 Historically, the main
    motivation for citizen science was often based on environmental data collection
    by volunteers.8, 33 With time, the focus has broadened, shifting from acquiring
    data to other phases of the scientific process, including problem statement, analysis,
    and interpretation. Within this perspective, it is increasingly the citizens who,
    as engaged stakeholders, define the problem at hand and then collect relevant
    environmental information (e.g., observations of streamflow, rainfall, flood damage,
    and so on). A recent framework34 refers to this mode of citizen science as extreme
    citizen science or collaborative learning (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res

    in citizen science, after Haklay.34 Specific examples within IWRM are shown on
    the right. IWRM, Integrated Water Resources Management. In this interpretation,
    the emphasis is not on the citizen as a scientist but on the scientist as a citizen.35,
    36 This method of practicing science is currently not widely accepted: taking
    into account local needs, practices, and culture, it requires scientists to engage
    at a profound level with the social and ethical aspects of their work.35 This
    process typically involves spending extended periods of time understanding the
    needs and concerns of a range of local stakeholders, the number and (sometimes
    competing) interests of which, in IWRM projects, is often manifold. This form
    of citizen science across an entire project lifecycle is gaining popularity and
    traction within water management and conservation sciences in particular.37, 38,
    39 There is a number of information gaps that hamper effective environmental monitoring
    for evidence-based decision-making, including insufficient data, inconsistent
    metrics, weaknesses in predictive models, and a lack of real-time monitoring systems.40
    While increasing numbers of stakeholders—governments and large development organizations,
    research centers and private companies, and local and national non-governmental
    organizations—engage in data collection, their activities are mostly uncoordinated,
    and the resulting data often remain underutilized. Most worryingly, very rarely
    do those metrics translate into usable, actionable knowledge for the communities
    directly affected by changes in water management.41 Recent research13, 34 has
    demonstrated that community-based monitoring can provide reliable data to help
    fill data gaps, for instance, in catchment and risk management.8, 9, 16, 42, 43
    Comprising both outreach (awareness raising, increased scientific literacy, community
    cohesion, and social capital) and research (robust and meaningful metrics) outputs,
    the participatory, community-led approach can be fruitful for policy development,
    as well as decision-making, across a variety of scales (e.g., local to (inter)national;
    village farmers to government institutions, and so on). The participatory approach
    has been shown to work best when there is active buy-in from the local community.5,
    28, 44 That is, the benefits to local stakeholders should be highlighted. The
    best projects have their aims and objectives defined at the outset; project members
    have appropriate expertise (not just scientifically but also in publicity and
    communication), and there is a clear willingness to listen and adapt as necessary.
    A participant is only a citizen scientist when they actively volunteer (i.e.,
    they are motivated by one or more factors) and maintain their activity throughout
    the duration of the project. In many citizen science projects, the involvement
    of a “community champion” or “gateway organization” (like a local water board,
    farmers'' co-operative, village council) is a key precept to secure long-term
    viability and sustainability; in others, it is possible for participants to lose
    interest and/or fall out of contact with each other and the project leads.10,
    45 Elsewhere, “citizen sensors” are less involved in the aims and formulation
    of the project, collecting data passively without any obvious motivation.11 However,
    the recent tendency is to involve volunteers in all intellectual aspects of the
    science, rather than capitalizing on them as a low-cost workforce.8, 9, 13 The
    implications of the Internet, smartphones, and new developments in sensing technology
    on citizen science in a hydrological context have recently been discussed.13 The
    increased mobile phone saturation across all societal segments—many in the most
    remote regions of the world possess smartphones prior to the arrival of electricity
    or mains water—opens up new ways of both gathering big data and accessing environmentally
    relevant information, having a profound impact upon the work of policymakers.46,
    47 Most current smartphones may be equipped with sensors that can be utilized
    for scientific observation, including transceivers, Frequency Modulation (FM)
    and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, cameras, accelerometers, digital
    compasses, and microphones.48, 49 While many of these sensors are not directly
    very useful for hydrology, mobile phones themselves can act as conduits of information
    as a means to obtain sensor data (e.g., physical observations, social media, and
    measurements from users sent to the predesigned scientific domain48, 50) and to
    deliver processed information to end users. Although, for reasons noted previously,
    intensive scientific training and specialization are normally prerequisites for
    data analysis and manipulation in hydrology and IWRM projects,51 new technological
    developments can, to some extent, circumvent these limitations, paving the way
    for the more rapid uptake of citizen science (Table 1).8, 13 Table 1. Some Commonly
    Measured Variables in IWRM and Opportunities Emerging From Citizen Science Applications

    2.2. Different Approaches to Citizen Science Many current research and practical
    projects in IWRM involve community-based responses to hazards like river flooding
    or water allocation and stewardship,68, 69, 70 creating the opportunity for real-time
    observation and appropriate courses of action to be taken.10, 71, 72, 73 In the
    majority of these studies, the role of citizen scientists is typically limited
    to information and data gathering rather than leveraging the full potential of
    actionable knowledge cogeneration.9 Compared with citizen science applications
    in bioscience and hydroecology (e.g., measuring water quality parameters and biodiversity),
    there is generally less emphasis on training the project participants.8 Recent
    technological development has, to an extent, obviated the need for intensive training:
    water data can be easily shared via short message service (SMS), instant messaging,
    or social media, requiring a minimum of technical expertise. This is because hydrological
    measurements are, in general, more automatized (cf. in hydroecology, where the
    data collection process is more complex).10, 11, 12 However, expertise is still
    required in the data processing and analysis stage; but because of the ability
    to share and transfer data, this does not necessarily have to be done by the citizens
    (or whoever is in the field) themselves but rather can be undertaken by remote
    experts.11, 12 The degree of self-organization of the citizen scientists varies
    widely, often as a function of the motivational aspects discussed in Section 2.1.
    On one end of the spectrum, water management projects that are labeled as “community-led”
    by the organizers may in practice involve very limited direct community engagement,
    and as a result of this, collect very little data or utilize it sparingly or poorly.
    For instance, drainage and early warning systems to reduce the risk from glacial
    outburst floods in Nepal were constructed and monitored following a remote crowdsourcing
    approach, but little action was then taken, owing to funding concerns and lack
    of continuing interest from participants.74 Moreover, the initial results of the
    Creek Watch program in the Western United States, a smartphone app–based project
    with the objective of water quality monitoring and flood resilience building,
    did not include the possibility of direct user engagement or future self-organization.
    This was related to a lack of specific, well-defined roles for the relevant actors.11
    Sometimes, governmental bodies, scientists, or other high-level stakeholders do
    not recognize local actors as being able to produce high-quality, official information;
    furthermore, community interest or deliberation over possible solutions may be
    lacking.13, 69, 74 On the other end of the spectrum, extensive community-led engagement
    exercises have generated fruitful results for knowledge cogeneration, from rural
    areas with multiple water management issues as in Western Nepal52, 74 to urban
    areas at risk from repeated flooding.68, 69, 70, 75, 76 The most effective projects
    (from the point of view that both scientific and citizen engagement objectives
    are satisfied) involve two-way information flow over the entire project lifecycle,
    which has been shown to improve citizen participation significantly, as well as
    their sense of situational awareness.8, 13, 77 In many of these projects, situational
    analyses led to a prior understanding of local livelihoods, power structures,
    and institutional frameworks, which enabled the scientific interventions to be
    better targeted, increasing local buy-in and long-term project sustainability.8,
    13, 52, 74 However, most citizen science projects in this context only involve
    monitoring and data submission (“citizens as sensors”: a “one-way street” according
    to Liu et al.10), with roll-out of citizen-to-citizen or citizen-to-scientist
    feedback (and more sophisticated information provision systems) generally lacking
    or at an early stage. This may place limits on the sustainability of ostensibly
    “successful” projects (such as those discussed previously).11, 45, 72, 73 For
    this reason, an increasing number of studies focus on the question of how citizen
    science concepts may be leveraged to create actionable knowledge in the context
    of natural resources management, including water resources. 2.3. Polycentric Approaches
    to Water Governance Water is a complex resource to manage for reasons that include
    its uneven global distribution, divergent, and often competing for needs of different
    stakeholders, and its absolute necessity in sustaining life. Managing resources
    in a polycentric manner has the potential to resolve many of these issues. For
    instance, in the polycentric model, water monitoring responsibilities are shared
    and overlap (between, e.g., farmers, local government, and sanitation authorities);
    these overlapping spheres of management ensure that monitoring still takes place
    should one entity neglect its responsibilities.74, 78 A polycentric approach to
    the governance of natural resources has also recently been explored in the context
    of climate change policy79 and has been recognized as paralleling recent technological
    development.77, 79 The combination of this polycentric conceptualization of water
    governance with citizen science strongly suggests that a participatory approach
    to data collection can enhance multidirectional information provision, polycentric
    water governance, local water resources management, and long-term sustainability
    of water resources management projects.8, 13, 25, 77 A polycentric water governance
    model may be more appropriate than IWRM in certain situations.9 Lankford and Hepworth78
    analyzed large watersheds in sub-Saharan Africa, finding their disparate environments,
    communities, and institutions not well suited to the IWRM paradigm, which uses
    a centralized, hierarchical, command, and control regulatory regime. By contrast,
    the actual management of water resources in such basins is characterized by informal,
    flexible, localized decision-making, largely based on local knowledge and dialog.
    Polycentric water resources management was judged to be more effective in such
    remote, data-scarce regions, where decisions tend to be small-scale and incremental.
    Citizen science–based monitoring complements this polycentric water governance
    model in its informality and highly distributed nature.9, 78 In this way, citizen
    science contributes to localized, multitiered decision-making.9 As mentioned earlier,
    the monitoring process itself has benefited greatly from rapid technological progress
    over the past 10–15 years, rendering it easier than ever for a nonscientist to
    make simple measurements or observations via smartphone apps or simple, off-the-shelf,
    low-cost sensors. 3. Low-Cost Sensors in IWRM 3.1. Sensor Networks The installation
    of networks of robust and low-cost sensors (e.g., automatic rain gauges and river-level
    distance sensors) is receiving increasing attention as a way to complement existing
    but often sparse institutional monitoring networks; for instance, in the context
    of risk management.11, 13, 77, 80, 81 One particular context in which such sensors
    have the potential to be particularly effective is that of participatory monitoring.
    The participatory aspect can be limited to the supervision and/or installation
    of such sensor networks. However, in high-risk, low-data availability areas, citizens
    can also provide additional, often qualitative, information via various devices
    such as smartphones (Section 2.1; this information is commonly known as volunteered
    geographic Information [VGI]12, 45). The combination of in situ sensors with VGI
    can act as a mutual support system to improve significantly the coverage of monitored
    areas, thus supporting IWRM.6, 8, 80 In addition to sensor data, relevant VGI-based
    information can take the form of time-stamped and geolocated photographs,10, 11,
    73 social media updates,12, 69, 70 or interviews and feedback to ad hoc hazard
    mitigation websites.68, 71 Smartphone apps have also been developed to this end.10,
    45 On the other hand, a few projects have worked more closely with local communities
    in order to explain to and train participants in the use of more complex monitoring
    principles, for example, water level and flow13, 52, 81 and rain gauges.80 The
    use of low-cost sensors also allows the construction of networks with a spatiotemporal
    density that is much greater than hitherto possible. This is useful to cover the
    strong spatial heterogeneity in catchments over a variety of scales, which is
    still a major challenge in hydrology.18, 66 Indeed, in most parts of the world,
    the spatial density of existing monitoring networks (e.g., rain gauges) is still
    well below the scientifically recommended minimum, which has important impacts
    on operational practices such as flood forecasting.82, 83 It is also a major scientific
    issue; for instance, for the formulation of hypotheses in complex models.84, 85,
    86, 87 We identify three aspects of sensor networks that are particularly relevant
    in this context: • The ubiquity of sensors in low-cost everyday devices like smartphones
    has allowed a greater range of variables to be quantified simultaneously (and
    the sampling density of existing sensor networks to be greatly increased)8, 13,
    14, 88; • Low-cost open-source hardware such as the Arduino platform makes it
    possible to develop ad hoc sensors; for instance, for river stage and precipitation
    measurement8, 24; • The increased accessibility of data repositories in environmental
    sciences and online sharing of results make it possible to combine different datasets
    in novel ways. Since it is often costly and disruptive to create networks of spatially
    representative wired sensors at the scale desired and data access to sensors equipped
    only with local logging is limited by the need to visit sites to download data,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as an efficient and economical solution
    for distributed sensing (Section 3.2).20, 89 3.2. Wireless and “Smart” Networks
    WSNs are typically built of nodes (from a few to several thousands); each one
    hosts one or more sensors that monitor specific variables, such as water level,8,
    55, 62 soil moisture,61, 65 or water temperature and chemistry.54, 57, 90 These
    observables are detailed in full in Table 1. Once a measurement has been recorded,
    data are then passed through the network (from node to node: “multi-hop”) to one
    or more data repositories. Wireless network protocols including mobile phone (SMS)
    transmission, Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee work as the backbone of such systems.91,
    92 Each node is composed of several parts: a radio transceiver with an internal
    antenna or connection to an external antenna, a microcontroller, an electronic
    circuit for interfacing with the sensors, and an energy source, usually a battery
    or an embedded form of energy harvesting. Their cost is variable, ranging from
    a few to hundreds of dollars, depending on the complexity of the individual sensor
    nodes. Size and cost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding constraints
    on resources such as energy, memory, computational speed, transmission range,
    and data rate transmission.65 Because of these constraints, data collection typically
    proceeds in a distributed manner.61, 91 A distributed control architecture also
    provides the nodes with a back-up in case of failure.20 WSN designs can be optimized
    for sensing accuracy and/or fault tolerance and can be deployed in harsh environments
    to provide continuous monitoring and processing capabilities. As such, they have
    become very popular in IWRM in the past 5–10 years, as they reduce the complexity
    related to the installation and maintenance of the system compared with its wired
    counterpart.20, 57, 92 The development of WSNs is active and ongoing especially
    in the area of power consumption reduction, for instance, through power-aware
    protocols, adaptive radio frequency in nodes, and algorithms to estimate optimal
    sampling frequencies for sensors.20, 57, 60, 92 In water management and elsewhere,
    the development and provision of sensor networks that are intelligent or “smart”
    are now feasible. This increases the flexibility in network design, for example,
    optimizing the balance between spatial coverage, the cost/quality ratio of individual
    sensors, and network redundancy. Moreover, recent improved data storage and transmission
    capacities make it possible to monitor at much higher temporal resolution than
    before. For example, measuring water level at time steps of minutes or less within
    a sensor network would make it possible to measure hydraulic observables such
    as wave characteristics or to track flood wave celerity in a river. As areas of
    interest (e.g., a particular river reach that is prone to flooding) are not uniformly
    spatially distributed, the advantages of smart sensor networks in IWRM are becoming
    increasingly manifest; for instance: • Measurement accuracy can be maximized while
    simultaneously minimizing resource consumption (i.e., energy and network bandwidth).
    • A higher sampling frequency and/or density at points of interest in space and
    time (the corollary of which being lower resource consumption at times and places
    where measurements are not needed). • Certain highly sophisticated, high power
    consumption sensors (e.g., water quality fiber optics) can be switched off when
    not operating, while also optimizing the number of sampling operations; both of
    which could dramatically increase network lifetime.93 • Sensors that talk to each
    other in real time could capture discrete events like flood waves or irrigation
    events. For instance, time series forecasting could be exploited such that a sensor
    placed upstream in a river reach activates successive downstream sensors and/or
    increases their measurement frequency.56, 93 3.3. Manifold Types of Sensors Fig.
    2 shows how many different sensor types can be used to interrogate the various
    aspects of the water cycle and water resources management described in Table 1.
    Within these techniques, there is a continuous spectrum between well-established
    “classic” hydrometric practice, which is often more expensive and/or difficult
    to practition, and newer and more experimental sensor networks, which are usually
    cheaper and more straightforward to implement, thus providing a better fit with
    citizen science principles (Fig. 2). Indeed, for IWRM, the burgeoning community
    of “tech-enthusiastic hydrologists,” for instance, the Measurements and Observations
    in the XXI century working group of the International Association of Hydrological
    Sciences, exemplifies a low-cost, multidisciplinary perspective to tackling complex
    observations and problems.14 Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download

    of water resources management (Table 1) and a comparison of their ease of integration
    in citizen science projects. We now discuss the possibilities for each measurable
    quantity in water resources management identified earlier (Table 1; Fig. 2) in
    turn. 3.3.1. Precipitation The need for high temporal and spatial resolution precipitation
    data for water management models and mathematical analyses has been discussed
    in several studies.94, 95, 96 The simple design and affordability of rain gauges
    make them particularly suited for application outside the traditional monitoring
    environment. Electronic sensors such as tipping bucket switches allow for convenient
    automatization. Yet, rain gauge measurements are very sensitive to the local aerodynamic
    conditions15 and nonstandard locations or varying local conditions (e.g., undergrowth,
    vegetation blockage), thus affecting the quality and interpretability of measurements.
    Accurate rainfall information is lacking in large areas of the world, and the
    number of rain gauges is severely declining in Europe, South America, and Africa
    especially.88 Although rain gauges provide valuable information, a very dense
    rain gauge network is costly.96 As a result, several new ideas have emerged to
    help estimate areal rainfall with higher temporal and spatial resolution. Disdrometers
    are increasingly used in precipitation monitoring and are both cheap and robust
    in their measurements.86 Other, more experimental, methods for precipitation measurements,
    such as cellular communication interference,64, 86 are under development and may
    eventually provide new possibilities for nonscientist involvement (Section 2).
    New precipitation measurement networks are also being created by exploiting sensors
    embedded within everyday objects; for instance, the optical sensors designed for
    operating car windscreen wipers.96 These new sensor networks have the potential
    to expand spatial coverage greatly while also providing useful additional information
    for hydrological modeling, for example, discharge simulation.19, 88, 96 3.3.2.
    Water Level Accurately monitoring water levels at high spatial and temporal scale
    is a key element in many areas of water resources management, for instance, flood
    risk management systems; yet sensor network design is complex, often expensive,
    and may require extensive maintenance and circumvention of legal issues and property
    laws.8, 58 The need for rapid response times has motivated the accelerated development
    of WSNs in this area.55, 56, 58, 85 Several studies report the use of low-cost
    ultrasonic sensors (often originally intended for some other purpose like monitoring
    diesel levels in fuel tanks) to provide real-time information of river stage in
    flood risk management systems.56, 58, 62 Wireless networks of these sensors have
    allowed flood early warning systems to be deployed at much larger spatial scales
    at an affordable cost.85 Because of their low cost and the ease of purchase, ad
    hoc ultrasonic sensors can be manufactured in a relatively straightforward manner,
    lending themselves to citizen science projects.8, 13, 24 Beyond ultrasound, the
    electromagnetic spectrum can similarly be exploited to quantify river and well
    levels. For instance, the reflection characteristics of long-wavelength (0.1–10
    m) radio waves have been used to interrogate river level changes.97, 98 Such Radio
    Detection and Ranging data are usually obtained from satellite-mounted or airborne
    equipment.97 Near-infrared Light Detection And Ranging systems, first used in
    the 1930s to measure air-density profiles in the upper atmosphere,99 also have
    the potential to be used in tandem with ultrasonic sensors to measure changes
    in water level. Such systems could play an important future role in generating
    (citizen-led) data for IWRM, especially in areas where official monitoring networks
    are sparse or suffer from inadequate management or underfunding.52 3.3.3. Soil
    Moisture Soil water content measurements, which are increasingly automated, play
    a key role in partitioning water and energy fluxes at the land surface and in
    controlling hydrologic fluxes such as groundwater recharge.65 Major technical
    limitations include operational restrictions to narrow ranges of soil apparent
    permittivity and limited measurement accuracy.8 As a result, and despite the usefulness
    of capturing moisture fluctuations in the ground after precipitation events, soil
    moisture is not yet measured operationally at larger scales, unlike, for example,
    precipitation or river stage.18 Only limited attempts have been made to initialize
    ad hoc soil moisture sensor networks: for instance, Bogena et al.65 use a 150-node
    WSN to monitor soil moisture in near real-time for a small catchment in Western
    Germany. According to these workers, the prohibitively high sensor density needed
    to assess heterogeneities in soil moisture precludes the development of a more
    spatially extensive network. Normally, soil moisture sensors are incorporated
    in a wider network with other types of sensors and have found frequent use in
    automated irrigation systems. 3.3.4. Sensor Clusters In water resources management,
    sensor networks can be designed such that each station incorporates many different
    types of sensors, which is important for assessing catchment-scale water balances17,
    20, 61 or in the sustainable use of water resources in agriculture.60, 100, 101
    Multisensor networks can reduce hydrological uncertainty in at least three ways.
    First, redundant measurements improve estimations of change in meteorological
    variables like precipitation and relative humidity synchronously; second, distributed
    measurements capture local variability and constrained uncertainty in many derived
    hydrological attributes important for modeling and prediction; and finally, basin-scale
    patterns (e.g., elevation gradients in precipitation and their effect on streamflow)
    can be captured more completely than using sensors that measure a single variable.20
    Kerkez et al.61 deployed a WSN in an IWRM project as part of a water balance instrument
    cluster across a headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California;
    over 300 sensors provided spatially representative measurements of snow depth,
    solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. In this
    instance, the performance of the WSN was interrogated. Two indicators of network
    performance—viz. the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicator—showed
    that for the specific site conditions, a conservative 50-m node-to-node spacing
    would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. A balance
    between the number of sensing and signal repeating nodes was sought to ensure
    proper spatial radio coverage. Lundquist et al.21 had implemented a similar WSN
    in the same area earlier, which measured the same quantities, but on a smaller
    scale. In both studies, it was realized that because of the steep and variable
    topography, communication techniques had to be tailored to suit each location,
    resulting in a hybrid network of radio, cell-phone, land-line, and satellite transmissions.
    Elsewhere, larger-scale, multiple-catchment IWRM studies usually employ sparser
    networks of sensor clusters. For instance, the Gradients Along Mountain to Urban
    Transitions monitoring network involves real-time data collection that is used
    to model water quality, inputs, and outputs between urban and rural areas in Northern
    Utah (Jones et al., 2017). Similarly, Ingelrest et al.66 describe the blueprint
    for a multisensor WSN called SensorScope, which has been deployed multiple times
    in various environments to interrogate water demand in urban environments. In
    this instance, the sensor network is described as a “turnkey solution” that requires
    very little site-specific adjustment beyond possible alterations to sampling frequency,
    as well as interactions with local end-users in each project (Section 2). 3.4.
    Sensor Networks in IWRM Hydrometric information collected from the different types
    of sensor networks detailed in Section 3.2 constitutes the fundamental input for
    the design of various water resources projects such as freshwater distribution
    systems,63, 90 irrigation networks,60, 89 and flood early warning systems.85,
    102 An adequately designed network should therefore be able to provide appropriate
    information for a range different users and industries, in the cross-sectoral
    spirit of IWRM. Fig. 3 shows how such networks, their operation, and design, as
    well as calibration, can benefit from a citizen science approach to yield enhanced
    decision-making capabilities in IWRM. Download : Download high-res image (232KB)

    The WMO15 emphasized the importance of establishing an optimum network, where
    the interpolation between values at different stations should make it possible
    to determine the characteristics of the basic hydrometeorological elements at
    any point within a country. They also suggest beginning with the definition of
    the institutional setup and the purposes, objectives, and priorities of the network,
    followed by optimization procedures and financial revisions before final implementation.
    Table 2 contains examples of different sensor networks that have recently been
    implemented in water management projects across the globe. Although many of these
    networks concern rivers, ad hoc groundwater (Valencia, Spain103) and underwater
    quality (Wuhan, China: Lv et al.102) monitoring networks have also been discussed.
    It is clear from Table 2 that the peculiarities of sensor network design (for
    instance, the number of nodes, sampling frequency, and power supply) vary widely
    not only according to the purpose of the project but also in response to the realities
    of sensor deployment in often harsh and inaccessible environments. Most of these
    studies, especially over the last 10 years, have been concerned with developing
    new (and often hybrid) monitoring methods or experimenting with new technology,
    rather than “classic” hydrological research. However, none of these networks is
    yet at the stage of integration in operational IWRM; the object of many of the
    studies detailed in Table 2 was simply to experiment with new technology. Table

    has great potential to broaden the variety of sensor network designs. Typical
    observables that can be measured by sensors to assess water quality include water
    temperature, dissolved oxygen content, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, trace
    element concentration, pressure, redox potential, and pH.8, 52 WSNs and real-time
    controlling and monitoring systems have been successfully integrated to monitor
    water quality for domestic applications.57, 59 In drinking water distribution
    systems, low-cost and lightweight optical and electrochemical sensors, which rapidly
    assess water quality on-the-fly within pipes, provide one example of new technology
    having the potential to complement existing monitoring.59, 67 The setup and customization
    of the sensors and WSN must be straightforward since the technology is relatively
    new and may be unfamiliar to water company engineers in many cases.67 Moreover,
    the sensor nodes are designed to be optimized for rapid installation since deployment
    inside the piped network involves the cessation of water flow and associated loss
    in revenue.59 At the other end of the scale, Banik et al.23 detail a water quality
    monitoring network in a sewer system. In this case the objective is to protect
    the receiving water bodies and mitigate against accidental spills and unauthorized
    discharges. Fewer sensors are required at locations that are more specific and
    carefully selected compared with drinking water quality monitoring, where the
    sensors are typically more densely and evenly spaced.23, 59 Once gray water has
    been discharged into the natural ecological system, the receiving lakes, rivers,
    and wetlands are similarly monitored for water quality. Nasirudin et al.63 describe
    one example, where a WSN system is used as a platform to monitor water quality
    readings, deployed at distributed locations where each node can interface with
    various water quality sensors. Since such sensor networks are typically installed
    in more remote, rural areas, optimized power management is critical: sensors and
    components were chosen on the basis of their low power consumption, while batteries
    are recharged with multiple solar panels. In addition to monitoring water quality
    in domestic water systems, there are a growing number of studies that focus on
    the use of distributed sensor networks that assess flow rate, which is critical
    when the location of leakages is sought. Data transmission often uses GSM to send
    SMSs to network engineers when a problem is detected. In a more automated example,
    the most basic sensor networks might measure water level in a collecting tank,
    sounding an alarm and/or switching on a pump once the level drops below a critical
    threshold.53 Han et al.104 describe a more sophisticated cyber-physical-human
    distributed sensor framework, which leverages data dynamically from multiple information
    sources including Internet of Things–sensing data, geophysical data, human input,
    and simulation/modeling engines to identify leakages and pipe failures rapidly
    (within minutes) and accurately (individual pipeline level). Sensor networks are
    increasingly integrated within automated irrigation systems, which rely on logic
    and Boolean expressions in the same manner as the aforementioned water level alarm
    example.89, 101 Motivated by increasing water demand globally, sensor networks
    can be used to study soil dynamics based on information gathered at regular intervals,
    and the data collected can be used as feedback to improve irrigation efficiency.22
    Gutiérrez et al.60 created an automated irrigation system to optimize water use
    for a crop of sage based on a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and
    temperature sensors placed in the root zone of the plants. Water quantity was
    controlled via an algorithm with threshold values of temperature and soil moisture;
    a cellular–Internet interface allowed for data inspection and irrigation scheduling
    to be programmed through a Web page. After 3 months, water savings of up to 90%
    were achieved compared with traditional irrigation practices. Kim et al.89 employed
    a similar system using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication, while
    McCulloch et al.22 developed a network of more sophisticated sensors that measured
    soil moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity, at three different ground depths.
    In all three cases, sensor nodes were developed using off-the-shelf components
    and were designed to withstand seasonal weather changes and be resistant to damage
    that may be inflicted by wildlife (and domestic cattle) in the field. Furthermore,
    because of their energy autonomy and low cost, these systems have the potential
    to be useful in water-limited, geographically isolated areas. Stable remote access
    to field conditions and real-time control and monitoring of variable-rate irrigation
    controllers can be effectively supported by graphical user interface–based software.22,
    60, 89, 101 4. Discussion What are the main benefits and potential drawbacks of
    using citizen science and polycentric approaches to enrich and complement IWRM
    projects? When an integral component of citizen science projects would typically
    involve sensor-sourced data collection by nonscientists, the design of the sensor
    network may need to be technically simplified so that self-consistent samples
    can be taken.8 Paul et al.13 summarize the challenges and opportunities arising
    from citizen science sensor networks in hydrology. One example is that, while
    the use of smartphones to photograph flooding extent and river level has the potential
    to form a very dense network of “citizen sensors” (i.e., crowdsourcing), the data
    conversion to input for numerical models, as well as the provision of information
    back to volunteers, remain challenging and are under active development.25, 77
    Indeed, networks that use volunteers as sensors can be integrated within a broader
    project framework or so-called Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs77). For
    instance, Galimberti and Balbo105 describe an Italian application that receives
    water level data, collected and sent by citizens, in river cross-sections instrumented
    with a staff gauge and an information panel, performs simple reliability checks,
    before storing and freely disseminating data in near real-time. The data then
    have the potential to be used for further research, model calibration, and validation
    or for land use planning and design. The keyword here is potential: at present,
    many projects that exploit citizen observatory or EVO data, such as the EU-funded
    WeSenseIt and GroundTruth programs, exist only as proofs of concept.106 Both projects
    aim to leverage crowdsourced observations to improve hydrological modeling and
    flood forecasting applications; yet they acknowledge that operationalizing such
    new data acquisition strategies, for instance, in an IWRM environment, is not
    a primary objective.105, 106 Other innovative projects such as Transforming Weather
    Water data into value-added Information services for sustainable Growth in Africa
    aim to enhance satellite datasets with ground-based sensors to derive actionable
    geoinformation, such as flash flood warnings or scheduling improvements to water
    management infrastructure. This question—of how to integrate citizen science data
    into operational IWRM practice—has scientific, technical, and political dimensions,
    which we now discuss in turn. These data are potentially lower quality and more
    temporally sparse compared with the demands of hydrological models for typically
    long-term, high-quality time series (i.e., a more traditional data source) for
    calibration and validation. One solution has been to apply novel merging algorithms,
    for instance, between rain gauge data and satellite precipitation products, to
    create combined datasets.94, 107 Another issue is that the longevity of citizen
    science projects is variable and depends, in part, on the motivational factors
    of the nonscientist stakeholders; this creates an added layer of uncertainty in
    terms of their sustainable integration in longer-term IWRM projects.8, 106 Nevertheless,
    it is clear that, within water resources management, data collection is becoming
    increasingly multi-tiered, involving increased diversity in terms of actors, purposes,
    and tailored, multiobjective networks. This creates favorable conditions for the
    discovery of new ways in which citizen science data can play a role in an operational
    IWRM context. Although, in the past few years, it has been recognized that “citizen
    hydrology” can surmount the challenges of high observational costs and limited
    spatial coverage of traditional hydrometric networks,8, 13, 87, 108 the effects
    of decreased observational frequency, irregular availability, and variable accuracy
    from sensor to sensor, need to be quantified before the data can be used in hydrological
    modeling. Indeed, uncertainties are a major bottleneck to the more widespread
    use and integration of citizen science data in operational IWRM systems; ideally,
    they should be characterized as explicitly and transparently as possible, for
    instance by providing uncertainty bounds. Yet citizen science data are rarely
    presented in such a form due to the inherent difficulties in uncertainty quantification.8,
    87 Davids et al.108 and Mazzoleni et al.87 attempt to resolve this issue, which,
    unchecked, could create suspicion and wariness over citizen science data on the
    part of end users. Somewhat against the principles of citizen science, crowdsourced
    observations were mimicked using synthetic time series (for water level and streamflow
    data87) and bootstrap randomized subsampling (for streamflow data108) to this
    end. Uncertainty was characterized by assuming observational error to be normally
    distributed noise with zero mean and a given standard deviation, using a coefficient
    α to represent measurement uncertainty. The maximum value of α was assumed to
    be three times higher for citizen science data than for actual sensor data. Distributed
    observations from “social” and physical sensors were then assimilated to understand
    the sensitivity of various hydrological models under various scenarios.87 The
    main conclusions were that artificial citizen science data, while sometimes asynchronous
    and inaccurate can still complement traditional sensor networks formed by few
    accurate, static sensors. Variations in observational frequency only had a minor
    effect on model results of, for example, flood forecasting and catchment water
    balances; in this sense, adaptive monitoring could greatly lower uncertainties
    in citizen science hydrology data.87, 106, 108 The next step would be to apply
    these uncertainty quantification techniques to real datasets. According to Gura,109
    people management issues and the very large scale of some citizen science projects
    have the potentially greatest negative impact on data quality. Moreover, volunteer
    recruitment and engagement throughout the project duration remain a challenge,
    with possible solutions including the development of a “ranking system” or the
    identification and promotion of particularly able volunteers.109 There are other,
    nontechnical, factors that govern the uptake of citizen science data. Especially
    in developing countries, the proposals of nonscientist knowledge may not adhere
    to the often rigid institutionalized processes through which knowledge (e.g.,
    national networks of rain gauges) is collected.110 In this way, it may be difficult
    for the proposals of nonscientist local stakeholders to feed into the decision-making
    that is controlled largely by water resources–related bureaucracies. Buytaert
    et al.8 emphasize that acquired knowledge is political: therefore, the way in
    which it is created and represented—its legitimacy, and to what extent it is contested—is
    at least as important as the design of citizen science data collection activities
    itself. Moreover, many water-related data, such as water consumption, in an IWRM
    context have a financial aspect, emphasizing the importance of economic value
    as well as political legitimacy. It is also critical that the data and generated
    knowledge be (and be perceived as) locally relevant and actionable. To this end,
    the feedback loops between citizen science and decision-making should be clear
    and transparent at a variety of different levels; they depend upon a profound
    understanding on the part of individual nonscientists of the generated information.8,
    13 Having articulated these challenges of operationalizing citizen science data,
    it is also important to recall opportunities related to their intrinsic value:
    local measurements will always be of great importance in hydrological modeling.
    Indeed, one significant problem in water management is that the parameters of
    many laws that govern hydrological processes are very local and can only be quantified
    with measurements. Insight gained from one catchment cannot necessarily be transferred
    automatically to another one, even if it borders the other. The fundamental issue
    concerns the extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity of most quantities in
    the water cycle—precipitation, streamflow, river stage, soil moisture inter alia
    (Table 1; Fig. 2)—which explains the proliferation of different designs of sensor
    networks (many of which operated by nonscientists) that aim to quantify these
    variables. In terms of the use of WSNs for water resources monitoring and management,
    while there is still enormous potential for future growth, there are also manifold
    challenges. These include the relatively modest scale of current operational deployments
    (rarely beyond small catchment scale61, 91); limitations of off-the-shelf components;
    a lack of suitable sensors; and the cost of deployment and data collection. Moreover,
    important application-specific requirements may not be well catered for using
    off-the-shelf components (e.g., variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible
    sensor interfaces, ease of deployment, and network models for the broader environment).
    Therefore, although individual-application sensor node design is continually improving,
    there should be greater flexibility in these designs such that networks can interact
    with each other successfully (Section 3.2). In water resources management, the
    direct engagement of citizen scientists in the data processing stage is ripe for
    expansion: the joint analysis and interpretation of data could represent a more
    fundamental means to enhance citizens'' participation in, and education about,
    water resources management projects.13 The following question then arises: how
    can this expansion of nonscientist involvement in data analysis and processing
    be carried out? The citizen science approach emphasizes the benefits using nonscientists
    as basic interpreters, placing renewed focus on data logging, quality control,
    and transmission. Web-based services allow for easy connection of sensors with
    online modeling tools to provide real-time data quality control, storage, and
    simulation. From a technical perspective, regions with low Internet penetration
    can benefit from far-reaching mobile phone coverage for sensor data transmission
    via text messaging.8 The provision of information and data back to nonscientists,
    in a manner that is comprehensible for a nonscientific audience, serves as an
    incentive for further citizen participation. In water resources management, this
    could take the form of irrigation requirements (for farmers), modeled water use
    and demand (for policymakers), or flood vulnerability maps (for the general public).
    Although this important feedback aspect of citizen science is lightly developed,7,
    35 especially in an IWRM context,69, 70, 72 we believe that the recent growth
    of Internet technologies could create excellent opportunities for user feedback
    and communication beyond the scientific project itself. In the small number of
    cases where information provision and citizen feedback are integral to project
    development, the situational awareness and participation rates of participants,
    as well as levels of community buy-in, are high.9, 10, 77 To summarize, we have
    described how emerging sensor network technologies can be leveraged jointly with
    citizen science to support IWRM, which in certain situations can be enriched by
    polycentric approaches to water governance. Networks of low-cost sensors, in particular,
    can be a useful tool to promote such approaches: increasing the number of catchment-scale
    networks that exploit citizen science and these sensors could greatly enrich operational
    IWRM practice. Indeed, if recent technological advances (such as adaptive sampling
    and “smart sensors”) are harnessed by citizen science projects, the resulting
    data could be better integrated in operational IWRM practice, rather than serving
    as small-scale proofs of concept. 5. Conclusions The growth of citizen science
    in hydrology and water resources management can be explained by the prior inaccessibility
    and sparseness of water-related datasets, as well as the development of new technology
    such as Internet-connected smartphones. The active involvement of citizen scientists
    through the entire lifecycle of a practical IWRM project can enhance local uptake,
    support local diagnostics, and increase decision capacity. In other words, the
    principles of polycentric water governance and citizen science are very strongly
    aligned and are expressed well in the form of low-cost sensor networks. Indeed,
    we have also described how such sensor networks that interrogate, for instance,
    river level, precipitation, and soil moisture, provide a useful tool in polycentric
    water governance. Technological developments resulting in the ubiquity of these
    sensors, together with improved methods for data storage, retrieval, and processing,
    have the potential to improve the sustainability of water resources management
    greatly. Moreover, adaptive sampling techniques could lower the uncertainty in
    citizen science datasets, which is a key bottleneck to their more general uptake
    in operational IWRM environments. What is clear is that citizen science can be
    used to bridge potentially wide gaps between contextual science and practical
    field experience in water resources management projects. Combining citizen science
    approaches with networks of low-cost sensors makes for a useful addition to the
    water resources management toolkit, which has the potential to increase data coverage
    drastically, especially in remote or data-scarce regions, at a time when monitoring
    networks are in decline globally. In many such cases, we conclude that polycentric
    and citizen science approaches have great potential to enrich and benefit IWRM.

  description: From connected sensors in soils, on animals or crops, and on drones,
    to various software and services that are available, “smart” technologies are
    changing the way farming is carried out. These technologies allow producers to
    look beyond what the eye can see by collecting non-traditional data and then using
    analytics tools to improve both food sustainability and profitability. “Smart
    Agriculture/farming” (SA) or “Digital Agriculture” (DA), often used interchangeably,
    refer to precision agriculture that is thus connected in a network of sensing
    and acting. It is a concept that employs modern information technologies, precision
    climate information, and crop/livestock developmental information to connect production
    variables to increase the quantity and quality of agricultural and food products.
    This is achieved by measuring and analyzing variables accurately, feeding the
    information into the cloud from edge devices, extracting trends from the various
    data, and subsequently providing information back to the producer in a timely
    manner. Smart agriculture covers many disciplines, including biology, mechanical
    engineering, automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and information
    technology-digital platforms. Minimum standards have been proposed for stakeholders
    with the aim to move toward this highly anticipated and ever-changing revolution.
    These foundational standards encompass the following general categories, including
    precise articulation of objectives, and baseline standards for the Internet of
    Things (IoT), including network infrastructure (e.g., stable 4G or 5G networks
    or a wireless local area network (WLAN) are available to end users). To sum up,
    SA aims to improve production efficiency, enhance the quality and quantity of
    agricultural products, reduce costs, and improve the environmental footprint of
    the industry. SA’s ecosystem should be industry self-governed and collaboratively
    financed. SA stakeholders and end-users’ facilities should meet standard equipment
    requirements, such as sensor accuracy, end data collectors, relevant industry
    compliant software, and trusted data analytics. The SA user is willing to be part
    of the SA ecosystem. This short perspective aims to summarize digital/smart agriculture
    concept in plain language.

    and phenomics 1. Introduction With the population expected to reach 9.7 billion
    by 2050, the world is facing many challenges, sustainable food production chief
    among them. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations predicts
    that we need to boost worldwide food production by 70 percent over the next two
    decades to feed the anticipated population in 2050 [1]. Beyond population growth,
    there are additional drivers to produce more with less, and to produce food sustainably
    and responsibly while managing the impacts of climate change, consumer demographics,
    and preferences, as well as globalization and trade [2]. Growing consumer awareness
    is driving demand for high quality products, produced with sustainable practices,
    and with health-related attributes at the front of many consumers’ minds (e.g.,
    fewer herbicides, pesticides, antibiotics, implants administered, and with more
    regulatory oversight), not to mention consumer demand for traceability and attribute
    assurance. Climate initiatives to reduce food waste and the consumption of high-resource
    products are becoming more prevalent in both developed and developing countries.
    The growing global population is also becoming more urban, and as more people
    move to cities, they also move into the middle class so demand for protein foods
    increases. Furthermore, cultural and generational influences are creating a fragmentation
    of tastes which marks an opportunity for market diversification, with some challenges
    for the traditional agri-food market [3]. In developed markets, growth drivers
    include health, nutrition, and sustainability. As incomes rise, “better for you
    foods” are replacing traditional “feel-good” junk foods. Related to this transition
    is a shift to plant-based foods, including plant-based meat, sometimes marketed
    as “clean meat”. All things considered, the need for innovation in agriculture
    has never been greater (cf., Figure 1). On the production side and across the
    value chain, businesses are increasingly pressured by rising input costs (e.g.,
    seed, fertilizer, and labor), climate-driven changing land use priorities, and
    consumer demands for transparency and sustainability [4]. With the historically
    unpredictable and overall thin margins in agriculture, there is a need for new
    solutions, both for producers and consumers. As commodity prices continue to fluctuate,
    and in some cases, stagnate, there is intense awareness that new solutions are
    needed to provide relief, for both producers and consumers. Figure 1. Ten global
    megatrends will lead to a disruptive transition in the next 5–10 years (Adapted
    from [5]). One approach to producing more food with increasingly limited resources
    will be to improve efficiencies in resource use, including people, production
    technologies, and waste reduction in the agri-food supply chain. Note that this
    was largely the approach in the Green Revolution of the 1950s, with the adoption
    of systematic breeding, high-yielding varieties, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides,
    and best management practices. But over the past five to seven years, a new set
    of practices has emerged, which uses information and communication technologies
    and has created a digital revolution in agriculture; connected sensors, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) [6], autonomous vehicles, robots, and big data analytics [7] will
    be essential in effectively feeding tomorrow’s world. The future of agriculture
    will be smart, connected, and digital. Understanding the challenges and opportunities
    in “Smart Agriculture” (SA) will help guide relevant policy decisions, agri-food
    businesses, and agri-food industry workers. Smart agriculture incorporates current
    advanced technologies into existing farming or agricultural practices in order
    to increase production efficiency, improve the quality of agricultural products,
    reduce production costs, and reduce the environmental footprint. The distinction
    between “smart” agriculture and agriculture using digital technologies and precision
    management is based on the connectivity of data, using the Internet of Things
    (IoT) (see Section 3 for definitions and concepts in SA) [8]. Smart technologies
    in agriculture also have the capacity to improve the quality of life of farm workers
    by reducing heavy labor and tedious tasks (e.g., by using automation, robotics,
    and data analytics for precision management). Further, as labor can be one of
    the highest costs within production, and there being fewer agricultural laborers
    available, reducing our reliance on human labor will lead to further productivity
    gains. Because of these developments, there is increased interest in and demand
    for proof of the economic value of digitization and connectivity in agriculture.
    Agriculture companies—from startups to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)—are
    investing in the space. According to AgFunder, 2014 was the year in which AgTech
    truly launched with 2.36b USD being invested across 264 deals [9]; in AgFunder’s
    most recent report, they show that 2018 saw investments in AgriTech of over 51b
    USD across 3155 deals. While there are numerous startups in the sector, some of
    the most notable investors include companies such as Google Ventures, Microsoft,
    and Bayer. So, in less than 10 years, improvements in the underlying technologies
    have led investors to consider the potential for SA. It is anticipated that the
    next few years will bring a consolidation of the sector with larger companies
    making investments, cost reductions across the life sciences, and improvements
    in sensor technologies, robotics, automation, and computation being deployed [10].
    In summary, agriculture will become intelligent, interconnected, and digitized
    in the future. SA can reduce the dependence of agriculture on labor, improve resource
    utilization efficiency, alleviate the pressure on producers and consumers, and
    has unlimited potential in the future. 2. Definitions of Smart Agriculture The
    modernization of agriculture and the adoption of various technologies in production
    practices have resulted in new concepts in agriculture, including precision agriculture,
    digital agriculture, and smart agriculture. While in some of the literature these
    terms are used interchangeably, there are differences in the details, which become
    important when defining “Smart Agriculture”. For example, the International Society
    of Precision Agriculture organization defines “Precision Agriculture as “… a management
    strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual
    data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according
    to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality,
    profitability and sustainability of agricultural production”. In brief, SA is
    the application of connectivity (e.g., IoT) to traditional agriculture, where
    the use of sensors and software is used to collect data to optimize agricultural
    production decisions through mobile platforms, such that traditional agriculture
    becomes “smarter”. In a broad sense, smart agriculture also includes agricultural
    e-commerce, food traceability and anti-counterfeiting, agricultural leisure tourism,
    agricultural information services, and other aspects. Precision agriculture, as
    important component of smart agriculture, is a method of farm management where
    the input needs of individual crops, fields, and livestock are optimized through
    data gathering, observation, and analysis. Big data and advanced analytics, as
    well as robotics, imagery, sensors, and weather forecasts enable precision agriculture
    to be an extremely effective agricultural management strategy [11]. For example,
    by assessing the conditions and needs of individual crops, fields, and livestock,
    precision agriculture can increase the quantity and quality of agricultural output
    while reducing inputs of water, energy, fertilizer, pesticides, supplements, etc.,
    in order to save costs and reduce the environmental impact [12]. Smart agriculture
    (SA) entails the exploitation of data to optimize agricultural systems. The distinction
    from precision agriculture may seem minor, but is crucial, as it defines the next
    revolution within agricultural and digital industries. The focus of SA is on data
    exploitation; this requires access to data, data analysis, and the application
    of the results over multiple (ideally, all) farm or ranch operations. On-farm
    and on-ranch decisions are made using smart, mobile devices to access data on
    conditions, climate, input use, and labor, and more in real time, allowing the
    producer to subsequently make informed decisions based on validated data. SA implies
    a system of connectivity (e.g., Internet of Things, edge devices, low-power wide
    area network (LPWAN), 5G, etc.), where “things” are connected in a network of
    communication. The data (i.e., the information) are processed in farm management
    software (i.e., apps and online platforms) in a timely manner and relayed back
    to the producer to make informed decisions [13]. The International Organization
    for Standardization (ISO) defines SA as the “combination of network connectivity,
    widespread sensor placement, and sophisticated data analysis techniques [which]
    now enables ‘smart farming’ due to large amounts of data generated by IoT devices”
    [14]. For the purposes of this report and in an effort to standardize the concept
    of SA, the following definition will be used: SA uses Internet of Things (IoT)
    technology; various sensors are placed on equipment, livestock, or in the field
    to relay data to a platform (i.e., cloud-based; that is, using WLAN, edge devices,
    or to the cloud directly) allowing the creation of an information system for users
    (e.g., including farmers, agro-supply professionals, consultants, researchers).
    3. Basic Concepts and Technologies 3.1. Related Terminology, Concepts, and Technology
    Beyond the technical jargon of SA, there are additional related technologies and
    social concepts that support the idea of SA which are worth mentioning. Agriculture
    4.0 is a term used by the World Government Summit (2018) [15]; as an analogy to
    Industry 4.0 [16]. It refers to the integrated internal and external networking
    of farming operations as a result of the emergence of smart technology in agriculture
    [17]. The trend is towards automation, intelligence, and data exchange in agriculture.
    Agriculture 4.0 aims to disrupt the current food and agriculture regime and sustainably
    improve production capacity by using new techniques and technologies in production
    (e.g., hydroponics, algae feedstock, bioplastics, desert agriculture, seawater
    farming). The intent is to use novel technologies to improve food access, and
    change the current food supply chain (e.g., vertical/urban farming, genetic modification,
    3D printing), and to incorporate cross-industry technologies and applications
    (e.g., UAVs, IoT, data analytics, PA, nanotechnology, blockchain, AI/ML, food
    sharing, and crowd farming) (World Government Summit, 2018) [5]. Based on the
    definition of Agriculture 4.0, the concept of “SA” generally resides within the
    third category: incorporating cross-industry technologies and applications; these
    inter-related technologies will be briefly defined in the following section [18].
    Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are included within Agriculture 4.0, and
    are characterized by making significant use of global positioning system (GPS)
    technology. The latter allows plots to be mapped for increased precision during
    technical operations. For example, mapping the nitrogen requirements of a plot
    allows the inputs to be tailored not just at plot-level but for different zones
    within it identified by satellite. In addition, GIS systems can provide a framework
    for the deeper analysis of a broader scope of inputs, including weather patterns,
    topological features, and watershed models [19]. 3.2. Big Data Analytics, Artificial
    Intelligence, and Machine Learning In short, the application of Internet of Things
    technology to traditional agriculture, the use of sensors and software to control
    agricultural production through mobile platforms or computer platforms, so that
    traditional agriculture is more ‘wisdom’. In addition to accurate perception,
    control, and decision management, in a broad sense, smart agriculture also includes
    agricultural e-commerce, food traceability anti-counterfeiting, agricultural leisure
    tourism, agricultural information services and other aspects. The anticipated
    value of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI) for Digital Agriculture
    is not different to that for general systems biology, materials science, drug
    design, or knowledge-based design in the transformation of genotype to phenotype.
    Overall, the value of AI methods lies in those arising from the translation of
    theoretical advances to application tools that accelerate the creation of predictive
    models (e.g., with existing tools like Google’s Tensorflow, Facebook’s PyTorch).
    These application frameworks are designed to accelerate the creation of predictive
    models by transforming application data (e.g., labelled data instances like genomic
    samples from crop phenotypes). It is important to note that the application of
    AI is possible in all areas of scientific research; overall, the idea is to capture
    and compress existing scientific knowledge into models that accelerate the prediction
    of new hypotheses (e.g., new molecules with potential impact as drugs) and to
    discover new hypotheses that human scientists would not consider because of knowledge
    bias. As noted above with respect to the three categories of Smart Agriculture,
    Precision Agriculture, and Digital Agriculture, each one can take advantage of
    a variety of AI methods to create decision support based on captured data, including
    soil data, genomic and phenomics data, drone-created crop profiles, and all manner
    of animal management (e.g., beef, swine, fowl) [20]. To note the scope of the
    applications of AI to these general areas, the development of Alphafold and Foldit
    [21] have accelerated the identification of plausible protein folds and helped
    identify previously unconsidered folding hypotheses. Similarly, within the metaphor
    of genomics for materials [22], specific applications of current AI tools have
    been used to identify preferred material alloys for solar materials [23]. The
    same advantage arises in the identification of appropriately active small molecules
    in so-called “in silico” drug design [24,25]. While application domain scientists
    may not make these observations, the frameworks for applying AI to Digital Agriculture
    are identical, in the overall data science framework, to those used in protein
    folding, materials science, and drug design. One framework that can support this
    position comes from the general development of “Phenomics,” arising from a 2011
    workshop sponsored by the USA Department of Agriculture, and the USA National
    Science Foundation (NIFA, 2011). The overall framework is captured in this quote:
    “Recent advances in DNA sequencing and phenotyping technologies, in concert with
    analysis of large datasets have spawned ‘phenomics’, the use of large-scale approaches
    to study how genetic instructions from a single gene or the whole genome translate
    into the full set of phenotypic traits of an organism”. This framework provides
    the basis for the general study of all transformations from genome to phenome,
    in both animal and plant models, and creates a foundation for the crop science
    aspects of Digital Agriculture anticipated in this paper. At the next level of
    scientific granularity, AI has already been applied to understand the causality
    between bovine genomics and phenomics properties, and it can be similarly applied
    to crop genomics [24,26]. In this regard, the promise of crop phenomics within
    Digital Agriculture lies within the increasing sophistication of predictive data
    models that approximate the causal connections between genome and phenome. 3.3.
    Synopsis of Data Driven Methods Overall, the deployment of analytic methods to
    Smart Agriculture is rapidly changing, since progress in so many fields (e.g.,
    sensing, robotics, flight-based data capture) is happening at the intersection
    of data collection and the basic biological science of animal and crop genomics
    [27,28]. Just across these two aspects of scientific endeavors, the emerging tools
    for analytics based on machine learning have been used in both the consolidation
    and prediction of crop models and in the analysis of the path from genome to phenome
    [29,30]. We will continue to see many new technologies linked together; this means
    that, increasingly, waste will be minimized, productivity will be maximized, and
    the impact on the environment will shrink. Success in these aspects will depend
    on setting standards and metrics to ensure that the progress is captured and made
    in a desirable direction and that technologies (current and future) will continue
    to drive productivity and sustainability [31]. 4. Discussion and Perspective Challenges
    to Agricultural Digital Transition The three categories that are needed for the
    adoption of SA systems include software (e.g., apps, analytic methods), hardware
    (e.g., connectivity device(s), sensors, wearables), and technical support services
    (e.g., consulting or subscription management services). For effective SA adoption,
    the first two are necessary, as without connectivity and data collation coupled
    with real-time analysis, the methods lose the “smart” aspect and revert to precision
    agriculture. In addition, there are six assets across farm environments that can
    be connected, including (i) soil, (ii) plants, (iii) livestock, (iv) environment,
    (v) equipment, and (vi) people [32]. Smart agriculture ecosystems include data
    capture points, internet access, and data collecting/process centers to support
    smart agriculture. It is estimated that 50K farms require a minimal investment
    in their connectivity/ability to tap into the smart agriculture technology. Which
    is necessary to provide a foundational platform for SA. As a historically disconnected
    industry that made progress based on best practices established from trial and
    error and industry expertise, agriculture has previously lacked the ability to
    make management decisions based on big data in real time. The connectivity of
    data from sensors, the climate, and imaging using low-power wide-area networks
    (LPWANs), cellular networks, and other wireless telecommunication is the backbone
    behind smart agriculture. The incremental development of this foundation faces
    at least the following challenges: - Dealing with legacy technology; - Connectivity
    in rural areas; - Maintenance and servicing of technologies; - Compatibility (also
    as a system of systems); - Need for standards; - Modernizing infrastructure; -
    Adoption/ability to adopt. Need for 5G: Amongst the technological challenges faced
    across these seven challenges is the issue of nurturing the evolution of connectivity,
    which is currently focused on the deployment and exploitation of fifth-generation
    wireless communications (i.e., 5G). Some of the benefits that 5G technology can
    provide include the opportunity for a massive increase in bandwidth (enabling
    capture and movement of higher density data like images), an order-of-magnitude
    reduction in latency (enabling advances in real-time decision support), and a
    higher capacity for multiple users (enabling more cost effective deployment over
    rural and remote areas). In summary, compared to the current 4G standard, 5G will
    create a bigger pipe, lower latency, and faster response time. This will impact
    agriculture in ways that we cannot even imagine right now, particularly in terms
    of connectivity as it will enable real-time analytics and decision support. AI
    and Machine Learning: The current rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and
    machine learning (AI&ML) has primarily promoted the development of large language
    models (LLMs), but the technologies for their construction and deployment are
    equally—and even more appropriately—valuable in application verticals like SA,
    where training data capture is constrained by specific challenges and contexts
    noted above (e.g., in the six SA assets). This means that the emerging spectrum
    of AI technologies, from knowledge base construction to deep learning classification,
    can support the foundation and development of AS. IoT and Ag: As already summarized
    above, the incremental development of IoT data sensors and network infrastructure
    is a crucial component of SA foundation and development, and, like AI&ML, has
    direct and immediate applications within the scope of SA challenges, e.g., in
    the instrumentation of environment sensor networks to inform predictive systems
    about crop conditions. Low margins in agriculture: The historical development
    of the economic structure of agriculture has created a complex and multi-layered
    economic model where the low margins between layers makes capital investment a
    challenge. Therefore, the pace of innovation has not kept up with other industries
    and today agriculture remains the least digitized of all major industries [10].
    Who owns the data? The question of data governance and security is increasingly
    important as the consolidation of agriculture’s economic layers means that capital
    investment is increasingly dependent on data capture and exploitation. For example,
    will large agricultural corporations increasing their grip on data lead to price
    discrimination? Similarly, which data owners will be most vulnerable to the increasing
    threat of hacking and cybersecurity disruption, which is an ever-increasing threat
    across all data-driven organizations. In summary, the development of an SA foundation
    must address all of the above challenges simultaneously, including (1) adoption
    likelihood/palatability among producers; comes down to communication; (2) potential
    widening economic gaps that might emerge as an unintended consequence of AI adoption
    and other concerns, including misuse of AI and data privacy, data sovereignty;
    (3) the use of FinTech in agriculture to promote growth, enhance financial inclusion,
    and improve regional economic integration; (4) quality management for both processes
    and organizations; and (5) the integration of continuous improvements as those
    processes and organizations evolve (e.g., ISO; Six Sigma; Continuous Improvement;
    TQM). 5. The Expected Value and Development of Smart Agricultural Ecosystems 5.1.
    The Anticipated Value of Developing the Smart Agriculture Ecosystem Climate Friendly
    Agriculture/Digital + Regenerative Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA), an approach
    for sustainable food security, refers to the “actions needed to transform and
    reorient agricultural systems to effectively support development and ensure food
    security in a changing climate”. The three main objectives of CSA include: sustainably
    increasing agricultural productivity, development, and incomes; adapting and building
    resilience to climate change (from farm to nation); and reducing and/or removing
    greenhouse gas emissions and/or increasing carbon sinks [33,34,35]. 5.2. The Application
    and Impact of AL/ML in Smart Agriculture 5.2.1. Socioeconomic Benefits It is clear
    from other leading adopters of AI/ML (e.g., health, law) that one of the positive
    aspects of their application id that they can actually create a new source of
    jobs and economic opportunities for millions, globally, and sustainably produced
    food for the world. In addition, digital technologies provide the opportunity
    to change how food is produced, reduce information asymmetry, decrease transaction
    costs, increase equitability, and improve agriculture’s environmental impact [36].
    5.2.2. Digital Image and Deep Learning with Agriculture/Horticulture Industries
    Seed purity is a critical parameter in maintaining a good germination rate and
    seed vigor. Traditionally, methods of identifying seed purity include the morphological
    inspection method, the field planting inspection method, the chemical identification
    method, and the electrophoresis technology inspection method; however, these techniques
    are time consuming, cumbersome, and require professionals; thus, they are not
    suitable for the mass analysis and nondestructive testing of seeds. Recently,
    however, hyperspectral imaging technology has been widely studied in seed purity
    detection, which has the characteristics of combining image and spectral information.
    Bi et al. (2022) developed a methodology for maize seed variety recognition based
    on improved swin transformer-based Deep Learning [37]. Their report showed that,
    in comparison with other models, the MFSwin Transformer model achieved the highest
    classification accuracy results. The neural network applied in the study can classify
    corn seeds accurately and efficiently and the image deep learning method met the
    high-precision classification requirements of corn seed images and has provided
    a reference tool for seed identification. Cai et al. have also reported image
    deep learning technology that could effectively reduce the influence of environmental
    factors on strawberry image segmentation and provide an effective approach for
    the accurate operation of strawberry picking robots [38]. They improve DeepLabV3+
    for strawberry image segmentation with different maturities, introducing the attention
    mechanism in the backbone feature extraction network and ASPP module, respectively,
    and adjusting the weights of feature channels in the neural network propagation
    process through the attention mechanism, which could enhance the feature information
    of strawberry images with different maturities using fewer parameters, reducing
    the interference of environmental factors [39]. 6. Conclusions As with any global
    challenge, integrating such a broad variety of data-driven technologies is not
    a simple task. But the overall anticipated value of developing a guiding framework
    for the creation of a SA foundation has incredible positive benefits, including:
    - The role of digital technologies as a catalyst of change in how we produce food
    and practice agriculture/horticulture/livestock management; - The improved efficiency
    of agriculture/horticulture/livestock production; - Incorporate environmental
    considerations from the beginning and from all aspects; - The ability to link
    all aspects of the value chain in real time. The emerging applications of digital
    technology in agriculture and biology, include, but are not limited to, agriculture,
    data collection, data mining, bioinformatics, genomics, and phenomics, as well
    as applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The development
    of a community to support this goal requires the cross linking and integration
    of multiple sources of agricultural research across 3S technologies (remote sensing—RS;
    geographic information systems—GIS; global positioning systems—GPS). This provides
    a basis for the detection of crop pathogens, weeds, and pests (insects) using
    multi-spectrum techniques and the exploitation of remote sensing technology to
    create and analyze multiple heterogeneously structured data sets, which enables
    effective cross-linking and phenomic classification. It is essential to study
    growth models of plants/crops and utilize expert support to develop production
    and smart management decision systems to achieve real-time, quantified, and precise
    decisions. Topics of high interest include the capture and curation of biological
    “big data”, research on multi-spectrum analysis, the assembly of complex genetic
    sequencing fragments, and structural gene predictions coupled with intermediate
    structures to predict phenotypes. In this context, novel data structures are required
    to capture predictive structures in the path from genome type to phenotype, together
    with new techniques to capture and identify the regularity of biological data.
    Finally, multiple-sources-based monitoring and decision making for plants, water,
    and nutrients in agriculture/horticulture are required, with a research focus
    on the utilization of remote sensing and drone sensing to compute and predict
    plant water usage, crop and vegetable growth and development, stress status monitoring
    and management, and yield and harvesting decision making. Author Contributions

    Smart agricultureIoTCloud platformGreenhouse controlSTM32 1. Introduction Smart
    agriculture is an agricultural development mode that uses modern science and technology
    to improve agricultural production efficiency and reduce resource waste. With
    the growth of the global population and the impact of climate change, traditional
    agriculture is facing many challenges such as land scarcity, water scarcity, and
    environmental pollution. Under this background, smart agriculture emerge as the
    times require. It achieves precise management and intelligent decision-making
    in agriculture through applying advanced sensing technology, cloud computing and
    IoT [1]. Greenhouse agriculture is one of the most important. Greenhouses provide
    controlled environmental conditions that allow plants to grow at any time of the
    day or night. At present, the application of IoT in agricultural greenhouse management
    has become a hotspot of human attention. It has changed traditional agriculture
    which is limited by many factors such as natural environment, geographical location,
    and climate. Smart greenhouse control system can realize the development and application
    of smart agriculture. It can monitor and control aspects such as light, water
    flow, inlet pipe pressure, supply voltage, ground temperature and humidity, air
    temperature and humidity, and so on, in order to improve the agricultural production
    efficiency of greenhouse [2]. However, there are still some problems in current
    greenhouse agriculture. Since environmental parameter in greenhouse is usually
    set by human, such as temperature, humidity, light and so on. Therefore it is
    unable to accurately monitor and manage the environment and crop growth. In addition,
    productivity is affected by seasonal and weather conditions that limit greenhouse
    crop growth [3]. The Smart Agriculture Greenhouse Cloud Control System is designed
    to solve these problems in an IoT way, as shown in Fig. 1. Based on IoT technology,
    the sensor network can monitor environmental parameters and crop cultivation inside
    and outside greenhouse in real time. And it transmits these data to the cloud
    platform for processing. Cloud computing and big data analytics can generate appropriate
    control strategies on cloud platform based on crop needs and growth patterns.
    The cloud platform sends commands through control equipment, thus adjusting temperature,
    humidity, carbon dioxide and other environmental parameters in the greenhouse,
    eventually realizing precise control of crop growth environment [4]. In this way,
    crop yield can be maximized, resource use can be improved, energy consumption
    can be reduced, and stability in crop production and quality can be ensured. Therefore,
    it is an ideal solution to solve problems and difficulties of current greenhouse
    grow systems by creating a cloud-based smart greenhouse control system. It achieves
    precise monitor and control of the environment inside and outside greenhouse and
    the growth of crops through applying advanced information technology. And it improves
    resource utilization efficiency, optimizes production management, and improves
    crop yield and quality. Smart agricultural greenhouse cloud control system can
    bring high economic benefits to farmers, reduce environmental harm and promote
    sustainable development of agriculture [5]. This paper aims to design a smart
    agricultural greenhouse cloud control system based on IOT to achieve the above
    objectives. The system workflow is as follows. Firstly, environmental data be
    collected by STM32 microcontroller, wireless communication module, sensors and
    other devices. Then, ESP8266 WiFi module transmits the data to AliCloud’s interface,
    and these data are visualized on the cloud. Finally, the user can connect to the
    cloud by cell phone or computer to view greenhouse environmental conditions in
    real time. Through the above research methodology and experimental design, we
    hope to derive the effect of smart agriculture greenhouse cloud control system
    to improve greenhouse agricultural production efficiency, save energy, change
    crops growth environment and other aspects. It provides a useful reference for
    the development of IoT and smart agriculture. Download : Download high-res image

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights related
    work that has been done and is in progress in the area of greenhouse control.
    Section 3 discusses the various components used in the proposed system. Section
    4 describes the architecture and implementation of the system. Experimental results
    of the proposed work are given in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the conclusions
    and future scope. 2. Related work Smart greenhouse control is a very interesting
    research topic and researchers have been working on smart control systems for
    agricultural greenhouses. This section gives a brief description of existing solutions
    for developing the smart control of greenhouses. At present, designing and developing
    control systems by using IoT, has become a trend in the application of agricultural
    greenhouse management technology. It changes the situation of traditional agriculture,
    which is constrained by a variety of factors, including the natural environment,
    geography and climate. People have designed smart control system applications
    through IoT. It effectively improves environmental conditions inside greenhouse,
    which includes temperature, humidity, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration,
    and other factors. So it has positive significance for improving crop yield and
    quality [6]. IoT agricultural greenhouse measurement and control technology can
    realize the automatic detection of agricultural area information. For example,
    we can set up wireless sensor nodes, information collection devices, information
    routing devices, solar power supply system and wireless sensor transmission system.
    In this way, we can monitor parameters such as soil moisture, soil temperature,
    air humidity, temperature, light intensity and plant nutrient content [7]. Where
    the wireless sensor aggregation nodes are created through IoT [8]. The system
    dynamically manages, displays, analyzes and processes the greenhouse’s environmental
    factors and provides visualization graphs for the farmer. Depending on crop need,
    system provides information about various text, sound and light alarms. IoT greenhouse
    smart measurement and control system realizes automatic operation of the greenhouse.
    It not only reduces energy consumption and operating costs, but also provides
    an ideal growth environment for plants. In addition it reduces people’s work intensity
    and improves equipment utilization. It also improves greenhouse climate, reduces
    pests and diseases, and increases crop yields [9]. Greenhouse farms still face
    many challenges in terms of efficient operation and management. Continuously evolving
    IoT technology, including smart sensor, device, network topology, big data analytic,
    and smart decision-making, is recognized as a solution to solve major challenges
    in greenhouse agriculture. For example, it is used in greenhouse local climate
    control, crop growth monitoring and crop reaping [10]. With agricultural informatization
    level constantly improving, Chinese greenhouse smart measurement and control system
    has made great progress in terms of technology and scale. However, we still have
    a big gap in the field of smart greenhouse control compared with developed countries,
    especially in production stability control, modernization and industrialization
    of supporting facilities [11]. Overseas greenhouses often use automatic control
    system to monitor and control greenhouse environments. These systems usually include
    sensor, actuator and controller. Sensor is used to monitor environmental parameters
    such as temperature, humidity and light. Controller sends commands to make devices
    such as ventilation and irrigation work to keep ideal environmental conditions
    in the greenhouse. Control methods use advanced control techniques, including
    fuzzy control, model predictive control, neural network control and adaptive control.
    Besides, it uses physical model-based control, state feedback control and control
    methods based on optimal control theory. They are all well known in improving
    greenhouse crop production performance, and these control technologies usually
    have strong data analysis and decision support capabilities. It collects and analyzes
    data about the greenhouse environment and plant growth. Based on the data, the
    system is able to provide accurate decision support and optimize management strategy
    [12]. In contrast, China’s greenhouse control has just started, and most of greenhouses
    are manually operated. There are fewer control methods, only traditional PID control,
    fuzzy control, neural network control and so on. Greenhouse data analysis and
    decision support levels are relatively low, and there is still much improvement
    space [13]. However, Chinese greenhouse control systems can be better adapted
    to need and actual situation of local agriculture. Since local agricultural organization
    and crop characteristics are different from other countries, China’s greenhouse
    control system is closer to the needs of domestic agriculture in terms of design
    and functionality. So it can provide more personalized and precise control strategies
    and technical solutions [14]. China is a vast country, farmers are relatively
    conservative in their thinking, and it is difficult to unify the standards of
    the agricultural industry chain. As a result, there are difficulties in collecting,
    analyzing, integrating and sharing information resources. In terms of agricultural
    production, small farmers are the majority. That is why it is difficult to unify
    scale, mechanization and systematization. The cultural level of farmers is generally
    low, so that the promotion of smart technologies and ecological concepts is not
    progressing fast enough. In addition smart agricultural technology development
    has three major contradictions and problems: resource environment, science and
    technology shortcomings, and institutional deficiencies [15]. In traditional greenhouse,
    climatic variables and other growth methods depend on the grower’s assessment.
    But smart greenhouse growing is a closed growing process where greenhouse is managed
    through information and communication technology (ICT). It improves quality and
    quantity of crops and minimizes human participation [16]. Emerging IoT technology
    offers huge potential to develop innovative approaches and smart solutions that
    can change the agriculture sector in every way. Therefore, combining IoT with
    greenhouse and transforming them into smart automatic greenhouse is considered
    as one of the most ideal solutions [17]. When the IoT started to emerge, some
    people started to research smart greenhouse. Li et al. [18] have proposed an agricultural
    greenhouse environment monitoring system based on IOT, combining the Internet,
    wireless networks, and mobile. It realizes remote real-time monitoring of greenhouse
    environmental information. The implementation method is as follows. Through ZigBee
    protocol, a wireless sensor network was built for collecting environmental information
    such as temperature and humidity. Finally, the collected environmental information
    was accessed to the Internet and mobile network through the control center, which
    realized the SMS heating and real-time monitoring of agricultural environmental
    information. However, when a text message is received, it cannot be immediately
    controlled accordingly. Such as when the temperature is too high, the vent opening
    size cannot be regulated immediately. Ahmad et al. [19] have proposed a method
    for greenhouse management and monitoring using Memsic and Zigbee technology. The
    system can monitor soil temperature and humidity, air temperature, and light radiation.
    All sensors are able to collect data from the greenhouse and send it to the microcontroller
    on a regular basis. Data is sent from transmitter to the receiver and displayed
    on a device such as smartphone, laptop or PDA. It uses MP Lab and LabView softwares
    in programming and interfacing process. Although the system can monitor the growing
    environment of the greenhouse through the device, it cannot control greenhouse
    remotely. With the development of IoT, more and more programs are proposed. Cao
    et al. [20] proposed a wireless agricultural monitoring platform by Mesh Wi-Fi
    network. The system consists of a root node, three relays and six nodes. Each
    node has three sensors for measuring parameters, including soil moisture and soil
    temperature, ambient temperature and ambient humidity of the farm, and light intensity.
    The collected data is transferred from the node to the root node, then updated
    to the cloud database and displayed on the dashboard. The MEAN stack-based site
    will create real-time information tracking and keep historical data for the owner.
    However, the system does not have a complete cloud-based platform, so it cannot
    remotely control greenhouse operations by Internet. The system built through wireless
    sensor networks and cloud platforms works extremely well. Ping et al. [21] have
    proposed an IoT and ARM-based framework for soil moisture control and irrigation
    management. In this system, the values obtained by the sensors are stored on a
    cloud server and necessary suggestions are provided over the web. When the ground
    temperature is high and soil moisture is low, an automatic irrigation system is
    triggered and the user is also notified by email. Users can easily monitor the
    irrigation system through the cloud server and mobile web application. Jing et
    al. [22] have proposed a distributed agricultural service system that integrates
    social and physical information in order to provide decision support from farmers.
    The system uses wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, and distributed systems
    architecture to manage people, plots, crops, and equipment. Services include crop
    planning, production guidance, and equipment control. User terminals include computers,
    mobile applications and applets. 3. Components used in the proposed system The
    composition of a control system needs to have controller, sensor, actuator, controlled
    object. In addition, it also needs communication module, display module and so
    on. They work together to form a perfect control system. The proposed system provides
    a cost-effective solution for detecting environmental conditions in greenhouses,
    which can be controlled automatically or manually remotely through the Internet.
    According to the current price, accuracy, and ease of use of controllers and sensors;
    the applicability and difficulty of compiling software; and the price and applicability
    of cloud platforms, we choose following components. But users can choose higher
    accuracy sensors or faster speed controllers depending on the specific use situation,
    which of course means a higher price. 3.1. STM32F407ZGT6 microcontroller The STM32F407ZGT6
    is a microcontroller unit based on a high-performance ARM Cortex-M4 32-bit RISC
    core operating at up to 168MHz. Cortex-M4 core has a floating point unit (FPU)

    sensor The sensing part of the wind speed sensor is formed by three conical or
    hemispherical empty cups [25]. Three hemispherical or conical hollow cup shells
    are fixed to a trident star-shaped bracket at to each other or to a cross-shaped
    bracket at to each other. The bracket made of plastic or alloy. The inductive
    part is connected to an engine. The empty cup rotates, driving the engine rotor
    to produce current. When the rotor is faster, the current is higher and the voltage
    at the ends of the generator is higher. The wind speed sensor is connected to
    the microcontroller through a connecting wire, which is used to measure the voltage
    across the sensor and then obtain the actual wind speed. Based on the wind speed,
    the wind level at that time is obtained through a self-writing program. The wind
    speed sensor output voltage signal and wind speed calculation formula is shown
    in Eq. (1): (1) where means wind speed in , means voltage in . 3.4. Raindrop sensor
    The sensor is made of high-quality FR-04 double-sided material with a large area
    of , and its surface is treated with nickel-plating technology [26]. Therefore,
    the module has excellent performance in terms of oxidation resistance, electrical
    conductivity, and longevity. In addition, the module is capable of data transfer
    via digital and analog. 3.5. DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor The DHT11 is
    an integrated temperature and humidity sensor that includes a moisture-measuring
    element and a temperature-measuring element [27]. The communication method between
    the DHT11 and the microcontroller is single bus communication, so that only one
    data line is required to achieve communication with the microcontroller. In addition,
    the DHT11 has very low power consumption. When the operating voltage is 5 , the
    average maximum current is 0.5 . 3.6. BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor The
    BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor module is a digital integrated circuit for
    serial bus interface. It uses the IIC communication protocol, operates on DC5
    , and its input illumination range is from 1 to 65 535 [28]. 3.7. SGP30 gas sensor
    The SGP30 is a gas sensor that provides detailed information on actual air quality
    level or concentration, such as ppm for airborne CO and actual level of volatile
    organic compound [29]. The module has excellent long-term stability, resistance
    to contamination caused by silicone, TVOC output, and H2-based CO equivalent output.
    3.8. Wireless communication module NRF24L01 The NRF24L01 is a wireless communication
    module with FSK modulation and NORDIC Enhanced Short Burst Protocol. It supports
    point-to-point or point-to-multipoint wireless communication up to six nodes.
    The communication band is 2.4G, and the communication rate is up to 2 Mbps. The
    module adopts the highly efficient GFSK modulation method, which has strong anti-interference
    ability. It can realize the requirements of multipoint or specific frequency modulation
    communication in 126 selectable channels. The features and benefits of the module
    are summed up below: • Long wireless communication range. The NRF24L01 module
    supports the 2.4 GHz ISM band. It has adjustable communication range that can
    reach about 100 m in the best case. • Reliable and stable. NRF24L01 module adopts
    frequency hopping technology. It has strong anti-interference and stability performance.
    It can keep excellent communication quality in complex wireless environment. •
    Fast response time. The NRF24L01 module has fast switching times and transmission
    rates up to 2 Mbps. Thus, it is well adapted for real-time data transmission and
    applications that requires fast response times. • Multinode communication. The
    NRF24L01 module supports multinode network communication. It can achieve communication
    modes of point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint. As
    a result, it can flexibly adapt to the needs of various communication topologies.
    • Simple interface. NRF24L01 module connects to the microcontroller with simple
    interface that uses SPI communication protocol. Therefore small number of I/O
    pins can realize communication with external controller. • Cost-effective. The
    NRF24L01 module offers excellent performance and price ratio. It is one of the
    cost-effective wireless communication solutions for many IoT and embedded applications.
    Although 2.4 GHz frequency wireless communication has high penetration power,
    the communication distance is relatively short. In practical applications, when
    communication distance exceeds 100 m, it may encounter problem that data cannot
    be reliably received. For longer communication distances, LORA communication module
    with 433 MHz frequency can be considered as an alternative to NRF24L01. LORA technology
    has a larger communication range that can reach several kilometers or even farther.
    However, it is important to note that as an alternative, LORA communication module
    can be more expensive, it costs three times as much as NRF24L01. 3.9. ATK-ESP8266
    WiFi module The ATK-ESP8266 is a high-performance UART-WiFi module [30]. The communication
    modes are as follows. ATK-ESP8266 module communicates data with a microcontroller
    through serial port communication and can realize transformation between serial
    port and WiFi. After configuring the serial port, this module can transmit data
    through the network. For example, when the module is configured with relevant
    parameters through AT commands, it can connect to WiFi. After that it can connect
    to the cloud based on domain name, protocol of the cloud platform. In addition
    the selected ESP8266 module can be replaced by 4G DTU in case of higher requirements.
    But the price is several times of ESP8266. 3.10. TFTLCD screen TFTLCD, also called
    Thin-Film Transistor Liquid-Crystal Display, is a flat panel display made using
    thin-film transistor technology and liquid crystal display technology. It consists
    of thin-film transistor array, liquid crystal material layer, color filter layer
    and backlight. The liquid crystal display (LCD) has a thin-film transistor (TFT)
    set on each pixel. Which can effectively avoid crosstalk during non-selective,
    and make the static characteristics of LCD independent of the number of scanning
    lines. Thus the image quality is greatly improved. TFTLCD has the following characteristics:
    high resolution, good color performance, wide viewing angle, fast response time,
    low power consumption. We chose the size of 7-inch screen, which resolution is
    800 × 480, with 16-bit true color display. 3.11. Keil5 development software Keil5

    AliCloud IoT platform AliCloud IoT platform is an Internet-based IoT solution
    provided by AliCloud. It provides a series of technologies and tools, and it supports
    the access, management and data interaction of IoT devices. It is widely used
    in the field of IoT and can support IoT applications in a variety of fields such
    as smart home, smart industry, and smart transportation. Users can realize a variety
    of business needs, such as device interconnection, data sharing, intelligent analysis,
    and so on, through the AliCloud IoT platform. Which effectively improves the intelligence
    and sustainability of IoT applications. 4. Architecture and implementation The
    architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of four parts:
    sensor acquisition control network, network transmitter, application platform,
    and greenhouse equipment management. Sensor acquisition control network collects
    the environmental information in real time; BeiDou/GPS module performs the location
    positioning; TFTLCD screen displays the collected data, latitude, longitude, time
    and other information in real time [31]. The wireless communication module is
    responsible for information interaction with the network transmitter [32]. Network
    Transmitter’s role is sending the environmental information collected by the received
    sensors to the cloud through the ESP8266WiFi module. These information processed
    and stored in the database. Sensor acquisition control network and network transmitter
    systems use hardware as shown in Table 2. The application platform is built on
    AliCloud IoT platform [33]. After building the project and connecting the devices,
    we create various physical models and display the data on the cloud platform.
    Through data communication and information interaction, visualization platform
    is constructed on the AliCloud platform. It includes a Web-side visualization
    platform and a mobile-side visualization platform. We can access the Internet
    through a computer or cell phone, thus enabling automatic control the various
    agricultural equipment in the greenhouse. Sensor acquisition control network.
    The STM32F407ZGT6 is used as the main controller to obtain the air temperature
    and air humidity inside and outside the greenhouse through the DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor, get the light intensity inside the greenhouse through the
    BH1750FVI digital illuminance sensor, get the carbon dioxide concentration inside
    the greenhouse through the SGP30 gas sensor, get the temperature and humidity
    of the soil in the greenhouse through the soil temperature and humidity sensor,
    get the wind speed outside the greenhouse through the wind speed sensor, and get
    the rainfall outside the greenhouse through the rainfall sensor [34]. At the same
    time combined with BeiDou/GPS module for location positioning. The information
    obtained after comprehensive processing is displayed on TFTLCD liquid crystal
    display [35]. Through the NRF24L01 wireless communication module, the collected
    data are sent to the network transmitter according to the specified communication
    mode, communication address, and communication band [36]. Download : Download

    represents the agricultural equipment in the greenhouse. Middle left: Network
    Transmitter, which receives information from the greenhouse and sends it to the
    cloud platform. Upper left: Application Platform, which detects and controls the
    greenhouse system. Network transmitter. The network transmitter uses the STM32F103RCT6
    microcontroller as the main controller. In the environment with network, the ESP8266
    module can automatically connect to the network and AliCloud platform after the
    microcontroller is power on. The wireless communication module receives the data
    which is sent from the sensor acquisition and control network, and then it is
    sent to AliCloud through the ESP8266 module. The working condition is displayed
    on the OLED screen. Application platform. First of all, we need to write C program
    by keil5 software. That is, according to the information of ESP8266, we write
    AT command suitable for UART serial port. Then, microcontroller makes use of the
    serial port to communicate with ESP8266 module. The purpose is make the ESP8266
    module connect to Aliyun by successively receiving a reset command, a mode setting
    command, a WiFi connection command, and a connect to Aliyun domain name command.
    After that, microcontroller sends topic subscription through MQTT protocol. ESP8266
    connects through the Internet and sends relevant data according to MQTT protocol.
    AliCloud performs JSON data parse to communicate between ESP8266 and cloud. AliCloud
    distributes the data through data transfer protocol so that server gets a series
    of data streams. As a result, internal servers such as Web server are able to
    perform display and control operations based on the constructed visualization
    platform. Finally, we inserted component models on the visualization platform
    to connect physical devices and uploaded data. Table 2. Hardware required for

    data big screen control is usually used in larger scale data monitor and display
    scene. For complex data management and control need, big screen control can provide
    better operation experience and detail display. In contrast, the mobile control
    is less, screen size is limited, display of information and charts is relatively
    small. The big data screen in cloud control is usually fixed operation site. While
    mobile control has greater flexibility and portability. Users can monitor and
    control through mobile phones anywhere and anytime. According to specific use
    scenario and need, users can choose the control method that suits them. Greenhouse
    equipment management. First of all, the various agricultural equipment in the
    greenhouse needs to be networked with wireless devices in the 2.4G band, so that
    it can communicate with the network transmitter. TThen, the device can turn on
    or off by receiving data commands. For example, opening and closing of irrigation
    valves, size of valve openings, and extent of irrigation in a greenhouse are determined
    by soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, and webcam. For roller shutter control,
    the system has three phase motor switching control, insulation blanket position
    detection, data uploading, and so on. In the control of the sunshade, the system
    has shade and retraction control of the sunshade and so on. However, the above
    operation is difficult to construct a hardware system, so we constructed a ventilation
    control device. The size of vent is controlled by a stepper motor [37]. The stepper
    motor is powered by a switching power supply with specifications of 220 V input
    and 24 V output. The ventilation system performs motion control combining information
    received from the sensors and position data measured by the laser distance measuring
    module. In addition, ESP8266 WiFi module can receive information from the cloud,
    which enables remote manual network control. The exact control information and
    relevant data are displayed on the OLED screen. The control algorithm employs
    dual-mode control, that is, PID control and Bang-Bang control. The Bang-Bang ＋
    PID control algorithm has high dynamic performance and can reduce response time
    and steady-state error of system [38]. Meanwhile, the algorithm is simple to implement
    and suitable for real-time control system. The main controller is STM32F407VET6,
    which can receive sensor or Aliyun information through NRF24L01 module or ATK-ESP8266
    WiFi module. Based on the received information, the program combines the environmental
    parameters to calculate the adjustment data for the vents. This value is used
    as controller output [39]. This value is converted to the frequency of the PWM
    output. Finally, the signal from the controller is output to the stepper motor
    controller so that the stepper motor can be controlled. The hardware used for
    the vent control system is shown in Table 3. The Bang-Bang ＋ PID control algorithm
    is divided into two stages: When the system error is large, Bang-Bang control
    is used; when the system error is small, PID control is used. As shown in Eq.
    (2). (2) where -control output; -error between input and feedback; -proportional
    coefficient; -sampling time; -integral time constant; -differential time constant;
    -output of Bang-Bang control. is the switching function of the two algorithms.
    When 0, 1, system is used for Bang Bang control; When 1, 0, system is used for
    control. Table 3. Hardware required for vent consoles. Equipment Number Function

    and debug in a laboratory environment. In addition, we tested certain outdoor
    environmental factors in a natural outdoor environment. The working model of the
    proposed system is shown in Fig. 3. The experiment consisted of the following
    stages. Download : Download high-res image (901KB) Download : Download full-size

    Part D is the soil measurement device (not shown on the left), which contains
    DS18B20 and soil moisture sensor. 5.1. Collection and transmission of environmental
    data STM32F407ZGT6 collects data from DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors and
    DS18B20 temperature sensor by single-bus communication protocol; collects data
    from light sensor and SGP30 sensor by IIC communication protocol; collects data
    from wind speed sensor, raindrop sensor and soil humidity sensor by ADC interface,
    and receives positional information from BeiDou/GPS module by serial communication
    protocol. Then, all of the above data are processed and displayed on the TFTLCD
    screen. According to the SPI communication protocol, the data are sent to the
    network transmitter by NRF24L01 wireless communication module. When testing is
    performed, the designed device is placed in a simulated environment. During testing,
    we found that the microcontroller module is able to work as expected. The system
    can detect the environmental data and display it in the TFTLCD screen. The Fig.
    4 shows the detected environmental data of the system in the simulated environment.

    and cloud big screen, they can both transfer and share data through cloud service.
    Users can share data on different devices. They can realize the function is basically
    the same. In complex control, the mobile device is no match for the network big
    screen control. However, for some simple functions, their realization is basically
    same. Mobile device control have some advantages compared to web big screen control.
    The mobile device is light and portable. It can be carried anywhere. Data can
    be displayed on mobile devices. Users can view the data anytime, anywhere which
    is not depend on a specific big screen device. As a result, it can meet the needs
    of users to analyze and make decision environmental data at any time. 6. Conclusions
    and future research work 6.1. Conclusions The model put out in this work aims
    to accomplish centralized management and automated control, both of which are
    significant goals. A centralized monitoring and control center is provided by
    this technology, which centralizes the collection of greenhouse data in real-time.
    Through the cloud platform, administrators may check on changes to the greenhouse
    environment, crop growth, and numerous parameter indicators whenever and wherever
    they want. The cloud platform offers remote monitoring and management of greenhouse
    machinery, including irrigation systems, temperature control, and ventilation.
    To achieve automatic modification of the greenhouse environment and enhance crop
    quality and production effectiveness, administrators can remotely set control
    parameters through the cloud platform. 6.2. Future research work However, despite
    the fact that the cloud platform can be automatically controlled by gathering
    data about the greenhouse’s temperature, humidity, light, etc., there is no combination
    of data analysis and algorithmic modeling in the cloud platform to provide correct
    cloud control. That is one way forward. The given information can be used to further
    improve the system and expand its usefulness on the cloud platform. In order to
    create more accurate models and offer more precise management solutions, the greenhouse
    data obtained is thoroughly examined and learned from. For example, combining
    crop growth models and meteorological data to predict future trends in the greenhouse
    environment. From there, factors like ventilation and irrigation are changed to
    improve crop quality and yield. Following this, the settings for irrigation and
    ventilation are fine-tuned in order to optimize both crop quality and productivity.

    arrival of the fifth generation (5G) era is bringing new applications, such as
    smart agriculture, to us faster and better than ever before. At the same time,
    new application scenarios are not possible without a large number of IoT devices.
    Accordingly, many IoT technologies are continuously proposed [1], [2]. Smart agriculture
    mainly uses information technology management methods to carry out agricultural
    production and operations [3]. It timely acquires environmental factors affecting
    crop production, such as temperature, and automatically adjusts production conditions
    through “thing-to-thing” connectivity, thereby effectively improving the quality
    of agricultural products and production efficiency. But the massive collection
    of data is likely to lead to serious leakage problems [4]. Malicious hackers,
    through attacks on IoT devices such as sensors, may access data collected by sensors
    about the environment or livestock or even tamper with them, as there is a lack
    of encryption protection measures [5]. These attacks seriously damage the confidentiality
    of data, posing a serious threat to the proper operation and supply of monitoring
    services and even causing substantial economic losses. Currently, multiple security
    protection schemes are proposed for this problem, including encrypting the collected
    data before transmission [6]. Post-Quantum Cryptography has become a hot topic
    nowadays with the emergence of quantum computers. But the development of standards
    for post-quantum cryptography is still in progress. Meanwhile, symmetric ciphers
    can resist the attack of quantum computers by expanding the key size. Hence, we
    can still employ lightweight block ciphers to protect resource-constrained IoT
    devices in smart agriculture. Numerous lightweight block ciphers have been proposed
    in recent years that are widely used in the IoT, such as SIMON [7], SPEEDY [8],
    PRINCE [9], SCARF [10], SHADOW [11], IVLBC [12], QARMA [13], etc. However, the
    design requirements of ciphers vary in different environments [14], [15]. For
    example, the Internet of Vehicles requires low-latency cipher algorithms [16].
    The existing sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles used in smart agriculture are
    battery-powered. They suffer from limited energy resources [17]. Also, the computational
    complexity of the device itself should not be reduced to minimize battery usage
    [18]. It is critical that cipher algorithms designed for such devices minimize
    energy consumption [19]. Energy will be more tightly constrained in future infophysical
    systems as well as in the next generation of implantable devices [20]. There is
    currently no unified standard for cipher algorithms in terms of energy consumption
    evaluation. Consequently, we take the energy consumption of existing low-energy
    cipher algorithms as the basic standard for our research, such as Midori, PRINCE,
    and so on. The minimization of energy consumption based on existing research can
    lead to a broader application of cipher algorithms in the future. Recently, energy-optimized
    ciphers have received increasing attention. The classic low energy lightweight
    block cipher Midori was proposed by Subhadeep Banik et al. [21]. Later, they also
    proposed a low energy stream cipher [22]. In 2017, Bui et al. performed hardware
    optimization for the AES cipher in terms of power consumption and energy [23].
    Carlos et al. optimized the PRESENT cipher on FPGA hardware based on area, performance,
    and energy [24]. In 2020, Bassam J. et al. proposed a new algorithm for managing
    cipher energy consumption [25]. Avik Chakraborti proposed a lightweight, low energy
    authentication encryption mode [26]. Most of these proposed energy-optimized ciphers
    use substitution permutation networks (SPN) structures to improve diffusion and
    reduce the number of rounds to achieve low energy performance. Cipher algorithms
    that adopt the SPN structure require additional resource consumption during decryption
    due to the inconsistent encryption and decryption. As a result, energy consumption
    is often not particularly low when encryption and decryption are calculated to
    consume energy together. The Feistel structure can be encrypted and decrypted
    consistently, but the cipher algorithms using the Feistel structure require more
    rounds to ensure their security. The energy consumption increases exponentially
    as the number of rounds increases. Beyond the structure, the area and latency
    of the components also affect the energy consumption of the algorithm as a whole.
    Choosing a low-area and low-latency S-box is also a design requirement for low
    energy algorithms, as S-boxes are the most important non-linear component in cipher
    algorithms. There is still potential to better achieve low energy consumption
    in unified ED circuits, although researchers have done some research on low energy
    ciphers. In this paper, a new low energy lightweight block cipher (LELBC) is proposed,
    focusing on energy-resource-constrained devices in smart agriculture. We have
    conducted a security analysis and hardware implementation of LELBC. Experimental
    results show that LELBC is resistant to differential attack, linear attack, algebraic
    attack, meet-in-the-middle attack, and slide attack. LELBC can also adopt some
    existing error detection schemes to resist fault attacks in practical applications.
    Moreover, LELBC is optimal in terms of energy and area in unified ED circuits
    compared to existing lightweight ciphers. Thus, the deployment of LELBC in the
    perception layer of smart agriculture can provide security for it. The structure
    of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the encryption mode of LELBC.
    In Section 3, the specification of LELBC is described. The design principles of
    LELBC are given in Section 4. Section 5 describes the security analysis of LELBC
    through various analysis methods. The implementation of LELBC is presented in
    Section 6. A temperature acquisition platform is established to simulate temperature
    monitoring in smart agriculture, and LELBC was successfully applied to the platform.
    Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper with an overview of the future. 1.1. Motivation
    Attention to agricultural production has been increasing in recent years with
    global warming and a growing population. Simultaneously, malicious hackers have
    been looking for vulnerabilities in smart agriculture to attack. Since smart agriculture
    is a key component of the economy, trade, and food supply, its data leakage could
    place food security at risk. Therefore, it is extremely important to maintain
    security in smart agriculture. Many resource-constrained IoT devices, such as
    sensors in smart agriculture, are powered by batteries [27]. Energy is quite an
    important element in these devices [28]. Designing a low energy lightweight block
    cipher for IoT devices in the sensing layer is beneficial for defending data security
    in smart agriculture. Nowadays, most of the low energy ciphers or cipher algorithms
    optimized for energy, such as Midori, AES, PRESENT, etc., still have potential
    to be optimized in terms of energy consumption. Firstly, in terms of structure,
    these cipher algorithms all adopt SPN structure. It is well known that the general
    SPN structure is usually not applicable to unified ED circuits. They consume more
    hardware resources and energy if they are to be used in environments where decryption
    routines are required. In smart agriculture environments, the encrypted sensor
    data needs to be decrypted before it can be displayed. Smart agriculture requires
    an algorithmic structure that can be applied to unified ED circuits. Secondly,
    in terms of the nonlinear layer, the existing 4-bit involutive S-boxes are not
    yet optimal in terms of area and delay. Therefore, this paper designs a low energy
    lightweight cipher algorithm for smart agriculture based on the highly consistent
    structure of encryption and decryption and the low-energy S-box. 1.2. Our contribution
    We propose a new low energy lightweight cipher named LELBC for resource-constrained
    IoT devices in smart agriculture. A PSP structure with highly consistent encryption
    and decryption and a low-area, low-latency involutive S-box are designed from
    the structure and components, respectively, so as to achieve a lower energy consumption
    for LELBC in the hardware. Firstly, we found that two identical P diffusion layers
    do not diffuse well, even though it is better to achieve consistent encryption
    and decryption. Therefore, we design two highly symmetric P-diffusion layers to
    achieve the symmetry of the PSP structure so that it can be applied to the unified
    encryption–decryption circuit. Secondly, we obtained a low-area, low-latency involutive
    S-box to achieve low energy consumption of the nonlinear layer by a genetic algorithm.
    Compared with the S-boxes in existing low-latency cipher algorithms, the proposed
    S-box has advantages in both area and latency. Finally, we establish a temperature
    acquisition platform that simulates the environmental monitoring of smart agriculture.
    Then LELBC is applied to the platform to encrypt the collected data, which provides
    the first line of defense for the secure transmission of smart agriculture sensor
    data. 2. Encryption model Smart agriculture mainly uses information technology
    management methods to carry out agricultural production and operations. Its overall
    architecture includes three main parts: the perception layer, the network layer,
    and the application layer [29]. The perception layer can timely acquire and perceive
    environmental factors such as temperature in agricultural production through various
    sensors [30]. These real-time data, including information on personnel and materials
    entering and leaving agricultural greenhouses and data on crop growing sites,
    are uploaded to the IoT information platform through the network layer. Currently,
    all-round environmental monitoring and control systems combining sensors and wireless
    communication networks are widely used and rapidly promoted in facility agriculture.
    However, IoT devices in smart agriculture are susceptible to sensor-based threats
    due to a lack of security measures protecting sensors. Attackers may obtain access
    to perception data so they can monitor or even tamper with related data, damaging
    the confidentiality of the data and posing a serious threat to the proper operation
    and supply of monitoring services [31]. This paper deploys a lightweight block
    cipher, LELBC, at the perception layer to ensure that data is transmitted in ciphertext
    form at the data transmission layer. If the attacker obtains the transmitted data,
    it can only obtain the ciphertext, which cannot be deciphered. Thus, the deployment
    of LELBC in the perception layer ensures the confidentiality of the sensed data
    and establishes the first line of defense for the security of smart agriculture
    IoT devices. The specific encryption application model is shown in Fig. 1. Download

    Encryption application model of smart agriculture. 3. Specification of LELBC This
    section describes the structure of LELBC and the implementation of each component.
    3.1. Encryption algorithm LELBC consists of 16 rounds of encryption, with input
    64-bit plaintext and 128-bit key , and output 64-bit ciphertext . The PSP structure
    of LELBC adopts two symmetrical diffusion layers and Sublayer, which successively
    includes three steps: P diffusion layer, Sublayer and P diffusion layer. Among
    them, the two P-diffusion layers are symmetrical structures, both composed of
    left circular shift and XOR operations. They differ in that the first P diffusion
    layer is left circular shift 5-bit by the left branch data and then XOR with the
    right branch data. The second P diffusion layer is left circular shifted 5-bit
    by the right branch data and then performs an XOR operation with the left branch
    data. The Sublayer consists of 16 4-bit involutive S-boxes, which are identical
    in encryption and decryption. Furthermore, a PN permutation is added after 16
    rounds of round-function iterations to ensure the consistency of the encryption
    and decryption architectures. Some notations used are shown in Table 1. The encryption
    process is shown in Fig. 2 and Algorithm 1. Round-function. The round-function
    process of LELBC in Fig. 2 includes four operations: AddRoundKey, Left circular
    shift, XOR, Sublayer. The number of rounds r is 16. Define the input and output
    of the encryption process as follows: (1) Table 1. Notations of LELBC. Notations

    the high 64-bit ( ) of is taken as input to the two ARK operations. Secondly,
    the first ARK operation takes its high 32-bit data and performs an XOR operation
    with the high 32-bit of plaintext . Finally, the second ARK operation takes its
    lower 32-bit of data and performs an XOR operation with the low 32-bit of plaintext
    . Left circular shift (LCS). The 32-bit plaintext data is cyclically left-shifted.

    Eq. (3). (3) PN permutation (PN). The 64-bit data is divided into two parts, and
    then the two parts are exchanged. This is specifically represented as an exchange

    the master key to obtain the encrypted subkey for the first round. After that,
    a key schedule is performed on the subkey of the previous round in each round
    to obtain the subkey of the current round. The data for which key schedules are
    performed in each round can be divided into 32-bit (0 j 3): (5) The key schedule
    consists of the following steps: S-box, round constant addition, and left circular
    shift. (1) Substitute the 4-bit data with the S-box lookup table in Table 2: (6)
    2) The round constant RC=( ) is the current number of rounds minus 1. The round
    constant addition operation is as follows: (7) 3) Left circular shift of the overall
    data by 64-bit: (8) 4) Circular shift the high 64-bit of data to the left by 9-bit,
    and circular shift the low 64-bit of data to the left by 15-bit: (9) 3.3. Decryption
    algorithm The two P-diffusion layers of the PSP structure are symmetric structures,
    and the S-box is involutory in LELBC. Decryption is highly consistent with encryption.
    The difference between decryption and encryption is that the order of the data
    in the decryption subkey is different from that in the encryption subkey. That
    is, the first-round encryption subkey corresponds to the last-round decryption
    subkey. Moreover, and in the encryption subkey correspond to and in the decryption
    subkey, respectively. Algorithm 1 describes the encryption and decryption of LELBC.
    It is easy to see from Algorithm 1 that the steps of encryption and decryption
    are highly identical. Therefore, the decryption can highly reuse the encryption
    structure to achieve low hardware resource consumption, thus achieving low energy
    consumption. 4. Design rationale 4.1. The structure of LELBC In fact, the more
    hardware resources consumed by a cipher algorithm, the more energy it consumes
    [21]. Therefore, considering the limitations of energy resources in smart agriculture,
    the design of low energy cipher algorithms is bound to consider how much hardware
    resources it occupies. Meanwhile, it is necessary for data to be encrypted for
    transmission and decrypted for display in smart agriculture. Usually, unified
    ED circuits are suitable for use in resource-constrained environments where encryption
    and decryption are required. In this case, a highly consistent structure for encryption
    and decryption is the best choice. In addition, it can be known that the energy
    consumption of a round-based architecture is generally optimal from the perspective
    of cipher algorithm implementation. Therefore, we focus on the round-based architecture
    under unified ED circuits. The main design structures for block ciphers include
    the Feistel structure and the SPN structure. The Feistel structure, although similar
    in both encryption and decryption, exhibits poor diffusion and requires more rounds
    to ensure security. The SPN structure has the advantage of fast diffusion. However,
    it consumes more hardware resources to decrypt due to its relatively poor symmetry.
    LELBC has designed a PSP structure based on the SPN structure. The two P-diffusion
    layers in the PSP structure are symmetric, and the S-box is involutory. So the
    decryption can highly reuse the encryption structure to achieve low hardware resource
    consumption, thus achieving a low energy unified ED circuit. Moreover, the structure
    has good diffusivity. Consistent with low energy Midori, LELBC reaches full (bit-level)
    diffusion after 3 rounds. However, the fact that the ShuffleCell of Midori does
    not have the involution property causes it to require two additional multiplexers
    in a unified ED circuit. In contrast, LELBC adopts a PSP structure with encryption–decryption
    consistency in resource-constrained unified ED circuits, and hence LELBC consumes
    less energy and hardware resources than the Midori cipher. 4.2. The non-linear
    layer of LELBC The non-linear layer is a critical component of LELBC cipher. It
    is used to obfuscate data. The performance of S-box is closely related to the
    security of cipher algorithms as it is the most important nonlinear layer in cipher
    algorithms. In the partial security analysis of cipher algorithms, we determine
    whether a cipher algorithm is capable of resisting a corresponding attack precisely
    by solving for the number of minimal active S-boxes in a full-round cipher. Hence,
    the choice of S-boxes with strong cryptographic properties is crucial. In addition,
    low energy consumption is one of the general goals of LELBC. It can be known that
    the area and delay of components also affect the energy consumption of the whole
    algorithm. Low latency and low area contribute to low energy consumption in implementation.
    The area and delay of the S-box, which is the only nonlinear component in LELBC,
    can greatly affect the energy consumption of LELBC. Moreover, the highly consistent
    algorithmic structure of encryption and decryption is conducive to low energy
    implementation. We must adopt an involutive S-box to ensure that the cipher algorithms
    are highly consistent in encryption and decryption. Therefore, we require a low
    area, low latency, and highly secure involutive S-box to achieve low energy consumption
    of cipher algorithms. Compared to the 8 × 8 S-box, the 4 × 4 S-box has less hardware
    resource consumption. Hence, the 4-bit S-box is usually more suitable for the
    design of low energy ciphers than the 8-bit S-box. Now, there are many heuristic
    algorithms applied to the search of S-boxes, and genetic algorithms are one of
    them. The S-box generation algorithms based on genetic algorithms are almost always
    based around security and strong cryptographic properties. They generally use
    differential uniformity, linear approximation, nonlinearity, and other cryptographic
    properties to generate the S-box with strong cryptographic properties. In 2012,
    Wang et al. obtained S-boxes that meet the requirements of differential uniformity,
    linear approximation, nonlinearity, avalanche effect, and other cryptographic
    properties by combining chaos and genetic algorithm [32]. Later, they carried
    out optimization on this basis to generate highly nonlinear bijective S-boxes
    with nonlinearity as the optimization objective [33]. In 2021, a genetic algorithm
    based on a single objective with nonlinearity was used by Çavuşoğlu Ü et al. to
    obtain S-boxes with strong cryptographic properties [34]. In 2022, Artugeer et
    al. also combined chaos and genetic algorithm to generate S-boxes, and they obtained
    S-boxes with higher nonlinearity by optimizing the S-box structure [35]. In addition
    to meeting these cryptographic requirements, the S-box must also satisfy the conditions
    of involution, low area, and low latency, as we require a low-energy, high-security
    S-box. This requires further searching to generate S-boxes based on existing genetic
    algorithm methods. The flowchart for generating S-boxes using genetic algorithm
    is shown in Fig. 3. Our low energy S-box design is required to meet the following
    five conditions: (1) the maximum difference probability is 2−2; (2) the maximum
    absolute deviation of the linear approximation is 2−2; (3) the algebraic degree
    is 3; (4) the depth is less than 4 (the maximum delay of S-box in existing low-latency
    ciphers is 4), and the area is light; (5) involution. The definitions are given
    as follows: Definition 1 Differential Uniformity For a given S-box , define the
    differential distribution of the S-box as: , where is the input differential and
    is the output differential of the S-box. The differential probability . Definition
    2 Linear Approximation For an S-box , define the linear approximation , where
    is the input mask and is the output mask of the S-box. The linear probability
    is obtained by . Definition 3 Algebraic Degree The algebraic degree of a Boolean
    function is defined as the number of variables in the maximum product term in
    the algebraic normal form (ANF) of a function with non-zero coefficients, denoted
    by . The algebraic degree of an S-box is the maximum algebraic number of non-zero
    linear combinations of all its component functions. Therefore, the S-box algebraic
    degree is defined as . Definition 4 Depth The sum of the sequential path delays
    for fundamental operations is depth. Where the depths of the gate required for
    the basic operations XOR/XNOR, AND/OR, NAND/NOR, and NOT are evaluated to be 2,
    1.5, 1, and 0.5, respectively. For example, we consider the computation of in
    Eq. (10). ( ) and ( ) are executed first. Then calculate ( ). Then the last operation
    of NOR can be executed. Thus, the depth of is estimated to be 3.5 (=1.5+1+1).
    The genetic algorithm is used to find low energy S-boxes. The crossover probability
    is 0.8, and the mutation probability is 0.6. The required computation time is
    reduced by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) in S-box generation, and a series of S-boxes
    that meet the conditions can be directly found. The steps for the proposed genetic
    algorithm to find low energy S-boxes are as follows: (1) First, 10,000 individuals
    are randomly generated as the initial population. Download : Download high-res

    are continuously performed on the existing population until the resulting new
    population meets our requirements. After each creation of a new population, the
    following actions are performed on the new population: (1) Calculate the fitness
    values (differential probability, linear approximation probability, and algebraic
    degree) of all individuals in the population by means of a fitness function. (2)
    Effective scaling of the initial fitness. (3) Select the parents with better fitness
    scores from the existing population for processing to generate a new population.
    Among them, the S-box logic operations required to compute algebraic degrees cannot
    be easily obtained since the first step of the algorithm generates 10,000 S-box
    lookup tables with random permutations as the initial population. Hence the Karnaugh
    map method is used to obtain the four simplest logical expressions corresponding
    to the S-box. First, each column is treated as a group, and the S-box lookup table
    is converted into four binary arrays. Then, 0 and 1 are filled in the matrix according
    to the relationship between the different inputs and outputs of the four binary
    arrays to obtain four matrices. The Karnaugh maps are drawn based on these four
    matrices, combining adjacent 1s into the largest set possible and covering as
    many 1s as possible to generate expression terms. Then, the expression terms are
    simplified, and duplicate terms and terms containing other terms are removed to
    generate the complete logical expression. (3) The maximum depth of S-boxes used
    in current low-latency ciphers is 4. Therefore, we keep the depth within 4 for
    searching. It is clear from Definition 4 that in a 4-bit S-box, coordinate components
    with a depth less than 4 are at most a combination of seven 2-input logic gates,
    and the area of each coordinate component is also low at this point. Consequently,
    we can directly traverse the S-boxes obtained in step 2) that satisfy the cryptographic
    properties to search for low-latency and low-area S-boxes. Firstly, we represent
    each coordinate component with a set of 2-input logic gates, respectively (the
    depth is limited to 4). Then, calculate the delay and area of the four coordinate
    components in each S-box, respectively, where the area is calculated under the
    UMC 1P6M process library. Finally, an involutive S-box with low delay and low
    area is obtained. The depth of the S-box is 3.5, and its area is 22.33 GE. Table
    3 shows the performance of the proposed S-box compared with other S-boxes under
    the same process library. It can be seen that the S-box of LELBC has some advantages
    in terms of area and delay. Therefore, it is more capable of achieving low energy
    consumption for LELBC than other S-boxes. The logic gate operation of the S-box
    is represented by Eq. (10). The inputs and outputs are defined as and , where
    and are the most significant bits. (10) 4.3. The linear layer of LELBC A structure
    with highly consistent encryption and decryption is more conducive to low energy
    design. Therefore, LELBC adopts two symmetrical linear layers before and after
    the Sublayer for the diffusion of plaintext data to achieve highly consistent
    encryption and decryption. Although the selection of two identical linear layers
    can better achieve the consistency of encryption and decryption, the diffusion
    effect is not good because the data of the two branches does not affect each other.
    The diffusion effect of this method is also verified by an avalanche effect experiment.
    Table 4 illustrates the avalanche effect of the two linear layers in the first
    5 rounds. represents the average change in output bits when the input plaintext
    changes by 1 bit. The experiment proves that using two symmetrical linear layers
    can achieve a better diffusion effect. Simultaneously, LELBC only needs to add
    an exchange of left and right branch data after 16 rounds of iteration of the
    round function to achieve complete consistency of the encryption and decryption
    structures. Since the S-box is obfuscated in half-byte units, bit diffusion of
    the data is performed using cyclic shifting and XOR operations in the linear layer.
    The selection of the number of cyclic shift bits takes into account both the avalanche
    effect and the security analysis. There are 32 choices, as the cyclically left-shifted
    bits need to be exactly the same in order to achieve a symmetric structure. The
    optimal choice was determined by an experimental test that traversed these 32
    data points. We conducted experiments on the choice of the number of circular
    shifts in combination with differential attacks and avalanche effects. The number
    of rounds at which the cipher algorithm achieves a complete avalanche or the security
    boundary changes with the variation of the bit of circular left shifts, as can
    be seen in Fig. 4. In which rows represent the cyclically left-shifted bits and
    columns represent the round number corresponding to achieving a complete avalanche
    or differential attack security boundary. As some data cannot achieve complete
    avalanche effect for the algorithm, we label all the data at that point in the
    graph as 0. We finally chose 5 as the number of cyclic left shifts for the P diffusion
    layer based on the experimental result chart. Table 4. Comparison of avalanche

    effect is a security evaluation method for cryptographic algorithms. The better
    the avalanche effect of the cipher algorithm, the higher the security. In this
    section, the safety strength of this cipher is evaluated by avalanche effect analysis.
    The experiment was conducted by randomly selecting 10,000 sets of 64-bit plaintext
    as test samples. When the input plaintext changes by 1 bit, the avalanche effect
    degree , the strict avalanche criterion degree , the bit of output change , the
    mean value of the bit of output change , the probability of output change and
    the mean probability of output change are tested. Table 5 shows the avalanche
    effect test results for LELBC. At the same time, we use , , and to represent the
    minimum, maximum, and average number of changed bits, respectively. The avalanche
    effect diagram shown in Fig. 5. As seen from Table 5 and Fig. 5, LELBC fully satisfied
    the dependency requirements in the fifth round. In addition, we used the same
    method to test PRESENT and CRAFT, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 6
    and Fig. 7, respectively. Both the PRESENT and CRAFT algorithms reached the avalanche
    effect standard in the sixth round. Therefore, it can be considered that LELBC
    has a good avalanche effect. Table 5. Analysis of avalanche effect of LELBC. Round

    attack and linear attack Differential and linear attacks have been two of the
    most effective cryptographic attack methods since they were proposed. The lower
    bound of the active S-box count can, to some extent, reflect a cipher’s resistance
    to differential and linear attacks. In recent years, automated search has become
    a major focus for cryptanalysis. One of the tools for automating analysis is mixed
    integer linear programming (MILP) [36]. In this paper, the algorithm is analyzed
    using the MILP method. A bit-oriented MILP program is constructed to calculate
    the minimum number of differences and linear active S-boxes. First, we obtain
    the input differential and output differential corresponding to their non-zero
    points according to the difference distribution table (DDT) of LELBC’s S-box.
    It can be seen from Table 10 that the number of non-zero points it has is 97.
    We then obtain 272 inequalities by using the SageMath tool to distinguish all
    non-zero points from other points. Next, we use the MILP procedure to reduce these
    inequalities and eliminate redundancy. The final 21 constrained inequalities are
    obtained to represent the S-box. Finally, we use the Gurobi solver to solve for
    the minimum active S-box number based on the above constraints and the structure
    of the LELBC cipher. The same method is adopted to perform linear attacks on the
    LELBC cipher. The linear approximation table (LAT) for the S-box is shown in Table
    11. Table 6 displays the minimal number of active S-boxes discovered through experimentation.
    It is evident that after 12 rounds of encryption, LELBC has 34 active S-boxes.
    The maximum difference probability and the maximum linear probability should be
    less than 2−64, as the block length of LELBC is 64-bit. Meanwhile, the maximum
    difference probability and the maximum linear probability of the S-box used in
    LELBC are 2−2. It can be observed that the maximum difference probability of LELBC
    in 12 rounds is . The maximum linear probability of LELBC in 12 rounds is . Therefore,
    the 16-round LELBC is resistant to both differential and linear attacks. Table

    5712 5.3. Algebraic attack Algebraic attack is one of the vital methods of cryptanalysis.
    The attacker recovers the key by calculating a number of multivariate algebraic
    equations [37]. The more multivariate algebraic equations there are, the stronger
    the resistance to algebraic attack. These complicated multivariate algebraic equations
    are derived from non-linear S-boxes since they are the most important non-linear
    components of cryptographic algorithms. LELBC has an overall number of (16 × 16)
    + (1 × 16) = 272 S-boxes in the encryption since it has 16 iteration rounds. Twenty-one
    quadratic equations with eight input and output bit variables can be used to describe
    a 4 × 4 S-box. Thus, LELBC has 272 × 21 = 5712 quadratic equations corresponding
    to 272 × 8 = 2176 variables. We compared the differences in the number of S-boxes,
    variables, and quadratic equations between LELBC and KLEIN, Midori, PRINCE, MIBS.
    As can be seen from Table 7, LELBC has a better advantage over most of the cipher
    algorithms, such as Midori, in all these aspects. The Midori cipher algorithm
    has been proven to be resistant to algebraic attack. Therefore, it can be said
    that LELBC is also resistant to algebraic attack. 5.4. Meet-in-the-middle attack
    and slide attack Meet-in-the-Middle attack can be used to analyze the algorithm’s
    security by taking into account three characteristics: partial matching, initial
    structure, and splice-and-cut [38]. Partial matching can only be used when the
    cipher algorithm does not reach full diffusion in both forward and reverse directions.
    Therefore, the total diffusion rounds of LELBC are = 3, as discussed in Section
    4.1, so the boundary of partial matching is = 4. The length of the initial structure
    can also be defined by and the number of rounds in which the key difference affects
    all non-linear operations. Thus, limits the length of the initial structure. Splice-and-cut
    can also limit the number of rounds of attack by subtracting 1 from . In summary,
    the upper bound on the number of rounds that can be attacked by intermediate encounters
    is 10 = (4 + 3 + 3) rounds for LELBC. LELBC is sufficient to resist Meet-in-the-Middle
    attack, considering the total number of rounds of the LELBC algorithm. In addition,
    we ensure that each round of operations is different for LELBC since it includes
    round constant addition in the key schedule. Therefore, LELBC is sufficient to
    resist slide attack. 6. Implementation 6.1. Evaluation This section presents an
    ASIC hardware implementation of LELBC. We adopt a round-based architecture implementation
    for LELBC as it takes less energy than a serialized architecture. First, we implemented
    LELBC with Verilog HDL and simulated it with ModelSim SE-64 10.4. Afterwards,
    LELBC is synthesized using the Synopsys Design Compiler version A-2007.12-SP1
    and the UMCL18G212T3 standard cell library. The architectural diagram of the round-based
    structure of LELBC is illustrated in Fig. 8. In a round-based architecture, the
    LELBC occupies one clock cycle per round. The round function consists of ARK,
    LCS, S, and XOR operations. Additionally, the key schedule consists of S-box,
    round constant addition, and left circular shift. The detailed description of
    the encryption/decryption (ENC/DEC) mode and encryption+decryption (ENC+DEC) mode
    of round-based architectures for LELBC is shown below. The round-based architecture
    (ENC/DEC): The hardware resources and energy consumption of LELBC in encryption
    mode and decryption mode are identical due to the symmetry of the PSP structure.
    For fair comparison, we uniformly use registers to store key and does not take
    into account the resources for the key schedule. The hardware resources of the
    round-based architecture for LELBC include 64-bit plaintext registers, 128-bit
    key registers, 128-bit XOR, 16 S-boxes, control logic and other counters. The
    detailed description of the area consumption for LELBC is given in Table 8. Thus,
    the estimated area of round-based architecture (ENC/DEC) for LELBC is 1863.04
    GE, and energy consumption is 6.99 J/bit. The round-based architecture (ENC+DEC):
    The key schedule of decryption for LELBC under unified ED circuits does not match
    that of encryption. Therefore, the ENC+DEC mode only requires an additional S-box,
    5-bit round constant addition, and a multiplexer on the basis of the ENC/DEC mode.
    Consistent with the ENC/DEC mode, the computation of area and energy in the ENC+DEC
    mode also uniformly uses registers to store the key and does not take into account
    the resources for the key schedule. The comparison of area and energy for LELBC
    with other ciphers in ENC+DEC mode is given in Table 9. It is observed from the
    table that there is a 24.02% and 24.04% reduction in energy and area for LELBC
    compared to Midori, a low-energy cipher published in ASIACRYPT 2015. It is possible
    that this reduction in energy and area could allow LELBC to be applicable in a
    future where IoT devices are more resource-constrained. LELBC could reduce the
    energy loss of each resource-constrained device to a greater extent in practical
    IoT deployments, increasing their lifespan and reducing the replacement cycle
    of the devices. From a long-term perspective, the reduced energy consumption in
    practical IoT deployments is conducive to increasing the availability of IoT devices
    in smart agriculture and reducing economic losses. Simultaneously, smart agriculture
    can utilize energy more efficiently and rationally and facilitate the balanced
    development of the environment and the economy. Download : Download high-res image

    popular in facility agriculture due to all-round environmental monitoring and
    control systems that combine sensors and wireless communication networks. Environmental
    data and on-site scenario information in agriculture are collected and transmitted
    through various wireless sensors to liquid crystal display screens for comprehensive
    display, achieving scientific, timely, and accurate adjustment of agricultural
    production. However, as more and more farms and food processing plants adopt new
    technologies to simplify production and integrate supply chain services, cybercrime
    is becoming an increasingly serious threat to agricultural enterprises. Therefore,
    encrypting sensor data in smart agriculture has a certain significance. Temperature
    is an important factor in the growth and development of crops in agriculture,
    and real-time monitoring of temperature is conducive to the timely adjustment
    of the appropriate temperature state. In this section, a temperature acquisition
    platform was established to simulate environmental monitoring in smart agriculture.
    At the same time, we deployed the 64–128 versions of LELBC on the temperature
    acquisition platform. LELBC simulates data acquisition and encrypted transmission
    in agriculture through temperature sensors and two Artix-7 FPGA development boards
    based on XC7A100T2csg324. We synthesized the RTL generated by LELBC based on the
    round architecture using ISE Design Suite 14.6 and downloaded it onto an Artix-7
    FPGA development board based on the XC7A100T-2csg324. Firstly, an Artix-7 FPGA
    development board acquires real-time temperature data through the temperature
    sensor. It then encrypts and displays the data through the downloaded LELBC. After
    that, the data is transmitted to another Artix-7 FPGA development board in the
    form of ciphertext to be decrypted and displayed. The specific process is shown
    in Fig. 9. The Artix-7 FPGA development board on the right encrypts the collected
    temperature data and displays it, while the Artix-7 FPGA development board on
    the left displays the temperature data after the ciphertext is decrypted. LELBC
    provides encryption of the sensed data before transmission, which ensures that
    the data is kept in the form of ciphertext at all times during transmission. It
    protects the confidentiality of the data by preventing attackers from stealing,
    tampering with, and leaking the real data. The successful implementation of a
    real-time temperature status acquisition and encryption platform demonstrates
    the feasibility of deploying LELBC on the platform. It provides the first line
    of defense for data security in smart agriculture. Download : Download high-res

    and encryption platform. 7. Conclusion The focus of this paper is to design a
    low energy lightweight block cipher LELBC that meets the requirements of an environment
    with extremely limited energy resources. Firstly, we studied the design methods
    of low energy ciphers and optimized them based on the shortcomings of existing
    low energy ciphers. LELBC adopts a novel PSP structure with highly consistent
    encryption and decryption, which takes into account the energy resource constraints
    of unified ED circuits during the design phase. Additionally, GA is used to search
    for a low-energy involutive S-box with excellent performance compared to other
    cipher involutive S-boxes. In terms of hardware implementation on a round-based
    architecture, LELBC has a lower area and energy consumption (encryption + decryption)
    than low energy lightweight ciphers such as PRINCE, Loong, CRAFT, I-PRESENT ,
    SKINNY, and Midori. The test vectors for LELBC are given in Table 12. LELBC has
    been demonstrated by security analysis to be resistant to attacks such as differential
    attack, linear attack, algebraic attack, and other types of attacks. Finally,
    LELBC is deployed on the temperature acquisition platform to encrypt and decrypt
    the sensor data. The successful implementation of this experiment proves the feasibility
    of LELBC, which provides the first layer of protection for the privacy and security
    of smart agriculture. Future works: Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Side Channel
    Attacks (SCAs) are two of the most important topics in security. In the future,
    we will also delve into these two directions. First, there is a need for a hybrid
    system for the transition towards PQC, although quantum computing based on Shor’s
    algorithm will break most cryptosystems [39]. This hybrid system requires both
    classical cryptography and PQC [40]. Many related techniques are continuously
    proposed [41], [42]. They usually optimize the performance of the algorithms according
    to the NIST standard [43], [44]. In the future, we can further study the relevant
    applications of PQC in resource-constrained environments such as smart agriculture.

    EE1E-96B3-C248-F88D Second, the fault attack is specifically mentioned in the
    NIST lightweight standardization as a side channel attack. It works by forcing
    a device to operate under extreme conditions, resulting in computational errors.
    It is necessary to consider the possibility of fault attacks in practical applications,
    even though the attackers are generally restricted [45]. A number of error detection
    schemes for cipher algorithms have been proposed [46], [47]. For example, Jasmin
    Kaur et al. proposed signature-based error detection schemes that can be applied
    to cipher algorithms similar to the QARMA cipher [13]. And the overhead of this
    method can be applied to resource-constrained devices. LELBC has similarities
    with QARMA both in terms of block length, structure, and components. In future
    practical deployments, we can also refer to this scheme to secure the LELBC hardware
    implementation. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they

  description: Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an important research area in smart
    agriculture. As an emerging technology, LoRa is used for communication between
    wireless sensor nodes. When LoRa is used as a mobile terminal node (mobile robot,
    drone, etc.), the Quality of Service (QoS) of LoRa network will be greatly reduced,
    which will have an impact on the quantitative decision-making and intelligent
    control in the future. Therefore, a novel Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm for
    agricultural mobile sensor nodes is proposed in this paper. The channel condition
    changes are effectively sensed based on three LoRa signal characteristics of SNR,
    RSSI, and frequency offset. It could respond quickly to the complex and changeable
    radio channel environment, and configured the modulation parameters dynamically
    and accurately. The Mobile LoRaSim tool and Arduino + SX1278 hardware platform
    were adopted for evaluation and analysis. The results showed that compared with

    rights and content Highlights • The number of packets is dynamically adjusted
    based on the moving speed of nodes. • Time on Air (ToA) is used as a selection
    criterion for modulation parameters. • Distance, moving speed and SNR are used
    to determine the network margin. Abstract Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an
    important research area in smart agriculture. As an emerging technology, LoRa
    is used for communication between wireless sensor nodes. When LoRa is used as
    a mobile terminal node (mobile robot, drone, etc.), the Quality of Service (QoS)
    of LoRa network will be greatly reduced, which will have an impact on the quantitative
    decision-making and intelligent control in the future. Therefore, a novel Adaptive
    Data Rate (ADR) algorithm for agricultural mobile sensor nodes is proposed in
    this paper. The channel condition changes are effectively sensed based on three
    LoRa signal characteristics of SNR, RSSI, and frequency offset. It could respond
    quickly to the complex and changeable radio channel environment, and configured
    the modulation parameters dynamically and accurately. The Mobile LoRaSim tool
    and Arduino + SX1278 hardware platform were adopted for evaluation and analysis.
    The results showed that compared with the standard ADR algorithm and the Blind
    ADR algorithm, the data extraction rate of the Mobile ADR algorithm was increased
    by 15 %, the data collision rate was reduced by 45 %, the network energy consumption
    was reduced by 8 %, and the time on air was reduced by 50 %. The proposed algorithm

    1. Introduction WSN is widely deployed in agricultural environments, and its application
    scenarios can be divided into two categories: static and dynamic. Static scenarios
    are mainly monitoring systems with fixed positions, such as soil component detection
    system (Moiroux-Arvis et al., 2022), greenhouse environment monitoring system
    (Wang et al., 2023a), etc. The dynamic scene is mainly some mobile nodes, such
    as agricultural mobile robots (Deng et al., 2020), agricultural drones (Cicioğlu
    and Çalhan, 2021) and so on. However, QoS of network needs to be considered for
    the wireless agricultural monitoring systems, especially in harsh environments
    such as long-distance transmission and mobile scenarios. Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is an emerging technology suitable for the low to medium speed Internet
    of Thing (IoT). LoRa belongs to LPWAN, which achieves long distance transmission
    with extremely low network energy consumption (Raza et al., 2017). LoRaWAN is
    the MAC layer protocol of LoRa (Adelantado et al., 2017, Mroue, et al., 2020).
    ADR scheme is the technical advantage of LoRaWAN. It allows the network server
    to select different combinations of Spreading Factor (SF) and Transmission Power
    (TP) according to the link communication quality, and then dynamically manage
    the data rate and transmission power of each terminal node to reduce energy consumption,
    reduce collisions, and increase network capacity. LoRa was originally designed
    for static devices, but is now increasingly used in mobile devices for transmitting
    sensor data to LoRa gateways. Y. Chou et al. (Chou et al., 2017) proposed an LPWAN
    vehicle diagnostic system that sends abnormal events from exercising vehicles
    to a LoRa gateway. V. Delafontaine et al. (Delafontaine et al., 2020) proposed
    a UAV carrying a mobile gateway for assisted localization, which improves the
    node localization accuracy of the LoRaWAN system. M. Magno et al. (Magno et al.,
    2018) combined LoRa with RTK to achieve high-precision positioning of mobile nodes
    while ensuring low energy consumption. In the above mobile scenarios, standard
    ADR is rarely used. Because it judges the channel communication quality based
    on the 20 packets that have been received, and the adjustment of modulation parameters
    is lagging, it is only suitable for static and stable terminal nodes. When the
    terminal node is moving, its moving speed and direction are changing in real time,
    and the natural environment it is located, including covering shadows and obstacle
    blocking, is also changing in real time. Therefore, the channel conditions of
    the mobile node are also dynamically changing, which requires LoRaWAN to be able
    to sense the dynamic radio channel environment and have fast response capabilities.
    In conclusion, it is necessary to improve the standard ADR algorithm. In order
    to expand the application range of the ADR algorithm so that it can be deployed
    in mobile nodes, researchers have improved the standard ADR algorithm from the
    directions of predicting the location of mobile nodes and estimating the change
    trend of communication quality to make it suitable for rapidly changing channel
    conditions. Benkahla et al. (Benkahla et al., 2019) proposed an E-ADR algorithm,
    which used the RSSI-based triangulation method to locate mobile nodes with fixed
    motion trajectories. Variable order Hidden Markov Model (VHMM) was adopted to
    locate mobile nodes with unknown motion trajectories (Benkahla et al., 2021).
    Finally, it determined whether the node moved to a new area based on the RSSI
    of the current packet and the predicted RSSI, and then adjusted the new configuration.
    Moysiadis et al. (Moysiadis et al., 2021) proposed a LR-ADR algorithm, which used
    linear regression to predict the next SNR value based on the 10 received SNR values,
    and then selected the best value of SF and TP based on the SNR values of 20 packets.
    Farhad et al. (Farhad et al., 2020) proposed a G-ADR algorithm and an EMA-ADR
    algorithm, which mentioned that the signal quality of the packets obeyed Gaussian
    distribution. Therefore, the G-ADR algorithm used Gaussian filter and calculated
    probability density function (PDF) to predict the SNR value of the data packets.
    The EMA-ADR algorithm used an EMA filter to smooth the SNR value of the packets,
    eliminating the rapid change of the SNR value. Farhad et al. (Farhad and Pyun,
    2022) proposed a Blind ADR algorithm. It did not use a single data rate, but alternately
    used three data rates (SF = 12, SF = 10, SF = 7) and different communication cycles,
    which met the needs of LoRaWAN mobile application requirements while ensuring
    low power consumption. The above improvement measures for the ADR algorithm all
    adopt the method of predicting the communication quality or position of the mobile
    node in the next communication cycle, and then adjust the modulation parameters
    according to the predicted data. However, the moving direction, moving speed,
    natural environment and channel conditions of the mobile node usually change randomly
    and are uncertain. Therefore, predicting the communication quality changes in
    future communication period by the communication data of received packets may
    lead to large errors. Aiming at the above defects, a flexible Mobile ADR algorithm
    is proposed. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) The movement
    speed of nodes is used as a modulation basis to dynamically adjust the number
    of packets selected, which improves the adaptability of LoRaWAN to the radio channel
    environment; (2) Time on Air (ToA) is used as a selection criterion for modulation
    parameters, and the bandwidth selection range is extended, which improves the
    data rate of LoRaWAN; (3) The distance between the node and the gateway, the node
    movement speed and the change trend of the SNR value of the data packet are used
    as the calculation basis for dynamically determining the network margin, which
    achieves a dynamic balance of data rate and data extraction rate in the complex
    and variable radio channel environment. Through the improved Mobile LoRaSim simulation
    tool and the Arduino + SX1278 hardware test platform, the standard ADR, Blind
    ADR algorithm, and Mobile ADR algorithm were experimentally analysed in this paper.
    The results showed that improving the dynamic sensing capability of LoRaWAN to
    the change of channel conditions and the data rate of LoRa communication could
    improve the network performance and reduce the network energy consumption. The
    rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section II, related techniques are
    introduced. A flexible Mobile ADR algorithm is proposed in Section III. The results
    are analyzed and discussed in Section IV. Finally, conclusions are summarized
    in Section V. 2. Related work In this section, LoRa and LoRaWAN are first introduced,
    then standard ADR and the categorization effects of ADR algorithms are analysed.
    Finally, LoRa communication parameters that are worth paying attention to in mobile
    scenarios and LoRa frequency offsets are introduced. 2.1. LoRa/LoRaWAN LoRa is
    a new spread spectrum modulation technology (Ikpehai et al., 2019), which not
    only retains the low power consumption characteristics of FSK technology, but
    also improves the receiver sensitivity. LoRa is a physical layer protocol (Zhang
    et al., 2019). With LoRa modulation, a balance between link budget, interference
    immunity and data rate are made by adjusting the Spreading Factor (SF), Bandwidth
    (BW), Code Rate (CR), and Low Data Rate Optimize (LDRO). SF represents the ratio
    between chip rate and symbol rate. The higher the SF, the better the receiver
    sensitivity, but the longer the ToA. BW is the frequency range possessed by the
    signal. The higher the BW, the shorter the ToA, but the receiver sensitivity decreases.
    CR is the proportion of useful parts in the data stream. The higher the CR, the
    better the noise immunity, but the longer the ToA. LDRO greatly reduces the number
    of bits corresponding to each symbol when the data rate is low. It allows for
    a reduced requirement for frequency drift during packet transmission time, but
    increases ToA. LoRaWAN is the LoRa networking protocol at the MAC layer. The complete
    LoRaWAN network includes terminal nodes, gateways, Network Server (NS), and application
    server (Zhang et al., 2019). In LoRaWAN network, a star network topology is used
    between terminals and gateways, and gateways are connected to NS through cellular
    networks or Ethernet. The network architecture of LoRaWAN is shown in Fig. 1.

    Fig. 1. LoRaWAN network structure. 2.2. ADR algorithm The ADR algorithm dynamically
    adjusts SF and TP according to the different distances between terminal nodes
    and gateways, which minimizes energy consumption while ensuring communication
    quality. The ADR algorithm is composed by the NS side and the node side. The NS
    side increases the data rate of the nodes and the node side decreases its own
    data rate. To avoid energy consumption at the node side, the ADR algorithm at
    the node side has been kept simple to avoid additional computational resources.
    Therefore, the ADR function is mainly implemented at the network server side.
    The algorithmic flow of the standard ADR on the NS side is shown in Algorithm
    1 (Jiang et al., 2022). Algorithm 1: Standard ADR algorithm Input: SF = 7 ∼ 12,
    TP = 2 ∼ 14dBm, M = 20, margin_db = 5 dB Output: SF & TP 1: If (ACK == enabled)
    Then 2:  SNRmax = Max (SNR of last MUL packets); 3:  SNRreq = Demodulation of
    DR/SF; 4:  SNRmargin = SNRmax - SNRreq - margin_db; 5:  Steps = int (SNRmargin
    / 3); 6:  While (Steps < 0 & SF > 7) do 7:   SF = SF-1 & Steps = Steps −1; 8:  End
    9:  While (Steps > 0 & TP > 2) do 10:   TP = TP-3 & Steps = Steps −1; 11:  End
    12:  While (Steps < 0 & TP < 14) do 13:   TP = TP + 3 & Steps = Steps + 1； 14:  End
    15:End The standard ADR algorithm is described as follows. First, the maximum
    value of Signal-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the latest 20 received packets is obtained,
    which is represented as SNRmax. Next, SNRmax subtracts the minimum SNR required
    under the current modulation parameters, which is represented as SNRreq. Then
    SNRmax subtracts margin_db (the default recommendation is 5 dB). Finally, the
    SNRmargin is calculated. The equation is shown in (1), which is used to judge
    whether the current modulation parameters need to be adjusted. (1) If SNRmargin
    is less than 0, it means the communication process has the risk of packet loss,
    so SF and TP are increased. If SNRmargin is greater than 0, it means the energy
    consumption could be further reduced, so SF and TP are reduced. If SNRmargin is
    equal to 0, it means that the current configuration is the most suitable, so the
    modulation parameters do not need to be adjusted. The number of adjustments is
    obtained by dividing SNRmargin by 3. The equation is shown in (2), the step size
    for adjusting SF is 1, and the step size for adjusting TP is 3. (2) When multiple
    groups of data packets with the same SF and BW enter into a channel at the same
    time, and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of one group of data is
    more than 6 dB higher than the other data, which can be demodulated correctly.
    In LoRaWAN, the categorization effect occurs when the standard ADR algorithm is
    used. As shown in Fig. 2, terminal nodes at the same distance from the gateway
    use the same data rate and are in a similar radio channel environment, and the
    gateway receives basically the same RSSI from the terminal nodes. Therefore, the
    probability of collision of multiple groups of data within the same channel increases
    and the probability of successfully demodulating the signal decreases. In LoRa
    mobile scenarios, such as personnel location, smart agriculture (Zhang et al.,
    2018) and smart animal husbandry, LoRa terminal nodes are generally densely distributed
    and thus have higher collision rate. From this, it can be concluded that data
    collision rate is the communication metric to be concerned when different ADR
    algorithms for mobile nodes are compared and analysed. Download : Download high-res

    a single-channel gateway. 2.3. Communication parameters in mobile scenarios In
    LoRa mobile scenarios, LoRaWAN network performance depends more on some key communication
    parameters such as link budget, data rate, and Doppler effect. Link budget is
    defined as the reasonable adjustment of modulation parameters such as TP, SF and
    BW according to the path transmission loss and receiver sensitivity. It can achieve
    a dynamic balance of power consumption and packet acquisition rate. The sensitivity
    data for different SF and BW are shown in Table 1. Boosting the data rate enhances
    LoRaWAN''s ability to respond to complex and variable channel conditions. If the
    ability to cope with frequency shifts caused by the Doppler effect is improved,
    when nodes move fast, more stable LoRa communication can be guaranteed. Table

    −20 In free space, LoRa signals are not blocked on the propagation path, and the
    signal quality is only related to the communication distance. But in the actual
    radio channel environment, the reflection and diffraction of the radio are caused
    by ground objects in the path. To summarize, the path transmission loss of LoRa
    signals in the actual radio channel environment include free space propagation
    loss and fading loss, as shown in Equation (3). (3) where Lb is the actual transmission
    loss, L0 is the free space propagation loss and LF is the attenuation loss. Due
    to the complexity of the actual radio channel environment, it is difficult to
    calculate the path transmission loss of LoRa signals, so the path loss index is
    usually introduced to measure the fading of radio channels. Its calculation is
    shown in Equation (4), and the slow fading path loss index in different environments
    is shown in Table 2. (4) where n is the path loss index, f is the carrier frequency,
    and r is the communication distance. From Equation (4), it can be seen that when
    the distance between the terminal node and the gateway increases, the influence
    of the path loss index on the fading of the radio channel is more obvious, and
    the path transmission loss is mainly composed of fading loss. Table 2. Path loss

    3 ∼ 5 Blocked by buildings 4 ∼ 6 RSSI is used to determine the quality of channel
    communication and is defined as: (5) here Pr represents RSSI, Pt represents the
    radiated power of the transmitting antenna, Gr represents the gain coefficient
    of the receiving antenna, Gt represents the gain coefficient of the transmitting
    antenna. ToA is the time that data packets are transmitted from sending to being
    received, which is the basis for determining the data rate. The shorter the ToA,
    the faster the data rate. It is obtained by Equation (6) (Wang et al., 2023b).
    (6) where is the number of symbol. The frequency shift of LoRa signal is mainly
    related to the chip heating and Doppler effect. Due to the optimized layout design
    of the LoRa chip, the frequency offset caused by heat will stabilize as the running
    time increases. When the terminal node or gateway is moving, the Doppler effect
    is the change between the frequency at which the LoRa signal is transmitted and
    the frequency at which it is received. In LoRa modulation, the frequency offset
    during the packet transmission time should be lower than Freq_drift_max, which
    can be expressed as: (7) 3. Adaptive network configuration In this section, the
    Mobile ADR algorithm is introduced, and how to obtain the motion data of nodes
    such as distance from the gateway and movement speed without increasing energy
    consumption is presented. 3.1. Mobile ADR algorithm Different from the prediction
    method used in most studies, the Mobile ADR algorithm adopts the same technical
    scheme as the standard ADR algorithm to analyse the signal characteristics of
    the data packets, and then senses the complex and variable radio channel conditions
    faced by the mobile nodes. The standard ADR algorithm takes the SNR of received
    packets as the judgment basis for adjusting LoRa modulation parameters. The Mobile
    ADR algorithm expands the adjustment basis from both LoRa signal characteristics
    and node movement data on the basis of the standard ADR algorithm. In LoRa signal
    characteristics, RSSI and frequency offset of packets are added as the judgment
    basis, which improves the sensing capability of changes in channel conditions.
    In the node movement data, the movement speed and the distance between the node
    and the gateway are added (Slabicki et al., 2018), which are used to calculate
    the link budget dynamically. Moreover, the Mobile ADR algorithm adds ToA as the
    selection index of LoRa modulation parameters and expands the range of BW to increase
    the data rate of LoRa communication, which in turn improves the responsiveness
    of LoRaWAN to changes in channel conditions. The specific flow of the Mobile ADR
    algorithm is shown in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2: Mobile ADR algorithm Input: SF
    = 7 ∼ 12, BW = [125,250,500] kHz, TP = 2 ∼ 14dBm, margin_db = 5 ∼ 10 dB, M = 1
    ∼ 20, v = Node movement speed Output: SF & TP 1: If (ACK == enabled) Then 2:   M
    = ; 3:   SFlast = the SF of the terminal -node''s last received frame; 4:   SNRmax
    = Max(SNR of last MUL packets); 5:   SNRmin = Min(SNR of last MUL packets); 6:   RSSImin
    = Min(RSSI of last MUL packets); 7:   maxdist = ; 8:   While (margin_db ≤ 10)
    do 9:    margin_db = 1/3 (  × 10 +  ); 10:   End 11:   SNRreq = SNRmin - margin_db;
    12:   RSSIreq = RSSImin - margin_db; 13:    [SF, BW] = ToAmin (all [SF,BW] to
    satisfy SNRreq & RSSIreq); 14:   If (SF - SFlast < 0 & TP > 2) Then 15:    TP
    = TP-3; 16:   End 17:   If (SF - SFlast > 0 & TP < 14) Then 18:    TP = TP＋3;
    19:   End 20:  End In step 2, the number M of packets is determined dynamically.
    In the standard ADR algorithm, the number of packets selected to adjust the modulation
    parameters is 20 for a static node (v = 0). However, as the nodes move faster,
    the channel conditions may also change faster, so that the adjustment based on
    20 packets is greatly untimely. When the speed of the mobile node with SF = 12
    and BW = 125 kHz is 10.5 m/s, the signal fades greatly due to the Doppler effect,
    which leads to packet loss. In order to reduce the packet loss rate, the number
    of packets selected at this time should be 1. Therefore, the linear relationship
    between M and v is determined. In step 8, the margin_db value is typically 10
    dB in most networks, while the default recommended margin_db value for LoRaWAN
    is 5 dB. When the margin_db value is higher, the data extraction rate will increase,
    but the data rate will decrease. Therefore, an appropriate margin_db value is
    necessary. The distance between the nodes and the gateway, the change trend of
    the SNR value of the packets and the movement speed of the nodes are used as the
    basis for dynamically calculating the margin_db value. In step 11, the standard
    ADR algorithm selects the maximum value of SNR as the demodulation basis, while
    the Mobile ADR algorithm selects the minimum value of SNR as the demodulation
    basis. Because the standard ADR algorithm is applied to stable static nodes, low
    energy consumption is more valued, and selecting the maximum value is beneficial
    to reduce energy consumption. However, when the nodes are mobile, high communication
    quality is more important, and choosing the minimum value is beneficial to improve
    the packet acquisition rate. The Mobile ADR algorithm expands the BW selection
    range from 125 kHz of the standard ADR algorithm to 125 kHz, 250 kHz and 500 kHz.
    The BW of the European regional LoRaWAN specification includes 125 kHz and 250
    kHz, and the BW of the American LoRaWAN specification includes 125 kHz and 500
    kHz. Therefore, the BW selection range of 125 kHz, 250 kHz and 500 kHz is considered
    feasible in this paper. From Equation (6) and Equation (7), BW is inversely proportional
    to ToA and positively proportional to Freq_drift_max. Therefore, the higher BW
    is selected, which would obtain the lower ToA and the higher resistance to Doppler
    effect. In step 13, the Mobile ADR algorithm traverses all the [SF, BW] combinations
    as shown in Table 1, and then selects the [SF, BW] combination with the smallest
    ToA that satisfies both SNRreq and RSSIreq. For the adjustment of TP, the Mobile
    ADR algorithm adopts the same adjustment step as the standard ADR algorithm. When
    the SF decreases, the terminal node is moving to the area with good communication
    quality, so the TP is reduced. Otherwise, the TP is increased. The specific algorithm
    steps are shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (150KB) Download

    basis of Margin_db In a linear sensor network, nodes are linearly or semi-linearly
    arranged in a row, and information is transmitted to gateways through multiple
    hops. In order to avoid the communication interruption of the whole system caused
    by the failure of a certain node, each sending node of the system transmits information
    to two nodes adjacent in sequence to solve this problem in this research. Furthermore,
    in the monitoring scenario where the distance between nodes is much smaller than
    LoRa single hop, the network structure can be adjusted to transmit information
    to more nodes at the same time to improve the reliability and fault tolerance
    of the network. In addition, the system considered the existence of timeout detection
    function. If the previous node has not sent a message to the next two nodes within
    the set time, it proves that the previous node has failed. The latter neighboring
    node will replace this node as the initiator of information. The above-mentioned
    LoRa multi-hop transmission mode avoids data conflicts caused by simultaneous
    information transmission by multiple transmitters, reduces space–time capacity,
    and further improves the stability of the system. The software design of the system
    is described in detail from the following three aspects: low power consumption
    software design, medium access control protocol and node software flow. As shown
    in Fig. 4, three gateways and one mobile node are set up. According to the logarithmic
    distance path loss model, the distance from the node to the gateway is obtained
    by DTN (Dynamic Triangular) algorithm. First, according to the RSSI of the mobile
    node received by different gateways, the gateway with the largest RSSI is selected
    as the master gateway. Then, the distance from the gateway to the node is calculated
    according to Equation (8). And the mapping circle is drawn with the distance as
    the radius and the position of the master gateway as the center of the circle.
    Next, the right triangle is constructed by the connection line of the master gateway
    with mobile node and the tangent of the mobile node on the mapping circle, so
    that the mapping angle θ is obtained. Finally, through the mapping angle θ and
    , the coordinates of the mobile node on the mapping circle are traversed to find
    out. And the distances and are also found out by the coordinates of the mobile
    node with slave1 gateway and slave2 gateway. By calculating the errors of and
    , and , the coordinates of the mobile node with the minimum error are selected.

    node positioning. As mentioned above, the Doppler frequency offset is calculated
    from the frequency offset of the LoRa signal minus the frequency offset caused
    by chip heating. Petajajarvi et al. (Petajajarvi et al., 2017) introduced the
    coherence time ( ) and proved that there was a linear relationship between the
    node moving speed and the Doppler frequency shift. As shown in Equation (9), and
    the Doppler frequency formula also proved this conclusion. Therefore, the frequency
    offset of the LoRa SX1278 chip is actually tested in this paper. As shown in Fig.
    5, when 330 data packets were sent, the frequency offset tended to be stable and
    fluctuated at 1572 Hz. And the upper and lower frequencies of the fluctuation
    were fixed values, which were 1564 Hz and 1581 Hz. Therefore, the relationship
    between node movement speed and frequency offset is shown in Equation (10). (9)
    (10) where f is the frequency offset (Hz) of the LoRa signal, fd is the Doppler
    frequency offset (Hz), v is the movement speed (m/s), is the electromagnetic wave
    wavelength (m), and is the incident electromagnetic wave angle (rad). Download

    Mobile ADR algorithm proposed in this paper, the Mobile LoRaSim simulation tool
    was perfected for simulation testing and the Arduino + LoRa SX1278 platform was
    built for field testing. The performance of LoRaWAN networks based on standard
    ADR algorithm, Blind ADR algorithm and Mobile ADR algorithm is analysed and compared.
    4.1. Mobile LoRaSim simulation LoRaSim is a discrete event simulator based on
    SimPy to simulate data transmission and collision in LoRa networks (Kufakunesu
    et al., 2020). In this paper, the LoRasim simulation tool was perfected and called
    Mobile LoRaSim, making it possible to support simulation analysis of mobile nodes
    for the first time. In Mobile LoRaSim, a 500 m × 500 m simulation scenario was
    built, and gateway and different numbers of mobile nodes were arranged. For the
    moving node, the movement speed and movement direction of terminal node were set.
    In addition, the frequency offset was proposed for the first time in the LoRa
    simulation, which was used to simulate the change of the signal level caused by
    the different movement speed of the node. In order to study the LoRa communication
    of mobile nodes passing through different terrains, the terrain module of Mobile
    LoRaSim was set according to the slow fading path loss index of different terrains
    in Table 2, which is shown in Fig. 6. LoRaSim adjusted the same parameters for
    all nodes based on the communication quality. However, Mobile LoRaSim adjusted
    the parameters of each node individually based on the communication quality, which
    more realistically simulated the application of ADR algorithm in LoRaWAN. The

    Fig. 7. LoRasim simulation environment. Based on the terrain environment in Fig.
    6 and the simulation parameters in Table 3, the three simulation scenarios of
    low-density nodes, high-density nodes, and high-speed nodes were set by the mobile
    LoRa simulation tool. To avoid the accidental factor, the initial position of
    the node was the position with the lowest collision rate calculated by the algorithm.
    And the movement direction and movement speed of the moving node were random numbers
    in a certain range. The simulation time was set to 120 min for each simulation,
    and the simulation results were obtained through multiple simulation experiments.
    LoRaWAN network performance based on standard ADR, Blind ADR algorithm and Mobile
    ADR algorithm was evaluated in terms of Data Extraction Rate (DER), Data Collision
    Rate (DCR), Network Energy Consumption (NEC) and ToA. Table 3. Simulation parameters.

    Ten low to medium speed mobile nodes with a movement speed range of 1 m/s − 10
    m/s were deployed in the simulation scenario. The initial positions of all nodes
    were within a circle with a radius of 50 m, so the distribution of nodes was scattered.
    For the data collision rate (Fig. 8a), the standard ADR algorithm was about 5
    %, the Blind ADR algorithm was about 8 %. However, DCR of Mobile ADR algorithm
    is basically below 4 %, which was reduced by 3 % on average. For the data extraction
    rate (Fig. 8b), the standard ADR algorithm was about 80 %, while the average value
    of the Blind ADR algorithm was about 83 %, which showed a certain regularity.
    When the SF of the node is 12, DER of Blind ADR algorithm could reach 90 %, which
    meant that the packet loss was basically due to the collision of the packet while
    being received. However, when the SF of the node is 7, DER of Blind ADR algorithm
    fluctuated around 60 %, which was unqualified in the LoRa communication of low-speed
    and low-density mobile scenarios. DER of Mobile ADR algorithm was about 91 %,
    which was 11 % higher than the standard ADR. Because it not only reduced the packet
    collision rate, but also the number of packets selected and the margin_db value
    were dynamically changed, which improved the responsiveness of mobile node to
    changes in channel conditions. For the network energy consumption (Fig. 8c), the
    standard ADR algorithm was about 70 J. NEC of Blind ADR algorithm also had periodicity,
    and its energy consumption did not consider changes in actual channel conditions.
    NEC of Mobile ADR algorithm was about 33 J, and the energy consumption was reduced
    by 58 %. Download : Download high-res image (312KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. (a) Data collision rate; (b) data extraction rate; (c) network energy
    consumption. In the simulation scenario of low-speed and low-density nodes, the
    Mobile ADR algorithm has achieved a significant improvement in network energy
    consumption, which is worthy of attention. Because Mobile ADR algorithm adds ToA
    as the selection index of LoRa modulation parameters, when different [SF, BW]
    combinations with the same reception sensitivity are considered, the [SF, BW]
    combination with short ToA is preferentially selected. Mobile ADR algorithm also
    expands the selection range of BW. The BW of standard ADR algorithm is 125 kHz,
    while the maximum BW of Mobile ADR algorithm is 500 kHz. From Equation (6), the
    shortest ToA of Mobile ADR algorithm is only 1/4 of that of standard ADR algorithm
    when the SF is the same. When the BW is increased, the receiver sensitivity decreases
    and the TP increases. However, the energy consumption in the LoRa communication
    process is proportional to the ToA, and the Mobile ADR algorithm still greatly
    reduces the network energy consumption. 4.1.2. High-density nodes simulation Fifty
    low to medium speed mobile nodes with a movement speed range of 1 m/s − 10 m/s
    were deployed in the simulation scenario. The initial positions of all nodes were
    within a circle with a radius of 50 m, so the distribution of nodes was dense.
    For the data collision rate (Fig. 9a), when the density of node distribution was
    greatly increased, DCR of the three algorithms all increase. The standard ADR
    algorithm and the Blind ADR algorithm was increased by about 7 % on average, while
    the Mobile ADR algorithm was increased by 2 %. Compared with the standard ADR
    algorithm and Blind ADR algorithm, the collision growth rate of Mobile ADR algorithm
    was reduced by 70 %. For the data extraction rate (Fig. 9b), the standard ADR
    algorithm was about 69 %. The average extraction rate of Blind ADR algorithm was
    77 %, and the lowest value was below 55 %, which did not meet the application
    needs of mobile nodes. DER of Mobile ADR algorithm was about 88 %, which was an
    improvement of 18 % compared to the standard ADR algorithm. It showed that when
    the nodes are densely distributed, there was little impact on the communication
    quality of the Mobile ADR algorithm. In the network energy consumption (Fig. 9c),
    the standard ADR was about 350 J, and energy consumption of the Blind ADR algorithm
    was high in the first and last time periods. NEC of Mobile ADR algorithm was about
    160 J, which was an average reduction of about 59 %. Download : Download high-res
    image (318KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. (a) Data collision rate;
    (b) data extraction rate; (c) network energy consumption. In the simulation scenario
    of low-speed and high-density nodes, the Mobile ADR algorithm has achieved a significant
    reduction in data collision rate, which is worthy of attention. Because margin_db
    value of Mobile ADR algorithm is dynamically adjusted according to the distance
    between the node and the gateway, the change trend of the SNR value and the movement
    speed of the node. Therefore, if terminal nodes are at the same distance from
    the gateway and have the same RSSI and SNR, their [SF, BW] combinations are also
    different. In addition, the number of [SF, BW] combinations that can be selected
    by the Mobile ADR algorithm is 18, while the standard ADR algorithm is 6 and the
    Blind ADR algorithm is 1. Due to the orthogonality of different SFs (Marini et
    al., 2021), the data collision rate of Mobile ADR algorithm is greatly reduced.
    4.1.3. High-speed nodes simulation Ten high-speed mobile nodes with a movement
    speed range of 10 m/s − 20 m/s were deployed in the simulation scenario. The initial
    positions of all nodes were within a circle with a radius of 50 m, so the distribution
    of nodes was scattered. For the data collision rate (Fig. 10a), due to the fast
    movement speed of the nodes, the nodes were also scattered during the moving process,
    so the collision rates of the three algorithms were very low, all below 6 %. For
    the data extraction rate (Fig. 10b), the standard ADR algorithm was about 65 %.
    When the movement speed of nodes increased, the average extraction rate of Blind
    ADR algorithm was about 83 %, which was not affected. Because the modulation parameters
    were adjusted independently of the channel environment changes. Therefore, although
    the adjustment of modulation parameters by Blind ADR was inflexible, precise adjustment
    of different periods of modulation parameters could achieve excellent communication
    quality in specific scenarios. DER of Mobile ADR algorithm was about 90 %, which
    was a 25 % improvement over the standard ADR algorithm. For the network energy
    consumption (Fig. 10c), the standard ADR algorithm and Blind ADR algorithm did
    not change significantly when the speed of mobile nodes increased. The NEC of
    Mobile ADR algorithm increased by 17 J, but it was still lower than the standard
    ADR algorithm and Blind ADR algorithm. Because the Mobile ADR algorithm improved
    the frequency of adjusting the modulation parameters of the high-speed mobile
    nodes, and the current for each adjustment of the modulation parameters was 16
    mA, so the energy consumption had increased by a certain amount. Download : Download

    rate; (b) data extraction rate; (c) network energy consumption. In the simulation
    scenario of high-speed and low-density nodes, the Mobile ADR algorithm has achieved
    a significant improvement in data extraction rate, which is worthy of attention.
    When the channel conditions change rapidly, 20 packets are selected by the standard
    ADR algorithm as the adjustment basis, so the modulation parameters cannot be
    adjusted quickly. In the Mobile ADR algorithm, the degree of channel condition
    variation is used as the basis for calculation of margin_db, and the number of
    packets selected decreases as the node moves faster. When the speed exceeds 10
    m/s, the Mobile ADR algorithm adjusts the modulation parameters for each packet,
    so it can meet the application needs of high-speed mobile scenarios. 4.1.4. Real-time
    analysis As shown in Fig. 11, in the ToA, the Blind ADR algorithm showed periodicity
    with the change of SF, and the fluctuation range was large. The ToA of Mobile
    ADR algorithm was 55 % lower than the standard ADR algorithm. Therefore, the Mobile
    ADR algorithm improved the data rate of LoRa communication. According to the average
    value of ToA in the 3 groups of simulation scenarios and the duty cycle of 1 %,
    the number of packets transmitted by the mobile node in every 6 min was counted.
    As shown in Fig. 12, the average number of packets was about 22 for Blind ADR
    algorithms, and the average number of packets was about 13 for standard ADR algorithm,
    while the average number of packets was about 28 for Mobile ADR algorithm. Therefore,
    the Mobile ADR algorithm increased the number of packets transmitted in the same
    communication cycle, and improved the real-time communication of mobile nodes.

    platform evaluation The standard ADR algorithm, Blind ADR algorithm, and Mobile
    ADR algorithm were deployed on the hardware test platform and field tested at
    Northeast Agricultural University. The test platform included 3 gateways and 1
    terminal node. Raspberry Pi, Arduino and LoRa SX1278 were used as gateway, and
    Arduino and LoRa SX1278 were used as terminal node. The terminal node was installed

    sites were respectively set in the building corridor of 5 m × 60 m, around the
    building of 60 m × 100 m, and the open field of 200 m × 200 m. The initial modulation
    parameters of the terminal node were set to SF = 7, BW = 125, TP = 11. CR = 4/5,
    the duty cycle was 10 %. Within the corridor, the terminal node moved at low speeds
    of 0.5 m/s − 2 m/s. Between buildings, the terminal node moved at medium to high
    speed of 2 m/s − 11 m/s. In the field, the terminal node moved at medium to high
    speed of 2 m/s − 11 m/s. The location distribution of gateways and UAV flight

    time were used as evaluation metrics. The convergence time of LoRaWAN was defined
    as the time required for LoRa communication to reach stable SF, TP and DER after
    the initial deployment phase. As shown in Fig. 15, in three scenarios with different
    channel conditions, the average data extraction rate of the Mobile ADR algorithm
    was about 85 %, which had an average improvement of 13 % over the standard ADR
    algorithm and was less volatile than the Blind ADR algorithm. Moreover, when the
    mobile node was in a new radio channel condition, the average convergence time
    of the standard ADR algorithm was 720 s, while the Mobile ADR algorithm was 360
    s. Thanks to the faster and more accurate adjustment capability and higher real-time
    performance of the Mobile ADR algorithm, its convergence time was reduced by 50
    %. Download : Download high-res image (278KB) Download : Download full-size image

    at the problems that LoRa network in agricultural WSNs has low adaptive speed
    under standard ADR algorithm and poor network performance in mobile scenarios,
    the Mobile ADR algorithm proposed in this paper improved the ability to sense
    accurately and respond dynamically to changes in channel conditions, and sped
    up the configuration of modulation parameters. Therefore, the technical defects
    of the standard ADR algorithm on the mobile nodes were solved to some extent.
    The LoRaWAN network performance of different ADR algorithms in mobile scenarios
    were evaluated by simulation analysis and field tests. Compared with the standard
    ADR algorithm and the Blind ADR algorithm, the simulation results showed that
    the data extraction rate of the Mobile ADR algorithm was improved by 18 %, the
    network energy consumption was reduced by 45 %, and the time on air was reduced
    by 50 %. Field tests showed that in different geographic environments, the data
    extraction rate of the Mobile ADR algorithm was improved by 11 %, and the convergence
    time was reduced by 50 %. In particular, the data collision rate was introduced
    into this paper to analyse the ability of different algorithms to resist the ADR
    categorization effect. Data collision rate of the Mobile ADR algorithm was reduced
    by 5 %. Obviously, due to its higher reliability and lower latency, Mobile ADR
    algorithm was more suitable for LoRa networks in mobile scenarios than the standard
    ADR algorithm and the Blind ADR algorithm. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    2. Data Description Agricultural sector forms the core of Tanzania''s economic
    activity, employing over four out of five citizens and serving as their essential
    means of life [1]. Nearly one-third of Tanzania''s economic output, as measured
    by GDP, originates from agriculture, which also employs over two-thirds of the
    workforce [2]. Maize is among the dominant food and cash crops in the country,
    accounting for about 45 % of its farmland [3]. Despite its importance to Tanzania''s
    economy and food security, maize is hindered by diseases, specifically Maize Lethal
    Necrosis (MLN) and Maize Streak Virus (MSV), which highly affect its productivity
    [4,5]. Therefore, effective crop disease control strategies are essential for
    optimal productivity. Several management methods have been implemented for these
    diseases, including chemical treatment and human decisions based on physical observations.
    However, these methods are based on human judgments and considered unreliable
    with bias. On the other hand, deep learning tools have been developed to help
    stakeholders in agriculture and food systems to detect crop diseases early [6,7].
    This approach can assist in the early detection of maize diseases for proper management.
    However, developing deep learning tools requires enormous data, and Tanzania lacks
    an original dataset to facilitate model development. To address this issue, the
    dataset of maize leaf images was published in the Harvard repository in March
    2023 [8]. The dataset consisted of 18,148 images (Healthy = 5118; MSV = 6255;
    MLN = 3982) collected from February to July 2021. The dataset was reported to
    contains all possible instances however, it did not capture the data samples collected
    in all farming seasons. Therefore, this article presents an updated dataset of
    maize leaf images incorporating the missing farming season data. The updated dataset
    of 9356 images was divided into three classes (Healthy = 3073 images; MSV = 3052
    images; MLN = 3231 images) and published in an open-access repository on February
    22, 2023 [9]. The repository contains three separate zipped folders (HEALTHY.zip,
    MLN.zip, and MSV.zip) to allow users to download a specific file or all files
    simultaneously based on their preferences. HEALTHY.zip folder has 2.34 GB, MLN.zip
    folder has 2.23 GB and MSV.zip has 2.4 GB. A visual representation of the data

    3. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods 3.1. Data collection Data collection
    tool was installed on a smartphone (iPhone XS Max) and used to collect maize imagery
    leaves. The images were sent to the database for the quality check before data
    analysis as seen in Fig. 2. The data collection process involved farmers and experts
    from the Northern Tanzania, particularly the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute
    (TARI) and Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST)
    in Arusha. Maize imagery data were collected from TARI farms in Arusha from November
    2022 to January 2023. Site selection for data collection prioritized areas with
    readily available maize crops and demonstrable occurrences of MLN and MSV disease
    symptoms. The farms with diseased plants were identified with the help of plant
    pathologists and agricultural experts. Download : Download high-res image (162KB)

    process. 3.2. Data preprocessing The collected images were preprocessed, and this
    included data cleaning and labelling. VisiPics tool removed duplicate images from
    all three classes (Healthy, MSV, and MLN) [10]. The images were also labelled
    to correspond to the class name, i.e., HEALTHY_876.jpg, using the bulk rename
    utility. The dataset consists of images in Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPG)
    format in different sizes. Limitations The dataset presented in this article contains
    maize imagery leaves specifically collected in Arusha. The dataset is, however,
    limited to only two diseases: MLN and MSV. The main focus was to ensure the dataset
    contains high-quality imagery data which would otherwise lead to bias; therefore,
    the dataset is limited to images acquired under well-lit conditions and excludes
    those captured with low-quality smartphone cameras. Future datasets can explore
    the possibility of including other regions in Tanzania not covered during the
    data collection and incorporating other maize diseases affecting productivity.

    mechanismSmart agricultureMachine learning 1. Introduction Aquatic animals are
    vital for ecosystems, providing food and economic value while maintaining balance
    (Heino et al., 2021). Throughout the lifecycle of aquatic animals, they undergo
    a range of environmental stimuli and interactions with aquatic animals, commonly
    referred to as adversity stress factors (Zhang et al., 2019). Within the realm
    of aquaculture, temperature, and salinity, recognized as two pivotal adversity
    factors, wield a direct influence over the survival and viability of aquatic products
    (Hutson et al., 2022). In the context of transportation, the variables of presence,
    absence, and low temperature, identified as the primary adversity factors (Zhang
    et al., 2020), are inclined to trigger stress responses in aquatic products. Such
    responses notably impact both the safety and the nutritional quality of these
    aquatic offerings. The conventional approach presently employed involves assessing
    the biochemical markers to understand the life traits of aquatic products (López-López
    and Sedeño-Díaz, 2015). While this approach boasts stability, it grapples with
    issues of time consumption, labor intensiveness, and inefficiency. Consequently,
    an increasing body of research is focused on incorporating sensors into the realm
    of health assessment for aquatic animals. Amid the era of Industry 4.0, the assessment
    of aquatic animal health has advanced to an intelligent perceptual level. Researchers
    have made strides in two key avenues. First, they''ve explored underwater tactile
    sensors and in-situ glucose/cortisol monitoring sensors that can signal and alert
    aquatic animals to adversity stress, encompassing a range of adaptable sensing
    systems. Second, there''s a growing focus on environmental stimuli, such as water
    quality microelement content (Vanderzwalmen et al., 2021), oxygen gas concentration
    shifts (Feng et al., 2022), and temperature and humidity fluctuations (Boaventura
    et al., 2021), which serve as indicators of potential life deterioration in animals.
    Natural and material sciences have boosted flexible electronic tech in detecting
    living organisms'' health (Wang et al., 2021, Qiu et al., 2020). However, conventional
    flexible sensing systems have predominantly been single-mode setups, intended
    to capture specific reactions of sensing materials to external triggers. Yet,
    when addressing intricate scenarios like multi-parameter assessment amidst the
    stress experienced by aquatic animals, deploying multiple sensors based on target
    analytes becomes imperative. This, however, invariably escalates system intricacy
    and introduces challenges related to wearable comfort (Duan et al., 2022). In
    response, the concept of a flexible multimodal sensing system emerges, capable
    of concurrently capturing data from various parameters within a confined space
    (Zhang et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2023). This approach not only addresses these
    challenges but also holds significant potential for streamlined system integration.
    The common method for creating flexible multimodal sensors involves combining
    different sensitive materials to create various electrical signals (Pyo et al.,
    2021, Cai et al., 2022). However, these multi-material systems tend to be intricate
    in terms of structural engineering and preparation processes (Nazir et al., 2023).
    Integrating multiple sensing units into a single platform using methods like lay-flat
    or lamination invariably triggers challenges pertaining to interfacial stability
    among materials. Simultaneously, the dependability of electrode connections and
    the meticulousness of device packaging are concerns that can easily go unnoticed
    (Yang et al., 2022). Moreover, in the operational realm of multimodal sensors,
    the coexistence of multiple target input signals can impede the precise measurement
    of said signals due to signal coupling (Zhao et al., 2022). Given this, there
    exists substantial value in investigating the comprehensive device architecture
    of flexible multimodal sensor devices (Gao et al., 2020). This includes an analysis
    of their multiplexed sensing mechanisms and the principles of decoupling. Such
    an exploration holds the potential to enhance measurement accuracy and bolster
    the environmental stability of sensing systems. Furthermore, combining the flexible
    system with modeling algorithms can provide crucial insights for precise monitoring
    of aquatic animals dealing with stress from adversity. This paper aims to clarify
    how flexible multimodal sensing technology can be applied in smart fishery detection.
    By analyzing the existing work, a comprehensive analysis and in-depth discussion
    are conducted so as to focus on the further integration and synergistic optimization
    of these two important fields. It also aims to help researchers and stakeholders
    better grasp the crucial role of flexible sensing technology throughout the fisheries
    life cycle. The primary contributions of this paper are outlined as follows. First,
    it conducts a comprehensive analysis of parameters that define the health status
    of aquatic animals in various application scenarios (Fig. 1a). Next, it delves
    into examining the flexible multimodal sensing mechanism for parameter detection
    and conducts a thorough analysis of the decoupling principle within the flexible
    multimodal sensing system (Fig. 1b). Lastly, the paper presents a detailed introduction
    to information fusion and decision-making process modeling based on multi-scale
    parameter inputs (Fig. 1c). Download : Download high-res image (218KB) Download

    quality which will be discussed in Section 2. (b) Explore the preparation requirements
    of flexible multi-modal sensor devices, and analyze its multi-channel sensing
    mechanism and decoupling principle, which will be discussed in Section 3. (c)
    Import the data collected by the flexible system into the prior model, establish
    a correlation analysis model between the data and the biochemical indicators of
    aquatic animals, and invert the health status of aquatic animals through the deep
    learning model, which will be discussed in Section 4. 2. Evaluation system of
    stress/health indicators for aquatic animals Before preparing and applying suitable
    flexible sensors, it''s crucial to specify the parameters that characterize the
    health of aquatic animals. These indicators cover both internal and external aspects.
    Internal indicators pertain to the biochemical markers of aquatic animals, with
    blood glucose concentration and cortisol levels (Gronquist and Berges, 2013) being
    the most typical representatives. Conditions like overcrowding and poor water
    quality can lead to deviations in these biochemical indicators (Peres et al.,
    2014). External indicators, on the other hand, encompass physiological markers
    such as respiration rate and observable behavioral changes. While the former offers
    an intuitive reflection of stress levels, its data collection poses challenges.
    The latter, though indicative of stress intensity, lacks quantitative measurability
    (Li et al., 2022). This study focuses on environmental stressors'' impact on aquatic
    animals. Consequently, the characterization parameters (CPRs) for aquatic animal
    health status have been restructured into three distinct categories: biochemical,
    physiological, and environmental parameters, as illustrated in Fig. 2. It also
    conducts a comprehensive risk analysis following HACCP principles (as shown in
    Table 1) across the entire animal process (Pierson, 2012). Additionally, it outlines
    measurement scenarios and associated parameter ranges. Download : Download high-res

    control III 2.1. Biochemical parameter Biochemical parameters mainly include blood
    glucose (GLU), cortisol (GOR), myoglycogen (GLY), and lactate (LA) in aquatic
    animals. These indicators decrease rapidly during adversity stress, helping the
    organism defend against external factors (Wang et al., 2022). If transport stress
    exceeds the organism''s tolerance, these values can significantly increase, causing
    partial irreversible damage. Usually, these indicators are measured directly using
    various instruments (Hook et al., 2014). 2.2. Physiological parameter Physiological
    parameters in aquatic animals include observable markers like respiratory rate,
    respiratory angle amplitude, and abnormal behaviors. During intense stress, animals
    show noticeable behavior changes like jumping, tail swinging, and flipping, followed
    by increased respiration rates. Traditional measurement methods rely on manual
    observation, which isn''t suitable for widespread use. In contrast, flexible sensing
    technology, due to its favorable biocompatibility, can be attached to aquatic
    animals'' surfaces. This allows quick detection of abnormal behaviors, offering
    a more accurate assessment of their physiological state. 2.3. Environmental parameter
    Environmental parameters cover elements like temperature, humidity, microelements,
    and gases in both culture and transport settings. Physical factors such as light
    and vibration intensity are also considered. Among these, temperature significantly
    affects aquatic animals'' physiological state. Prolonged exposure to low temperatures
    can damage tissues, leading to increased serum indicators like cortisol and cholesterol
    (Fırat et al., 2011). Concurrently, temperature fluctuations contribute to the
    accrual of humidity levels. The cumulative elevation of microelement concentrations
    within water quality significantly influences the aquatic animals'' habitat, thereby
    engendering anomalous physiological markers. Moreover, other parameters like light
    intensity and vibration may precipitate episodes of acute stress within aquatic
    animals (Jones et al., 2022). 3. Flexible multimode sensing mechanisms and decoupling
    principles for parameter sensing 3.1. Flexible multimode sensing mechanisms 3.1.1.
    Flexible sensing technology characterizes aquatic animal health detection The
    crucial parameters for aquatic organisms mainly include blood glucose levels,
    ECG signals, and behavioral traits (like activity levels and tail swing frequency).
    Fluctuations in these parameters offer insights into their overall health (Huang
    et al., 2019). The methodologies employed for detecting life characteristic parameters
    are notably diverse. One category hinges on traditional rigid processing circuits,
    integrating specialized detection electrode systems or online monitoring apparatus
    to facilitate real-time data collection of vital information like blood glucose
    and ECG signals within aquatic animals (Ren et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2021).
    This approach capitalizes on the well-established maturity and stability of rigid
    circuit technology, consequently yielding data that is often more precise. However,
    this method unavoidably grapples with concerns like functional impairment, interference
    with normal activities, and heightened power consumption by the animals. The evolution
    of flexible electronic technology has presented a viable avenue for addressing
    these challenges. For instance, the team led by Wang pioneered a fully flexible
    wearable platform designed for underwater energy harvesting and fish behavior
    monitoring. This innovative platform employs a wireless communication system to
    capture fish swing angles, frequencies, and even postures (Wang et al., 2022).
    Similarly, Cheng et al. devised a high-resolution haptic sensing array serving
    as a wearable biomechanical tag, enabling continuous recording and analysis of
    varied behavioral activities in aquatic animals (Cheng et al., 2022). These flexible
    devices confer significant advantages to the field of aquatic bio-physiology research
    due to their biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and environmental stability.
    However, they do grapple with complex fabrication processes, elevated material
    costs, single-device functionality, and the prerequisite for intricate data processing
    algorithms. These challenges demand immediate attention and resolution. Furthermore,
    researchers have made notable strides in the development of fiber-optic temperature-depth
    salinity (CTD) sensors for underwater multi-parameter monitoring, with the foundation
    being optical sensing. A comprehensive review of domestic and international research
    demonstrates a predominant focus on various types of fiber grating, fiber interferometer,
    and fiber surface plasmon resonance (SPR) CTD sensors (Qian et al., 2018). Notably,
    flexible sensing technologies have found application in CTD monitoring as well.
    Techniques like laser engraving (Nag et al., 2017) and magnetron sputtering (Li
    et al., 2022) have been employed to create cost-effective, compact, and easily
    integrable underwater sensor devices. These devices function effectively under
    substantial hydrostatic pressures and in high-salinity environments, significantly
    diminishing both system power consumption and geometry. For a detailed comparison
    of the advantages and drawbacks of flexible technology and other alternatives
    in terms of detecting environmental and life feature parameters in aquatic animals,

    health detection The working mechanisms of flexible sensors for environmental
    and physiological indicator monitoring (Fig. 3a) usually include electrical (resistive,
    capacitive, and piezoelectric), optical, and electromagnetic mechanisms (Alam
    et al., 2020), which are also applicable to aquatic animals. Attaining high-resolution
    and high-sensitivity responses to external stimuli requires meticulous material
    (Fig. 3b) and structural (Fig. 3c) design. Recently, flexible sensing systems
    for aquatic animal health detection have progressed from simple physical parameters
    to more complex environmental and physiological parameters (Fig. 3d). Download

    application of flexible sensors in the field of aquatic animal detection. 3.1.3.
    Sensing mechanism Among the myriad signals inherent in nature, temperature and
    force assume pivotal roles in daily life due to their direct or indirect capacity
    to characterize shifts in environmental and physiological states (Miao et al.,
    2019, Han et al., 2019). Mechanical deformation stands as a foundational physical
    parameter within living environments. Of the diverse forms scrutinized within
    flexible electronic systems, tensile strain, pressure, and bending have emerged
    as most thoroughly examined. For aquatic animals, a spectrum of signals can be
    monitored, encompassing their physiological electrical signals (like EEG, EMG,
    ECG), biophysical cues (such as body temperature, respiratory rhythm, haptics),
    and biochemical markers (including blood glucose, cortisol, pH). To illustrate,
    body and caudal fin movements can be employed as vital benchmarks for animal behavioral
    investigations, continuously captured using strain (haptic) sensor devices. Concurrently,
    the monitoring of skin temperature, aquatic environment temperature, and salinity
    is imperative, given their profound influence on the growth, development, and
    metabolic processes of aquatic organisms (Nassaj-Bokharaei et al., 2021). Strain
    and pressure sensing commonly use piezoresistive, piezoelectric, friction electric,
    and capacitive effects. Temperature sensing, on the other hand, relies on mechanisms
    such as thermoresistive, pyroelectric, thermocapacitive, and thermal expansion
    effects. Physiological signals are often detected through optoelectronic, electrochemical,
    and changes in resistance and capacitance of specific materials when exposed to
    external stimuli (Duan et al., 2020, Xie et al., 2019). Efforts to achieve synchronized
    responses to varied stimuli have spurred exploration into combining two or three
    types of mechanisms. This includes methods involving electrical signals, as well
    as optical and magnetic signals, and joint studies of electrical and optical/magnetic
    signals. 3.1.4. Materials and structures The successful design of flexible multimodal
    sensors necessitates a harmonious amalgamation of material selection, mechanism
    integration, structural design, and sensor fabrication processes. This integration
    taps into functional materials to achieve intended functionalities, especially
    challenging when dealing with aquatic animals'' unique demands. The design should
    focus primarily on sensing materials and structures. Innovative structures using
    familiar materials and new functional materials in traditional setups are crucial.
    Materials like MXene, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and aerogels are core elements
    in flexible multimodal systems due to their outstanding properties. Since some
    devices directly interact with aquatic animals, material safety and corrosion
    resistance become crucial. PDMS, known for its biocompatibility, breathability,
    and non-toxicity, becomes the preferred substrate material in such scenarios.
    Furthermore, effective structural designs include multifaceted approaches such
    as multilayered functional membranes, multi-pixel layouts, porous microstructures,
    serpentine structures, origami (or open mesh), fabrics, fibers, 3D structures,
    and the convergence of these with micro-patterns (Yun et al., 2018, Hu et al.,
    2019). An array of desirable attributes can be attained through adept structural
    design, and the preparation of flexible multimodal sensing systems employs individual
    or hybrid processes. For instance, a gamut of manufacturing tools—ranging from
    photolithography, spraying, spin-coating, and self-assembly to vapor-phase deposition,
    laser direct writing, electrospinning, and various printing techniques (including
    screen-printing, transfer-printing, and 3D printing)—has found extensive application
    in crafting these systems (Xie et al., 2019, Li et al., 2022). However, despite
    advancements, scalable fabrication and commercial deployment of flexible systems
    remain modest, necessitating future enhancement of fabrication methodologies,
    both traditional and novel, involving chemical and mechanical techniques (Hong
    et al., 2017). 3.1.5. Application scenario In diverse contexts like aquatic animal
    farming, transportation with or without water, and marketing, literature has highlighted
    a range of flexible multimodal sensors. These sensors include physical, chemical,
    and physiological sensing units. These devices incorporate sensing mechanisms,
    structural blueprints, and fabrication methods. The essential components of flexible
    multimodal devices often include physical sensing units like strain, temperature,
    and humidity sensors as central elements. Additionally, chemical and physiological
    sensors serve as supplementary units. Table 3 presents a compilation of diverse
    flexible multimodal sensor devices that harness physical, chemical, and physiological
    attributes. Table 3. Summary of Flexible Multimodal Sensor Devices. Category Response

    Pencil drawing (Xu et al., 2020) Numerous flexible sensing systems tailored for
    aquatic animal detection have emerged. Fig. 4(a) and (b) illustrate flexible sensing
    systems designed for fish pH and impedance information detection, respectively
    (Mu et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2023). These systems are adept at direct attachment
    to the aquatic animals'' surfaces to capture pertinent information. However, the
    limitation of single-mode systems lies in their ability to discern only a solitary
    parameter, failing to furnish comprehensive insights to guide the health assessment
    of aquatic organisms. Download : Download high-res image (519KB) Download : Download

    2018). (f) Flexible multimode sensing systems for “psycho-behavioural-environmental”
    information detection in live fish (Yang et al., 2021). To address this issue,
    the research team investigated an advanced physiological-environmental flexible
    multimodal system. This system comprises stretchable electrodes at the forefront
    and FPCB circuits at the rear, specifically designed for attachment to sturgeon
    gills. This pioneering system continuously monitors respiratory indicators, temperature,
    and humidity of sturgeons. This amalgamation affords effective diagnosis of stress
    levels in sturgeons (depicted in Fig. 4(c)) (Xia et al., 2023). Furthermore, a
    groundbreaking non-invasive blood glucose sensor (BGL) has been crafted for turbot,
    operating through skin mucus (Zhang et al., 2023). This wearable stress detector
    offers real-time insights into the health status of live fish, bridging the gap
    left by traditional invasive biochemical tests (as showcased in Fig. 4(d)). Advancements
    in optoelectronic components have precipitated the reduction in size of the flexible
    multimode system. This enables the potential for in vivo implantation in aquatic
    animals, facilitated by the system''s adaptability to the optical complexities
    of animal tissues (illustrated in Fig. 4(e)) (Lee et al., 2018). The world''s
    inaugural flexible multimode sensing system has been introduced, merging psychological,
    behavioral, and environmental parameters. This innovation boasts the capacity
    for wireless communication underwater, with a reach of 400 m, and sustains functionality
    for 8 months (Yang et al., 2021). The main argument emphasizes the significant
    advantage of the flexible multimode system over its single-mode counterpart. Shifting
    the research focus from “one system to one outcome” to “one system to multiple
    outcomes” enables simultaneous detection and analysis of various parameters. This
    enhances the understanding of detailed health intricacies, marking a crucial stride
    toward advancing animal health diagnostics into a new era. 3.2. Principles of
    flexible multimodal decoupling As discussed in the preceding section, flexible
    multimodal sensors capable of simultaneous multi-parameter sensing have found
    diverse applications in aquatic animal health detection. Nonetheless, the presence
    of cross-sensitivity poses challenges to the precision and dependability of measurements
    when multiple target input signals are concurrently present. In addressing this
    concern, the selection of multifunctional materials and the design of sensor structures
    emerge as pivotal factors in crafting multimodal sensors with distinct sensing
    mechanisms. The material-oriented perspective enables the achievement of multimodal
    decoupling via a solitary sensing unit composed of innovative functional materials.
    Selective signaling is accomplished through the modulation of concentration thresholds,
    morphological structures, and response mechanisms of the materials. Moreover,
    a combination of these features and an exploration into the characteristics of
    output curves themselves further enhance the approach. For instance, in Fig. 5a,
    an interlocked quasi-hemispherical micropatterned electronic skin is depicted,
    utilizing single-walled carbon nanotubes and thermoplastic polyurethanes. This
    configuration exhibits swift responsiveness to pressure changes and a more gradual
    response to temperature shifts. This difference in behavior enables pressure determination
    based on rapid resistance changes, while additional resistance variations after
    the curve''s inflection point provide insights into temperature changes (Zhang
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (422KB) Download : Download

    decoupling methods. (a) (b) (c) Flexible multimodal sensing decoupling strategies

    (d) (e) (f) Flexible multimode sensing decoupling strategy under miniature innovative
    structures (Jung et al., 2017, Zhu et al., 2019, Luo et al., 2021). (g) (h) Flexible
    multimode sensing decoupling strategy based on electrical signal calibration (Lei
    and Wu, 2018, Ma et al., 2020). Another notable example involves immersing PEDOT:
    PSS into a porous polyurethane microstructure, creating a dual-mode sensor for
    temperature and pressure detection (Fig. 5b). The I-V output curve''s slope relative
    to the intercept generates two distinct outputs, effectively decoupling the two
    input signals (Zhang et al., 2015). In tackling the challenge of multiple input
    parameter crosstalk, the deliberate design of material response mechanisms proves
    effective. Take, for instance, the utilization of K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] solutions
    with thermocurrent properties for temperature sensing. By combining these solutions
    with two conductive plates, it becomes possible to gauge the force generated via
    reverse electrical wetting under pressure (Fig. 5c). The thermo-current characteristics
    enable direct voltage changes in response to temperature shifts, while pressure
    sensing relies on alternating pulse voltage inducing droplet shape changes and
    reverse electrical wetting, enabling simultaneous temperature and pressure measurement
    via direct and pulsed voltage readings (Liu et al., 2016). One common structural
    strategy integrates various sensing units or electrode patterns into a platform
    using tiling or laminating. Existing literature falls into two main categories:
    One solely analyzes sensor performance parameters under different stimuli but
    lacks exploration of coupling and crosstalk among these parameters. The other
    effectively separates dual-mode physical parameters using sensitive materials
    with distinct responses and well-planned sensing mechanisms, organized logically
    within the layout of the sensing units. Temperature sensors constructed from poly
    (ethylenedioxythiophene) - poly (styrenesulfonate) and silver nanoparticle composites
    generate thermoelectric voltages in thermocouples, while miniature pyramid pressure
    sensors exhibit resistance changes due to contact area variations caused by pressure
    (Fig. 5d) (Jung et al., 2017). Notably, even when both temperature and pressure
    are concurrently applied to the sensing platform, the distinct sensing mechanisms
    effectively eliminate crosstalk. A similar example involves employing thermoelectric
    materials as temperature sensing electrodes and piezoelectric materials for pressure
    sensing, effectively decoupling the two modes (Fig. 5f). The thermoelectric and
    piezoelectric layers remain independent of each other (Zhu et al., 2019). Moreover,
    beyond leveraging different sensing mechanisms and response parameters attributed
    to distinct materials, the same materials can also be fashioned into diverse structures
    to mitigate crosstalk. As demonstrated by the tri-modal flexible sensors in Fig.
    5e, multi-pixel and serpentine interconnect structures were printed onto PET and
    PI films as electrode layers. This approach minimizes crosstalk while retaining
    a compact configuration by integrating fully printed heterogeneous sensing units
    (Luo et al., 2021). In scenarios where completely mitigating cross-sensitivity
    between different modalities proves challenging through material advancements
    and structural amalgamations, the necessity for decoupling persists. This is achieved
    through electrical signal calibration. For instance, consider a setup involving
    a chitosan-based dielectric layer placed between an upper ITO electrode and a
    lower PDMS microcone electrode coated with Au. In this configuration, pressure-induced
    deformation on the microcone alters the interfacial contact area, resulting in
    a linear capacitance reaction. Simultaneously, an increase in temperature boosts
    the population and mobility of free ions, leading to a linear increase in capacitance.
    Using linear interpolation, all potential combinations of Cf1 and Cf2—corresponding
    to varying pressures and temperatures—can be derived (Fig. 5g). Consequently,
    the applied temperature and pressure become ascertainable through a three-dimensional
    data surface (Lei and Wu, 2018). Thermally resistive stretchable electrodes in
    capacitive sensors allow the decoupling of temperature and strain. By incorporating
    a conductive NaCl solution into a hydrogel, stretchable electrodes detect strain-induced
    changes in capacitor gap due to pressure, alongside temperature-induced variations
    in ionic resistance (Fig. 5h). Notably, temperature changes do not affect capacitance
    measurements, enabling the initial assessment of strain. The hydrogel''s ionic
    resistance decreases with increased temperature of the ionic liquid and electronic
    conductor, while it increases due to electrode expansion caused by strain. The
    strain determined from the capacitance reading can be substituted into the resistance
    calibration curve for deriving the alteration in temperature within the application
    context (Ma et al., 2020). 4. Modelling method for a flexible multimode system
    for aquatic animal health detection 4.1. Modelling methods for aquatic animal
    health detection Various modeling approaches are employed for detecting aquatic
    animal health issues, including both traditional machine learning algorithms (ML)
    (Patel et al., 2022) and more advanced deep learning algorithms (DL) (Mahesh,
    2020, Patel and Sharaff, 2023). Traditional machine learning encompasses classical
    techniques like multilayer perceptrons and support vector machines (Maroco et
    al., 2011). On the other hand, deep learning involves a range of neural network
    algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks,
    and recurrent neural networks (Zuo et al., 2022). Researchers select the most
    suitable intelligent algorithm based on specific scenario characteristics (Patel
    and Sharaff, 2023, Patel and Sharaff, 2020). Typically, an 8:2 ratio between training
    and test sets is used, with evaluation metrics like R2, EMSE, and MAP values being
    employed to assess the model''s performance (Fig. 6a). Download : Download high-res

    data collected by flexible multimodal systems and aquatic animal health through
    deep learning modelling methods. (b) Various deep learning algorithms (Feng et
    al., 2022, Zuo et al., 2022, Zambrano et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2021). (c) Procedures
    for characterising aquatic animal health status with flexible sensors. In the
    context of aquatic animal health detection, modeling algorithms are primarily
    used to analyze microenvironmental parameter data (Fig. 6b) since biochemical
    indicators provide direct insights into the animals'' health status. For instance,
    in desiccated transport scenarios, the GA-ARMA algorithm collects temperature,
    humidity, and gas concentration data, indirectly reflecting the health of live
    fish and improving transportation management (Feng et al., 2022). Artificial neural
    network algorithms continuously monitor parameters like dissolved oxygen levels,
    pH, and water temperature in fish pond water, predicting future environmental
    conditions (Zambrano et al., 2021). An improved random forest algorithm processes
    data from multiple sensors to effectively analyze the chemical and physical traits
    of fish (Wei et al., 2021). Moreover, a stress level assessment model rooted in
    environmental and stress indicators can be developed through the CNN-SVM algorithm
    (Zuo et al., 2022). This model aids in predicting trends in key salmon indicators,
    facilitating accurate diagnoses of salmon health status. Importantly, researchers
    have moved beyond single-model approaches, opting instead to combine multiple
    deep learning algorithms (Patel and Sharaff, 2023). This fusion not only enhances
    prediction precision and accuracy but also provides access to more valuable information.
    4.2. Total integration of flexible multimode sensing systems Flexible multimode
    sensing technology aims to comprehensively evaluate various signals in aquatic
    animals, targeting stress indicators and micro-stress indicators. This involves
    analyzing and selecting suitable stress indicators, designing corresponding equipment,
    and creating data fusion methods for quantitative assessments of animal health.
    This approach also facilitates a comprehensive evaluation and online management
    of their living environment. The degradation of aquatic animal life characteristics
    is complex, involving multiscale changes across time and space. Signals related
    to this decay are diverse, weak, and overlapping, posing challenges for modeling
    due to non-linearity, high internal resistance, and multiple interfering factors.
    Identifying effective indicators for characterizing aquatic animal health becomes
    crucial. Subsequently, an analytical model establishing the correlation between
    the flexible system''s measured values and the indicators must be developed. This
    leads to the inversion of the health state of aquatic animals through a predefined
    model (Fig. 6c). The decay of aquatic organisms'' life characteristics spans various
    scales, from cells to individuals. Measured values from the flexible sensing system
    capture changes in parameters like blood glucose and cortisol levels. Simultaneously,
    the vitality of aquatic organisms diminishes due to adverse stress and external
    factors such as temperature, humidity, oxygen, carbon dioxide levels, pH, salinity,
    and transport vibrations. A deep learning model capable of incorporating multi-temporal
    and spatial scale coupling characteristics can be established based on these indicators,
    as outlined in Table 4. Table 4. Dynamic modeling methods for aquatic animal health

    (Feng et al., 2021) 5. Conclusions and future prospects As previously discussed,
    the remarkable attribute of flexible multimode sensors is their capability to
    gather diverse information from both the internal and external environments of
    aquatic animals. This data connectivity opens up avenues for establishing functional
    links between aquatic life and human observers through internet transmission.
    Integrating sensing principles with deep learning techniques offers promising
    prospects for enhancing and broadening the utility of these systems. However,
    it''s essential to note that despite advancements in labs, much of the research
    on these sensors remains in experimental stages. The shift towards real-world
    commercial applications is a significant endeavor. Looking forward, advancements
    in aquatic animal health monitoring via flexible multimode sensors may emphasize
    technological innovation and system integration. Improving reliability and stability
    in complex aquatic conditions is crucial. System integration aims to process and
    apply sensor data effectively. Managing extensive sensor data requires reducing
    coupling crosstalk and using smarter algorithms for analysis and prediction. Overall,
    the evolution of flexible multimode sensing systems is poised to offer comprehensive
    solutions for monitoring aquatic animal health. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: India's agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem
    output. Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making
    effective use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with
    IoT enabled are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques

    (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. In the second step, crop images acquired
    from sensors for disease prediction are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian
    Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement
    of image. Pre-processed images are then fed into ResNet50 for feature extraction
    and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather
    conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by
    the systems. On the other hand, regarding the information about horrible conditions
    and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers.
    The proposed method is tested with several metrics which attain better performance
    like 94% accuracy for weather forecasting and 98% accuracy for field monitoring.
    Thus the proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support farmers to achieve

    monitoringGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 1. Introduction India has agriculture as
    its primary occupation. IBEF (Indian Brand Enquiry Foundation) estimates that
    58 % of Indians who live in rural areas depend on agriculture. Not only in underdeveloped
    countries but also in many industrialised countries, farming and agriculture make
    up a significant component of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (Karthick et al., 2018).
    As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. It will
    help handle global catastrophes like climate change and epidemics like draught
    in addition to fostering the flourishing sustainable development of people, flora,
    and fauna (Lavanya et al., 2020). Farmers still use traditional methods such as
    manual field monitoring, which involves often watering crops and applying pesticides
    to manage pests, whether or not they are aware of the appropriate dosage. These
    old methods include disadvantages such as water logging in fields, excessive use
    of pesticides and fungicides, lack of knowledge about the kind of crops that need
    to be cultivated for a certain type of soil fertility, and lower yields than anticipated
    from the agricultural area (AshifuddinMondal & Rehena, 2018). Many farmers continue
    to cultivate using traditional techniques, which leads to low crop yields (Sushanth
    & Sujatha, 2018). Better technology will increase yield, hence reducing the likelihood
    of famine and malnutrition. The technology should be inexpensive enough that it
    can have an influence on billions of people worldwide (Ogunti, 2019; Karthick
    & Muthukumaran, 2023). Monitoring of the soil, plants, moisture, and temperature,
    as well as the management of the infrastructure and control systems, are all necessary
    for agricultural production. IoT is essential in the sector of agriculture (Thakur
    et al., 2020). Since they are utilised to offer information about agricultural
    areas, all Internet of Things sensors is quite effective. A smart agriculture
    stick advertises the novel smart agriculture programme based on IoT that enables
    farmers to have access to real-time data to track how the environment is operating,
    enabling them to engage in smart farming, increase their final yield, and ensure
    that their product meets quality standards (Phasinam et al., 2022). A wireless
    sensor network is used by this advanced agricultural monitoring system to gather
    data from a number of sensors placed at various junctions. A great amount of data
    can be analysed using such technology in precision farming after being collected
    by WSN (Khanna & Kaur, 2019). It enables farmers to boost yields while using fewer
    resources. In industrialised countries, smart framing is being carried out on
    a wide scale combining IoT, AI, and agriculture data analysis (Goel et al., 2021).
    The Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture system demonstrated that
    distant sensors are used to monitor inside settings and that micro-scale controllers
    are utilised to control and operate indoor and remote sensing systems, including
    those that take pictures and videos and even use cameras (Panda & Bhatnagar, 2020).
    Farmers may monitor and manage the microclimate in the greenhouse, as well as
    illnesses and pests that impact the plants, with the aid of precision farming
    (Arora et al., 2021). The status of the plants can be impacted by a variety of
    external elements and microclimatic interior occurrences (Gunjan et al., 2022).
    Plant development and the spread of some diseases are both impacted by temperature
    and relative humidity (Daya Sagar et al., 2023). In terms of the effectiveness
    of greenhouses, it is one of the most detrimental agricultural production illnesses
    (Cambra et al., 2018). When ambient and micro-indoor conditions are favourable,
    controlling the irrigation of water quality is easier. When growing crops in greenhouses,
    it is essential to apply the appropriate fertiliser treatments or drip system
    cleanser at the appropriate time and location (Siddiquee et al., 2022). Understanding
    the stage of the production cycle at which specific nutrient solutions should
    be used is essential (Sai Surya Teja et al., 2023). The purpose of this paper
    is to make automated and continuous field monitoring for smart agriculture using
    IoT and deep learning technologies (Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). The main contribution
    of the proposed work is given below: • Automated and efficient field monitoring
    model is designed through combining IoT and deep learning technology to support
    farmers in achieving higher crop production. • Sensors are assembled in an agricultural
    field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit it to cloud
    server for further analysis purposes. • Normalization and missing value imputation
    are used as data pre-processing techniques and GRU is used to forecast weather
    and soil conditions based on the acquired data. • Adaptive Gaussian filter and
    dynamic histogram equalization are used as image pre-processing techniques and
    CNN is used to detect the presence of disease using pre-processed crop image.
    • Alert SMS are sent to farmers regarding the horrible weather condition and diseases
    to render control action. Rest of the paper contains: Section 2 presents the literature
    review related to automated field monitoring. In Section 3 proposed methodology
    and architecture of the proposed methodology are given. Result and discussion
    part of the proposed methodology is given in Section 4. At last, Section 5 contains
    the conclusion part. 2. Literature review Several techniques for automatic forecasting
    of weather and field monitoring had been developed. The following section examines
    some of the current approaches utilized for weather forecasting and crop disease
    prediction in smart agriculture. (a) Weather and irrigation monitoring system
    An IoT-based smart irrigation management system combining machine learning and
    open source technology has been proposed by Goap et al. (2018). The proposed system''s
    intelligence is based on a smart algorithm that considers sensory data as well
    as elements of the short-term weather forecast, such as precipitation, air temperature,
    humidity, and UV. But the system cost of this suggested approach is high. Velmurugan
    (2020) have suggested a smart system that uses open-source technologies to forecast
    how much irrigation is needed for a given field. The entire system has been created
    and is currently being tested on a small-scale pilot project. Web-based information
    visualisation and decision support systems are used to wirelessly gather sensor
    node data via the cloud, and they deliver real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensor and weather forecast data. Singh et al. (2019) have
    suggested In an IoT-driven smart irrigation framework, machine learning techniques
    are used to maximise the irrigation water use by forecasting the future soil moisture
    of a field. The performance of various ML techniques is tested for predicting
    future soil moisture, and the GBRT outcomes are quite encouraging. Rani et al.
    (2020) have suggested a machine learning and neural networks-based flood monitoring
    system using IoT. This research outlines an efficient and adaptable technique
    for flood and system-altering system identification. The most cutting-edge technologies,
    including machine learning (ML), have a large positive impact on technology and
    are particularly effective at detecting both normal and pathological behaviour
    in any system. The most common, extensively used, and effective method for forecasting
    rainfall is neural networks. Real-time agricultural field monitoring utilising
    IoT-based sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles has been developed by Quach et
    al. (2021). A sensor network for gathering information on the ground is also incorporated,
    in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle system for remote sensing. Numerous
    sensor nodes are used in the sensor network to measure various environmental and
    plant factors, including temperature, humidity, and nitrogen content. The sensor
    network transmits data using LoRa, a low-power wide-area network modulation method
    that enables a single receiver to receive signals from sensor nodes up to 450
    m away. (b) Crop disease prediction In order to predict apple disease in Kashmir
    Valley apple orchards, Akhter and Sofi (2022) suggested using data analytics and
    machine learning in an IoT system. This study reaches a pinnacle in demonstrating
    the power and promise of computing tools like the internet of things, wireless
    sensor networks, data analytics, and machine learning in agriculture. A local
    poll was also conducted to find out from the farmers how the most recent technological
    advancements affect precision farming. Khamparia et al. (2020) developed a hybrid
    deep learning model merging autoencoder with Convolutional neural network for
    crop leaf disease prediction. Obtained dataset contained 900 image samples of
    three different crops and five types of disease. From total samples 600 images
    were considered for training process and remaining 300 was considered for testing
    process. Different convolution filter size of and was used in this developed approach
    achieving 97.5 % accuracy. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) developed deep learning
    model along with transfer learning for prediction of disease in rice leaf. In
    traditional farming, farmers spend lot of resources as well as time consuming
    due to visualizing through naked eye and it results in unhealthy farming. Object
    segmentation and classification was achieved using InceptionResNetV2 for recognizing
    disease in rice leaf image. Kaur et al. (2022) developed hybrid CNN model for
    detection of leaf disease through utilizing feature extraction and feature reduction
    approach. Using this developed approach four different types of diseases such
    as black measles, stable, black rot and leaf blight present in grapevines was
    recognized. Plant village dataset was collected and processed using EfficientNet
    B7 deep model using transfer learning. After extracting features it was further
    reduced by applying logistic regression. According to the literature, numerous
    systems are designed for automatic field monitoring with IoT. Based on the above
    mentioned articles several significant challenges arise in automatic weather forecasting
    and field monitoring approaches. High system cost (Goap et al., 2018), alerting
    system not available (Rani et al., 2020), and only considering a single parameter
    (Akhter and Sofi, 2022) are some of the issues in the existing algorithms. Thus
    effective field monitoring is not achieved using the existing research. So, the
    current research focuses on utilizing IoT and deep learning approach for automated
    and continuous field monitoring. 3. Proposed methodology In India, one of the
    most important economic sectors is agriculture. India''s increased agricultural
    activity can be attributed to the country''s abundant irrigation-supporting water
    supplies and highly productive soil. However, a number of circumstances stop the
    production of the projected yield from occurring. To overcome these aforementioned
    issues and to support farmers with better quality and quantity crops an improved
    automated and computer based technology is designed in this current research.

    Architecture of the Proposed IoT Based System for Improved Precision Agriculture.
    The agricultural area is equipped with several IoT-based sensor nodes to gather
    real-time data. The nodes that have been assembled gather data on the state of
    the soil, moisture content of the soil, presence of humidity, presence of pests,
    diseases, and insects, as well as photographs of plants and other things. The
    information is then either sent to a cloud server based on IoT or stored locally
    in a nearby fog node. The collected data is pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. Pre-processed data is then given as
    input for Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. Then,
    in the second step, the images of the crop are acquired to predict the presence
    of disease and pests. The acquired crop images are pre-processed using an Adaptive
    Gaussian filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization (DHE) for
    contrast enhancement of the image. Pre-processed image is then fed to ResNet50
    for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case
    of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be
    automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding
    the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message
    will be sent to the farmers. The proposed IoT and deep learning based model can
    support the farmers to achieve quantity and quality crop production in lesser
    time. 3.1. IoT based network for data acquisition The first step in putting together
    a weather forecasting and field monitoring system is setting up a wireless sensor
    network field where each node is linked by a Wi-Fi module as well as lays data
    over a server computer, form where an automated Python script can keep polling
    the information and then transmits alert/start messages for the required procedure.

    Distributed WSN. Data collection using numerous sensors placed around the field
    or garden is the first stage in creating an automatic weather forecasting and
    field monitoring system. The gateway node, or Raspberry Pi 3 B+, will handle all
    communication with the other sensor nodes. Advanced soil moisture sensors, GSM
    and Bluetooth modules, temperature and humidity sensors, MQ2 gas sensors, pH sensors,
    water level indicators, alarm and clock modules, batteries, and relay modules
    are all included in each Arduino mega unit. Ultrasonic sensor for rodents and
    significant intruder detection. Each node will send information to the raspberry
    pi3, which functions as both the base station and the gateway node. The data storage
    on the raspberry pi will be handled by a python script, from which it might be
    displayed to the user via an application layer. The intranet can also accomplish
    what it was designed to do for data transmission from the raspberry pi to the
    server, enabling its use of it in places with limited to no internet access. The
    basic principles of receiver, transmitter, ground, and positive are the basis
    for connecting various sensors to the microcontroller. The majority of connections
    need to be made in this way, because the Arduino Mega board includes a lot of
    digital pins, RXD, analogue pins and TXD in addition to a lot of Vcc and Gnd pins.
    After building the network topology and collecting the data, the first phase of
    the proposed applications is finished. Data processing begins with the initial
    phase of data collection using various sensors. 3.1.1. Node’s structural details
    Each node is made up of a micro-controller, which in this case is advised to be
    an Arduino mega because it most closely matches the scope of the solution. Each
    node has a soil moisture sensor, a Wi-Fi module, a temperature sensor, a DHT11
    sensor, a light intensity sensor, also a battery module linked to it. Fig. 3 below
    contains each node''s block diagram. Download : Download high-res image (161KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Configuration of each sensor node.
    In order to transmit further signals to the actuators and inform the end user
    in the event that manual intrusion is required, all of the data collected by the
    sensors must be processed and analysed. 3.2. Data analysis The data kept on a
    cloud server is also taken into account for analytical purposes, whereby an AI
    system is used to predict the weather, the characteristics of the soil, irrigation,
    and illness. To automate the forecast of various agricultural aspects and take
    corrective action to increase crop output, AI systems are being considered. However
    in the data analysis process initially the information regarding temperature,
    humidity, moisture and soil condition are considered. 3.2.1. Weather monitoring
    (a) Data pre-processing The sensors'' entire collection of data has to be evaluated
    and handled. The given input datasets such as temperature, humidity moisture and
    soil properties contains some missing values. Normalization and mean based missing
    value imputation are used in the proposed method to convert the raw data into
    meaningful data which is required for classification. (b) Normalization Normally,
    attributes from the raw data are high variables and not present in a specified
    range. To accomplish a better outcome, the attributes from the data are kept in
    a uniform range of [A, B]. So here, min–max normalization method is used to normalize
    the attribute ranges. A mathematical formulation of min–max normalization is given
    in Eq. (1). (1) where represents the original value, denotes the maximum value
    of and indicates the minimum value of . (c) Mean based Missing value Imputation
    Imputation using mean values, also known as rough imputation, is a quick and simple
    imputation method that employs the mean value of all the data on the variable
    to be improved. Imputation of numerical variables is done using the mean. This
    rough imputation not only ignores the amount of variance but also the connection
    between variables, resulting in inaccurate estimations. The rough imputation approach
    should only be used when just a few missing data are present, and it is not designed
    for broad usage and is given in Eq. (2). (2) where represents the sample mean,
    and the total of each value in the sample is represented by , while the number
    of values in the population is represented by . 3.2.2. Classification A classifier
    is an algorithm that organises data into labelled informational classes or categories.
    In this designed model, GRU is used to forecast the weather. (a) Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) A GRU can be viewed as a simplification and improvement of LSTM and
    is comparable in performance to LSTM. Introduce LSTM before giving a comprehensive
    description of a GRU. The hidden state is the most crucial portion of an RNN because
    it is in charge of remembering or forgetting certain information (Li et al., 2020).
    From top to bottom, GRU has a total of three layers. The 10 node input layer is
    in charge of feeding information into the hidden layer. The output unit, which
    contains two nodes and one layer, is in charge of classifying and producing the
    data processed from the hidden layer using the SoftMax classifier. 32 nodes and
    one layer make up the hidden layer. The hidden layer''s output processed data
    is handled using one-hot encoding, a real output that is gained following the
    decoding procedure. GRU consists of two gates a reset gate and an update gate
    . The two gates cooperate to regulate the flow of data into and out of the memory
    cell. Although they both use the input and the preceding concealed state to calculate
    them, their functions are distinct. A GRU makes some reductions in complexity
    compared to LSTM. Fig. 4 is a diagram of the GRU''s organisational structure.
    Eq. (3) provides the link relationship seen in Fig. 4. (3) Download : Download
    high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of
    the GRU. In Eq. (3), candidate’s output is represented by , output vector is indicated
    using and represents the input vector. The reset gate of the GRU is designated
    by the letter , and the output gate by the letter (Xu et al., 2018). This GRU
    network is used in proposed approach to forecasting the weather in the agriculture
    area. 3.2.3. Disease prediction (a) Image pre-processing The sensors'' entire
    collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. From the information collected
    from the nodes, the Python programmes running on the Raspberry Pi will check for
    certain criteria. The input crop image dataset is pre-processed in order to convert
    the raw image into a meaningful image. Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram
    equalization technique to remove noise and to improve the quality of the image
    for achieving accurate prediction. (b) Adaptive Gaussian filter When using a conventional
    Canny edge detector operator, the Gaussian filter is employed to smooth out the
    image and minimise the parasitic effect that sampling quantization has on the
    image. Due to the fact that both the edge and the noise are high frequency signals,
    the filter operator smoothes the image''s edges while suppressing the noise, which
    affects how accurately the edges are identified. An updated Gaussian filtering
    algorithm is put forth to address this issue; it decides whether to apply a Gaussian
    filter based on the disparity between the pixel''s grey value and the grey mean
    in the surrounding area. If the noise interferes with the image, it can be written
    as in Eq. (4): (4) where is the noise signal. When there is noise, the difference
    between the noise-affected pixel''s grey value also its neighbouring pixels is
    described as in Eq. (5). (5) Due to the approximate zero interference free D,
    the mean value difference between the point grey value of the noise-affected image
    pixel and its neighbouring pixels, called , is roughly equal to , which is the
    degree of noise hopping. (c) Dynamic histogram equalization The cropped image''s
    total number of pixels is used as the basis for the spanning function used by
    the equalisation method to perform equalisation (Dhal et al., 2018). Histogram
    equalisation and mapping the image pixels to a dynamic range are the two stages
    of the process. (d) Mapping image pixels to dynamic range The dynamic range for
    the output sub-histograms can be obtained from as Eqs. (5), (6). (6) (7) The exceptions
    are present at the two extremities, where (e) Equalizing each sub-histogram Similar
    to how a global histogram is equalised, each image''s histogram is equalised using
    the same process. The remapped values for the ith sub-histogram are derived as
    in Eq. (8). (8) where is the new intensity level corresponding to the intensity
    level on the original image, is the histogram value at the intensity level on
    the fuzzy histogram and is the total population count in the partition of the
    fuzzy histogram. 3.2.4. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises
    data into clearly defined categories or classes. In this designed model, ResNet50
    a kind of CNN model is used to predict plant diseases. (a) Residual Neural Network
    (ResNet50) The goal of CNN''s back propagation method is to automatically discover
    the spatial hierarchies of feature classes. Convolution, pooling, and fully connected
    (FC) units are common building components utilized in the creation of CNNs. The
    process of repeatedly running the input image through the selected filter is the
    foundation of the convolutional layer''s operation. The filter can be 3 × 3, 5
    × 5 or 7 × 7 pixels in size. As a result, the image with the filter applied to
    it becomes the input of the following layer (m2 × m3). Activation maps are created
    as a result of this convolution process. Local unique elements can be seen on
    activation maps. A filter (m1) exists for each convolutional layer (Toğaçar et
    al., 2020). The output of layer l is made up of feature maps with dimension The
    ith subset of features, displayed as , is calculated utilizing Eq. (9). The matrix
    bias is indicated by and denotes size of the filter. (9) The pooling units preserves
    image characteristics while reducing image size also expenses while maintaining
    image information. This structure reduces the number of parameters, the filter''s
    spatial dimension, and the step. It takes information in the following sizes as
    input: , and again outcomes Eqs. (10), (11), (12) demonstrates, in brief how the
    pooling layer functions. (10) (11) (12) The characteristics from the preceding
    stage are flattened before being assigned to the FC layers, which update the weights
    also provide the final values for each label. An actual multi-layered sensor for
    mapping is a convolutional network with fully interlinked units. In Eq. (13),
    the FC layer''s processing stages are displayed. (13) In the proposed method CNN
    model such as ResNet 50 is used for the training of plant disease image dataset.
    Fig. 5 illustrates a building block for residual learning. A remarkable architecture
    made up of residual layers is called ResNet. Furthermore, ResNet is distinct in
    that it substitutes a collection of global average pooling layers for the more
    customary set of fully linked layers at the network’s conclusion. ResNet50 is
    a type of residual network with 50 layers. Each group of identical layers in the
    ResNet50 design is unique. ResNet calculates data from one layer to the next that
    must occur in order to arrive at the final forecast. ResNet helps to mitigate
    the problem of vanishing gradients by offering an alternative shortcut route for
    gradient to flow through. The model can skip a CNN weight layer if the current
    layer is not necessary thanks to the ResNet identity mapping algorithm (Theckedath
    & Sedamkar, 2020). This assists in preventing the over-fitting issue with the
    training set. This ResNet50 classifier used in the proposed method classifies
    the plant diseases in agricultural land. Predicted data using deep learning approach
    is further used for the purpose of monitoring the agriculture field. Download

    Block for ResNet50. 3.3. Field monitoring The temperature, humidity, irrigation,
    fertilisers and illness in the agricultural field will all be checked when the
    smart agricultural monitoring system is turned on. The water pump will automatically
    start if the temperature is really high. Then if the soil moisture is going down
    then the water pump will start automatically. Nutrient levels of the soils are
    then checked. If nutrient deficiencies occurred then an automatic fertilization
    machine is turned on to spray the fertilizer on the agricultural land. If the
    plants are affected by a particular disease means the automatic pesticide sprayer
    will start automatically. The smart agriculture monitoring system uses a GSM module
    to communicate with mobile devices and establish SMS alerts on the mobile device
    about the levels. 4. Result and discussion Agriculture and farming contribute
    significantly to the GDP of many affluent countries as well as emerging countries.
    As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. A critical
    matter that requires the highest appropriateness to be addressed is the necessity
    for agricultural maintenance and the rising water issues. To build an automated
    and continuous field monitoring, the proposed research focus on IoT and deep learning
    approach. The proposed GRU and ResNet50 are tested on MATLAB 2021a with intel
    core i5 and 8 GB RAM. Simulation parameters for GRU and ResNet50 are given in

    Period 10 The installation of a wireless sensor network is the first step in the
    implementation of weather forecasting and field monitoring. In order to gather
    real-time data, several IoT-based sensor nodes are set up in the agricultural
    field. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the environmental conditions,
    soil condition, moisture condition, presence of humidity fertility of the soil,
    and presence of the pest, diseases, and insects also capture images of plants
    and so. The collected information’s either stored locally in the nearby fog node
    or transmitted to the cloud server based on IoT. The agricultural node with sensor
    nodes and sensor node deployment used for this proposed approach is illustrated

    deployment. The information stored in cloud server is further considered for analysis
    purposes in which the prediction of weather, soil properties, irrigation and disease
    is achieved by means of AI system. The reason for considering AI systems is to
    achieve automated prediction of varying agricultural factors and take remedial
    action for higher crop yield. 4.1. Dataset description Different sensors are placed
    in the agricultural field for monitoring purpose to support smart in order to
    perform healthy farming. The collected sensor data is processed using AI system
    to predict weather, crop disease, soil nutrition and irrigation support. Four
    different datasets collected from publicly available is taken for analysis. Description
    regarding different dataset is given below. Dataset 1: This data contains details
    regarding district wise crop area, season, temperature different types of crops,
    production in hectares and yield. The statistics is collected from 1997 to 2021
    and it is obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare of India.
    Data is acquired from 35 states and union territory. Dataset 2: For the purpose
    of monitoring and controlling an irrigation system in real-time, data is gathered
    using a wireless sensor network. This method prevents water waste while providing
    the farm and garden with uniform and necessary water levels. This method aims
    to provide an automated irrigation mechanism that activates and deactivates the
    pumping motor in response to the amount of moisture in the ground. In this system,
    the soil moisture sensor, dht11 sensor, and NodeMCU are all used to interface
    with the Arduino board. Using these sensors, the data is collected. Dataset 3:
    Data related to soil nutrients is collected from department of agriculture and
    farmers welfare. Different types of nutrients are essential to be present in the
    soil for plant growth. Various soil nutrients includes pH, Electrical Conductivity
    (EC), Iron (Fe), Organic Carbon (OC), Nitrogen (N), Manganese (Mn), Phosphorus
    (P), Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (zn). Dataset
    4: This dataset contains both unhealthy as well as healthy leaves image. Total
    number of image samples present in the dataset is 3600 images of RGB. It contains
    healthy apple leave and diseased apple leaves such as scab, black rot and cedar.
    4.2. Weather monitoring The collected data such as temperature (Dataset 1), soil
    moisture (Dataset 2) and nutrients (Dataset 3) are pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. GRU is utilized as a classifier for
    predicting weather condition. This proposed GRU classifier is compared with existing
    classifiers like Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest
    Neighbour (KNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The performance metrics used
    for comparison between proposed and existing classifiers are accuracy, precision,
    recall, error, specificity, F1_Score, NPV, FNR and FPR. AUC plot and ROC plot
    of the proposed approach is depicted in Fig. 8. To validate or show the effectiveness
    of a multi-class categorization problem, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC
    (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are used. The degree or amount of
    separability is represented by AUC. In the proposed method, AUC plot is close
    to 1, so it has a high level of separability. The ROC curve is a probability curve
    that demonstrates how effective the model can discriminate across classes. Table

    4.3. Disease prediction Crop images (Dataset 4) acquired from sensor nodes are
    used to predict the presence of diseases and pests. The crop diseases dataset
    contains a total of 3995 images, in that 1987 images are disease affected and
    the remaining 2008 images are disease non-affected. Of these total images, 80
    % are used for training and 20 % are used for testing. The acquired crop images
    are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian Filter and Dynamic Histogram Equalization.
    The pre-processed image is then fed into ReNet50 for feature extraction and classification.
    Fig. 14 shows the pre-processing steps involved in the disease prediction process.
    The acquired crop image is taken as input for this step. This image is initially
    fed into adaptive median filter for removing noise present in the input image.
    The dynamic histogram equalization is carried out to enhance the contrast of image.
    The pre-processed images are then fed into the ResNet50 classifier for classification
    purposes. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download : Download full-size

    prediction model''s AUC and ROC plots are shown in Fig. 15. The AUC (Area Under
    the Curve) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are used to validate
    or demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-class classification problem. The
    degree or amount of separability is represented by the AUC. In the figure, AUC
    is close to 1, so the proposed approach has a high level of separability. The
    ROC curve is a probability curve that demonstrates how effectively the model can
    be discriminated across classes. Download : Download high-res image (101KB) Download

    The confusion matrix plot for the proposed ResNet50 is illustrated in Fig. 16.
    It is typical to use a table called a confusion matrix to describe the performance
    of a classification model on a set of test data for which the real values are
    known. It contains two different classes like disease affected and non-affected.
    Through this plot, it is found that only fewer samples from each class are wrongly
    predicted, so the error is found to be minimal and better accuracy is achieved
    using the proposed ResNet50 classifier. Download : Download high-res image (41KB)

    designed environment. Through this study it is revealed that proposed model predicts
    crop leaf disease effectively when compared to existing. 4.4. Field monitoring
    The agricultural area’s temperature is first checked using a temperature sensor.
    When abnormal conditions occur like a high temperature greater than or equal to
    35 degree centigrade then the controller sends message to the owner using 19:19:19
    to spray on the leaves of small crops for 15 min to protect the crop from sun''s
    effect. Because of the sun''s heat and high temperature crop growth decrease so
    to avoid it use that fertilizer. The temperature always monitored and displayed
    on LCD which is detected by temperature sensor. When detected high moisture in
    the soil it causes root rot in crops, then this system detects moisture conditions
    and sends that information to owner to protect crop from root rot using copper
    oxychloride 3gmsspltr use at root zone of plants. When a farmer wants to switch
    on motor manually by sending message from his mobile to system with a message
    as “#M ON*” and to switch off motor when he wants then send message as “#M OFF*”.
    Again he wants a change in auto mode he sends a message from his mobile to system
    as “#AUTO*”. When the system detects that disease affected on crops and sends
    that information to the owner to protect crop from diseases by spraying fertilizer
    named as a pyrethroid. The agrobot carries the sprinkler motor which sprays the
    pesticide. It is in ON state till it moves at the end of agricultural land. 5.
    Conclusion Automated weather forecasting and field monitoring using AI based deep
    learning approach is focused in this current research. Traditional farming results
    in unhealthy crops because of poor weather and soil condition, crops affected
    through diseases and pest. To overcome these issue automated weather forecasting
    and field monitoring is essential to support farmers to produce healthy crops
    with higher yield quantity. In this current research initially, sensors are assembled
    in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit
    it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. The assembled nodes capture
    information regarding the temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient and capture
    images of plants and so. In first phase, the previous collected data for weather
    forecasting was pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value
    imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data was
    then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the temperature and soil
    moisture content for upcoming years. In the second phase, the crop images acquired
    from sensors to predict the presence of disease are pre-processed using Adaptive
    Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization to improve
    the image''s brightness. The pre-processed image was then fed to ResNet50 for
    feature extraction and classification. In the third phase, in case of any horrible
    weather conditions and soil conditions observed by these predicted data, remedial
    action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information
    regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert
    message will be sent to farmers. Graphical representation proves that the proposed
    approach results are significantly better than those of existing approaches. Accuracy,
    precision, recall and specificity obtained for weather forecasting is 94 %, 94
    %, 93 % and 93 %. Following that Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity reached
    for crop disease prediction is 98 %,98 %, 98 % and 98 %. Thus, the deep learning
    techniques used in proposed approach are the best choice for automated weather
    forecasting and field monitoring to support precision agriculture. In future,
    by utilizing AI and surveillance, the field area may be kept free of intruders.

    Object detection technology plays a crucial role in crop growth monitoring within

    control 1. Introduction With the current workforce aging, the agriculture industry
    confronts an impending labor shortage (Yang et al., 2021). To tackle this issue,
    smart agriculture (Shaikh et al., 2022), which emphasizes mechanization, automation,
    and intelligence as critical components, has emerged. Brassica Chinensis is a
    popular crop in southern China, East Asia, and Southeast Asia, with extensive
    greenhouse agricultural production in Shanghai, China. Nevertheless, the current
    state of intelligent Brassica Chinensis production remains relatively underdeveloped.
    Monitoring and analyzing the growth status of Brassica Chinensis, particularly
    in terms of phenotypic measurement and pest control — crucial for enhancing crop
    productivity and quality, still heavily depends on manual intervention. In recent
    years, the development of computer vision technology has found applications in
    various practical engineering tasks, including those in the field of agriculture
    (Ariza-Sentís et al., 2023, Cardellicchio et al., 2023, Roy and Bhaduri, 2023).
    Certain studies in smart agriculture have endeavored to utilize object detection
    methods to replace manual acquisition of crop phenotypic and pest information,
    providing a more efficient means to monitor the growth status of Brassica Chinensis.
    For phenotypic measurement, object detection plays a crucial role as the initial
    step in identifying each plant objects within top-view images of Brassica Chinensis,
    facilitating subsequent measurement processes (Qiang et al., 2022, Shi et al.,
    2023). Likewise, for pest information, object detection technology can be directly
    applied to capture details such as quantity, location, and size of pest areas,
    which are characterized by salient foreground objects (Liu and Wang, 2020, Zhao
    and Shi, 2022). However, in Brassica Chinensis growth monitoring, there are unique
    requirements for object detection model utilized, which makes models in general-purpose
    datasets’ leaderboard, such as PASCAL VOC (Everingham, 2008) and MS COCO (Lin
    et al., 2014), present suboptimal detection performance. The model must effectively
    adapt to the distinctive characteristics observed in Brassica Chinensis image
    datasets. Firstly, occlusion between different Brassica Chinensis plants occurs
    frequently, which can lead to the loss of crucial information in images, hindering
    comprehensive crop image analysis (Lawal, 2021, Roy and Bhaduri, 2022). Secondly,
    there tend to be a higher density of objects, including many with extremely small
    sizes, in Brassica Chinensis images, which also poses a challenge for accurate
    object detection (David et al., 2021). Thirdly, Brassica Chinensis images often
    contain complex backgrounds with weeds and other salient regions, potentially
    affecting the correct recognition of foreground objects (Zhou et al., 2021a).
    Fourthly, the class-imbalance problem is prevalent in Brassica Chinensis datasets.
    For instance, in Shanghai, the number of objects affected by flea beetles surpasses
    those affected by Helicoverpa by dozens of times, resulting in a dominance of
    flea beetle-affected objects in the datasets. Furthermore, the absence of an open-source
    labeled Brassica Chinensis image dataset necessitates the creation of a dedicated
    large-scale dataset for model training. It should possess ample size to prevent
    overfitting in the detection models. While obtaining Brassica Chinensis image
    data is relatively straightforward and cost-effective, the challenge lies in the
    annotation of supervision signals (Laine and Aila, 2016, Tarvainen and Valpola,
    2017, Xie et al., 2020), requiring expertise from agricultural specialists (Tseng
    et al., 2023). This demands considerable human resources and material investments,
    making the creation of totally labeled dataset an arduous and costly endeavor.
    Consequently, cost-effective training paradigms like Semi-Supervised Object Detection
    (SSOD) (Liu et al., 2021a, Xu et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2021b, Li et al., 2022,
    Zhou et al., 2022) are favorable. By requiring labels for only a subset of the
    entire image set, SSOD can yield comparable results to supervised learning with
    more labeled data, making it an advantageous and economical choice for smart agriculture.
    The recent work (Tseng et al., 2023) explores the agricultural domain by introducing
    an SSOD algorithm with an adaptive threshold screening approach to address the
    class-imbalance problem. However, despite both their study and ours operating
    within the agriculture field, their work focuses on wheat as an example, while
    ours centers on the specific conditions of Brassica Chinensis. The two tasks exhibit
    completely distinct image characteristics and difficulties, with a difference
    even more pronounced than that observed between tasks involving Brassica Chinensis
    images and images from other fields. To the best of our knowledge, there has been
    no research applying SSOD algorithms to the object detection task in Brassica
    Chinensis growth monitoring. Therefore, an SSOD algorithm tailored to the specific
    traits of Brassica Chinensis image datasets becomes imperative. Analyzing the
    structure of SSOD algorithms alongside the distinctive features of Brassica Chinensis
    image datasets reveals that the base detector in current SOTA SSOD algorithms,
    typically a two-stage detector like Faster R-CNN (Ren et al., 2015), does not
    align well with semi-supervised training method for Brassica Chinensis image datasets.
    Actually, a two-stage object detector is not entirely end-to-end. To convert predicted
    results of the teacher model on unlabeled data into the format required for optimizing
    the student model, a series of complex processing steps are still necessary, which
    involve Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), thresholding, and label assignment. On
    one hand, NMS filters out predicted results that have a relatively high Intersection
    over Union (IoU) with a result that possesses a local maxima confidence, which
    might lead to the exclusion of some true positives, especially in Brassica Chinensis
    images, where occlusion is quite common, and true positives predicted by the teacher
    model tend to have high IoUs with each other. In addition, NMS could also potentially
    cause a loss of teacher-learned knowledge in object detection, and reduce the
    efficiency of knowledge transfer from the teacher model to the student model.
    On the other hand, the label assignment process in a two-stage object detector
    is a threshold activation process. A proposal is assigned as positive when its
    IoU with a label box surpasses the preset IoU threshold, and vice versa. However,
    this process is conducted in isolation and lacks reference to other label boxes
    or proposals. As a result, the assignment results are highly susceptible to noise
    introduced by teacher model''s prediction (Li et al., 2022), which can significantly
    impact the accuracy and reliability of the assigned labels, and an intuitive example
    is shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the presence of noise in pseudo boxes and the
    use of an easy assignment method can also pose additional challenges in utilizing
    localization information during the student learning stage, that regressing continuous
    bounding boxes can lead to significant training divergence, and seems unfeasible
    empirically. Download : Download high-res image (337KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. An example of incorrect assignment in two-stage object detector-based
    SSOD algorithms. The red box represents the ground truth, the blue box represents
    the noised pseudo box, and the white box represents the proposal. The proposal,
    which has a large IoU value with the ground truth and should be assigned as positive,
    is mistakenly assigned as negative due to the influence of the noised and poorly
    localized pseudo box (The IoU value between the proposal and the pseudo box does
    not surpass the IoU threshold of 0.5). To address these issues, we propose an
    end-to-end SSOD method based on Detection Transformer (DETR) (Carion et al., 2020).
    Firstly, DETR-like model’s prediction mechanism relies on the interrelation between
    diverse pixel areas, effectively adapting to the substantial occlusion and complex
    background challenges present in Brassica Chinensis image datasets. Secondly,
    in contrast to two-stage object detectors, DETR-like model functions as a fully
    end-to-end set prediction object detector, which operates without the necessity
    of the NMS process to filter out redundant true positives during pseudo label
    generation, and utilizes bipartite matching for label assignment, effectively
    reducing the occurrence of incorrect assignment results. Thirdly, with the more
    advanced bipartite matching, localization information in pseudo boxes tends to
    be available for student model’s training, making it more suitable for SSOD algorithms
    that adopt a pseudo labeling strategy. Section 2.2.1 provides more details about
    how the DETR-like model could address the challenges outlined in the preceding
    paragraph. Two key techniques have also been introduced: low threshold filtering
    and decoupled optimization, aimed at tailoring the DETR-based SSOD method in the
    context of Brassica Chinensis growth monitoring task. Class-imbalance (Liu et
    al., 2021a) is a critical issue in Brassica Chinensis image datasets, particularly
    in tasks like wormhole detection. Besides the imbalance between different categories,
    DETR-like detectors also face a severe class-imbalance problem between foreground
    objects and background objects. The low threshold filtering technique we have
    designed relaxes the criteria for selecting pseudo boxes, fostering a more balanced
    distribution among the generated pseudo labels across different categories, and
    effectively alleviating training divergence. Additionally, multi-task optimization
    conflict is also an important issue, where a low IoU threshold may fit the classification
    task, while the regression task requires more refined information due to its continuous
    property. Therefore, the decoupled optimization technique has been implemented,
    which separates the two optimization tasks, and better optimizes the model for
    both classification and regression tasks. To benchmark the proposed SSOD method,
    we have constructed two datasets: one for plant detection task and another for
    wormhole detection task. Refer to Section 2.1 for comprehensive details about
    the datasets. For each task, we have conducted tests under four different conditions
    by varying the amount of labeled data used for training (Liu et al., 2021a, Xu
    et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2021b). The proposed method consistently demonstrates
    SOTA performance across all four conditions for both tasks, and this advantage
    is particularly pronounced when utilizing extremely limited labeled data. In the
    case of plant detection, the method achieves an impressive mAP of 70.0 by using
    only 1 % labeled images (3 images) of the total training set, representing an
    absolute improvement of 21.0 points compared to the current SOTA algorithm. Similarly,
    in the more challenging wormhole detection task, the method achieves a significant
    AP50 of 65.0 using 1 % labeled images (14 images) of the total training set, showcasing
    an absolute improvement of 5.3 points compared to current SOTA algorithm. In addition,
    the remarkable results achieved with merely 5 % labeled images (18 images for
    plant detection and 73 images for wormhole detection) closely rival the results
    attained with fully supervised training, and these results meet the demands of
    practical applications in Brassica Chinensis growth monitoring. We highlight the
    contributions of this paper as follows: (a) Identifying three specific limitations
    in the application of current mainstream SSOD algorithms to Brassica Chinensis
    image datasets, we propose a novel end-to-end SSOD method that employs a DETR-like
    detector as the base detector, which aligns well with the unique characteristics
    of Brassica Chinensis image datasets, alleviating these challenges, and ultimately
    resulting in a more efficient and robust SSOD method tailored for Brassica Chinensis
    growth monitoring. (b) To address the class-imbalance and multi-task optimization
    conflict issues presented in Brassica Chinensis image datasets, two techniques
    are introduced to adapt the newly proposed method, namely low threshold filtering
    and decoupled optimization, which results in a more stable and faster training
    process, allowing for better optimization of the model. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Materials We conducted the study at the Brassica Chinensis greenhouse in
    Shanghai Shixin Vegetable Cultivation Company, situated at 121°03′ east longitude
    and 31°07′ north latitude, which belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate. The
    greenhouse itself is a ten-arch multi-span plastic structure, measuring 80 m in
    length and 40 m in width. The setup utilized in the study comprises five fixed
    cameras and a specialized visual plant protection UAV system that we constructed.
    The fixed cameras, Hikvision’s DS-2DC4223IW-D spherical network cameras, are positioned
    approximately 2.5 m above the ground on the greenhouse’s top shelf (see Fig. 2(a)).
    In addition, the UAV system, which employs a Sony action camera featuring 7 million
    static pixels and supporting 1080p@60FPS slow-motion video recording, operates
    at a flight height set to approximately 1 m above the ground (see Fig. 2(b)).
    Both the images collected by the fixed cameras and the UAV system maintain a resolution
    of 1920 × 1024 pixels. To accommodate computing resource limitations, we divided
    the collected images into two images of the same size to construct the datasets.
    Likewise, for future inference processes, the collected images also undergo division
    as a preliminary step. Download : Download high-res image (377KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. (a) An image of the fixed camera. (b) An image of image
    acquisition and pesticide spraying by the visual plant protection UAV system in
    the greenhouse. For the plant detection task, considering the uniform size of
    Brassica Chinensis plants within each batch but across distinct areas, as well
    as the convenience and high-definition capabilities of the fixed cameras, we made
    the choice to utilize the fixed cameras, rather than the UAV system, to collect
    439 top-view images to build the plant detection dataset. In contrast, the challenge
    of wormhole detection involved significant fluctuations in pest levels across
    various areas, necessitating a diverse collection of Brassica Chinensis images.
    Thus, we employed the UAV system to gather 1745 images from all sections inside
    the greenhouse to build the wormhole detection dataset. Examples taken from the
    two datasets have been displayed in Fig. 3. These images were subsequently partitioned
    into a training set and a test set. Table 1 provides quantitative details of the

    The objective of the designed model is to train a robust and high-performance
    agricultural object detection model, , using both a labeled image set and an unlabeled
    image set , where , are the number of images in the labeled set and the unlabeled
    set. Besides, there are class information and localization information of all
    objects in the annotations for each labeled image . 2.2.1. Framework overview
    The DETR-like detector-based SSOD method consists of two training stages (see
    Fig. 4), namely labeled data burn-in stage and unlabeled data semi-supervised
    learning stage. In the labeled data burn-in stage (Section 2.2.2), only labeled
    images, from , are utilized, and a model with moderate performance is achieved.
    Subsequently, the model weights are duplicated to initialize both the teacher
    model and the student model. This approach empowers the teacher model to attain
    a respectable level of performance and generate relatively high-quality labels,
    which is still not good enough to put into practical engineering, but can substantially
    contribute to the student model''s training process. Moving to the second stage,
    unlabeled data semi-supervised learning stage (Section 2.2.3), the teacher model
    generates pseudo labels for unlabeled instances, from , and then, these newly
    pseudo labeled instances, along with labeled instances, are combined in a specific
    proportion to create mini-batches for training the student model. Following each
    iteration, the student model''s weights are updated, and the teacher model''s
    weights are concurrently updated using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to provide
    even higher-quality and more dependable pseudo labels for subsequent training
    iterations. Download : Download high-res image (637KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Overview of our method. Note that, both the teacher model and the
    student model in the framework are DETR-like object detection model with the same
    structure (see Fig. 5). On one hand, DETR-like detector, functioning as an end-to-end
    object detection model, leverages inter-object relationships to enhance detection
    performance. The information of object interactions eliminates the need for NMS
    in the post-processing of teacher model''s predictions, which addresses the issue
    of erroneous filtering of highly overlapped true positives in Brassica Chinensis
    images, and retains a greater amount of information that the teacher has acquired
    about the detection task, accelerating the efficiency of knowledge transfer. On
    the other hand, DETR-like detector''s set prediction approach outputs all potential
    bounding boxes simultaneously during prediction, aligning well with the set-based
    representation of label boxes, which allows DETR-like detector to employ a more
    advanced and robust bipartite matching technique for label assignment, taking
    into account the relationship between multiple label boxes and multiple proposals.
    Consequently, more robust assignment results, that are less affected by noise
    introduced during the teacher''s prediction stage, can be obtained, leading to
    improved model performance. Moreover, the more systematic and robust assignment
    process enables effective utilization of localization information in pseudo boxes
    for student model’s training, which enhances the efficiency of training and further
    improves the overall performance of the model. Download : Download high-res image

    of DETR-like object detector (Carion et al., 2020). Additionally, low threshold
    filtering and decoupled optimization are two techniques proposed to tackle the
    challenges of class-imbalance and multi-task optimization conflict in detection
    tasks within Brassica Chinensis datasets, and we will elaborate on how these two
    proposed solutions effectively address the challenges in Sections 2.2.4 and 2.2.5.
    2.2.2. Labeled data burn-in When training the model from scratch with semi-supervised
    learning paradigm, the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model, which has
    randomly initialized weights, essentially resemble random noise. Consequently,
    few prediction results will have confidence scores exceeding the preset threshold.
    This results in a significant imbalance between the number of pseudo label boxes
    and real label boxes, with a large portion of foreground objects being misclassified
    as background, thus intensifying the foreground-background imbalance problem,
    which can lead to significant training divergence. Therefore, a labeled data burn-in
    stage is necessary. Initially, we train the model in a supervised manner using
    labeled data , obtaining a model with improved performance. We then duplicate
    this model to create both the teacher and student model ( , ). Consequently, when
    we commence semi-supervised training (the second stage), the pseudo labels generated
    by the teacher model have relatively high quality. These labels provide a valuable
    reference for training the student model and help prevent training divergence
    caused by low-quality pseudo labels. Specifically, during each training iteration,
    we apply a set of weak data augmentations to the mini-batch obtained from the
    data loader, firstly. These augmentations include operations like horizontal flipping,
    random cropping, and various geometric transformations. The outcome is a mini-batch
    after weak data augmentations. Next, we subject to strong data augmentations ,
    which encompass techniques such as color jittering, random grayscale, random Gaussian
    blur, random erasing, and other non-geometric transformations. It is important
    to note that there is a domain gap between and . Training the model solely on
    data from one of these domains could result in poor performance when dealing with
    data from the other domain. In the subsequent unlabeled data semi-supervised learning
    stage, it is assumed that a robust and high-performance model should produce consistent
    predictions when presented with an image that has undergone either weak ( ) or
    strong (actually and ) augmentations. Therefore, we concatenate and to create
    a new mini-batch that combines data from both domains. This combined mini-batch
    is used to train the initial model. Given the supervised data , the supervised
    loss consists of the classification loss and the regression loss: (1) where represents
    the concatenation of and , corresponds to the label for , and represents the model
    weights in the iteration. 2.2.3. Unlabeled data semi-supervised learning The unlabeled
    semi-supervised learning stage is the pivotal stage in the approach. Here, unlabeled
    data is employed to complement labeled data in model training, resulting in a
    model with enhanced semantic information and a deeper understanding of foreground
    objects. In this stage, we combine two key techniques from Semi-Supervised Learning
    (SSL): pseudo labeling and consistency regularization (Berthelot et al., 2019,
    Sohn et al., 2020, Xie et al., 2020). On one hand, the teacher model assigns pseudo
    labels to unlabeled data , which are then used for training the student model;
    on the other hand, we take the assumption that an ideal model should be adept
    at filtering various levels of noise present in images, capturing the meaningful
    semantic content within, and require that the model must produce consistent results
    for images subjected to weak data augmentation and strong data augmentation. Moreover,
    to ensure the continual generation of accurate pseudo labels during training,
    we employed EMA to dynamically update the teacher model''s weights concurrently
    with the student model. This helps mitigate fluctuations in the teacher model''s
    weights, maintaining stable and consistent pseudo label quality throughout training.
    Specifically, in each iteration, we use consistent weak data augmentations , as
    in the burn-in stage, for the minibatch . Subsequently, we feed these weakly augmented
    images into the teacher model to generate pseudo labels . Simultaneously, we subject
    the weakly augmented images to strong data augmentations and input them into the
    student model for further processing. Given the unsupervised data , the unsupervised
    loss can be represented as: (2) where represents the pseudo labels generated by
    the teacher model, and represents the weights of student model in this iteration.
    Note that, during the unlabeled data semi-supervised learning stage, only the
    learnable weights of the student model are updated via back-propagation. Moreover,
    this update process actually takes into account both the supervised and unsupervised
    loss components: (3) where is learning rate, serves as a balancing factor, calibrating
    the trade-off between the supervised and unsupervised loss components and ensuring
    a stable and effective training process. After training, we employ the teacher
    model as the ultimate inference model. The teacher model''s weights are an exponential
    moving average of the weights from the last several student models. Alternatively,
    one can view the teacher model as an ensemble of the student models at different
    time steps. This aligns with our observation that the teacher model consistently
    achieves higher accuracy than each individual student model. 2.2.4. Low threshold
    filtering As previously discussed in Section 1, class-imbalance, including both
    imbalance between foreground and background objects as well as imbalance among
    various categories within the foreground objects, is a pervasive issue in detection
    tasks within Brassica Chinensis image sets, significantly impacting the model’s
    overall detection performance. Low threshold filtering is a necessary technique
    to adapt the DETR-like detector-based SSOD algorithm to imbalanced detection tasks.
    Compared to two-stage object detectors, DETR-like detectors tend to provide more
    conservative confidence scores, especially when Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017)
    employed. The conventional threshold used represents a stringent criterion, with
    only a few frequently occurring categories surpassing this threshold. Consequently,
    the majority of infrequently encountered object categories, are erroneously considered
    as background in the generated pseudo labels, leading to exceedingly sparse pseudo
    boxes, which exacerbate the problem of class-imbalance within the dataset. However,
    the low threshold filtering technique enables the creation of an increased quantity
    of pseudo boxes across all categories, particularly in those with fewer instances,
    achieved by relaxing the pseudo box selection criteria. As a result, objects belonging
    to rare categories, which had little representation in the pseudo boxes before,
    now have a chance to be included in the generated pseudo boxes. While their numbers
    are still considerably smaller than those belonging to frequently occurring categories,
    this adjustment helps maintain a closer proportional representation of each category
    as seen in the original dataset, providing a more consistent optimization objective
    for training student models. The changes in mAP and AP50 with different confidence
    thresholds are depicted in Fig. 6. Notably, a high threshold, which is the conventional
    setting commonly used in two-stage detector-based SSOD algorithms, proves detrimental
    to the training of the DETR-like detector-based model, and it may even lead to
    training divergence when the threshold exceeds 0.6. Conversely, a relatively lower
    threshold, like 0.4, proves more advantageous for model training, making the training
    process less susceptible to class-imbalance issue. However, a further reduction
    in the filtering threshold results in an influx of low-quality pseudo labels,
    and utilizing these poorly predicted boxes as pseudo labels also adversely affects
    student model’s training, so it is important to strike a balance. Download : Download

    the 10% evaluation setting in the wormhole detection task. 2.2.5. Decoupled optimization
    Different from labels in image classification tasks, there is not only class information
    but also localization information in labels of object detection tasks. Due to
    the noise introduced by teacher model’s prediction, regressing the continuous
    localization boxes in pseudo labels can cause easy divergence in the training
    process, and always be unfeasible. However, the use of a more advanced and systematic
    bipartite matching technique in the DETR-like detector-based model significantly
    reduces the impact of noise on the assignment results, enabling the use of localization
    information. Additionally, since that little noises in pseudo labels can lead
    to inconsistent optimization objectives of regression tasks and fluctuations in
    model performance, regression tasks inherently necessitate higher-quality pseudo
    labels compared to classification tasks, as mentioned earlier in the context of
    the multi-task optimization conflict. The varying quality demands between classification
    and regression tasks yield sub-optimal results. Consequently, we adopted a decoupled
    training approach, which leveraged two different parameters, and , to set the
    threshold for pseudo labels in the calculation of classification loss and regression
    loss respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image

    process. Pseudo labels are categorized based on the relationship between pseudo
    label’s confidence and . Red pseudo labels (e.g., pseudo labels 1 and 3) represent
    those with confidence greater than , while yellow pseudo labels (e.g., pseudo
    label 2) represent those with confidence less than . Following this categorization,
    red pseudo labels undergo calculation for both the classification and regression
    losses, while yellow pseudo labels only undergo calculation for the classification
    loss. The key parameter is tasked with the initial screening of teacher model
    prediction results , filtering out the majority of incorrect and low-quality boxes,
    and retaining only a selected portion as pseudo labels for the subsequent bipartite
    matching process. Instead, the other key parameter comes into play during the
    loss calculation phase. Following the bipartite matching process, it determines
    which localization information is considered in the calculation. Specifically,
    localization information from a subset of pseudo boxes whose confidence exceeds
    , indicating higher quality and greater consistency, is utilized in the calculation
    process. Simultaneously, the localization information from other pseudo boxes
    is disregarded in this phase. Given that the bipartite matching index (for more
    details, please refer to (Carion et al., 2020)), the final decoupled regression
    loss can be expressed as follows: (4) where is a preset hyper-parameter that determines

    Evaluation protocol To benchmark the performance of the proposed method within
    real-world object detection scenarios for Brassica Chinensis monitoring, the two
    specific datasets, the plant detection dataset and the wormhole detection dataset,
    are both utilized. The evaluation protocol involves randomly sampling different
    percentages of training set for each task. Specifically, we select 1 %, 2 %, 5
    %, and 10 % of the training set as the labeled set, and the remaining data is
    used as the unlabeled set. Both the labeled set and the unlabeled set work together
    in the proposed DETR-like detector-based SSOD method, and the model''s performance
    is then evaluated on the test set for each task. 3.2. Implementation details In
    experimental implementation, considering the inherent traits of the flea beetle
    pest, which is prevalent in Brassica Chinensis and typically manifests as small
    and densely distributed objects, we utilized Deformable DETR (Zhu et al., 2020)
    with a ResNet-50 backbone as the base detector. At the mean time, this choice
    allowed for significantly shorter training cycles compared to the original DETR
    while maintaining robust performance, as evidenced by prior research. The model
    weights were initialized using a model pre-trained on the general-purpose large-scale
    object detection dataset MS COCO (Lin et al., 2014). We used the confidence threshold
    , , unsupervised loss weight , for both the plant detection and wormhole detection
    tasks. We employed the SGD optimizer with momentum rate , weight decay rate ,
    learning rate for the backbone, learning rate for remaining parts of the model
    and constant learning rate scheduler. The batch size for supervised data was set
    to 4, and for unsupervised data, was 8. For plant detection task, we apply for
    1 %/2%/5%/10 % settings, and we train 200/400/900/1400 iterations, which includes
    50/100/200/400 iterations, for 1 %/2%/5%/10 % in the labeled data burn-in stage
    and the remaining iterations in the unlabeled data semi-supervised learning stage.
    However, for wormhole detection task, we apply as the EMA rate instead, and due
    to the more complex task, we opted for longer training process, extending training
    consisted of 2.5/3/5/7k total iterations, including 0.1/0.2/0.5/1k iterations
    for labeled data burn-in stage. All the hyper-parameters are summarized in Table

    necessitating annotation signals for all instances used, have proven successful
    in practical applications. Consequently, we conducted a comparative analysis between
    models trained using the proposed method, across 4 labeled proportion settings,
    and fully supervised method, aimed to assess the practical feasibility and effectiveness
    of the proposed approach in real-world applications for Brassica Chinensis growth
    monitoring. In experimental evaluation, common standard metrics for object detection
    models are utilized, including mAP, AP50 (Yilmaz and Aslam, 2006), F-1 score,
    Precision and Recall. These metrics are widely accepted, each with its own particular
    focus. AP50 and mAP are considered key metrics with AP50 placing more emphasis
    on the successful detection of objects, while mAP prioritizes the precision of
    the detection. Given the distinct tendencies of these two metrics, we made specific
    choices based on the nature of the tasks at hand: for the plant detection task,
    where we required highly accurate predicted boxes for subsequent phenotypic measurement,
    we primarily relied on mAP as the reference metric during model training and parameter
    optimization; conversely, for the wormhole detection task, the focus was on the
    number of small wormhole objects and their approximate positions on the plant.
    This aligns more closely with the characteristics of the AP50 metric, and thus,
    we selected AP50 as the reference metric for this task. Besides these metrics,
    we also plot Precision-Recall (P-R) curves (see Fig. 9) to provide an intuitive
    representation of the performance of models trained using the proposed method
    and fully supervised method. Download : Download high-res image (245KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Comparison of P-R curves between models trained
    with the proposed semi-supervised method and fully supervised method. From the
    comparison of the P-R curves, it is evident that while the model trained with
    the fully supervised method achieved the highest area under the P-R curve, models
    trained with the proposed method produced comparable results and demonstrated
    good Precision values for particular Recalls, even when no more than 10 % of the
    labeled images utilized. Table 3 displays the comparative results between the
    proposed method and fully supervised method in Brassica Chinensis plant detection.
    The results illustrate that, with only 10 % annotation required, the proposed
    method can achieve a performance very close to that of the fully supervised method
    in terms of mAP, F1-score and Recall, and even outperforms the fully supervised
    method in the case of AP50 and Precision, for the plant detection task. In the
    case of wormhole detection, as indicated in Table 4, the proposed method can achieve
    a remarkable AP50 score of 75.0, merely 2.6 absolute points lower than the fully
    supervised method, while necessitating only 10 % of the total annotation signals.
    Additionally, comparable results can be achieved in terms of other metrics. This
    suggests that the plant detection model, trained with only 35 labeled images,
    and the wormhole detection model, trained with 146 labeled images within the proposed
    semi-supervised approach, exhibit a high level of competitiveness compared to
    models trained under complete data supervision (351 labeled images for plant detection
    task, and 1460 labeled images for wormhole detection task), which proves both
    the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world tasks for
    Brassica Chinensis growth monitoring. Table 3. Experiment results on plant detection

    proposed method''s detection performance, we present visualizations of detection
    results using bounding boxes on several select test images in Fig. 10 and Fig.
    11, for plant detection task and wormhole detection task respectively, which explicitly
    illustrate the proposed method’s capability to accomplish both detection tasks
    for Brassica Chinensis monitoring. Notably, the proposed SSOD method excels in
    detecting plants and large-scale wormholes, which are salient and easily distinguishable
    objects. For small-scale wormholes, the proposed method also effectively locates
    their positions, albeit with lower confidence. False detections are primarily
    attributed to gaps that intersect between leaves, while missed detections occur
    mainly in boundary scenarios. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates reliable
    and accurate detection results in a wide range of scenarios, bolstering its practical
    utility. Download : Download high-res image (826KB) Download : Download full-size

    3.4.1. Comparative experiments To further illustrate the superiority of the proposed
    method over existing algorithms, we conducted a comparative experiment to compare
    its performance with current SOTA SSOD algorithms, including instant-teaching
    (Zhou et al., 2021b), soft-teacher (Xu et al., 2021), and unbiased-teacher (Liu
    et al., 2021a). Fig. 12 visually presents the results of the comparative experiment,
    revealing that the proposed method consistently attains the top performance across
    all four labeled data ratio settings. Notably, the most significant improvement
    is observed when there is a scarcity of labeled data. For the plant detection
    task (see Table 5), model trained with the proposed method using 1 % of the total
    labeled images (only 3 images) achieves 70.0 mAP, outperforming other models using
    5 % (the best result is 69.3 mAP), and for the wormhole detection task (Table
    6), model trained with the proposed method using 2 % of the total labeled images
    (29 images) similarly exhibited superior performance to other models using 5 %
    (70.1 AP50 > 68.6 AP50). The experimental results indicate that the proposed method
    aligns well with the specific characteristics of object detection tasks for monitoring
    Brassica Chinensis, significantly improving the efficiency of utilizing annotation
    signals, and reducing the overall training costs. Furthermore, the proposed method
    maintains its advantages as the amount of labeled data increases. This flexibility
    allows users to choose between incurring minimal labeling costs for good performance
    or investing a relatively higher but still cost-effective amount to achieve even
    better performance. This adaptability makes the proposed method a powerful tool
    for object detection in Brassica Chinensis growth monitoring, where data labeling
    can be resource-intensive. Download : Download high-res image (275KB) Download

    75.1 It is worth noting that, the soft-teacher (Xu et al., 2021) model, which
    performs exceptionally well on general-purpose large-scale datasets, does not
    translate into satisfactory performance on the Brassica Chinensis image datasets
    we have created. In the case of the simpler plant detection task, when labeled
    data is extremely scarce, the soft-teacher struggles to learn a reliable model
    from the limited labeled data. Consequently, the pseudo labels it generates for
    the unlabeled data can actually disrupt the training of the student model, leading
    to a final model performance worse than the baseline achieved through supervised
    training. In the wormhole detection task, characterized by a complex dataset containing
    numerous small and densely packed objects, the soft-teacher fails to establish
    an effective model for comprehending the semantic information within the images.
    As a result, it performs worse than the supervised baseline across all four settings.
    This stark difference in performance underscores the unique challenges posed by
    Brassica Chinensis datasets as compared to general-purpose large-scale datasets.
    Simply transferring algorithms that excel on general datasets to the specific
    datasets is not a feasible strategy. Beyond the pivotal mAP and AP50 metrics,
    Fig. 13 presents comparative results for additional metrics such as F1-score,
    Precision, and Recall on wormhole detection task. Notably, when using only 1 %
    of the total labeled images, the proposed method demonstrated impressive performance
    improvements, with a 14.0 % increase compared to the supervised training paradigm
    and a 2.2 % increase compared to unbiased-teacher (Liu et al., 2021a) in F1-score,
    which further underscores the method’s superiority. Download : Download high-res

    In Section 2.2, we have discussed the significance of three critical techniques,
    low threshold filtering, localization information, and decoupled training. In
    this section, we substantiate their effectiveness through experimental results.
    Given that the wormhole detection task is a more challenging scenario compared
    to plant detection and provides a clear distinction between better and poorer
    model performance, we conducted the ablation study in the wormhole detection context.
    Specifically, we used the 10 % setting for uniformity, which yields relatively
    large and robust result values. Table 7 presents the model''s performance under
    different filtering thresholds. It is evident that when conventional, larger threshold
    values like 0.6 or 0.7 are used, the model struggles to converge, yielding degenerated
    results unfit for applications in Brassica Chinensis monitoring. Conversely, when
    employing a threshold value that is too small, such as 0.2, the poor quality of
    pseudo labels also leads to convergence issues. Striking a balance, the best performance
    is achieved with a threshold value of 0.4. Table 8 illustrates the outcomes when
    comparing results with and without simple localization information under different
    filtering thresholds. Across all filtering thresholds, the results with localization
    information consistently outperform those without. This demonstrates that the
    inclusion of localization information in pseudo labels significantly benefits
    model training, enhancing the learning efficiency of the student model and ultimately
    improving the model''s overall performance. Table 9 presents the results of decoupled
    training, comparing outcomes under various filtering thresholds and regression
    thresholds. In Fig. 14, we summarize the best results under three conditions:
    without localization information, with simple localization information, and with
    decoupled localization information. It is noticeable that the model operates most
    effectively when the threshold falls within the range of 0.3 to 0.5. Remarkably,
    the configuration with decoupled localization information consistently outperforms
    the other two methods within this threshold range, demonstrating the crucial role
    of localization information and the efficiency of the decoupled optimization approach
    in utilizing pseudo labels’ localization information. However, it is also crucial
    to strike a balance when setting the regression threshold during decoupled training.
    Typically, the best results are achieved with a value slightly higher than filtering
    threshold, as excessively high values can have counterproductive effects. Table

    SSOD method is proposed for Brassica Chinensis growth monitoring. We have successfully
    tackled the substantial challenge of minimizing data labeling efforts while maximizing
    model performance in the context of object detection tasks for Brassica Chinensis
    growth monitoring. The proposed approach, an end-to-end SSOD method based on the
    versatile DETR, aligns well with scenes characterized by severe occlusion and
    complex backgrounds, and improves the post-processing of the teacher model''s
    predictions by eliminating NMS and adopting a more advanced bipartite matching
    assignment. Additionally, we have introduced innovative techniques like low threshold
    filtering and decoupled optimization. These techniques effectively address the
    class-imbalance problem and the multi-task optimization conflict problem. The
    comparative experiments with real-world Brassica Chinensis image datasets have
    yielded remarkable results, showcasing the proposed method''s ability to outperform
    current SOTA SSOD algorithms with minimal labeled data. This breakthrough not
    only significantly reduces costs associated with data labeling for training object
    detection models in Brassica Chinensis growth monitoring but also paves the way
    for accurate and efficient object detection applications in smart agriculture,
    including tasks like phenotypic measurement and pest control. The proposed algorithm
    is currently deployed on the server side, necessitating the transmission of images
    collected by any terminal device for processing. While our model''s detection
    speed is functional, there is room for improvement. In future work, we aim to
    enhance the model''s detection speed and explore the integration with real-time
    performance DETR-like object detection methods like RT-DETR (Lv et al., 2023)
    and DEYOv3 (Ouyang, 2023). This could potentially lead to deploying the method
    directly on the terminal device, enabling real-time analysis during monitoring.
    In addition, we also consider enhancing the model''s detection accuracy by integrating
    more sophisticated backbones, such as Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021b) and
    ConvNeXt (Liu et al., 2022). CRediT authorship contribution statement Haoyan Li:

    for smooth agricultural supply chain operations. We formulated invisible auction
    mechanisms that hide actual bid values and regulate information flows, combined
    with machine learning techniques for robust predictive analytics. While rule-based

    encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making, adaptable training algorithms
    help optimize model parameters from the data. A two-phase hybrid learning approach
    is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated using domain expertise
    for three key supply chain decision problems. Auction markets discover optimal
    crop demand–supply balancing and pricing signals. Fuzzy systems incorporate domain
    knowledge into interpretable crop-advisory models. An integrated evaluation of
    50 farms over five crop cycles demonstrated the high performance of the proposed
    edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network model compared with
    benchmarks. Introduction Modern agriculture faces unprecedented stresses, such
    as rising food requirements from global population growth and declining arable
    land and water resources [1]. However, farm yields have plateaued, making bridging
    the supply–demand gap impossible. These macro trends necessitate urgent improvements
    in agricultural efficiency to boost productivity by up to 70% with shrinking buffers.
    Climate change pressures like extreme weather events, soil degradation, biodiversity
    losses, and rising carbon emissions threaten ecological sustainability. Agriculture
    accounts for over 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the sizable decarbonization
    potential. However, the sector needs to catch up to manufacturing and transport,
    among other sectors, in sustainability initiatives [2, 3]. Enhancing agriculture''s
    environmental footprint requires data-driven transparency in the operational decisions
    that guide targeted interventions [4]. At the execution level, the sector exhibits
    deeply fragmented value chains, with numerous small-hold farmers and intermediary
    aggregators connected to processors and distributors. The high variability and
    ambiguity in biological crop cultivation processes also introduce decision complexity
    for stakeholders. Managing the complexity of agricultural workflow is currently
    manual-intensive, opaque, and localized. These macro and micro challenges create
    a burning platform for transforming traditional agriculture through emerging technologies.
    The promise of precision agriculture powered by data-driven automation offers
    step-change boosts in productivity, quality, sustainability, and resilience [5,6,7,8].
    Recent advancements in sensors, communication networks, edge computing, blockchain,
    machine learning, and artificial intelligence can be harvested to uplift agriculture.
    However, myriad barriers to adoption persist, limiting the technology-upgrade
    cycles. Hyperlocalization, characterized by the high spatial variability of farm
    ecology, including factors such as soil nutrition, moisture patterns, and disease
    risks, requires hyperlocal insights [9]. Centralized systems must capture these
    microclimatic nuances. In addition, decision ambiguity arises from biological
    uncertainties, weather volatility, and market variability, thus introducing ambiguities
    that require more structured solutions. Rigid automation often leads to suboptimal
    results or overcorrections that require stability. Furthermore, ecosystem opacity
    within the fragmented, multi-stakeholder agricultural network contributes to the
    need for more transparency regarding peer practices, supply–demand patterns, and
    fair pricing, inducing informality. While data-driven precision agriculture promises
    potential benefits, farmer data privacy requires thoughtful consideration. For
    instance, privacy-aware schemes for point-of-interest recommendations that are
    also relevant in agriculture for sensitive farm-specific plans [10, 11]. Lastly,
    inadequate infrastructure, particularly in terms of telecom, power, and public
    cloud infrastructure, remains a significant challenge for large-scale smart upgrades,
    especially in emerging rural regions with connectivity gaps [12, 13]. Decentralized
    architectures have demonstrated their robustness in addressing infrastructure
    limitations. Smart agricultural systems apply modern information and communication
    technologies to enhance productivity, profitability, sustainability, and traceability
    across the agricultural value chain, including cultivation, postharvest handling
    and processing, logistics, and marketing [14]. Edge computing refers to the paradigm
    of decentralized data processing, whereby computation and analytics are embedded
    in the data source rather than relying on a distant, centralized cloud infrastructure.
    In agriculture, intelligent edge devices can be embedded in farm equipment, storage
    warehouses, processing plants, and retail outlets [15]. Key-edge computing capabilities
    include real-time insight generation, decision autonomy, data filtering, and operational
    visibility. The edge-processing topology also enhances scalability, reliability,
    and sustainability. Hosting decentralized intelligence close to dispersed agricultural
    endpoints facilitates hyperlocal and instantaneous data-to-decision, even in remote
    terrain. Auction markets refer to transparent bidding mechanisms that facilitate
    efficient price discovery and clearing of trade volumes between multiple buyers
    and sellers. Continuous double auctions allow participants to place ask or bid
    quotes that dynamically match compatible offers concurrently [16]. However, real-world
    bidder psychology requires governance to ensure stability. Computational techniques
    such as reinforcement learning can model optimized bidding tactics. Overall, auctions
    simplify bilateral negotiations and enable liquidity on a global scale. While
    neural networks offer adaptable nonlinear function approximations, fuzzy logic
    facilitates interpretable reasoning that supports agricultural decision-making.
    Fuzzy systems can also generate natural language advisories for irrigation, fertilization,
    harvest timing, etc., customized for highly divergent individual farm microclimates,
    soil health, and crop varieties. Unlike black-box methods, the ability to handle
    ambiguity and provide explanations builds trust [17]. Fuzziness reflects the underlying
    continuity of biological processes. While prior works have studied aspects of
    edge computing architectures, auction mechanisms, and fuzzy optimization models
    individually for agriculture, an integrated approach synergizing these promising
    directions still needs to be developed. Specifically, existing edge computing
    proposals need to tailor generic paradigms to address unique agriculture sector
    needs arising from operational scale, decision complexity, and value chain fragmentation.
    Similarly, agricultural auction designs focus on pricing efficiency rather than
    holistic supply chain coordination, covering planning, matching, and sustainability.
    Finally, fuzzy techniques largely encode scientific principles lacking adaptable
    learning for personalized needs spanning diverse regional and crop-specific considerations.
    Our unified edge computing, auction, and fuzzy neural network approach is uniquely
    positioned to overcome these limitations through a context-aware, transparent,
    and data-driven smart agriculture automation solution connecting the fragmented
    production-consumption lifecycle. The integrated architecture can capture localized
    variations, balance supply–demand stability, resolve decision uncertainty, and
    enable traceability for next-generation precision agriculture needs at a global
    scale. By combining the complementary strengths across emerging technologies,
    the transformation of agricultural supply chains toward data-driven precision
    approaches is accelerated, ushering in the future of farming. Accordingly, the
    main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) We propose an edge computing
    framework tailored to agricultural requirements. The edge computing framework
    addresses several challenges by providing dense sensing coverage through various
    sensors, enabling preprocessing and model evaluation capabilities at the edge
    nodes, facilitating single-hop data transfer to cluster heads, implementing adaptive
    sensing to activate only the relevant nodes, and ensuring sustainability through
    a renewable solar energy supply. 2) We formulated invisible auction mechanisms
    that hide actual bid values and regulate information flows, combined with machine
    learning techniques for robust predictive analytics. 3) Rule-based fuzzy systems
    encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making, and adaptable training
    algorithms help optimize model parameters from data. A two-phase hybrid learning
    approach is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated using domain
    expertise for three key supply chain decision problems. The remainder of this
    paper is organized as follows. Related work section  reviews related studies.

    Edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for addressing the challenges
    of data processing and decision-making in agriculture. By bringing computations
    closer to the data sources, edge computing enables the real-time processing and
    analysis of agricultural data, thereby reducing latency and improving responsiveness.
    Several studies have explored the applications of edge computing in agriculture,
    including precision agriculture, smart irrigation, and livestock monitoring [18,19,20].
    In [21], the authors introduced a two-tier genetic algorithm methodology aimed
    at optimizing a data analysis artificial intelligence system designed to monitor
    the conditions of agricultural vehicles. The cost-effective approach can be deployed
    on smartphones using integrated microphones rather than relying on expensive IoT
    sensors. By conducting an in-depth examination of the functioning of rural economies
    facilitated by the Internet, the authors thoroughly investigated the benefits
    of the Internet platform introduced in the operation of rural economies [22].
    Auction mechanisms for agriculture Auction mechanisms are widely used in agriculture
    to facilitate the trading of agricultural products. These mechanisms provide a
    decentralized and efficient way for farmers to sell their products and for buyers
    to obtain the desired products. Various agricultural auction mechanisms have been
    proposed, including open, sealed bid, and Dutch auctions [23]. To address the
    challenges related to low computational efficiency and restricted benefit distribution
    in the auction process, in [24], the authors introduced a novel deep learning-based
    iterative bilateral auction algorithm. This innovative approach represents an
    improvement over existing methods by harnessing deep learning capabilities to
    enhance the auction process. In [25], the authors evaluated the pricing efficiency
    of a livestock auction market using a two-tier stochastic frontier model. In [26],
    the authors devised a novel method to separate valuations from observed and unobserved
    variations using professional land appraisals. Fuzzy and neural models Fuzzy and
    neural models have been extensively employed in agriculture to model and predict
    complex systems. Fuzzy models can capture the uncertainty and imprecision inherent
    in agricultural data, whereas neural models can learn from the data and make accurate
    predictions. These models have been applied to various agricultural problems,
    such as crop yield prediction, disease detection, and pest management [27,28,29,30].
    Remya and Sasikala developed a neuro-fuzzy prediction model to simulate the behavior
    of international trade analysis in the agriculture industry [31]. Remya explored
    various neural network topologies and investigated methods for optimizing and
    analyzing these networks with agricultural data [27]. Ramana et al. used a convolutional
    neural network to classify and detect leaf disease [32]. Bhojani and Bhatt developed
    an amended multilayer perceptron neural network with a new activation function.
    They revised random weights and bias values for crop yield estimation using different
    weather parameter datasets [33]. Zhang et al. presented a radar echo prediction
    method representing disastrous weather based on convolutional neural networks
    and long short-term memory networks [34]. In summary, emerging computational paradigms
    demonstrate significant potential in helping realize the vision of smart agriculture
    but require synthesis considering problem constraints. Our work aims to address
    this research gap through an integrated edge intelligence, market coordination,
    and decision optimization approach purpose-built for the sector. Edge computing-oriented
    smart agriculture System model This study presents an edge computing framework
    complemented by auction mechanisms and fuzzy optimizers that connect various supply
    chain stages, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overall framework Full size image Edge
    computing offers powerful capabilities that enable real-time monitoring and data-driven
    decision-making in smart agriculture. We propose an edge computing framework tailored
    to agricultural needs, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Proposed edge computing framework
    for smart agriculture Full size image The framework comprises three sections:
    the sensing layer, the edge computing layer, and the growth data model. Sensing
    layer The sensing layer consists of heterogeneous sensing devices deployed across
    agricultural fields to collect various crop and environmental parameters. Sensor
    nodes can be categorized as follows. Crop-monitoring nodes: Sense key parameters
    related to crop growth, health, and yield, including leaf area, canopy size, stem
    thickness, leaf color, crop height, and root size. Environmental monitoring nodes:
    Sense climatic parameters such as humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and soil
    nutrients. Sensor nodes include sensors, microcontrollers, wireless radios, power
    units, and other supporting circuits. Different wireless communication standards
    include WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and legacy protocols like Zigbee. LoRaWAN
    provides long-range connectivity that is particularly suitable for sparse farm
    deployment, whereas Wi-Fi and NB-IoT offer higher bandwidths [35]. Bluetooth is
    appropriate for short-range communications between proximal nodes. Let the heterogeneous
    sensor node set in the field be represented as follows: (1) where is the total
    number of deployed nodes, and we assume that each sensor node is aware of its
    location ( ) via either GPS or landmark-based localization. Nodes with overlapping
    sensing zones can collaborate to reduce redundancy. The sensor node set is divided
    into clusters based on the spatial proximity: (2) Clustering exploits locality
    to enable energy-efficient data routing. Each cluster has a cluster head elected
    dynamically that aggregates and relays data to the edge layer. Edge computing
    layer The edge computing layer comprises edge servers with significant computing
    power, storage, and analytics capabilities. We propose a heterogeneous edge computing
    architecture consisting of the following: Static edge nodes: Deployed at base
    stations in the field. Mobile edge nodes: Mounted on autonomous ground robots
    or UAVs. It provides blanket coverage through fixed nodes and targeted data collection
    through mobile nodes. The edge nodes are outfitted with solar panels, batteries,
    and wireless antennae to ensure sustainable off-grid operations. Key capabilities
    offered by the edge computing layer include (i) Cluster data aggregation: Combine
    sensor data from nodes within clusters; (ii) Preprocessing and storage: Filter
    noise, detect outliers and temporally store data; (iii) Growth stage identification:
    Classify current growth phase based on crop parameters; (iv) Analytics: Environmental
    and yield predictions via ML models; (v) Control policies: Adaptive sensing frequencies,
    irrigation levels etc. These edge-centric functions distribute computations closer
    to the sensors, avoid cluttering the cloud, and support real-time agriculture.
    Next, we formulated mathematical models for crop and environmental sensing data.  Growth
    data model We divide the crop lifecycle into phenological growth stages denoted
    by (3) The fuzzy cluster algorithm can determine from historical crop data. Let
    represent the crop parameter vector sensed across nodes at time ; denotes the
    th parameter, such as leaf area and plant height. We define a weighted crop indicator
    aggregating all parameters as follows: (4) where represents the relative importance
    of parameter . The growth stage at time can be estimated based on using a TSK
    fuzzy neural network. For example, if representing leaf area and plant height,
    and , then . 0.7 and 0.3 are the weights, while 0.6 and 0.8 are the parameter
    values. The weights scale the parameter values before summing. Edge computing
    framework Traditional wireless sensor network deployments for agricultural monitoring
    often suffer from several deficiencies, including manual measurements of parameters
    leading to sparse data, a lack of computational capabilities on nodes, long multi-hop
    routes causing delays and congestion, redundant sensing from overlapping nodes,
    and limited power availability restricting the system lifetime [36]. Collectively,
    these issues limit the efficiency and reliability of traditional WSNs in agricultural
    monitoring wireless sensor networks. Our proposed edge computing framework addresses
    several of these challenges by providing dense sensing coverage through a variety
    of sensors, enabling preprocessing and model evaluation capabilities at edge nodes,
    facilitating single-hop data transfer to cluster heads, implementing adaptive
    sensing to activate only relevant nodes, and ensuring sustainability through a
    renewable solar energy supply. This comprehensive approach aims to significantly
    enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of agriculture monitoring wireless sensor
    networks. Consequently, the framework can collect high-resolution spatiotemporal
    data to better capture crop dynamics. Furthermore, optimized sensing and computing
    policies reduce resource waste and data redundancy. For quantitative comparison,
    we evaluate key performance metrics in the experiment section. The decentralized
    architecture also enhances scalability for large farm acreages. Next, we detail
    the computational techniques implemented on the edge layer. The first functionality
    is accurately identifying phenological crop growth phases, allowing stage-specific
    sensing and interventions for precision agriculture. We formulate a fuzzy clustering
    approach using the Gath-Geva algorithm that minimizes within-cluster variance.
    Let historical crop data over time slots be represented as where is the parameter
    vector at slot . The crop cycle is divided into stages ( ) denoted by fuzzy partition
    matrix . Element defines the membership of slot in stage . The cluster centers
    are . We define classification coefficient and average fuzzy entropy as (5) The
    iterative fuzzy clustering algorithm tries to maximize and minimize . The steps
    are summarized as follows: Step 1. Initialize: Partition matrix , clusters , iterations
    , weight . Step 2. Compute cluster centers using membership . Step 3. Determine
    cluster covariance and prior probability. Step 4. Calculate fuzzy maximum likelihood
    distance measure. Step 5. Update partition matrix . Step 6. Repeat steps 2–5 until
    . Step 7. Choose optimal based on best and β . The defined method effectively
    divides the crop cycle into phenological growth phases, , matching the field duration.
    Next, we predicted the current stage based on the sensed indicators. To determine
    the growth phase, we designed a Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy neural network model
    comprising five layers: input, fuzzification, rule, aggregation, and output. The
    first layer accepts an input vector containing current measurements of crop parameters.
    The fuzzification layer converts the inputs into a fuzzy set with Gaussian membership
    functions: (6) where and are the center and width of the th MF for th input, respectively.
    The first-order TS rule base comprises rules of the form (7) where is a consequent
    parameter. The net output is computed as where firing strength . For training,
    we used an extreme learning machine to randomly initialize the input layer weights
    and optimize the output layer weights analytically using the Moore–Penrose inverse.
    For sequential online adaptation, a recursive least-squares estimate was employed.
    The integrated TS fuzzy neural network model can accurately estimate crop growth
    stage at any instant based on the sensed crop indicators . Stage-specific control
    policies are then enacted. Next, we present the optimization of environmental
    sensing parameters. Correlations exist between external environmental factors
    and internal crop development processes. For example, high humidity and soil moisture
    are vital for plant emergence and flowering. However, continuously measuring all
    the parameters is energy-intensive. We propose an optimization technique driven
    by gray relational analysis to select the relevant attributes. Let represent the
    crop indicator sample sequence and denote the th environmental parameter sequence
    over slots. The gray relational coefficient between and is defined as follows:
    (8) where is the resolution coefficient. The degree of gray correlation (DGC)
    over all slots is (9) A higher DGC implies greater relevance of that attribute.
    However, crop indicators have different priority levels depending on their growth
    stage. Let represent the weight of indicator determined by the variance at each
    stage. The weighted correlation measure is (10) Gray relational analysis ranks
    all parameters in order of relevance to the current growth stage. The top-ranked
    attributes that satisfy the sensing time constraint are selected for measurement
    by the nodes. This method minimizes the infeasible measurements that are invalid
    for that phase. We designed an adaptive distributed sensing mechanism for crop
    growth data collection that activates relevant nodes based on spatial coverage
    constraints. Let represent a set of selected sensor nodes. The centroid of the
    active nodes is derived as follows: (11) The Euclidean distance of candidate sensor
    to centroid is (12) Node having maximum distance measure is incrementally added
    to if the effective coverage area meets the threshold where (13) This distributed
    algorithm allows only the appropriate sensors to be selected, thereby avoiding
    redundant measurements. The pseudocode is presented in Algorithm 1. Algorithm
    1. Adaptive crop growth sensor selection This method allows the activation of
    only a subset of nodes, thus saving energy and minimizing data redundancy. Subsequently,
    we evaluated the overall system performance against traditional approaches. Integration
    of auction mechanisms and fuzzy neural networks While the edge computing framework
    manages real-time crop monitoring and data collection, market-based mechanisms,
    such as auctions and fuzzy optimization models, support decision-making for smooth
    agricultural supply chain operations. Auction mechanisms for agricultural markets
    Auction mechanisms have become essential tools for achieving efficient price discovery
    and facilitating the exchange of goods between multiple buyers and sellers. They
    have gained significant prominence in commodity markets, particularly agriculture.
    These include automated matching, where continuous double auctions automatically
    pair compatible ask and bid orders, thereby saving manual effort and ensuring
    suitable trades; price discovery, as the ongoing interaction of agents leads to
    the emergence of market-clearing equilibrium prices that reflect fair valuation;
    allocation efficiency, where auction-clearing algorithms allocate goods to buyers
    willing to pay the highest price, promoting allocative efficiency; and transparency
    provided by centralized order books, offering insight into current prices and
    market depth, unlike in opaque bilateral negotiations. In addition, auctions offer
    anonymity to buyers and sellers, thereby reducing information leaks. At the same
    time, electronic trading significantly lowers the overhead transaction fees associated
    with intermediaries and paper-based processes, making auctions more cost-effective.
    Furthermore, the convenience of online accessibility ensures geography-independent,
    round-the-clock market access and liquidity. Although auctions possess characteristics
    that make them suitable for facilitating large-scale agricultural trade between
    numerous fragmented producers and consumers, several critical limitations must
    be addressed. First, information asymmetry between buyers and sellers stemming
    from differing private cost functions can enable fraudulent practices through
    unfair arbitrage. Additionally, the influence of visible market positions on expectations
    can result in frequent trading of speculative forward contracts that do not align
    with the underlying agricultural assets, potentially causing market distortions.
    Finally, agricultural markets are highly susceptible to external shocks, such
    as weather damage and policy changes, leading to volatile reactions that must
    be managed effectively to function as auctions in this context. To address these
    issues, we formulated invisible auction mechanisms that hide actual bid values
    and regulate information flows, combined with machine learning techniques for
    robust predictive analytics. We propose an invisible auction framework for agricultural
    commodity markets with the following components: Bid encryption: The participant
    bid values are encrypted using homomorphic public-key cryptography instead of
    visible quotes. (14) where is the actual valuation, is the public key, and is
    the published bid. Order matching: The auctioneer matches encrypted bids and asks
    by checking: (15) where denotes decryption via secret key . Transaction logging:
    An immutable distributed ledger chain transparently records all historically successful
    transactions with associated encrypted bid values. Predictive analytics: Long
    short-term memory neural networks are trained on aggregated transaction data flows
    to forecast future price dynamics and crop yields. This framework enhances transaction
    transparency without compromising privacy. Long-term trends can be forecasted
    through data analytics, whereas real-time irrational biases are moderated by cryptography.
    Violations, if any, get automatically flagged through audits promoting accountability.
    Therefore, an invisible auction architecture insulates agricultural markets from
    volatility and manipulation. Notably, invisible auctions preserve the desirable
    properties of traditional continuous double auctions, such as dynamic matching,
    efficient allocation, fairness, transparency, and anonymity. Only the price discovery
    process is indirectly influenced by analytics instead of directly visible bid-ask
    quotes. Regulatory oversight further nullifies the possibility of fraudulent behavior.
    This combination of cryptographic protection, machine intelligence, and accountable
    regulation stabilizes the agricultural commodity markets. Executing trade contracts
    through self-enforcing smart contracts over blockchain networks fosters seamless
    supply chain coordination. Smart contracts encode business rules governing supply
    chain interactions like procurement planning, financing payoffs, quality checks,
    and logistics flows. Input data are fed from trusted gateways, such as IoT sensors,
    with logic execution automatically managing the workflows. Integrated exception
    handling, such as penalties, improves accountability. Such blockchain-managed
    smart contracts promote coordination, transparency, and automation across agricultural
    value chain entities in a decentralized manner. The synthesis of auctions and
    distributed automation holistically connects disparate supply chain stages into
    a coherent system. Fuzzy neural network formulation Fuzzy logic and neural networks
    provide complementary modeling capabilities. While neural networks offer adaptable
    training for arbitrary complex mappings, fuzzy systems facilitate their interpretability.
    We formulate an integrated 5-layer architecture, as shown in Fig. 3, tailored
    to agricultural decision scenarios dealing with ambiguous and incomplete knowledge.
    Fig. 3 Fuzzy neural network schematic Full size image The input layer represents
    the problem domain parameters. For the agricultural application, input variables
    span crop attributes, weather forecasts, soil conditions, and market rates derived
    from field sensors, satellites, and domain expertise. Let vector denote the input
    variables. The normalization modules transform the features into comparable numerical
    ranges using min–max normalization. (16) This preprocessing enhances the training
    stability. The input layer feeds the normalized variables into the fuzzification
    layer for linguistic modeling. Membership functions convert real-valued inputs
    into fuzzy sets, mapping them to a normalized interval. Commonly adopted forms
    include triangular, trapezoidal, Gaussian, and bell curves with tunable parameters.
    We utilize Gaussian membership functions for smoothness and concise representation
    as follows: (17) where is Gaussian center and denotes width. The membership functions
    transform agricultural inputs into overlapping fuzzy variables, such as LOW, MEDIUM,
    and HIGH temperature, and DRY, MODERATE, or WET soil moisture—granular discretization
    of the problem space results. The inference logic is encoded in the fuzzy rule
    base, aggregating input variable fuzzy sets to form output decisions. Popular
    compositional schemes include AND, OR, and NOT operators applied to antecedent
    clauses. We used conjunctive fuzzy rules, with each clause joined by an AND. (18)
    where denotes the fuzzy set of variable in rule and is the crisp rule output.
    For example, an example irrigation advisory rule may be (19) Domain experts formulate
    such fuzzy rules linking inputs to outputs using intuitive language. Automated
    methods also assist rulebase generation from data. The firing strength of the
    fuzzy rules indicates the degree of match with the inputs found by the fuzzy AND
    operator, which is typically implemented as (20) The firing strengths across the
    rule bases were aggregated using weighted average defuzzification for crisp decisions.
    (21) This generates robust aggregate outputs by combining recommendations from
    multiple rules applicable to the current agricultural situation. We applied a
    hybrid learning approach with gradient descent for parameter tuning from the data
    by adapting the output layer weights and the least mean square estimate to update
    the antecedent membership function parameters. Composite backpropagation regulates
    the model performance on yield prediction and disease diagnosis tasks while retaining
    transparency. The fuzzy neural network provides an accurate yet interpretable
    agricultural decision-making framework. Fuzzy model training algorithms While
    rule-based fuzzy systems encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making,
    adaptable training algorithms help optimize model parameters from the data. A
    two-phase hybrid learning approach is formulated. In the first phase, domain experts
    or clustering methods initialize the membership function parameters and rule bases.
    For example, the fuzzy variable MOISTURE can be defined as. (22) The membership
    functions translate the input moisture percentages into degrees of association
    with the fuzzified sets, LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH. Typical fuzzy rules then link
    the soil moisture status to irrigation amounts; for instance, (23) In the first
    phase, primitive fuzzy relationships are established between the inputs and outputs
    based on the principles of agricultural science. However, this initial model exhibits
    several drawbacks, including arbitrary membership function bounds, insufficient
    coverage of the rule base, inconsistent consequent actions, and a lack of consideration
    of relative rule importance. These limitations must be addressed to enhance the
    effectiveness and reliability of this model. Refining the primitive fuzzy system
    using data-driven adaptation alleviates these limitations and enhances performance.
    In the second phase, the model parameters were tuned based on streaming field
    observations of moisture levels, actual irrigation amounts, and crop yields. We
    formulated a two-step least-squares estimate (LSE) algorithm that minimizes the
    squared error loss between the fuzzy model outputs and the measured ground truth
    labels: (24) where represents fuzzy model output, is true label at time and denotes
    parameters. The hybrid LSE method decomposes into: (25) where maps inputs to rule
    firing levels dependent on antecedent parameters . The function aggregates rule
    outputs based on consequent weights . The two-step gradient descent iterate then
    becomes: (26) First, the membership function bounds were tuned to better match
    the field data associations. The second step rectifies the consequent actions,
    such as adjusting the irrigation amounts. Batch model retraining or sequential
    stochastic gradient descent helps automate the parameter learning. Therefore,
    the hybrid approach aligns the model variables and rules with the ground realities.
    For nondifferentiable aspects, evolutionary heuristics also assist in adaptation.
    The integrated data-driven training methodology optimizes fuzzy systems for reliable
    and context-aware agricultural decision-making support. Practical implementations
    have demonstrated order-of-magnitude improvements in prediction accuracy and rule-based
    optimization over nearly 3,000 crop cycles. The tailored fuzzy modeling paradigm
    offers transparent yet robust tools for precision agriculture. Fuzzy optimization
    of agricultural decisions Fuzzy systems offer efficient mechanisms for translating
    ambiguous input data into transparent agricultural decision-making policies. We
    use domain expertise to formulate fuzzy optimization models for three key supply
    chain decision problems. Precision agriculture requires the optimal dynamic allocation
    of resources such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides based on crop stages,
    weather patterns, and soil conditions. We encode this as a multi-objective optimization
    problem. (27) The objectives are to maximize crop yield and minimize resource
    consumption costs and environmental impacts, subject to resource availability
    constraints. We designed a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system with a rulebase:
    (28) where linguistic variables, such as LOW and MEDIUM, model soil moisture and
    resource application levels, respectively. Defuzzification converts fuzzy outputs
    into actionable irrigation and fertilization rates [37, 38]. Common strategies
    include the centroid, mean-max, and maximum criteria. The weighted aggregate response
    resolves multi-objective optimization tradeoffs for personalized crop requirements.
    Agricultural scientists formulated approximate fuzzy relationships using field
    studies. Adaptive tuning then calibrates the recommendations to local conditions
    for precision farming. Crop planning involves annual decision-making regarding
    portfolio mixes across produce, acreage allocation, and planting schedules. The
    Mamdani fuzzy scheme for long-term planning is as follows: (29) Linguistic variables
    guide area expansion, reduction, or the status quo for different crops, contingent
    on historical profits and forecast outputs. Fuzzy crop planners offer interpretable
    data-to-decision modeling that complements predictive analytics. Tuning replenishment
    quantities and frequencies for seeds, fertilizers, equipment, etc. minimizes warehousing
    costs. The Mamdani fuzzy policy relating inventory levels to supply variability
    is [39]: (30) Strategic rules minimize stock-out risks and wastage induced by
    agricultural demand uncertainties for efficient operation. Fuzzy inventory controllers
    allow the embedding of domain insights and adaptive calibration. Integrated fuzzy
    optimization paradigms enable automated and interpretable agricultural decision-making
    by translating data into actions while balancing the supply chain KPIs. Extensions
    using neural learning and evolutionary heuristics can further enhance predictive
    accuracy and adaptation capabilities. Quantitative evaluation metrics Rigorously
    benchmarking the performance of fuzzy modeling and optimization methods requires
    quantitative accuracy metrics calculated from agricultural data. We utilized regression-based
    measures for prediction tasks and an economic cost–benefit analysis for the decision
    optimization results. Prediction problems in agriculture deal with forecasting
    time-varying phenomena such as crop yields, prices, and demand. The following
    accuracy measures were adopted: Mean absolute error (31) where is the actual observation
    and is the model-predicted value at time . Root mean-squared error (32) Mean absolute-percentage
    error (33) Coefficient of determination (34) Lower MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values,
    along with higher values, indicate superior predictive accuracy. Time-series metrics
    facilitate the comparison of performance improvements from fuzzy models over statistical
    baselines through field trials. For agricultural decision support scenarios, fuzzy
    systems optimize complex multidimensional objectives and balance relevant domain
    tradeoffs. Quantifying the realized business value requires a cost–benefit analysis.
    Net present value (35) where NPV calculates net economic gain over a lifetime,
    accounting for the time value of money. Return on investment (36) Payback period
    (37) These financial indicators estimate the sustainability of optimized fuzzy
    decision-making policies for precision agricultural management. Comprehensive
    evaluation is facilitated in conjunction with domain performance metrics such
    as crop quality and soil ecology. Fuzzy model interpretability Unlike black-box
    AI techniques, fuzzy systems enable the interpretation of knowledge encoded within
    models of transparency and trust. We analyzed rule-based insight extraction along
    three axes: Fuzzy rules employ natural language acting as intuitive decision policies:
    (38) The keywords HIGH and LOW map raw inputs into representative categories based
    on the underlying membership functions, allowing cognitive unpacking of the model
    logic linking various agricultural variables. Domain experts can validate whether
    the recommendations match the expected crop patterns in that context. This contrasts
    with the inscrutable weights in deep neural networks. Furthermore, the fuzzy model
    adapts its linguistic knowledge bank when novel unseen data patterns emerge and
    updates the rules with new terms. Variable relevance heat maps help identify key
    agricultural drivers based on the frequency of appearance in the fuzzy rule antecedents.
    (39) Higher weight parameters were prioritized for data collection using appropriate
    field sensors. The domain significance was also uncovered, such as the dominant
    weather influence on soil nutrition. Heatmaps improve model transparency in a
    manner similar to a sensitivity analysis. The firing strength of the fuzzy rules
    on the new data samples indicates the usage frequency, allowing the calculation
    of the rule influence: (40) where is the number of rules, and rules with higher
    influence drive aggregated model decisions more critically and distinguish between
    redundant niche policies. Such analysis enhances user trust and model debugging.
    The integrated interpretation toolkit, consisting of intuitive fuzzy rules, diagnostic
    heatmaps, and influence metrics, boosts model transparency, which is crucial for
    credibility and adoption—the agriculture-specific explanations bridge skill gaps
    preventing black-box automation. Experiment and results analysis Results under
    edge computing-oriented smart agriculture We evaluated the edge-based smart agriculture
    framework on 50 prototype farms and compared the performance with that of traditional
    sensing architectures. The key metrics analyzed were the crop cycle duration error,
    growth stage prediction accuracy, energy consumption, and sensed data redundancy.
    The farms spanned a geographical area of 250 acres and was divided into 100 sensing
    cells with a cluster of 20 sensor nodes randomly distributed per cell. The nodes
    possessed temperature, humidity, CO2, and lighting sensors with LoRa communication
    links. A solar-powered edge server was present in each cell, with a computing
    capacity of 2 GHz clock and 8 GB of RAM. The edge nodes also had a cellular 4G
    hookup for cloud analytics. The key capabilities deployed were fuzzy growth phase
    classification, adaptive neural growth forecasting, gray relational parameter
    selection, and distributed cell selection policies. Specifically, time-series
    data collected from 50 farms over five crop cycles of 90 days each, totaling over
    22,500 h of data, has the characteristics: multivariate data encompassing crop
    yields, market auction prices, soil moisture content, temperature, humidity, nutrition,
    and rainfall. The data was aggregated from IoT sensors like soil probes and weather
    stations deployed across the 50 farms to measure crop and environment conditions
    online agriculture commodity trading platforms recording market prices. These
    edge intelligence modules guide dynamic sensor scheduling and data routing, subject
    to lifetime and coverage constraints. The integrated edge-fog cloud architecture
    provides flexibility to distribute analytics across devices, cells, and the global
    scope [40]. We cultivated cabbage over three 90-day crop cycles, with sensor measurements
    gathered at hourly intervals. Table 1 compares the performance of our edge computing
    framework with that of conventional cloud-based sensor networks in terms of key
    metrics. Table 1 System deployment results Full size table It can be observed
    that the integrated edge computing architecture demonstrates superior crop modeling
    capabilities with halved season estimation errors and 23% improved classification
    accuracy over legacy networks. Strategic sensor-scheduling policies based on growth
    phases minimize redundant data collection and overlaps. Furthermore, analytics
    co-location with data sources avoids expensive cloud transmissions and reduces
    energy requirements by over 20%. Streamlined data pipelines facilitate deeper
    field insights into the exact operational costs. Next, we analyze the detailed
    sensitivity toward the prediction and selectivity mechanisms underlying these
    agriculture 4.0 productivity gains. The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2
    Cabbage growth phase accuracy Full size table Fuzziness captures intermediately
    transitioning states better than rigid discrete models. Furthermore, Table 3 shows
    that the classification approach is computationally efficient, requiring only
    14 mJ of energy and delivering 77% of the lifetime gains. Hence, edge computing
    enables advanced analytics by using frugal models on tight mobile platforms. Table

    scheme dynamically detects relevant attributes over the cabbage crop cycle using
    gray relational analysis, with the Pearson coefficient as a similarity metric.
    Table 4 shows the nutrient requirements, which varied across the seeding, vegetation,
    and pre-maturity stages. Our model automatically activated the corresponding sensors,
    MOISTURE during growth and NPK during flowering. Table 4 Representative parameters
    across cabbage phenology Full size table Such automated tuning of pertinent factors
    enhances efficiency; on average, only 21% of the available sensors are triggered
    per phase. Domain knowledge fusion achieves sparsity without compromising coverage.
    Edge analytics extract contextual execution policies that are challenging to infer
    as centralized. The decentralized sensor coordination protocol dynamically partitions
    cells into active sensing zones and candidate regions iteratively minimizing the
    (41) The distance metric ensures that dispersed sensors are selected, thereby

    faster to local moisture fluctuations. Table 5 shows evidence that decentralized
    coordination minimizes the number of active nodes and saves intranet routing overhead
    for fog computing gains. Table 5 Distributed optimization savings Full size table
    The integrated edge intelligence pillars achieved significant analytical enhancements
    while minimizing costs and demonstrating system-wide data-to-decision transformations.
    Field trials have validated that technology synergies unlock considerable efficiencies.
    In addition to productivity, environmental sustainability is enhanced through
    optimized resource usage. Evaluation under integration of auction mechanisms and
    fuzzy neural networks We evaluated the performance of the developed agricultural
    supply chain architecture by integrating edge computing, auction markets, and
    fuzzy optimization models across multiple metrics: crop price and yield forecasting
    accuracy, supply chain cost reduction, carbon footprint minimization, revenue
    and profit enhancements, and operational efficiency improvements. The field trial
    involved a consortium of 50 farmers producing corn and wheat varieties and selling
    them to 75 consumers via online auction platforms throughout five crop cycles.
    Transaction data flowed into analytical models that predicted seasonal averages
    for crop prices, production yields, and demand levels. These are fed into planning
    modules that encode domain constraints and business rules to issue quantity and
    portfolio recommendations in response to emerging dynamics. For prediction accuracy,
    the proposed edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network (EC-aFNN)
    should be compared with the four benchmarks: (i) BMAE-Net [41]: data-driven weather
    prediction network, (ii) Bayesian neural network (BNN) [42]: corn yield prediction
    based on remotely sensed variables, (iii) random forest regression (RFR) [43]:
    yield and quality prediction of winter rapeseed (iv) dingo-optimized sand piper
    (DOSP) [44]: automatic crop yield prediction framework designed with two-stage
    classifiers, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Forecasting performance comparison Full
    size image Superior accuracy metrics directly and positively affect various aspects
    of smart agricultural supply chain operations. Enhanced crop planning enabled
    by more precise yield and price forecasting allows farmers to develop data-driven
    sowing plans for the next season by considering soil conditions, water availability,
    and risk reduction. This accuracy also supports effective procurement optimization
    as it helps suppliers adjust inventories through calibrated stochastic ordering
    policies, thus minimizing waste. Additionally, efficient logistics coordination
    becomes possible by zonally matching the expected supply and consumption through
    granular forecasts, thereby facilitating right-sized transportation planning.
    Moreover, the stability of market dynamics improved significantly. The deep visibility
    of long-term trends through fuzzy models moderates speculative volatility and
    reduces irrational panic buying and selling. Furthermore, personalized recommendations
    can be tailored to individual farms based on hyperlocal crop-choice suggestions
    and cultivation advisories derived from precise geospatial predictions. Automation
    plays a crucial role, with smart contracts encoding decision rules around procurement
    quantities, shipping sizes, etc. These contracts automatically execute transfers
    based on reliable forecasts. In summary, integrated edge computing, auction markets,
    and fuzzy neural network architectures deliver accuracy improvements that drive
    data-driven, transparent automation, harmonize supply and demand, and lead to
    quantifiable enhancements in sustainability, profitability, and resilience throughout
    the agricultural value chain. Optimized production and delivery coordination minimizes
    waste across agricultural value chain stages, as shown in Fig. 5. Total food loss
    was reduced by 29%, thus lowering operational costs. Fig. 5 Food wastage reduction
    across supply chain Full size image Across all stages, the EC-aFNN architecture
    provides superior food waste reduction compared with state-of-the-art benchmark
    food supply chain models, leading to enhanced sustainability. Supply chain transparency
    and coordination eliminate excess resource usage, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Agricultural
    sustainability enhancements Full size image It can be observed that the integrated
    edge computing, auction markets, and fuzzy optimization framework provide 31–55%
    superior sustainability improvements along with energy, water, fertilizer, and
    pesticide reduction over the BNN, which highlights the strengths of our approach.
    Transparent price discovery boosted per-acre incomes for individual farmers, as
    shown in Fig. 7. Speculation risks declined through auction regulations, enhancing
    stability. Fig. 7 Increase in farmer profits per acre of land Full size image
    It can be observed that EC-aFNN architecture provides 37% superior profitability
    improvements per acre over the best benchmark BNN. Enhanced forecasting accuracy
    directly boosted incomes by eliminating wastage. The integrated edge computing,
    auction markets, and fuzzy optimization framework deliver accuracy improvements
    that drive data-driven, transparent automation, harmonize supply and demand, and,
    in turn, lead to quantifiable enhancements in sustainability, profitability, and
    resilience throughout the agricultural value chain. This study attributes the
    per-acre profitability gains to a combination of factors. These include enhanced
    price discovery and stability via auction market regulations, which, coupled with
    improved forecasting accuracy that reduced waste, led to increased incomes. Additionally,
    the data-driven and transparent automation enabled by the integrated framework
    played a crucial role in these gains. Moreover, the synergistic fusion of edge
    computing, auctions, and fuzzy techniques contributed significantly to the overall
    improvements in profitability. Figure 8 shows the improvements in operational
    key performance metrics. Fig. 8 Improvements in operational key performance metrics
    Full size image It can be observed that the integrated EC-aFNN architecture provides
    up to 43% superior improvements in asset utilization and service levels compared
    to the best benchmark model, BNN. Transparent information exchange and collaborative
    planning enabled right-sizing capacities to balance demand fluctuations. Therefore,
    the integrated architecture realizes quantifiable enhancements across key supply
    chain indices. A detailed comparative analysis substantiates the synergistic fusion
    of emerging technologies that transform traditional fragmented agriculture through
    informed automation. Conclusion Precision agriculture promises immense benefits
    but is hindered by fragmentation, opacity, and decision complexity. In this study,
    an integrated edge computing, auction, and fuzzy optimization approach was developed
    to address these barriers. The decentralized edge paradigm hosts localized crop
    analytics and provides real-time advisories. Apart from transparent price signals,
    auction mechanisms balance supply and demand. Fuzzy techniques allow domain knowledge
    to be encoded into interpretable crop-recommendation models. The integrated evaluation
    of a 50-farm consortium substantiates its outperformance over conventional approaches:
    31% supply chain cost reduction through lowered waste, 37% per acre profit increase
    via auction efficiency, 55% carbon emissions decrease using sustainability analytics,
    and 43% raised asset utilization from the sharing economy. A streamlined data-to-action
    architecture provides a robust, transparent, and efficient solution tailored to
    diverse agricultural requirements. While the integrated edge computing and auction-based
    fuzzy agriculture framework provide significant enhancements, certain limitations
    must be addressed in the future. Microclimate spatial variability, even within
    farms, necessitates adaptable recommendations by incorporating aerial/satellite
    imagery analysis to achieve localized precision. Additionally, resilience to unexpected
    severe weather events via climate ensemble simulations will make the system robust
    despite disruptions to harvest cycles. Simultaneously, expansions can enrich structured
    knowledge through formal agriculture ontology and semantics, elucidating soil,
    climate, and crop interrelationships. Optimized water conservation based on moisture
    patterns, supplemental controlled irrigation, and permissible stress thresholds
    present another sustainment opportunity. Furthermore, significant renewable energy
    potential exists at farms for solar, wind, and biofuels to attain carbon–neutral
    operations. Incorporating these limitations and proposed future enhancements centered
    on robust, adaptable models, geospatial intelligence, sustainability, and structured
    decision formalization will accentuate practical impact while opening longer-term
    possibilities. Availability of data and materials No datasets were generated or

  description: Poultry farming is crucial to feeding the world's growing population.
    Birds' abnormal behaviour can harm the birds, and disease detection relies on
    poultry behaviour. Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology into poultry
    farming can revolutionize the way to monitor and manage poultry health. Feeding,
    preening, and dustbathing are poultry's daily routines. In response to the problem
    of detecting correct poultry behaviour and health status, this paper proposes
    a smart poultry monitoring system that leverages IoT sensors to detect and monitor
    chicken behaviour in poultry farms and provides valuable information to industry
    stakeholders for management decisions and individual poultry health status. The
    phases of the proposed system are data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature

    Poultry farming is crucial to feeding the world''s growing population. Birds''
    abnormal behaviour can harm the birds, and disease detection relies on poultry
    behaviour. Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology into poultry farming
    can revolutionize the way to monitor and manage poultry health. Feeding, preening,
    and dustbathing are poultry''s daily routines. In response to the problem of detecting
    correct poultry behaviour and health status, this paper proposes a smart poultry
    monitoring system that leverages IoT sensors to detect and monitor chicken behaviour
    in poultry farms and provides valuable information to industry stakeholders for
    management decisions and individual poultry health status. The phases of the proposed
    system are data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and detection
    of poultry behaviour via different classification algorithms. An optimized synthetic
    minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) via an artificial hummingbird algorithm
    (AHA) is applied to solve the data imbalance problem. The experimental results
    show that an optimized SMOTE obtains better accuracy with 97 % than other algorithms.
    Further, to attain accuracy in predicting poultry behaviours, Random Forest (RF)
    achieves superiority compared to other machine learning algorithms with an accuracy

    hummingbird optimization algorithm 1. Introduction Nowadays, some diseases are
    particularly important because of the significant economic liabilities that aggravate
    poultry production. But there is also a fair amount of risk involved in the chicken
    farming industry [1], as shown by the sheer number of chicken farming companies
    that have failed because of various difficulties [2]. Precision animal and poultry
    farming relies on the monitoring of animal data and a reliable decision-making
    aid. Numerous things, including financial difficulties, illnesses, poor livestock
    management, and other things, can cause this phenomenon. In the chicken farming
    industry, problems are often caused by mistakes and a lack of care in how chickens
    are managed and cared for. Chickens are an important part of achieving the worldwide
    need for low-fat, high-protein foods. For centuries, the poultry industry has
    been trying to meet the growing demand for chicken and eggs. Consumers'' worries
    about the chicken they buy are on the rise, along with the industry''s response
    to rising demand. When it comes to the health and safety of the consumer and the
    quality of poultry products, animal welfare is of paramount importance. The health
    of poultry products is always enhanced by good animal welfare because it decreases
    the prevalence of disease in poultry chickens. Chickens are notorious for spreading
    disease among themselves and across entire farms, which has led to significant
    economic losses in the poultry sector [3]. Reducing losses and slowing the spread
    of disease in poultry flocks through early detection of sick birds by labelling
    or classifying individuals based on their behaviour. Poultry farming has attracted
    an increasing number of researchers in recent years [4]. Using the Internet of
    Things (IoT) and analysis of images, as well as other technologies that assist
    farmers in poultry health administration and surveillance to track and maintain
    manufacturing information in real-time, other researchers create online platforms
    and employ smart sensors [5]. The process of extracting information entails analysing
    the statistical properties of the raw data before defining an extensive hierarchy
    of the features extracted for upcoming analyses of novel/unknown instances. But
    things like the shape and size of the data, the loudness and unstructured data,
    attribute values loss, imbalanced data, and redundant data tend to make it harder
    for data mining processes to find patterns that make sense. By leveraging interconnected
    devices and sensors, IoT enables real-time monitoring of animal behaviors, offering
    insights into movement, interactions, and health status [6] employed IoT sensors
    to track pet cat behaviors, revolutionizing our understanding of their habits
    and ecological dynamics. Despite the numerous methods available, data can be classified
    in various ways and there are problems that affect its accuracy and efficiency.
    One of the most important problems that affect classification is the imbalance
    of data, which consequently affects the extraction of accurate features. Imbalanced
    datasets are characterized by a significant disparity in the number of samples
    among different classes [7]. The performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers
    suffers as a result of this difficult problem of uneven class distribution. As
    a result, a vast literature has focused on enhance the performance of machine
    learning classifiers to handle imbalanced datasets [8]. Other factors besides
    class imbalance should be considered when classifying imbalanced data, such as
    sample size and class overlap. There are multiple approaches for oversampling
    imbalanced datasets that increase the minority class into the majority class,
    such as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) [9]. SMOTE uses
    interpolation to create additional minority class examples in regions close to
    the existing ones. In spite of its potential to increase minority class accuracy,
    this method often introduces noisy instances and overfitting issues because it
    ignores the distribution of neighbouring samples. Sampling techniques are required
    for processing imbalanced datasets. There are three main methods for balancing
    the distribution of negative and positive classes; they are positive instances,
    negative instances, and combination sampling between positive and negative instances.
    Data mining techniques [10] can be applied to the series data that is extracted
    from these IoT sensors to gain insight into the behaviour of animals. There is
    frequently a significant amount of imbalance when a decision-making process is
    applied to isolate a special circumstance. The issue of imbalance has received
    more focus in recent years. Many practical contexts feature imbalanced data sets,
    including identifying dishonest phone users, spotting oil spills in satellite
    radar images, teaching word pronunciation, categorizing texts, spotting fake phone
    calls, and carrying out information retrieval and filtering tasks. The classification
    of imbalanced data has attracted a lot of attention. Already in the review [11],
    over 500 papers were gathered and explored in terms of applied methods and actual
    outcomes on data sets. Most publications, highly specialized workshops, and conferences
    have increased dramatically since then. There is ongoing research into better
    ways to categorise imbalanced data. There are a few ways to handle imbalanced
    datasets, including under-sampling the data in the majority class, over-sampling
    the minority class, or a hybrid of the two. The main contributions of this paper
    are summarized as follows: • Design a smart poultry monitoring system that detects
    and monitors the behaviours of the chickens in poultry farms. • Handling an imbalanced
    dataset using an optimized SMOTE via the artificial humming optimization algorithm
    • Prediction of the poultry''s behaviours via different machine learning techniques.
    • Detection of poultry disease status via the classification of sick and healthy
    chickens on a poultry farm according to poultry behaviours. • Selection of the
    best features from extracted new features using feature selection-based optimization.
    • Provides a performance validation comparison between various algorithms. The
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses other studies that are related
    to this paper. The preliminaries, like the essential concepts for SMOTE and the
    standard optimization algorithm for the artificial hummingbird, are provided in
    Section 3. Section 4 describes the details of the proposed poultry system. The
    measures of performance evaluation are discussed in Section 5. The experiment
    results are discussed in Section 6. Section 7 discusses the paper''s conclusion
    as well as future work. 2. Literature review Traditional classification algorithms
    suppose a balanced training dataset, but they struggle to identify minority classes.
    Traditional classification algorithms perform poorly on class-imbalanced datasets.
    On the other hand, since the uncommon classes typically represent intriguing concepts,
    it is typically most crucial to identify the minority classes. Furthermore, gathering
    these minority class examples can be costly or difficult. The uneven distribution
    in the datasets is what gives rise to the issue of class imbalance. As a result,
    it makes sense to think about rebalancing through the data space sampling to lessen
    the impact of class imbalance. One benefit of such a solution is that it can be
    used regardless of the classifier, so it can also be used as a pre-sampling technique.
    Under-sampling and over-sampling are the two fundamental concepts that are at
    the core of resampling methods, which are used to achieve a more equitable class
    distribution. The terms \"random under-sampling\" (RUS) and \"random over-sampling\"
    (ROS) refer to the elimination of representative samples from the majority classes
    and the systematic duplication of examples from the minority classes, respectively.
    The most prominent over-sampling method is SMOTE [12], which has garnered a lot
    of interest in recent years. A hybrid method was proposed for pre-processing imbalanced
    datasets by [13] for generating new samples using SMOTE and rough set theory.
    They noticed excellent average results from the experimental findings. Similarly,
    [14] introduced the Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling Technique (MWMOTE)
    to address issues with unbalanced learning. The method first identifies samples
    from the minority class that are challenging to learn and gives them weights based
    on their Euclidean distance from the closest majority samples. The SMOTE algorithm
    was utilized by [15] to resample the data, which they paired with a collection
    of extreme learning machines, a feature selection ensemble, and a decision tree
    (DT) to develop an original mechanism for forecasting the future to predict the
    two-class imbalance. A new semi-supervised adversarial generative adversarial
    network with spectral normalisation was proposed by [16]. (SN-SSCGAN). The idea
    behind it is to use minority fault samples that have been partially labelled to
    rebalance the dataset, it is necessary to produce additional samples with a comparable
    spread. To obtain a time-frequency matrix and to address these issues, a pre-process
    such as smooth the vibration signal using the wavelet transform is implemented,
    second, adversarial training is used to achieve Nash equilibrium on the partially
    labelled time-frequency fault data before generating data with a similar distribution.
    Random under-sampling (RUS) and the AdaBoost algorithm are two sampling techniques
    that have been used extensively in research that builds on ensemble learning [17].
    Because of the unpredictability of the random sampling technique, instances may
    occasionally not be representative, making it difficult to see how the model can
    be improved. [18] proposed the SMOTE Boost algorithm for building a balanced and
    high-quality dataset. In [19], authors use Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to
    gather information about waste features like waste bin size, waste size, and smell
    in the bin to alert truck drivers, waste management, and authorities. In addition
    to solving the problem of missing data and choose best optimal path for waste
    truck from disposal center to suitable waste bins in many different places in
    the city have embedded devices. An intelligent method was proposed by [20] who
    implemented it to detect and classify chickens based on their vocalization and
    using fisher discriminate analysis (FDA) using signals detection to sort healthy
    chickens from sick ones. [21] Detect method for avian influenza according to the
    sound (noise) analysis of poultry via SVM. By examining the poultry chickens''
    feces, it is possible to keep track of their behaviour and make an early infection
    diagnosis [22]. A managed lighting environment and an IR camera have been used
    to determine the number of chickens in poultry [23]. [24] proposed an IoT platform
    that allows for the real-time analysis of each hen''s egg production, enabling
    the substitute of chicken whose egg production falls below a predetermined level
    to achieve the overall target egg yield rate. The health, cleanliness, and growth
    of the poultry chickens were determined by tracking their [25]. One of the factors
    contributing to poor poultry welfare is lameness [26], and when lameness is detected
    early, farmers and veterinarians can take preventative measures. Table 1 summarizes
    the related work including the data sets type, used techniques, the main contribution,
    and limitations. The majority of the existing literature focuses on predicting
    diseases in poultry, and other research deals with imbalanced databases. But it
    did not consider the imbalance of data when detecting behaviours and diseases
    in poultry. Most of the previous research largely lacked an effective strategy
    for boosting the real-world effectiveness of a model trained with an imbalanced
    dataset when detecting diseases in poultry. Table 1. The relevant literature summaries.

    Technique (SMOTE) [27] is regarded as an improved version of the randomized oversampling
    technique that increases the classifier''s validation dataset generalization capability
    and lowers the likelihood of overfitting. By adding a synthetic minority class
    to the original dataset between the minority class and its nearest neighbours
    using random linear interpolation, it focuses on enhancing the dataset''s imbalance.
    The imbalanced data issue is ameliorated by SMOTE. The specific concept is put
    into practice as follows: Identity data set X''s k closest neighbours in the minor
    class, choose n samples at random, and record them as Xi. Finally, interpolation
    defines the new sample Xnew as defined in Eq. (1): (1) Where rand represents a
    random number uniformly distributed within the range of (0, 1). But there are
    some issues with the SMOTE algorithm Fig. 1. The choice of the value for k is
    unrelated to the selection of the nearest neighbors. Additionally, replicating
    the distribution of the original data is challenging due to potential repeatability
    issues and the presence of noisy, indistinct boundaries between the classes of
    positive and negative in the artificially generated samples from the minor class
    samples located at the periphery. Download : Download high-res image (224KB) Download

    hummingbird optimization algorithm (AHA) A brand-new bio-inspired algorithm is
    introduced the Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA) has been proposed by [28]
    to address global optimization problems. The world''s smallest bird and most beautiful
    creature. To the extent that brain size correlates with overall intelligence,
    hummingbirds would rank at the top of the animals. Hummingbirds have a top speed
    45 km/h. While some of the smallest seeds can reach speeds of over 80 beats per
    second, the largest seeds can emerge in the air at a rate of about 12 beats per
    second. Hummingbirds must forage to maintain their metabolism, and nectar tends
    to make up a majority of their nutrition. AHA consists of three components as
    follows: ■ Sources of Food: the decision of hummingbird on which flower to visit
    next for food depends on several factors, including the quality and content of
    flower nectar, and the refill rate of the flower nectar, and the hummingbird''s
    previous frequency of visits to the flower. ■ Hummingbirds: Each species of hummingbird
    has its unique food source, and the hummingbird and its source of the food are
    always in the same relative location. When a hummingbird finds a reliable source
    of nectar, it will tell the other members of its population where to find it and
    how often it will be refilled. ■ Visit Table: For each food source, data on the
    visit level is kept, which indicates how long it has been since the same hummingbird
    last visited that particular source. Initialization phase: Hummingbirds in a population
    of n are distributed at random among n food sources using Eq. (2). (2) The upper
    and lower boundaries are denoted as Low and Up respectively, while xi ''s representation
    of the location of the ith food source. The visit table is illustrated by Eq.
    (3). (3) Foraging with a guide: Every hummingbird possesses an inherent inclination
    to visit the food source containing the highest volume of nectar. Consequently,
    a desirable food source should exhibit a high rate of nectar refilling and a longer
    duration between visits by a particular hummingbird. To facilitate guided foraging
    behaviour, a hummingbird is permitted to identify food sources based on their
    visit levels and subsequently choose the one with the highest nectar-refilling
    rate as its target source. Once identified, the hummingbird can then direct its
    flight towards the desired food source. Three types of flight maneuvers, namely
    omnidirectional, diagonal, and axial flights, are employed for foraging purposes,
    as outlined from Eqs. (4) to (6). (4) (5) (6) The function generates a random
    number ranging from 1 to d, while randperm(k) produces a random permutation of
    numbers ranging from 1 to k. Additionally, r1 represents a random number that
    falls within the range of 0–1. A. Foraging on the frontier: After a hummingbird
    finish consuming all the nectar from its target food source, it prefers to forage
    for food in new locations rather than revisit old ones. Consequently, Hummingbirds
    are able to move freely between different parts of their territory using Eqs.
    (7) & (8). (7) (8) The factor of territorial, denoted as b, has a normal distribution,
    which describes it by N(0,1). Where 0 is mentioned as the mean and 1 is the standard
    deviation. B. Foraging migration: If the food supply in a hummingbird''s regular
    feeding spot dwindles, it may move to a nearby flower bed, the hummingbird typically
    undertakes a migration to a farther food source for feeding purposes. Hummingbird
    migration behaviour can be modelled using Eq. (9) by first determining the source
    with the lowest nectar-refilling rate and then simulating the bird''s transition
    to a new source that is generated randomly. (9) xwor represents the food source
    within the population that possesses the poorest nectar-refilling rate. 4. The
    proposed smart poultry monitoring system (SPMS) The utilization of wearable sensing
    devices enables the precise observation of individual chickens, as they are tracked
    and monitored for a specific period of time. Rapid trends in sensing technology
    have reduced the cost of such devices, making sensor-driven data analysis a more
    viable option. More recent research has also helped to enhance data collection
    techniques for livestock and poultry farming by making use of wearable sensing
    devices [29]. This paper proposes a smart poultry monitoring system to classify
    poultry behaviours that affect the status of poultry (sick or healthy). Fig. 2
    depicts the overall architecture of the proposed system. Download : Download high-res

    of the proposed system. 4.1. Dataset description phase The process of obtaining
    the desired input data from various resources is known as the dataset collection
    phase. Data size and data characteristics were all considered during the data
    collection process. By placing wearable accelerometers over individual chickens,
    the research [30,31] created a dataset of poultry. The data stores three-axis
    chicken data, which depicts the behaviours of poultry chickens like dustbathing,
    preening, and pecking. Both healthy and sick chickens were included in the dataset
    of these activities. The external parasites covering the chickens'' skin were
    purposefully embossed by the researchers, stressing the animals. The data generated
    from the sensor, which is attached to the chicken''s back to collect data, can
    be used to record a wide range of natural behaviours. The Activity AX3 sensor
    is a tri-axial accelerometer, measuring static and dynamic acceleration on three
    orthogonal axes (X, Y, and Z) and weighing only 11 g. The X, Y, and Z axes were
    all oriented dorsoventrally, laterally, and anteriorly-posteriorly, respectively.
    The sensor is set up with a 100 Hz sampling frequency and +/− 8 g sensitivity,
    allowing for two weeks of continuous data collection on a single charge. The following
    actions are hypothesised to be related to poultry health based on a survey of
    the available literature [32]. The 24 unique poultry chickens distributed among
    four different flocks make up the 20-week dataset. The dataset includes the daily
    averages for each chicken''s pecking, preening, and dustbathing in six different
    flocks. The available poultry behaviour dataset attributes are shown in Table
    2 which describes raw data X, Y, and Z axes of the accelerometer which describes
    the chicken behaviours cases. Table 2. Description of tri-axial accelerometer
    raw data. Raw data Description X-axis Is a horizontal axis that runs from left

    axis that runs perpendicular to the X-axis and Y-axis. Class Describes the behaviour
    (Peaking/Feeding, preening, and dustbathing) of poultry according to three axes.
    Table 3 describes the three labelled behaviour classes. Fig. 3 demonstrates pre-processing
    of raw data are created from the input labelled data (pecking, preening, and dustbathing).
    The labelled dataset was used to feed the model and then used to validate it.

    before preprocessing. 4.2. Data preprocessing phase The data from an accelerometer
    comprises readings from three float numeric axes (x, y, z). All the identified
    exercises are confined within the range of [−8, 8] for each axis. Subsequently,
    these readings were employed to identify three behaviours: pecking/feeding, preening,
    and dustbathing. The size of dataset is 176,154 records before data cleaning.
    The dataset size after cleaning and deleting all the duplicate data is 99,998
    records. To prepare the data for the classification process, it will go through
    several processes. Data cleaning (removing zeros values) and data duplication
    are the processes involved. According to the techniques employed during the classification
    model, the raw data is formatted into the necessary system. In essence, the decision
    class is included at the end of the entire column, and the data is presented using
    an r * c matrix, where r and c represent several rows and columns, respectively.
    The best advantage of pre-processing is that it helps to minimize data redundancy
    and improve overall dataset organization. To improve classification results, perform
    a feature selection task to extract a subset of pertinent features from the dataset.
    This task also helps eliminate the possibility of incorrect training by removing
    redundant features and noise. Fig. 4 demonstrates tri-axial accelerometer data
    after removing null values, zero classes, and duplicate records. Download : Download

    phase A systematic evaluation was conducted to determine the usefulness and significant
    features for distinguishing between various activities by employing different
    classification models and ranking their importance. Classification models were
    used to identify the relative importance of the seventeen features. The process
    of feature extraction was carried out via MATLAB (2019a). There are 17 instant
    characteristics through 3D accelerations (X, Y, Z), Single Magnitude Area (SMA),
    Average Intensity (AI), Movement Variation (MV), Energy, and Entropy were calculated
    via formulas listed in Table 4, where i is the record index, were chosen according
    to the length of time each behaviour lasted. For instance, feeding/pecking typically
    take very little time, about one peck per second, when compared to the time it
    takes a broiler to preening, which is roughly 3 s for 4 steps. This resulted in
    a total number of features, all of which were incorporated into the model training
    process. Table 4. Formulations for motion characteristics of broilers utilizing

    models were employed systematically to evaluate the utility of features and identify
    the most significant ones for distinguishing between different activities. In
    the field of data science, it is essential to determine the most relevant features
    within a dataset for training learning algorithms [33]. Some features may not
    contribute to improving the performance of the learning algorithm and can even
    degrade its accuracy. Consequently, feature selection (FS) algorithms are utilized
    to identify a subset of features that can enhance the machine learning model''s
    performance. FS algorithms also help prevent overfitting and expedite the training
    process of the learning algorithm. Furthermore, knowledge about the selected features
    can provide valuable insights into the datasets. 4.4.1. Fitness function The hummingbird
    swarm consists of individual birds, each representing a solution for feature selection.
    These birds are encoded using real numbers, as demonstrated in Eq. (10). Each
    solution, denoted as X, is comprised of n real numbers, n denotes the overall
    features of the dataset being analysed. The xi dimension of X corresponds to the
    decision of selecting or not selecting a particular feature. To form a subset
    of features, a decoding process must be performed on the bird''s position. This
    allows for the conversion of the bird''s position into a subset of selected features.
    (10) (11) The subset of features obtained after decoding the d-dimensionality
    of each solution is represented by Sd in Eq. (11). The value of xd in the d-dimension
    determines whether Sd is selected as 0 or 1. If xd corresponds to a selected feature,
    then Sd is set to 1. Conversely, if xd corresponds to a non-selected feature,
    then Sd is set to 0. Feature selection aims to identify an optimal combination
    of features that optimize the accuracy of classification while reducing the number
    of selected features. While it involves finding a suitable combination of features,
    the primary objective is to optimize the classification accuracy. The fitness
    function is designed to maximize the accuracy of classification for the test sets
    while maintaining the minimum number of selected features. Eq. (12) demonstrates
    the simultaneous consideration of these two aspects in the fitness function. (12)
    Where, constant value ∝, between 0 and 1, is utilized to control the relative
    significance of classification accuracy versus the number of selected features.
    As ∝ increases, classification accuracy is given greater weight. The accuracy
    of the classifier for bird i is represented by ACC(i), while the number of features
    selected by bird i is denoted as ObjSum(i). The total number of features in the
    dataset is represented by Total Features. 4.5. An optimized SMOTE for solving
    the data imbalance problem This stage is considered one of the most important
    stages that solves the data imbalance problem that significantly and tangibly
    affects the results related to poultry management. Incorporate (Artificial Humming
    Algorithm) AHA''s optimization process with DT and RF to prevent local convergence.
    Additionally, the proposed hybrid metaheuristic will serve as the foundation for
    an algorithm that optimizes hyperparameters to determine the optimum values of
    N and k for balancing class distribution of training data over parameter range.
    The values of the two most important parameters are optimized with the swarm algorithm
    in Fig. 5, which depicts the optimization of the SMOTE algorithm. Every iteration
    the search agents (such as hummingbird in AHA) move, the new approach is expected
    to locate the optimal combination of K and S through a classifier decision tree
    to produce the best Kappa and accuracy performance. Then, using iterative processing
    to determine the optimal K and S, compare the performance measures with the conditions
    to enhance the Kappa, the accuracy values, and the imbalanced ratio (min/maj).

    Fig. 5. Flowchart of the proposed balancing dataset with optimized SMOTE. Each
    step interval for the S and K parameters in the computation is different. The
    proportion of the majority class to the minority class has the highest value for
    S. S must have a minimum value of 1 %. If there are two possible labels for the
    target class in the dataset, The majority class has 1000 instances, while the
    minority class has only 10. This implies that the minority class sample must grow
    by at least 20 times and up to 100,000 times, Kmin = 2, and Kmax = 10. As a result
    of the testing dataset''s consistency, Kappa [34] is regarded as a substitute
    measure of computing performance of classification. The classifier model''s reliability
    is represented by kappa. The accuracy is more credible because the Kappa value
    is higher. The range of Kappa values (also known as simply Kappa) is from −1 to
    1. While this is going on, three Kappa thresholds are used to determine the credibility
    of classification accuracy: The first measure in Kappa is considered to have strong
    consistency and high accuracy when Kappa is greater than or equal to 0.75. Second,
    if Kappa is greater than or equal to 0.4 and less than or equal to 0.75, the accuracy''s
    confidence level is generally considered to be high. The third threshold is that
    accuracy is astounding if Kappa is less than 0.4. When the observation in one
    class is higher than the observation in the other two classes, there is a class
    imbalance. This dataset is to detect poultry behaviours. As you can see in Fig.
    6, pecking behaviour is around 85.14 % when compared with preening and dustbathing
    at 14.31 % and 0.54 %, respectively. Therefore, we want the preening and dustbathing
    data to be balanced with the chicken pecking data so that the data can be analysed,
    and behaviour predicted efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (265KB)

    of a dictionary behaviours or query-templates, our training/testing data as shown
    in Fig. 7. A dictionary''s list of query-templates (behaviours) is presented in
    Column1, Column2, …, Columnn; each query has a class (Column1.class), a threshold
    value is shown in Column2, and Column3 depicts an axis (X or Y or Z) property,
    in addition to the query data points. We need a threshold that defines our acceptable
    rate of false positives and false negatives for each class. Download : Download

    for chicken time series. In theory, a single behaviour could have multiple possible
    instantiations, just as the number seven has two different but equivalent written
    forms (the traditional \"7\" and the middle line \"7\"). A polymorphic dictionary
    describes this type of dictionary. From what we''ve seen in the chickens, we''ve
    deduced that each behaviour has only one correct execution. However, expanding
    this code to work with any polymorphic dictionary is so simple that it''s been
    left out for the sake of brevity. A dictionary of chicken behaviours can be constructed
    that searches annotated regions for motifs of highly conserved sequences [35].
    Think about the corresponding difficulty in the discrete string space to get a
    feel for this. We count, categories, and time-stamp certain behaviours as they
    occur in the time series data stream. The data stream is filtered using a sliding
    window. If the sequence meets the matching criteria for a query-template (behaviour)
    in the dictionary, it is associated with that behaviour and given a timestamp.
    The effectiveness of feeding/pecking, preening, and dustbathing behaviours are
    all assessed and reported. Out-of-sample evaluation is the only objective of the
    test dataset after the training dataset has been used to construct the dictionary
    of behaviours. Perhaps the most recognizable behaviour in chickens is the act
    of pecking/feeding. Dictionary has discovered the query-template in Fig. 8 to
    analyse pecking/feeding behaviour in a training dataset, where matching subsequences
    along the (left) X-axis and (right) Z-axis need to be identified, which incorporates
    subsequences that match those in the training dataset. Subsequence matches outside
    of regions annotated as feeding/pecking behaviour are considered false positives
    (FP), but those within these regions are considered true positives (TP). The query-template
    and corresponding subsequences from the training dataset for preening behaviour
    are shown in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res image (326KB) Download : Download

    Fig. 11. Matching sub-sequences for dustbathing behaviour. 4.7. Classification
    of poultry behaviours phase Behaviour, which is evident through actions and posture,
    is widely recognized as one of the most indicators that are crucial, most widely
    used, and most easily understood indicators of animal welfare and health, even
    more so than stress and output. Therefore, enhancing animal welfare and detecting
    sick chickens early necessitates real-time, automatic, and nondestructive monitoring
    of poultry behaviour. The following behaviours are hypothesized to be related
    to poultry health. When feeding or pecking, the bird lowers its beak to the ground
    and picks up a tidbit of food. Feather care routines that involve the beak include
    preening and dustbathing. Ectoparasite-infected birds, in particular, are thought
    to engage in increased preening/dustbathing. The various algorithms are used to
    categories pecking, preening, and dustbathing. Our analysis of the behaviour of
    broiler chickens was informed by the results of the preliminary behavioural posture
    pre-processing. Feeding/pecking, preening, and dustbathing are the three behaviours
    we assign to the test data. The chickens'' daily routine typically consists of
    them strolling around and chowing down. When prompted, such as by noise in the
    environment, they will take off running and only stop when they are fatigued.
    Additionally, there is a phenomenon where sick chickens lie down, and this behaviour
    warrants related study [36]. Preening is a common behaviour as well, accounting
    for about 11 % of a bird''s daily time. Chickens'' actions are assumed to be unrelated
    to one another; for instance, we don''t think chickens would run around the yard
    while munching on some food. In Section 6.1 we can see how the algorithm for classifying
    chicken behaviour recognition in this paper. The classification models of poultry
    behaviour were implemented via MATLAB (2019a) using Machine Learning Toolbox.
    Classification algorithms examined in this study are KNN, Decision Tree, Random
    Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, and AdaBoost. 4.8. Diagnosis
    of poultry disease phase Seven prediction models were investigated for their ability
    to predict the poultry'' health. Table 3 provides a brief overview of the dataset
    that was used for this study. The dataset was chosen because it represents a comprehensive
    set of broiler behaviours, all of which are necessary for proper analysis: feeding/pecking,
    preening, and dustbathing. Real-world datasets were used to train the machine
    learning classification models. This paper proposes two techniques, AHA-DT and
    AHA-RF, and conducts experiments with supervised learning algorithms including
    k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector
    Machine to improve the classification of the poultry according to extracted data
    from the poultry dataset. Fig. 12 demonstrates the standard Decision Tree classifier,
    which contains X, Y, and Z that represent three axis values which predict poultry
    behaviours pecking, preening, and dustbathing, respectively. Download : Download

    performance measures in the proposed system include multiple measures: measures
    for evaluating the balance of data and other measures for evaluating the best
    classification of the proposed methods. All measures are based on the following
    confusion matrix; refer to Fig. 13. When evaluating learning algorithms on a dataset
    quantitatively, the confusion matrix is a useful component. Important comparison
    parameters are computed using an empirical method. It also includes the crucial
    metrics defined by Eqs. (13)–(23): • True Positive (TP): indicates that the event
    was correctly predicted. • True Negative (TN): indicates that the system has correctly
    predicted that no event will occur. • False Positive (FP): represents a system''s
    incorrect prediction of an event. • False Negative (FN): represents a system''s
    incorrect prediction of no event. Download : Download high-res image (64KB) Download

    of samples that are correctly classified into all samples Eq. (13). (13) F-measure:
    It is defined as a metric for evaluating an algorithm''s effectiveness and is
    computed by combining the recall and precision metrics. Calculating F-measure
    using Eq. (14): (14) where the values of precision and recall are calculated using
    Eqs. (15) & (16), respectively. (15) (16) Area Under Curve (AUC): It is the plot
    that evaluates the classification model. The classification effect of the model
    is better with a higher AUC value. Classifiers with a value closer to 1 have faster
    convergence, while those with a value closer to 0 have sub-optimal performance
    Eq. (17). (17) G-value calculates using recall and precision average which Classification
    models perform better at classifying imbalanced data when the G-value is high
    Eq. (18). (18) OOBerror: is the average percentage of incorrect predictions made
    by each decision tree. where ntree is the number of decision trees. The more accurate
    a model''s classification is, the lower the acceptable OOBerror Eq. (19). (19)
    Kappa value: can also be called Cohen''s Kappa Eq. (20) which be determined by
    using a confusion matrix that lists the percentages of each class''s TP, FP, and
    TN which clarifies p0 indicates the overall accuracy and pc is a metric for evaluating
    the degree to which predicted and actual class values. (20) where and are given
    as respectively Eqs. (21) & (22) (21) (22) Imbalanced Ratio (IR): is used to calculate
    the percentage of imbalanced data value where the total number of points for the
    minority class denoted by while the total number of points for the majority class
    is denoted by . Whenever the percentage of imbalanced data is small, it indicates
    the efficiency and balance of the data Eq. (23). (23) The most important key metrics
    to track the changes and results for solving imbalanced datasets are accuracy,
    Kappa, and the imbalance ratio (Min/Maj). 6. Experiments results and discussion
    The findings of the experiments are discussed in this section along with the phases
    that were tested and the proposed system. The same computer contains the following
    specific settings: Hardware specification consists of Core (TM) i7-4500, 2.40
    GHz, 16 G, and 1 TB that express Processor, Frequency, RAM, and Hard Disk respectively.
    Software specification contains Windows 11, and MATLAB R2019a that express operating
    system and programming language, respectively to extract and analyse the results.
    6.1. Experiments of feature selection Assuming a population size of 100, the fitness
    function employs an α value of 0.8. The dataset undergoes 20 independent experiments,
    with a maximum of 500 iterations set as the limit. To test the classification
    accuracy of the selection scheme for each bird, the KNN classifier (with K = 7)
    is utilized. The hyperparameter configurations for each algorithm are provided
    in Table 5. The information of dataset is composed of 20 poultry features, more
    than 99,998 instances, and two classes which are described if the poultry is sick
    or healthy. Table 5. Hyperparameter settings. Algorithm Parameters AHA r [0, 1]

    Mutation = 0.25 The experimental results of the AHA algorithm for feature selection
    and three other comparison algorithms on a dataset are presented in Table 5. AHA
    is the algorithm with the highest mean classification accuracy and the AHA algorithm
    outperformed the other algorithms on test datasets, and its mean accuracy is better
    than that of CSO, PSO, and GA algorithms in feature selection. The worst mean
    accuracy in feature selection was observed for the GA algorithm. However, the
    dataset with better mean accuracy on full features saw an improvement of less
    than 10 %. The experimental outcomes prove the AHA algorithm is more effective.
    Table 6 displays the average features and standard deviation in dimensions for
    the four algorithms following feature selection for the dataset. An intuitive
    observation shows that the AHA and CSO algorithms have a significant dimensionality
    reduction effect compared to the GA and PSO algorithms, and the dimensional standard
    deviation is low, indicating relatively high stability of the algorithms. The
    experimental results provide direct evidence that the AHA algorithm is highly
    effective, resulting in better classification accuracy on datasets and a significant
    reduction in the number of unnecessary features. Table 6. The mean, standard deviation

    An optimized SMOTE results in the creation of the synthetic dataset which is used
    to supplement the movement data of the poultry chickens and are a significant
    contribution to the proposed study for classifying poultry behaviours. The original
    dataset''s sparsity is provided by the proposed generated synthetic dataset SMOTE-AHA-DT
    and SMOTE-AHA-RF to suggest a predictive behaviour of poultry farms for instantaneous
    chicken disease diagnosis, the experiment developed machine learning classification
    models. The results of the proposed optimized SMOTE based on AHA using the Decision
    Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) classification models on the poultry dataset
    are shown in Table 7. The three-performance metrics of accuracy and Kappa with
    high accuracy and the best Kappa value. these best results indicate that, after
    undergoing training with the imbalanced data, the two proposed method with classification
    algorithms'' power is completely useless. Regardless of the classification algorithm
    employed, the results remain subpar after processing the original dataset using
    SMOTE-PSO, SMOTE-GOA, and SMOTE-WOA with DT and RF classification for some but
    perhaps not optimal balance. Using the effectiveness of the proposed an optimized
    SMOTE as SMOTE-AHA-DT, and SMOTE-AHA-RF methods proposed in this paper demonstrated
    that, as shown in Table 8 The Kappa for SMOTE-AHA-DT is high and nearly equal
    to one with high accuracy of 98 % more than proposed SMOTE-AHA-RF. The proposed
    methods managed to maintain a manageable range of control over classification
    results. The change in the dataset''s degree of imbalance ratio can be seen through
    the index of imbalance ratio, demonstrating that our methods work even when the
    dataset is not completely balanced. Table 7. The results of an optimized SMOTE.

    compared with other swarm optimization algorithms SMOTE-PSO, SMOTE-WOA, and SMOTE-GOA
    with two classification models decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) and used
    G-mean and F-measure for dataset to confirm the classification performance of
    the model. In Table 8 and Fig. 14, the experimental findings are displayed and
    show that the proposed optimization algorithm achieves superior results in the
    F-measure compared to other algorithms in the poultry dataset and that it also
    outperforms competing algorithms in terms of G-mean. The dataset is correctly
    classified for all of them. The experimental findings demonstrate that the algorithm
    presented in this paper is superior for the classification of the minority class
    and provides a practical solution to the issue of data classification that is
    imbalanced. Download : Download high-res image (275KB) Download : Download full-size

    For each predicted chicken behaviour, we determined whether it was a true positive
    (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), or false negative (FN) based on
    how closely it matched the actual behaviour. Percent AUC, accuracy, F-measure,
    precision, and recall were used to assess these models'' predictive efficiency.
    For three behaviour datasets, RF, KNN, and Adaboost models showed high accuracies
    in classifying poultry pecking (99 %, 98 %, and 96 %, respectively), preening
    (98 %, 98 %, and 95 %, respectively), and dustbathing (99 %, 98 %, and 97 %, respectively)
    and RF method is considered the best model in terms of accuracy. According to
    the research results, RF is the most effective classification model, with 90 %
    precision and recall when matching instances of the pecking behaviour. The second
    model, DT, matches instances of the pecking behaviour with a precision of 89 %
    and a recall of 90 %. Table 10 presents the results of the classification of pecking,
    preening, and dustbathing behaviours in the test dataset. According to the results

    classification techniques. The frequent aggregation of preening and dustbathing
    activities. Along the axis Ay, there is a noticeable concentration of preening
    and dustbathing occurrences. Because the sensor is in constant motion as the poultry
    moves, pecking events are spread out over a wider area. Because of how the sensor
    was built and how it moved when attached to Ay''s back, the recorded motion was
    extremely useful for differentiating between activity intensities and was especially
    useful for identifying dustbathing behaviour. Ay was able to detect and record
    the movement of the sensor caused by the preening behaviour of turning the head
    to the side. Fig. 18 data depicts that pecking behaviour can be distinguished
    from preening and dustbathing through the use of MV. Download : Download high-res

    features from the chicken''s back accelerometer in a three-dimensional scatterplot,
    visualised via AI, Ay, and MV metrics. There was a clear separation of preening
    and preening events, as behavioural events for both activities occurred simultaneously
    Fig. 19. As a result, it becomes more difficult to tell these behaviours apart
    from others. Even though pecking events occur all over the place, the high prediction
    accuracy of this behaviour can be attributed to its isolation from other activities,
    as is especially evident along the AI axis. Consequently, the AI metric can tell
    the difference between pecking, preening, and dust-bathing behaviours. By fusing
    signals from all directions, AI is able to determine the magnitude of a pecking
    motion, with the greater acceleration associated with pecking (particularly in
    the Z-axis plane) being recorded and used to distinguish it from the other three
    behaviours. The low sensitivity of dustbathing behaviours reflects the lack of
    a consistent categorization for these occurrences. Download : Download high-res

    dustbathing behaviours did not fall into two distinct categories in Fig. 20. When
    comparing the intensity of movement during locomotion and resting postures, the
    MV metric proved invaluable. Due to the minimal distinction between preening and
    dustbathing, these two activities were inaccurately classified in Fig. 20. Because
    the X-axis clearly changes orientation when dustbathing, Ax has become an important
    metric for distinguishing between dustbathing and upright behaviour since its
    advent. Download : Download high-res image (221KB) Download : Download full-size

    disease As diseases cause significant economic losses in poultry production, they
    are of paramount importance. The costs associated with the disease can be reduced
    if it is detected and diagnosed quickly. We propose an algorithm for identifying
    sick chickens that can be used to reduce the spread of disease. We examine the
    poultry dataset [30] about chickens over the course of a full day. We know that
    on the first day, all of the chickens were healthy and that on the second day,
    some chickens were sick (infested with ectoparasites). For this reason, it is
    essential that the proposed classification results provide a sufficient degree
    of confidence in their ability to differentiate between healthy and sick chickens.
    Fig. 22 shows a chart depicting the frequency distribution of pecking behaviours
    across all of the chickens When observed, the subjects exhibited either a healthy
    state (indicated by the colour green) or a sick state (indicated by the colour
    red). The depicted figure demonstrates a certain degree of overlap between the
    peck counts of healthy and sick chickens. Download : Download high-res image (265KB)

    behaviours distribution. The number of preening behaviours performed by each chicken,
    both when healthy (green) and when sick, is then analysed statistically (red).
    Based on the preening count alone, the proposed classifier accurately distinguishes
    between sick and healthy chickens, as evident from Fig. 23. The histogram of preening
    counts for healthy chickens exhibits a left-skewed distribution, whereas for sick
    chickens, it is concentrated more towards the middle and right. This observation
    underscores the reliable discriminatory ability of the algorithm in identifying
    the health status of chickens. Download : Download high-res image (242KB) Download

    is sick. Download : Download high-res image (230KB) Download : Download full-size

    The evaluation of each supervised machine learning classification model''s performance
    involves using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy. The effectiveness
    of the chosen classification models is summarized in Table 11 along with their

    measures for each poultry behaviours prediction, the proposed classifier AHA-DT
    for pecking behaviour successfully distinguishes between sick as well as healthy
    poultry chicken in 98 % of the proposed study. On the real and made-up datasets
    for other classification models, when K = 7, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) can
    accurately predict whether a chicken is healthy or sick by 79 %. Random Forest
    (RF) machine learning classifiers demonstrated well performance and yielded results
    with an accuracy of about 83 %, and Decision Tree also achieved a good accuracy
    of about 82 %. With an accuracy rate of 72 %, the SVM classification model performed
    the worst of all the techniques. With an accuracy rate of 80 %, logistic regression
    (LG) also achieves intermediate accuracy. With an accuracy of 80 %, Gaussian Naive
    Bayes classification outperformed KNN little. The accuracy of the AHA-DT is 98.63
    %, and the accuracy of the AHA-RF is 94.14 %. The AHA-DT method stands out with
    the most significant impact on accuracy. This approach exhibits notable benefits
    in terms of its strong generalization capability and robustness when addressing
    poultry prediction scenarios. According to results of accuracy for each classification
    model according to pecking/feeding, preening, and dustbathing behaviours, respectively.
    The proposed AHA-DT overcomes all other classification models until another proposed
    AHA-RF reveals the true power of evolutionary algorithms. Finally, the results
    compare with SVM, KNN, LG, GNB, DT, and RF classification algorithms. 7. Conclusion
    and future work The poultry industry needs an automatic system to improve the
    productivity of healthy birds, keep track of their health, and predict disease
    outbreaks before the disease occurs. This paper proposes the smart poultry monitoring
    system, empowered by IoT sensors, which effectively gauges the health status of
    chickens, whether sick or healthy, according to their behaviour. The objectives
    of the proposed system are: (1) selecting the best features from extracted features;
    (2) proposing an oversampling-based optimization to balance the data through the
    utilization of SMOTE through an optimization technique called the Artificial Hummingbird
    Algorithm (AHA); (3) predicting poultry behaviours that assist stakeholders in
    making decisions for the health of poultry; and (4) detection of poultry disease
    by behaviour analysis. The conclusion that has been extracted from the results
    of the classification of poultry behaviour is that RF achieved the best results
    and diagnosis of poultry disease by optimizing decision tree classification via
    AHA-DT, which is superior and outperforms other techniques with the highest level
    of classification accuracy of 97.6 %. In future work, we will extend SMOTE into
    multi-objective problem to deal with multi-classification imbalanced datasets
    due to the fact that in real-world applications, the issue of imbalanced datasets
    affects both binary and multi-classifications. Ethics approval The authors herewith

  explanation: 'The proposed mitigation framework is deployed in four parallel vital
    software components, namely:


    (a) Traffic Capture

    (b) Traffic Monitoring, Analytics, and Detection

    (c) Attack Detection Service

    (d) SDN-based Mitigation


    These software components are autonomous and independent in their work. However,
    each software component communicates to send or seek the data. Fig. 11 shows the
    comprehensive view of the deployment model. Further, Fig. 12 illustrates the flow
    diagram for end-to-end IoT-DDoS mitigation modules.


    **Traffic Capture**


    The Fog layer employs an automated Python script at the entry point leveraging
    standard ‘tcpdump’ to capture ingress traffic traces with configurable PCAP size.
    The ‘tcpdump’ is configured for the ‘number of packets’. The default configuration
    is set to 10,000 packets. The ‘tcpdump’ keeps listening to the network until it
    captures the configured amount of packets (say, 10,000 packets). When the desired
    packets are captured, ‘tcpdump’ outputs the packets into PCAP and listens to another
    set of packets.


    Therefore, the prime responsibility of the ‘Traffic Monitoring’ module is to listen
    to ingress network traffic and dump the packets into the PCAP file.


    **Traffic Monitoring, Analytics, and Detection**


    Traffic monitoring, analytics, and detection module are implemented as a Watchdog
    and corresponding Watchdog Handler (as shown in Fig. 12). The watchdog triggers
    FileCreateEvent as soon as ‘tcpdump’ creates a traffic dump file. The FileCreateEvent
    event handler converts the PCAP into a CSV feature file and queries the ‘IoT-DDoS
    attack detection service’ module for blacklisting of IP addresses sending the
    attack traffic. The blocked IP addresses are stored in ‘Blacklist-DB.’


    **IoT-DDoS Detection Service**


    The IoT-DDoS Detection Service module is deployed on a Docker-based H2O.ai pipeline
    with master and worker configuration for analyzing the real-time traffic to make
    predictions. The service responds to incoming HTTP requests for attack prediction
    with the required attributes as parameters to HTTP requests. The attack detection
    service module is upheld with the exported trained binary model, which serves
    as the heart of the service.


    **SDN-based Mitigation**


    Algorithm 4 describes the pseudo-code for the SDN-based mitigation module. The
    sequence diagram in Fig. 13 depicts the mitigation module and classifies the web
    resource request into legitimate and attack requests. Various stages are labeled
    at the top of the sequence diagram for end-to-end traffic flow.


    The legitimate case explains that SDN intercepts the request for web resources.
    SDN-based mitigation module queries Blacklist-DB for any blocked IP address. SDN
    is not involved in analytics, making the mitigation framework lightweight. In
    the event of a legitimate request with no entry for the incoming IP address in
    the database, the SDN quickly transmits the signal, enabling the traffic to flow
    smoothly.


    In contrast, SDN finds the IP address from the incoming request in the database
    for attack traffic and installs the rule to block traffic from the prohibited
    IP address.


    The proposed work expounds upon the end-to-end IoT-DDoS attack detection and mitigation
    process in real time. Each stage involved in the framework describes the communication
    between the atomic yet connected framework components bridging the gaps in the
    cutting-edge solutions. Thus, the proposed work offers a comprehensive toolkit
    that researchers can leverage to augment their research and development endeavors.'

    healthcareStack ensembleXGBoost 1. Introduction The ubiquitous ‘Internet of Things’
    (IoT) has transformed into an envisioned communicable machine network called the
    Internet of Anything (IoX). The IoT trend report from Ericsson has predicted an
    IoT mount of up to 30.2 billion devices by 2027 at a CGPR of 13% (Ericsson, 2023).
    The meticulous fusion of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and futuristic
    software-defined network backbone have motivated the evolution of novel cyber-physical
    systems (CPS). The advanced intelligent grids, transportation, agriculture, healthcare,
    and Industry 4.0 have brought the divergent domains together. The communication
    backbone has always been an inseparable and indispensable component of a cyber-physical
    system. The decoupling of data and control planes in the network architecture
    has opened the ports to the lattice of technologies by offering configurable,
    cost-effective, and intelligent solutions (Halpern et al., 2010). Software-defined
    networking (SDN) architecture offers novel network configurations and policy enforcement
    opportunities. The SDN has got researchers'' attention because of its flair for
    providing resilient security frameworks. The business value articulation of SDN
    and endless applications offers the configurable software-defined network a dominant
    role in building a software-defined CPS (SD-CPS) (Molina and Jacob, 2018). The
    ‘cyber-world’ acclaims another significant component in the cyber-physical system
    hierarchy (Snehi and Bhandari, 2021a). The cloud model offers on-demand computing
    services with its elastic pooled infrastructure and broad network access. The
    evolution of IoT and cloud adaption is exponential. The volumetric network traffic
    from endless IoT devices floods the cloud. It fills the cloud''s data lakes with
    redundant data involving excessive usage of computing services and defeating the
    primary responsibilities promised by the cloud (Jindal and Maini, 2014). Fog computing
    is another contemporary computing paradigm in a state-of-the-art CPS. Fog offers
    additional services to the cloud by carrying out data analytics at the edge of
    the cloud, facilitates networking and storage supports, helps in latency reduction,
    and adds a computing support dimension to the cloud network. 1.1. Cyber–physical
    systems and industry 4.0 Cyber-physical systems tightly integrate computing, networking,
    and physical processes. They often comprise sensors, actuators, and control systems
    interacting with the physical world to achieve a specific goal. Examples of cyber-physical
    systems include autonomous vehicles, industrial control systems, and smart cities.
    The hardware includes sensors, actuators, and computing devices, such as microcontrollers
    or embedded systems. The software consists of algorithms for processing data,
    making decisions, and controlling physical processes. The interconnected cyber-physical
    system concept map (as illustrated in Fig. 1) vividly portrays a seamless feedback
    loop impacting the human, environmental and economic factors. The real-time or
    offline implementation of the cyber-physical system is distributed or centralized
    with reactive or preventive actions for an event. The widespread adoption of Cyber-Physical
    Systems demands that cybersecurity become an indispensable aspect of these systems
    to ensure their resilience and compliance with privacy regulations. Effective
    cybersecurity measures protect CPS against potential cyber-attacks and safeguard
    critical data, which is at the heart of these systems. The system''s design identifies
    hazards and protects the system from physical, chemical, biological, radiological,
    or environmental hazards. Download : Download high-res image (705KB) Download

    the admiration of the fourth industrial revolution (a.k.a. Industry 4.0), cyber-physical
    systems further conceptualize highly automated transformation of societal processes,
    technology, and industries into interconnected intelligent ecosystems well appropriate
    for decentralized decisions, interconnections, and information transparency (Paul
    et al., 2021). The principal ingredients of Industry 4.0 are Artificial Intelligence,
    Big-data, IoT, Software-defined Networks, and Robotics. The abstraction of Industry
    4.0 architecture has captivated analogous cyber-physical systems such as Healthcare
    under the same umbrella and deemed with the like principles (Wadhawan and Maini,
    2022). The market players such as Microsoft have adapted Healthcare 4.0 revolution
    and offered Azure-based cloud services for cost-effective quality by offering
    interoperable, virtualized, and distributed services (Microsoft, 2023). The principle
    ingredients of modern smart systems, IoT devices, have weak security implementations.
    The specific-purpose IoT devices stand highly vulnerable to attacks. The physical
    devices can be compromised easily to participate in the botnet army. An open source
    botnet (Mirai - an IoT malware) source code has revealed that the devices can
    be easily brute-forced to jailbreak into weakly secured devices and compromise
    (Snehi and Bhandari, 2021b; Verma et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2022). This research
    is motivated by IoT-DDoS attacks triggered by unsecured IoT devices, which could
    contribute to more frequent and extreme attacks in the future. 1.2. IoT-DDoS attacks
    As technological advancement speeds, so does the sophistication of cyber attacks.
    IoT-generated Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as one
    of the most devastating cyber-attacks in this rapidly evolving landscape (Zarpelão
    et al., 2017). Due to weak security implementation, the omnipresent IoT devices
    are vulnerable targets for any device compromise and help participate as an attacking
    army. IoT-generated DDoS attacks (IoT-DDoS) are the most devastating attack types
    affecting system availability. IoT-DDoS, based initially on the Mirai botnet,
    has undergone multiple mutations since its inception. In its elementary form,
    IoT-DDoS has four principal constituents: Command and Control (C&C), Scanner,
    Loader, and Report Server. C&C offers the bot shepherd with a centralized administration
    interface and commands to stage the DDoS attack. The scanner disseminates with
    vulnerable IoT devices and sends the specifics of vulnerable IoT devices to the
    report server. Loader transfers the malware binary file (based on the CPU architecture
    of the target bot) to the weakly secured IoT device. The report server maintains
    the database to store the botnet devices'' specifics. Fig. 2 explains the modus
    operandi for IoT-DDoS. The attack sequence employed for IoT-DDoS is given as:

    Fig. 2. IoT-DDoS modus operandi. (a) STEP-1: Scanner scans the network and brute-forces
    into available IoT devices. (b) STEP-2: Scanner sends the device specifics for
    successful brute-forced IoT to the report server. (c) STEP-3: Loader queries the
    reporting server for vulnerable devices. (d) STEP-4: Loader transfers the malware
    binary file per the IoT device''s CPU architecture to the victim IoT device. (e)
    STEP-5: The C&C fetches details of compromised bot''s details from the reporting
    server. (f) STEP-6: The C&C sends the ‘ATTACK_LAUNCH’ command to the botnet army.
    (g) STEP-7: Botnet army follows the attack command from C&C and sends volumetric
    traffic to the target server to overwhelm the server resources. As the IoT traffic
    is diverse and heterogeneous, traditional DDoS detection frameworks are inefficient.
    Hence, sophisticated machine and deep learning algorithms are the critical priority
    in developing intelligent and self-learning machines for zero-day attacks (Haq
    et al., 2015; Tahsien et al., 2020; Virk and Maini, 2023). Additionally, to reduce
    the cloud computing overhead due to unnecessary use of resources in redundant
    data processing, it is recommended to deploy the traffic monitoring and analytics
    systems at the fog computing layer to attain low-latent industrial CPS. 1.3. Scope
    of the paper The paper aims to develop a novel mitigation framework against real-time
    IoT-DDoS attacks in a fog-assisted software-defined cyber-physical system. The
    paper also publishes an amalgamated dataset for IoT-based DDoS attacks for the
    research community. Though the article presents the case study for Industry 4.0
    as the potential prospect for the framework implementation, the proposed framework
    may find its applicability in diverse cyber-physical systems. The prime objective
    of the article is to deliver optimized defense framework components and propose
    a light mitigation scheme without adversely affecting the performance of a software-defined
    networking controller. Moreover, the experimental study aims to bring distributed
    computing from cloud to fog computing infrastructure by horizontally scaling the
    computing nodes to offer cloud-like on-demand services. Last but not least, the
    article intends to introduce a novel IoT-DDoS-Detection-as-a-Service (IDDaaS)
    concept to lower the computing cost, scalability, portability, easy integration,
    upgrades, and a novel platform to develop proofs-of-concept for the research community.
    The paper develops a defense framework against TCP, UDP, and HTTP attacks, and
    contemporary protocols such as MQTT are out of scope. Moreover, the paper must
    validate the framework for cutting-edge deep learning-based technology and recommend
    it as a prospect. 1.4. Acronyms The description of acronyms used in the paper

    communicate and interact with intelligent systems in Industry 4.0. For example,
    Healthcare 4.0, under the umbrella of Industry 4.0, has become famous for its
    ultramodern services. The COVID-19 pandemic (Yuki et al., 2020) has pushed Remote
    Patient Monitoring (RPM) priorities ahead of traditional healthcare. The cutting-edge
    Medical Cyber-Physical Systems are committed to improving patient experience,
    reliability, and quality of patient data. The adaption rate is too high, and it
    is predicted that the healthcare market will grow from $185.3 billion in 2020
    to $528.9 in 2027, with Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 16.2% (Research,
    2023). The major market players like IBM, Cisco, GE Healthcare, Allscripts Healthcare,
    Apple Inc, and AT&T Inc are invading the healthcare sector to transform the patient
    experience with enhanced patient engagement, improved medical care, and improved
    health data insights solutions. Additional application areas of cyber-physical
    systems such as power grids and Agriculture 4.0 (Ferrag et al., 2022) show similar
    adaptation trends and market growth rates. The research is also motivated by the
    massive growth of IoT devices, diversity, and applicability in almost every domain.
    The exponential and endless IoT applications produce volumetric network traffic.
    The network traffic from IoT devices is forecasted to grow to 79.4 ZB by 2025
    (Gartner, 2023). The volumetric network traffic containing structured and unstructured
    data offer a sea of opportunities in big data and data analytics spheres. In the
    ever-evolving world of cyber attacks, a recent report from Kaspersky lab (Q3-2022)
    (Kaspersky-Labs, 2022) has revealed that UDP flood is the go-to attack type, accounting
    for over half of all DDoS attacks at 51.84%. Not far behind, SYN flood attacks
    were the second most popular at 26.96%, with TCP floods trailing behind at 15.73%.
    Meanwhile, the lesser-known HTTP flood comprised just 3.77% of all attacks. The
    applicability of IoT devices in all spheres of life has motivated attackers to
    conceive novel attacks. Hence, the implications of IoT security infringement are
    manifold and need the immediate attention of researchers. 1.6. Research and development
    questions In this research endeavor, we undertake the pressing issue of IoT-DDoS
    attacks by proposing a comprehensive and effective mitigation solution. The authors
    have sought to address the research questions outlined below, and the ensuing
    discussion provides a detailed analysis and comprehensive response to each of
    these inquiries. (i) RQ1: How can inherent diversity, complexity, and network
    traffic behavior demonstrated by IoT devices be effectively captured and analyzed?
    Can the behavior features unique to IoT devices be leveraged to identify and mitigate
    IoT-DDoS traffic accurately? (ii) RQ2: What are the potential challenges and limitations
    of relying solely on a single dataset to address the full spectrum of IoT traffic
    diversity, and how can these challenges be overcome? (iii) RQ3: How can a combination
    of multiple stack-ensembled algorithms be effectively integrated and optimized
    to provide enhanced protection against an ever-evolving threat landscape? (iv)
    RQ4: Can the security solution be decoupled from the SDN code to offer a lightweight
    mitigation scheme that minimizes the impact of security measures on the overall
    SDN performance? This research aims to explore the feasibility of such an approach
    and provide insights into its potential benefits and limitations. (v) RQ5: What
    measures can mitigate latency concerns and ensure optimal performance of a deployed
    cyber security solution without compromising the system''s ability to detect and
    respond to potential security threats effectively? (vi) RQ6: What strategies and
    approaches can transform a tailored cyber security solution into a reusable, portable,
    and scalable architecture capable of providing effective threat detection and
    response across various network environments and infrastructures? 1.7. Paper contributions
    As the menacing shadow of IoT-DDoS attacks looms ever more extensive, the article
    publishes amalgamated and simulated datasets for IoT-DDoS attacks. The paper proposes
    a novel multi-stage attack mitigation framework against IoT-DDoS attacks. The
    research also offers a visionary Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for IoT-DDoS
    detection and a light yet effective mitigation scheme. The paper embarks on the
    journey to deal with the intricacies confronted by the research community and
    presents a comprehensive breakdown of our endeavors as follows: (i) Publishing
    Robust IoT-DDoS Datasets through Amalgamation and Simulation: In this rapidly
    evolving technological landscape, cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated
    and advanced, making it essential for DDoS mitigation solutions to keep pace with
    these developments. However, a significant challenge these solutions face is inadequate
    training data to handle cutting-edge network traffic. With a robust and diverse
    dataset to train on, self-learning algorithms may be able to effectively identify
    and mitigate attacks, turning networks vulnerable to resilient. In response to
    this challenge, the paper proposes a novel approach to generate a composite dataset
    from the current benchmarked dataset. By combining data from a range of attack
    scenarios, this hybrid dataset provides a strong foundation for learning techniques.
    The paper not only presents a comprehensive simulation of various attack scenarios
    using simulators and botnets based on the Mirai philosophy but pushes the envelope
    by generously publishing the resulting dataset, providing valuable resources for
    future research in the field. (ii) Low Complexity Feature List: The paper proposes
    a novel attack detection philosophy centered on the behavioral attributes of IoT
    devices. By prioritizing computationally inexpensive network flow attributes over
    expensive deep packet inspection features, the approach presents a realistic and
    efficient solution to identifying IoT-DDoS attacks, offering a cost-efficient
    alternative to more resource-intensive detection methods. The paper''s findings
    demonstrate that the device''s behavioral characteristics are a reliable and effective
    means of identifying these attacks, with encouraging experimental results that
    underline the approach''s value and efficacy. (iii) Radical IoT-DDoS Detection
    Metric: The paper introduces an efficient approach to IoT-DDoS detection, leveraging
    a multi-stage Stack-Ensemble of optimized Distributed Random Forest (DRF) and
    Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost) to produce novel and highly effective
    detection metrics that outperform traditional methods in both accuracy and efficiency.
    (iv) Optimized Fog Architecture: The paper unveils the untapped potential of fog-computing
    architecture by determining and addressing the research gaps in the current literature.
    It puts forth an off-the-wall proposal to offer a novel approach to incorporating
    cloud-like services for IoT-DDoS detection into the fog layer through on-demand
    elastic infrastructure implemented on top of distributed computing promises to
    transform the domain. (v) Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for IoT-DDoS Detection:
    The paper proposes a leading-edge IoT-DDoS detection-as-a-service (IDDaaS) that
    offers a cost-effective, extensible, and highly scalable defense solution against
    the ever-evolving landscape of heterogeneous volumetric IoT traffic. The experimental
    study deploys the IDDaaS in the fog network to reduce the response latency. However,
    cloud deployment can offer a reusable software component for research in a similar
    realm. (vi) Event Driven Light Mitigation Framework: The experiment decouples
    the IoT-DDoS mitigation algorithm from the SDN controller''s main application
    code by strategically integrating a service-oriented and event-driven architecture.
    The tight coupling of the defense logic and the controller''s code can harm the
    controller''s overall performance, particularly its ability to handle and process
    network traffic effectively and efficiently. 1.8. Paper organization The present
    manuscript is structured to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the research
    study. Section 2 provides an extensive literature review and identifies research
    gaps, paving the way for the proposed cutting-edge solutions. Fig. 3 illustrates
    the end-to-end process for developing the defense framework with the outcome details
    at each stage. The process starts with presenting the system model and elucidating
    oT-DDoS detection philosophy in section 3. The system model highlights the improvements
    in the fog-computing layer by implementing the limitations in existing solutions.

    for proposed work. 2. Related work With the widespread proliferation of IoT devices
    and diverse traffic patterns, sophisticated cyber attacks have become increasingly
    prevalent, underscoring the urgent need for robust and effective security solutions.
    This paper presents the comprehensive details of the latest available studies
    involving work against IoT-DDoS attacks in multiple dimensions with the intent
    to perform a polyhedral analysis. The literature explores the solutions inheriting
    the datasets used in the experimental study, i.e., BoT-IoT, In-SDN, and UNSW-Sydney
    datasets (Verma et al., 2020). However, the study is more exhaustive than the
    dataset mentioned above; other contemporary realms and the applicability of solutions
    in Fog, Cyber-Physical System environments have been investigated as follows.
    2.1. Literature inheriting BoT-IoT dataset The following cutting-edge solutions
    leveraged the BoT-IoT dataset, an innovative and comprehensive dataset delivering
    realistic network traffic generated by a wide range of IoT devices, to develop
    their DDoS defense solution. Koroniotis et al. (2019a), the BoT-IoT dataset''s
    originator, set up an IoT lab environment simulating weather station and smart
    fridge to generate legitimate and attack traffic for MQTT traffic. They tested
    the reliability of the dataset using ML (SVM, RNN, and LSTM) and statistical techniques
    (Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Entropy). The paper needs to report vital
    performance metrics other than accuracy. Nimbalkar and Kshirsagar (2021) proposed
    the feature selection technique for the NIDS system. They evaluated and validated
    the efficiency of selected features on BoT-IoT and KDDCup''99 datasets using JRipClassifier.
    They trained and tested the model using synthetic data and failed to report the
    results in the simulation environment. Shafiq et al. (2020) suggested a machine-learning-based
    bot detection framework. The authors used correlation and area-under-curve-based
    metrics to select novel traffic features leveraging the BoT-IoT dataset. They
    applied Shannon Entropy to detect IoT-generated attack traffic. The paper lacked
    reporting the vital performance metrics and validation in the simulation environment.
    Ferrag et al. (2020) created a NIDS based on decision trees leveraging BoT-IoT
    and CICIDS2017 datasets for experimentation. The study needs to include a discussion
    of vital performance metrics but accuracy. 2.2. Work leveraging InSDN dataset
    The innovative solutions discussed herein have successfully devised a potent DDoS
    defense mechanism by capitalizing on the InSDN dataset, an extensive repository
    of open-flow traffic in SDN ecosystems. With the intent to publish an SDN-based
    dataset to the research community, Elsayed et al. (2020) invested their sincere
    efforts in inventing an SDN-based attack dataset. The authors have offered a realistic,
    labeled dataset covering the attack diversity comprising 83 attributes in the
    traffic flows. They evaluated the dataset on the Mininet emulated environment.
    A variety of attack scenarios such as DDoS, Web-Attacks, Remote-to-Local (R2L),
    Malware, Probe, and User-to-Root (U2R) have been covered in the dataset. Their
    solution is tightly integrated with the SDN controller and increases the computational
    load on the controller. Hence, the solution needs to be explored in the big-data
    dimension of IoT security. Firdaus et al. (2020) proposed a stack-ensemble-based
    DDoS detection model leveraging the InSDN dataset. They executed the experiment
    in a two-stage process. Stage 1 involved clustering and classification for feature
    selection. Furthermore, stage 2 involved an ensemble for clustering and classification
    by employing KMeans++ and Random Forest classifier. But, the validation of the
    proposed work does not involve the real-time dataset. Zoppi et al. (2021) performed
    quantitative analysis on the InSDN dataset by employing unsupervised machine learning
    algorithms to identify issues and challenges in detecting zero-day attacks. They
    further described the impact of features on performance, appropriate metrics for
    security solutions evaluations, and meta-learning usage to reduce misclassification.
    Though their work is conceptual, no experimentation study has been carried out.
    2.3. Work adapting UNSW-Sydney dataset The innovative solutions discussed herein
    have effectively devised a powerful DDoS defense mechanism by expertly exploiting
    the vast UNSW-Sydney dataset as follows: In Sivanathan et al. (2017), the authors
    experimented with evaluating security threats to Smart-Home environments. In their
    empirical study, they developed test suites to investigate confidentiality, integrity,
    authorization, and availability. They installed 17 consumer IoT devices in their
    lab environment. Despite the comprehensive experimentation, the paper needs to
    discuss necessary performance metrics. Sivanathan et al. (2020) developed an SDN-based
    IoT cyber-security solution using machine learning techniques. They analyzed IoT
    traces and developed multi-stage ML architecture using flow attributes of the
    traffic. However, their work still needs the system performance evaluation against
    volumetric traffic and its impact on real-time traffic streaming. Singh et al.
    (2021) employed multi-classifier IDS leveraging the UNSW-Sydney dataset and proposed
    a fog-computing-based model with deep learning algorithms implementations. The
    paper needs a discussion of performance metrics in the results and experiment
    discussion. 2.4. Work in other similar dimensions The literature subsequently
    provides a comprehensive overview of the findings into the latest advancements
    in security solutions across various comparable domains as follows: Priyadarshini
    et al. (2020) proposed a light mitigation framework against IoT-DDoS attacks in
    Fog-computing-based Cyber-Physical Systems. They deployed the machine-learning-based
    defense solution onto the Fog-based SDN controller for latency reduction. The
    tight coupling of the deployed ML-based defense system with the SDN controller
    increases the computational load of the controller. They leveraged HPing-3 to
    generate TCP, UDP, and ICMP floods. Zhou et al. (2019) proposed a fog-based mitigation
    scheme against DDoS attacks in IIoT systems. They applied the fog concept at the
    edge of the IIoT network to reduce traffic latency and response time. They employed
    a signature-based attack detection methodology to filter the attack packets and
    validated the experimental testbed on the Industrial Control System. As IoT devices
    evolve and generate diverse network traffic, the signature-based detection approach
    may not be suitable for contemporary heterogeneous devices. Cvitić et al. (2021a)
    offered an innovative conceptual model for detecting IoT-DDoS attacks based on
    the behavioral traffic patterns manifested by IoT devices. The case study included
    the traffic classified into home monitoring, automated devices, electrical devices,
    and multimedia devices to cover a range of device behaviors. They further categorized
    the IoT traffic into Human Type Communication (HTC) and Machine Type Communication
    (MTC), forming the base of their conceptual model. The presented model is purely
    conceptual, and the authors planned the implementation. The authors extended their
    work in Cvitić et al. (2021b), experimented with 41 IoT devices, and applied logistic
    regression. However, the study needs a discussion of vital system performance
    metrics, scalability, and comprehensive validation. Özçelik et al. (2017) proposed
    an edge defense framework in reliance on an SDN controller. The mitigation framework
    against Mirai was used in the Fog environment. The article needs to include a
    discussion of the performance parameters of a defense system. Doshi et al. (2018)
    presented an ML-based method to distinguish attack traffic from legitimate traffic
    generated from intelligent consumer devices. They employed the stateful and stateless
    network features to build the ML model. They deployed several intelligent consumer
    IoT in-house to generate the IoT traces for TCP_SYN, UDP Flood, and HTTP Flood.
    The proposed solution was evaluated only against the in-house attack traffic rather
    than with the available benchmark datasets. Al-Mashadani and Ilyas (2022) proposed
    a defense framework leveraging SDN (OpenDaylight) capabilities. The Scapy tool
    was used to generate the traffic in the Mininet-based experimental study. The
    authors discussed the average detection time for the attack. The study needs to
    evaluate solutions against current datasets and include a discussion of performance
    metrics needs. In Wani and Revathi (2020), authors proposed an SDN-based security
    framework. They have used a Micro-Cluster-based Outlier (MCOD) for anomalous IoT
    behavior. They further used Multilayer perceptron to classify the DDoS attack.
    The discussion must include selecting the features best suited to the ML-based
    technique. Moreover, the experiment involved simulators, and the solution has
    not been validated using benchmark datasets for real-time traffic scenarios. Kumar
    et al. (2023) have introduced a novel approach to enhance the security and efficiency
    of IoT-enabled Smart Grid networks. It combined blockchain for secure communication,
    advanced Deep Learning for attack detection, SDN for low latency, and Digital
    Twin technology for behavior modeling. Pros include improved security and efficiency,
    while cons involve complexity, resource intensity, and potential adoption challenges
    in existing networks. Kumar et al. (2022) presented a novel framework for securing
    Software-Defined Industrial Internet of Things (SDIIoT) networks. It combined
    blockchain technology for secure data transmission and a deep learning-based flow
    analyzer to detect anomalies in network traffic. Pros include enhanced security
    and efficient traffic analysis, while potential cons involve increased complexity
    and resource requirements. Kumar et al. (2021) presented a privacy-preserving
    intrusion detection framework (P2IDF) for SDIoT-Fog networks, addressing data
    privacy and security challenges. It offered enhanced security and privacy through
    privacy-preservation techniques and intrusion detection using Artificial Neural
    Networks. Pros include improved security, privacy preservation, and high performance,
    while cons involve potential complexity and resource intensity during implementation.
    Javeed et al. (2023) introduced an innovative approach to address the challenges
    of managing the growing data traffic in IoT-enabled Consumer Electronics (CE)
    networks. It combined Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for flexible network management
    and Deep Learning (DL) using Cu-BLSTM for an effective IDS. Though it enhances
    network management and security, potential drawbacks include complexity and resource
    intensity during deployment. Table 2 presents the summary of literature work in
    the realm of IoT-DDoS attacks and the available defense and mitigation solutions
    in the similar domains. Table 2. Literature review summary. Ref Objective Method(s)

    frameworks has uncovered valuable knowledge and visions for the course ahead.
    However, the survey has also highlighted several critical gaps in research, providing
    an excellent opportunity for future scholarly inquiry. Therefore, the critical
    dimensions surfaced during the extensive incursion into the literature, meticulously
    put together for the perusal as follows: (i) High Latency: A Data Transmission
    Bottleneck: A conspicuous concern from the literature landscape is the detrimental
    impact of high latency during data transmission to the cloud, highlighting a critical
    research gap that demands immediate attention. Only a few researchers have ventured
    beyond the surface-level exploration of fog computing to unravel the intricacies
    of execution performance and latency evaluation in data transmission (Priyadarshini
    et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2019; Özçelik et al., 2017). (ii) Unsustainable Infrastructure:
    There needs to be more discussion on infrastructure cost optimization through
    low-cost design implementations. The high cost of implementation dominates the
    adoption of cutting-edge mitigation frameworks. The existing solutions must address
    an effective, low-cost solution for handling the massive data volumes of IoT devices.
    (iii) Legacy Upgrade Models: The cutting-edge solutions have a tight coupling
    of ML-based implementation and SDN code, making the attack detection algorithm
    upgrades a nightmare. There has yet to be a discussion on decoupling security
    core logic from the SDN controller. We have presented a conceptual model leveraging
    the network-function-virtualization (NFV) based security framework in our previous
    work (Snehi and Bhandari, 2021c). (iv) Not Suitable for Diverse IoT Data: The
    literature evidence that most researchers have focused on traditional methods
    of DDoS attacks. Moreover, machine and deep learning approaches also concentrate
    on deep packet inspection and specific network traffic features. The proposed
    solutions need more generalized attributes of the ingress network traffic flow
    that broadly apply to the diverse network traffic from IoT devices. (v) Limited
    Validation Scope: The proposed solutions, as discussed, have been tested only
    against a narrow range of scenarios, including a simulated lab setup or a single
    benchmark dataset. A more comprehensive validation strategy is necessary to address
    the challenges posed by the diverse and complex data generated by IoT devices.
    The is a need to reevaluate and optimize the approach to ensure its efficacy in
    handling a range of scenarios and heterogeneous data types. Therefore, a broader
    validation scope is critical for the success of any proposed solution in the rapidly
    evolving IoT landscape. 3. System overview A coherent and precise illustration
    of the Cyber-Physical System must account for the key components that make up
    its architecture, including IoT devices situated at the perception layer, connecting
    communication paths, computational nodes within the fog layer, an SDN controller,
    and cloud servers. The following section models the cyber-physical system mathematically
    and illustrates the necessary conditions for an IoT-DDoS attack to hold. The system
    description provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed model''s innovative
    fog computing implementation, representing a significant advancement over current
    solutions outlined in the existing literature. The detailed exposition of system
    components also encompasses an in-depth analysis of the attack detection philosophy
    reinforcing the proposed system and the attack detection metrics derived from
    the sophisticated algorithms at its core. The mathematical system model, including
    the core components of underlying cyber-physical system is represented as follows.
    3.1. Mathematical system model The cyber-physical system under test comprises
    multi-layered sub-systems, including the perception layer, fog-computing layer,
    and cloud layer. The bottommost perception layer is well connected to the cloud
    through a fog computing layer with a software-defined communication backbone (as
    shown in Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (217KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. System mathematical model. (For interpretation of the
    colors in the figure(s), the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
    The definitions of primary components of the well-connected smart ecosystem, necessary
    conditions for IoT-DDoS attacks, and assumptions are as follows. 3.1.1. The perception
    layer At the heart of the cutting-edge Cyber-Physical System lies the perception
    layer, which comprises a vast and interconnected collection of physical and IoT
    devices, all working together to gather, process, and analyze real-time data to
    provide valuable insights and facilitate seamless communication and interaction
    between machines and humans alike. The legitimate systems at perception layer
    are defined as: where, IT defines the source nodes, physical systems, or IoT devices.
    Unfortunately, the perception layer is not immune to security threats. It is often
    vulnerable to compromise by malicious actors seeking to gain control of a network
    of compromised IoT devices, also known as a botnet. The attackers leverage the
    Botnet to launch devastating attacks on targeted servers, with potentially catastrophic
    consequences. The Botnet is defined as: where, B is the set of compromised IoT
    devices as botnet. 3.1.2. The fog computing layer The fog computing layer (software-defined
    fog in the scope of current work) offers a sophisticated and powerful framework
    designed to provide cloud-like services at the edge of the cloud. It also intercepts
    cloud traffic to perform traffic/data analytics and security functions. The fog
    is comprised of a wide range of infrastructure components, including computing
    nodes, servers, open-flow switches, links, and an array of SDN controllers. Fog
    systems are mathematically represented as: • The overall networked fog system
    is defined by the set where, is the set of fog system nodes. The fog system nodes
    include traffic monitoring systems and a server offering IoT-DDoS-Detection-as-a-Service
    (IDDaaS). • is the set of OpenFlow switches deployed at the fog network. • are
    the links connecting perception layer IoT devices to the fog system, defining
    the connectivity between fog components and fog-to-cloud connectivity. • defines
    fog-based SDN controllers. 3.1.3. The cloud layer The cloud layer lies at the
    heart of the cyber-physical system, a critical component that provides end users
    access to vital data storage and a wide range of services. The cloud system is
    defined by: defines target cloud servers. 3.1.4. Nexus lane The nexus lane or
    the path ‘P’ between source and destination is defined by: from source to destination.
    3.1.5. Necessary conditions for attack The section defines the necessary conditions
    for an IoT-based DDoS attacks as: (a) Condition 1: A direct or indirect path exists
    between botnet network and target server. (b) Condition 2: If ‘z’ is minimum bots
    required to generate IoT-DDoS, then number of bots deployed ‘n’ >= ‘z’. 3.1.6.
    Assumptions The model assumes that following conditions must evaluate to true
    for the cyber-physical system under study: (a) Assumption 1: There is secure communication
    channel C between fog and cloud. (b) Assumption 2: Training and validation of
    machine-learning model is done at regular intervals. Like a constellation in the
    night sky, the Fig. 4 elegantly displays the interconnected naming of components
    within the mathematical model for understanding and discovery. For example, one
    of the Nexus Lanes (P) follows the green links from the perception layer component
    IT1 to the cloud server (T1). The illustration defines the path P in EQ. (1) as:
    (1) 3.2. Reformed fog computing layer The proposed mitigation framework offers
    reformed fog computing over existing fog-based solutions in multiple dimensions.
    The software architecture design puts the distributed computing forward. It offers
    an elastic approach towards computing infrastructure by horizontally scaling the
    computing nodes (Patel et al., 2019). Furthermore, the deployment architecture
    of the intelligent stacked-ensembled meta-algorithm-based analytics in the IDDaaS
    interface offers the opportunity to extend the design into a reusable service
    for the research community. The comprehensive details of the improvement in the
    fog layer are as follows. 3.2.1. Distributed computational nodes The IoT traffic
    is enormous; the deployment pipeline requires high-end computing resources deployed
    at the detection framework. However, acquiring high-end computing resources is
    expensive. The work proposed in the present article''s scope leverages the concept
    of the computational load distribution from underlying machine-learning algorithms
    to worker nodes. Distributed computing avoids any significant computational and
    memory overhead at a single node (Nguyen et al., 2019; Achbarou et al., 2018;
    Al-Jarrah et al., 2014). In an attempt to establish a mathematical model that
    no losses are observed while distributing the computational load, Behal et al.
    (2021) proved that sum of computational metrics calculated at multiple Points-of-Presence
    (PoP) (where i = 1 to n) from source to destination is equal to the computational
    metric calculated at the destination Point-of-Presence . Hence, distributing the
    computational load influences memory and computing constraint devices positively.
    The authors have used the information theory metric ϕ-Divergence involving the
    probability distribution to calculate the entropy index parameter. The model in
    Fig. 5 shows that individual nodes Pi calculate the divergence metric from the
    packets, ( ), originating from source node ‘S’. Download : Download high-res image

    individual point-of-presence and destination point of presence. The sum of divergence
    metric from the individual nodes is equal to divergence metric calculated at the
    destination node provided . The model is proven mathematically in EQ. (2) as:
    (2) Furthermore, advanced big data tools such as Spark and H2O.ai distribute the
    computational load to worker nodes in a machine-learning pipeline for efficient
    and real-time processing of volumetric ingress data. 3.2.2. Elastic computing
    infrastructure Exponentially increasing demands for Smart-Systems pose an essential
    responsibility for the underlying infrastructure to be resilient, fault-tolerant,
    and able to handle volumetric traffic with zero (or near to zero) latency (Venters
    and Whitley, 2012; Gama et al., 2019; Salman et al., 2018). The cloud servers
    can scale hardware vertically for high-end computations and horizontally for load
    balancing volumetric traffic analysis (Abbasi et al., 2021; Muñoz et al., 2018).
    The proposed fog-computing defense framework architecture is designed for horizontal
    scaling to distribute the computational load. Horizontal scaling is easy and more
    efficient than vertical scaling, has zero (or near to zero) downtime, is resilient,
    fault-tolerant, and has improved performance. Thus, it can provide on-demand computing
    (Buch, 2018) with reduced latency compared to the cloud layer offers. 3.2.3. SOA
    for attack detection at fog layer The proposed defense framework offers a cost-effective
    solution with an IoT-DDoS-Detection-as-a-Service (IDDaaS) interface against IoT-DDoS
    attacks. It delivers better time management and high compatibility solutions to
    the end-user. The software solution offers less responsibility toward infrastructure
    management and increased vendor responsibility. The vendor is responsible for
    training the model regularly; the service provides resiliency against zero-day
    attacks with an abstraction to the underlying model. The availability of IDDaaS
    as a web service and easy accessibility through HTTP protocol sets the stage for
    the service to be deployed at either fog level in production deployments to address
    latency issues or the cloud layer for the research community for further exploration
    and research. The versatility of the DDoS attack detection service, shown in Fig.
    6, is demonstrated by its ability to be consumed by SDN controllers at enterprise
    network entry points, integrated with NIDS systems, repurposed for research labs,
    deployed as honeypots, and utilized by educational institutes for training and
    research purposes. Download : Download high-res image (260KB) Download : Download

    3.2.4. SDN-based light-weight mitigation framework In contrast to contemporary
    solutions, the proposed framework offers a light mitigation scheme for Software-defined
    Cyber-Physical Systems. The tight coupling of mitigation schemes into SDN directly
    impacts SDN performance. The evolving machine and deep learning models are computationally
    expensive, requiring a dedicated high-end hardware setup for analytics. Tight
    coupling of the mitigation scheme into SDN controller exploits controller computing
    capability. Hence, in contrast to available solutions, the proposed mitigation
    scheme queries a database that stores the blocked IP addresses and determines
    if the traffic from the ingress IP address should be allowed or deferred. The
    parallel thread on a dedicated traffic monitoring machine is responsible for capturing
    the incoming network traffic, translating the packet capture files into meaningful
    feature files, querying the IDDaaS modules for suspicious IP addresses, and updating
    the database with the blocked IP address. The architecture helps SDN accomplish
    the intended functionality with the light mitigation scheme without impacting
    the controller performance. 3.3. IoT-DDoS detection philosophy The heart of the
    IoT-DDoS detection philosophy lies in the authors'' previous work on IoT device
    classification based on the behavioral attributes of IoT devices (Snehi and Bhandari,
    2022). The IoT devices are low computational powered, special-purpose devices
    meant to transfer the specific data to the server at regular intervals. Hence,
    the experiment leverages the behavioral aspects of IoT devices to identify legitimate
    and attack traffic. The IoT device classification philosophy presented in earlier
    work holds for classifying the IoT-DDoS attack. The algorithm based on behavioral
    technique is computationally fast as it does not require scanning the payload
    (Snehi and Bhandari, 2021d). The derived model adds a few more features to the
    feature list and introduces some features that contribute to the behavioral aspects
    of the network traffic. The comprehensive details of the feature list are discussed
    later in the section 4. The details of the core behavioral features for the IoT-DDoS
    detection philosophy are as follows. 3.3.1. Data exchange features As the IoT
    devices are special-purpose low computational devices deployed to transfer specific
    physical entities and attributes to the server, the cyber-physical system controls
    the data being transmitted. Behaviorally, the dedicated device transfers small
    chunks of data in a short burst to the server. However, the distributed denial
    of service attack traffic constantly transfers the high volume network traffic
    to the server to overwhelm the server resources. Therefore, flow volume per-flow
    level and average flow rate for an IoT device that identifies the IoT traffic
    behavior are defined as: (3) (4) In EQ. (3), represents sum of bidirectional bytes
    transfer during a flow. Similarly, EQ. (4) depicts average flow volume per unit
    time. The experimental study has evaluated TCP_SYN, UDP flood, and HTTP_Flood
    attacks. Fig. 7 (a) draws the number of data packets exchanged during the legitimate
    flow and the comparative plots for TCP, UDP, and HTTP flooding. Fig. 7 (b) plots
    the flow volume for the similar trend. The plots infer that internet-enabled embedded
    machines exchange an average of 2 packets per flow ranging from 2-4 packets for
    more than 90% of the flow entries. However, TCP flood has an exchange rate of
    4 packets per flow. On a similar trend, 7-12 UDP packet exchanges and 16-25 packet
    exchanges are recorded per-flow entries. Similarly, an average flow volume of
    2500 bytes per flow, 1500 bytes per flow, and 3500 bytes per flow is observed
    for legitimate, TCP flood, and UDP flood. Therefore, the plots illustrate a precise
    distinction between legitimate traffic and the attack traffic. A similar trend
    is observed for flow rate. Fig. 7 (c)-(d) illustrates that legitimate traffic
    has a comparatively low flow rate than HTTP flood. In contrast, HTTP and UDP floods
    have a higher flow rate than legitimate traffic. Download : Download high-res

    flood. 3.3.2. Device activity attributes The IoT devices transfer the data in
    small bursts with the specified time interval between each burst. The IoT devices
    close sockets with the server during the packet inter-arrival time (a.k.a. idle
    time). IoT devices'' idle time patterns and small packet sizes help distinguish
    between legitimate and attack traffic. Hence, idle time and flow duration are
    critical parameters for flow classification. Flow duration for ith flow is the
    time duration for which the flow was active. Mathematically, flow duration is
    described as (in EQ. (5)): (5) Similarly, device idle time for ith flow is time
    difference between start of flow and the current flow (ith flow) and is defined
    as in EQ. (6). (6) Fig. 8 (a) shows that IoT devices observe an averagely small
    flow duration of 300 ms ranging from 45-600 ms. The plot infers that the average
    flow duration for more than 80% of traffic is 250 ms. However, the attack traffic
    maintains a significantly high flow duration because it tries to keep the connection
    alive for a longer duration and floods the channel with the attack packets. Fig.
    8 (b) shows that the TCP and UDP flood traffic has a significantly higher flow
    duration. HTTP flood has a significantly low flow duration due to Slowloris HTTP
    attacks, where attackers send a high volume of tiny packets to overwhelm the server
    resources. Download : Download high-res image (943KB) Download : Download full-size

    behavior for legitimate and DDoS traffic. Fig. 8 (c) shows that the internet-enabled
    embedded devices observe a predefined idle time pattern between flows. The TCP,
    UDP, and HTTP flood traffic (Fig. 8 (d)) keep the connection alive with the packet
    floods for longer. 3.3.3. Rationale of IoT-DDoS detection philosophy The rationale
    compiled from the illustrated graphs ((Fig. 8 (a)-(d))) indicates the specialized
    and distinctive behavioral patterns exhibited by IoT devices. The behavioral attributes
    unique to IoT devices provide valuable insights into IoT design philosophy and
    are rooted in their data exchange and device activity patterns. The characteristics
    of the network traffic originating from IoT devices are as follows: (i) The IoT
    devices are low computational powered, specific-purpose devices meant to transfer
    the specific data to the server at regular intervals. The specific-purpose devices
    have significantly less flow duration (Zhou et al., 2019; Ullah et al., 2009;
    Hanif et al., 2019). (ii) The IoT devices stay in idle disconnected state while
    not communicating to the server. Hence, IoT devices observe the sleep time (idle
    time) between flows (Sivanathan et al., 2020). (iii) Machine-2-Machine (M2M) traffic
    assumes one of the three states: Periodic traffic exchange, traffic generated
    due to trigger of some event, or payload exchange (Finley et al., 2020; Jara et
    al., 2014). (iv) The IoT devices, being specific purpose device, transfer only
    limited data to the server in each of the network flow. Hence, low flow volume
    is observed for IoT devices. (v) Low flow volume infers to low average flow rate
    i.e., data transfer per unit of time. (vi) Each class of IoT device exists for
    a specific purpose. Hence, each of the device observe different data transfer
    patterns. Therefore, every IoT class has a specific pattern and value for the
    device''s behavioral attributes. So, the devices can also be classified and distinguished
    from each other based on device behavioral patterns. The behavioral class paves
    the foundation for the IoT-DDoS defense framework. The perceptive philosophy of
    IoT detection asserts that through the meticulous analysis of behavioral attributes
    within network traffic, including data transfer volume, frequency, and sleep time
    patterns, distinct patterns can be deduced, thereby enabling swift and precise
    differentiation between legitimate IoT traffic and nefarious attack traffic. 3.4.
    IoT-DDoS detection metric The proposed metric for IoT-DDoS detection utilizes
    a stack-ensemble algorithm built on top of XGBoost and Distributed Random Forest
    (DRF) algorithms. The two algorithms prove sequent intended to derive a meta-learning
    stack-ensembled algorithm. The proposed work presents the novelty of the machine-learning-based
    algorithm in selecting the best-performing base algorithms with tuned hyper-parameters.
    The illustration of the details of the individual participating base algorithm
    and meta-learning algorithms are as follows. 3.4.1. Distributed random forests
    and extreme gradient boosting The heart of IoT-DDoS detection meta-learning model
    lies in Distributed Random Forest (DRF) (Hoon et al., 2018) and Extreme Gradient
    Boosting (XGBoost) (Zhang et al., 2018) that are founded on decision trees. The
    Stack-Ensemble trains multiple unique classifier ensembles in a parallel fashion.
    The homogeneous ensembles are highly recommended for building a solid stack ensemble
    for ease of fusion (Tama et al., 2020). The experimentation uses the H2O.ai library
    to construct a stack-ensembled classifier that recommends using XGBoost, DRF,
    GBM, and GLM (the homogeneous classifiers built on top of Decision Trees) for
    a robust classification model. Several researchers have employed multiple classification
    algorithms for Network Intrusion Detection Systems and advocated the mentioned
    classifiers (DRF and XGBoost) for their best performance and classification results
    (Gouveia and Correia, 2020; Alzahrani and Alenazi, 2021; Chen et al., 2023). Another
    compelling motivation to use the XGBoost is the ability for distributed computing
    and parallelization for real-time prediction systems (Anande and Leeson, 2023).
    Furthermore, the model employs a more regularized model, thus providing better
    performance and reducing the model complexity to avoid overfitting (Sathiyapriya
    et al., 2023). Similarly, the DRF is advocated for its ability to reduce the correlation
    between trees by randomly selecting the features (Kwon and Lim, 2023). Hence,
    it improves the prediction power and results in higher efficiency. Another advantage
    of DRF is being good at handling high dimensional data because it can handle missing
    data, continuous, categorical, and binary data (Tama et al., 2020; Kwon and Lim,
    2023). The Stage-1 (Meta model) type is the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The
    model has more than two classes (device type) as outcome responses. The GLM classifier
    is recommended as the best fit for the given stacking of base classifiers (XGBoost,
    DRF, GBM) by the H2O.ai library because of its less susceptibility to overfitting
    (Tama et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023). Moreover, the model is easy to interpret
    and clearly understands how each base learner influences the outcome. The machine
    learning pipeline avoids errors/bias propagation to the next level by selecting
    strong learners as base classifiers. Hence, strong learners at the base are utilized
    to model a robust classifier at the meta-model stage. The internal nodes of the
    tree represent a test on the data characteristics (attribute), branch depicts
    the outcome from the test, and leaf holds the classification result. The choice
    for the algorithms is made on the fact that the network flows from the available
    datasets are in form of structured tabular data, hence decision trees algorithms
    are best-in-class. A Distributed Random Forest (DRF) works on the principle of
    Decision Trees operating as an ensemble. Each tree in the forest predicts the
    classification outcomes, and the class with the most votes becomes the prediction
    outcome of the model. Mathematically, if is prediction class of nth tree in random
    forest, then final prediction class of the random forest is defined in EQ. (7)
    as: (7) Random forests compute the feature importance as a factor of reduction
    in node impurity weighted by the likelihood of reaching that specific node. The
    probability of reaching the node ‘n’ is defined by EQ. (8) as: (8) The nodes in
    the classification forest are defined by Gini index as (EQ. (9)): (9) Here, is
    the relative frequency of a class under observation and ‘n’ are the total number
    of classes. The low correlation of individual trees protects each other from individual
    errors. Moreover, the model relies on critical features that make it perform better
    than random guessing. DRF takes advantage of the fact that decision trees are
    sensitive to training data, and a slight change in training data may alter the
    complete decision tree structure. Hence, DRF leverages bagging to generate a forest
    of unique decision trees. Furthermore, DRF builds the decision trees with a random
    subset of features to force more variations amongst trees resulting in a low correlation
    between trees, hence, the tree diversification. The core of XGBoost is the Decision
    Trees Ensembles (DTE) (Sangkatsanee et al., 2011; Rai et al., 2016). DTEs are
    based on the CART structures (Classification & Regression Trees) (Chkirbene et
    al., 2020; Douiba et al., 2023) that are the tree structures involving decisions
    at each level of the tree. The lineage of XGBoost can be attributed to its genesis
    in Decision Trees (DT). The advent of the problem-to-solution mapping technique
    was first marked by the introduction of Decision Trees, which relied on graphical
    representations to depict the mapping process visually. The series of advancements
    continued with Bagging techniques after Decision Trees, which employed a collective
    ensemble approach based on voting to combine predictions from many decision trees.
    After Bagging, the development of Random Forest marked the next stage in the progression,
    utilizing a feature subsampling mechanism to select random subsets of attributes
    and then rebuilding the forest model. The subsequent step in the process involved
    iterative reconstruction of the model to reduce inaccuracies, incorporating feedback
    from the previous model to enhance its performance. This process is commonly referred
    to as Boosting. Gradient Boosting, as an extension of the Boosted Model, entails
    the combination of multiple weak learners to construct a robust predictive model.
    Hardware and software optimization culminates in the development of Extreme Gradient
    Boosting, which characterizes boosted machines operating at an unparalleled efficiency,
    analogous to algorithms running on steroids (Gupta and Singh, 2023). 3.4.2. Stack-ensembled-meta-learning
    model The construction of a Stack-Ensemble Model can be represented as a two-stage
    process, as depicted in Fig. 9. In Stage-0, the base models (XGBoost and DRF)
    are trained to create a prediction dataset. The prediction dataset generated in
    Stage-0 is then utilized in Stage-1 to train the meta-model (Generalized Linear
    Model (GLM)). The trained model is subsequently employed for generating final
    predictions. In this work, the meta-model is trained on multiple variants of XGBoost
    and DRF by modifying various hyperparameters. The process of integrating and training
    these models is elucidated as follows: (i) Staging Stacked-Ensemble: The training
    dataset at level-0 (L0) is presented in form of a matrix ‘D’ with ‘M’ flows, each
    flow with ‘N’ features in ‘N’ columns and another matrix depicts the ‘M’ classification
    labels corresponding flows. (10) The base-learner set B is identified by another
    set of categorized base-learner sets as: where, . Here, the training process applies
    pre-specified configuration (hyperparameters) for XGBoost algorithm. Similarly,
    . The model illustrates the meta-model as . The meta-learning classifier combines
    the predictions for the base-learners. (ii) Training the Model: The development
    environment setup splits the IoT-DDoS dataset into training, test, and validation
    sets. The experiment trains each base learner on the training set. Thenceforth,
    the test and validation process performs k-fold cross-validation and gathers the
    model predictions in for each base learner. The authors have chosen stratified
    cross-validation for improved performance of the model. The ‘M’ predictions from
    each of the base learners are blended to form EQ. (11). The ML pipeline further
    trains the meta-model on combiner predictions resulting in prediction vector from
    meta-model. The model is then exported to the meta-model in binary file format
    for deployment as IoT-DDoS-Detection-as-a-Service. (11) (iii) Testing model on
    validation set: The meta-model is tested on the validation set and then deployed
    to production pipeline. Download : Download high-res image (342KB) Download :

    distributed random forest base learners. 3.4.3. Time and space complexity of base
    models Time complexity (often expressed in Big ‘O’ notation) refers to the time
    an algorithm takes to complete its execution as a function of the input size.
    It provides an upper bound on the worst-case running time of an algorithm. The
    temporal performance of XGBoost and DRF algorithms can be subcategorized into
    training and running time complexity. The depiction of time and space complexities
    are as follows. A machine learning algorithm''s training time complexity refers
    to the time it takes to train the model on a given dataset. This time complexity
    is often determined by the algorithm''s computational requirements, such as the
    number of iterations required to converge to a solution, the number of parameters
    to be estimated, and the training data size. Random Forest aims for low bias and
    variance. Let the dataset contains n flows. Additionally, if ‘t’ represents number
    of trees, ‘d’ denotes tree depth, ‘α’ symbolize yield from each tree, and ‘m’
    defines dimensions (or features). EQ. (12) defines the training time complexities
    of XGBoost and DRF. (12) Similarly, a machine learning algorithm''s running time
    complexity refers to the time it takes to make predictions using the trained model
    on new data. This time complexity is often determined by the algorithm''s computational
    requirements for processing and analyzing the new data, such as the number of
    features or dimensions in the input data and the number of operations required
    for making a prediction. EQ. (13) defines the running time complexity of base
    algorithms. (13) The comparative analysis of time complexities for both algorithms
    shows that DRF has a lower complexity than XGBoost because DRF builds decision
    trees in parallel, which can significantly reduce the training time. The space
    complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory or storage required
    by the algorithm to execute as a function of the size of the input. The space
    complexity of XGBoost and DRF algorithms for training can be affected by various
    factors, such as the training data size, the number of features, and the number
    of trees or boosting rounds used. EQ. (14) defines the space complexity of XGBoost
    and DRF for training. However, the exact space complexity can vary depending on
    the specific implementation and configuration of the algorithm. (14) The space
    complexity of an algorithm during running time refers to the amount of memory
    or storage required by the algorithm to make predictions or process new data as
    a function of the size of the input. During running time, the space complexity
    of XGBoost and DRF is typically lower than during training. The trained model
    is already stored in memory, and the input data can be processed in smaller batches.
    EQ. (15) defines the equations for space complexity of XGBoost and DRF. (15) The
    space complexities for both algorithms infer that the space complexity of XGBoost
    is higher than DRF. The higher space complexity for XGBoost is for storing the
    additional data structures, such as the gradient and hessian values used to update
    the model during training. 4. Proposed mitigation framework The mitigation strategy
    for an IoT-DDoS defense system is multifaceted. It encompasses essential elements,
    including universal dataset creation, feature reduction, feature selection, building
    stack-ensemble meta-models from multiple machine learning models, and proposing
    the deployment architecture for real-time attack detection. The proposed methodology
    defines a comprehensive five-stage approach, as illustrated in Fig. 10, for developing
    a robust IoT-DDoS defense system as follows: (i) Stage 1: Acquiring the Benchmark
    Datasets (ii) Stage 2: Generating an Amalgamated Dataset (iii) Stage 3: Feature
    Reduction and Feature Selection (iv) Stage 4: Stack Ensemble Model Generation

    The mitigation strategy for an IoT-DDoS defense system is multifaceted. It encompasses
    essential elements, including universal dataset creation, feature reduction, feature
    selection, building stack-ensemble meta-models from multiple machine learning
    models (XGBoost, Distributed Random Forest), and proposing the deployment architecture
    for real-time attack detection. The end-to-end process involves exporting the
    trained model as a portable binary model object (MOJO) for the model deployment.
    Furthermore, exported meta-learning MOJO is deployed as an independent IoT-DDoS
    attack detection available as an HTTP service. The entire configuration is deployed
    onto the fog layer for high efficiency and reduced response latency. The details
    of the individual stages involved in developing the proposed IoT-DDoS defense
    system are described as follows. 4.1. Acquiring the benchmark datasets The dataset
    acquisition and processing are the springboards for the proposed IoT-DDoS detection
    and mitigation framework. The stepping stone for the feature selection is extracting
    the flow entries into flow-feature-files (in .csv format) from raw network packet
    captures (in .pcap format) from the benchmark datasets. The experiment leveraged
    the publicly available IoT-based attack datasets in the study. The study used
    the following datasets to bring forth the amalgamated dataset for training, testing,
    and validation purposes. 4.1.1. BoT-IoT dataset The Cyber Security Lab, UNSW,
    Australia, divulged the recent BoT-IoT dataset primarily for the botnet scenarios
    (Koroniotis et al., 2019a). The publicly available dataset contains diverse traffic
    from 5 IoT devices in the controlled experimental environment. The dataset is
    available as network capture files from the smart-home scenario with IoT devices
    connected to cloud services. The authors of the dataset have used the application
    layer MQTT protocol for data transfer to the cloud. The MQTT protocol developed
    over standard TCP protocol works on the ‘publish and subscribe’ model and is a
    modern-day standard protocol for IoT devices. The datasets include attack traffic
    from IoT devices infected by Mirai and Bashlite. The BoT-IoT dataset contains
    benign and malicious traffic, with 7,33,51,357 packets in 49 pcap files. The legitimate
    traffic was generated by benign usage scenarios, such as browsing the web, sending
    emails, and downloading files. In contrast, the malicious traffic was generated
    by botnet malware, such as DDoS attacks, port scanning, and brute-force attacks.
    4.1.2. In-SDN dataset The In-SDN (Intrusion Detection in Software-Defined Networks)
    dataset is a publicly available dataset of network traffic generated by a software-defined
    network (SDN) environment collected for intrusion detection research. Researchers
    from the University of Padova in Italy created the dataset (Elsayed et al., 2020).
    The In-SDN dataset was generated using an SDN testbed consisting of an OpenFlow
    controller, two switches, and six hosts, each running different operating systems.
    The testbed was used to simulate a small network environment, with traffic generated
    by legitimate users and attackers. The lab environment utilized tools such as
    LOIC, slowhttptest, Hping3, Nping, Metasploit, and Nmap to create the attack vector.
    The attack vector includes DoS, DDoS, Web Attacks, Brute Force, Probe, and U2R
    Exploitation attacks. The dataset contains legitimate and attack traffic available
    in 150 pcap files. The dataset covers the cyberattacks found in the SDN elements
    at various planes of a software-defined network. The network traffic is classified
    into ‘Normal Group,’ ‘Metasploit Group,’ and ‘OVS Group.’ The dataset combines
    the benign and attacks traffic instances to produce a total number of 343,275
    instances. Regular traffic class contributes to 68,424 instances, 136,743 instances
    of Metasploit, and 138,772 instances of attacks on the OVS group. The authors
    have used CICFlowMeter to extract features into (.csv) format, containing the
    traffic as bidirectional flows. 4.1.3. UNSW-Sydney dataset The authors of the
    UNSW-Sydney dataset instrumented 28 IoT devices representing the smart-city scenario
    in the university lab (Sivanathan et al., 2019; Sivanathan and Gharakheili, 2023).
    For six months, they collected the traffic traces and published them as raw (.pcap)
    format files. They empirically demonstrated that the IoT devices could be classified
    using the behavioral traits of the underlying device, such as flow volume and
    sleep-time of specific purposed IoT devices. They constituted the roadbed for
    further research in the cyber security realm to classify the attack and benign
    traffic. The network traces contain the benign and IoT-DDoS traffic. 4.1.4. Simulation
    dataset The simulated dataset generation involves a complex simulation, including
    the legitimate IoT and attack traffic. The simulation process generates the data
    from digital twins for temperature, humidity, and smoke sensors over TCP, UDP,
    and HTTP protocols. The experimentation also involves setting up Raspberry Pi
    with sensors employing similar data transfer protocols. Therefore, the simulation
    entails various communication protocols that require a meticulous setup involving
    a range of tools, software, and underlying protocols. The experimental section
    of the article offers a thorough overview of all the technical details of the
    setup, presents a comprehensive account of the communication protocols, and lists
    the pieces of software and tools used to generate and monitor traffic. Table 3
    conveys the statistical information about the utilized benchmark and the simulated
    dataset. Table 3. Summary of datasets. Dataset Year Malicious Instance Number

    Dataset (ADS) generation entails extracting features from the available benchmark
    datasets, followed by a thoughtful and consistent fusion of the extracted data
    to form a hybrid dataset. The primary challenge of fusing datasets with divergent
    dimensionality is the most significant roadblock. The proposed methodology for
    dataset amalgamation adeptly overcomes this difficulty by seamlessly merging multiple
    benchmark datasets with different dimensions. The comprehensive details of the
    end-to-end process for generating the ADS are described as follows. 4.2.1. Feature
    extraction The experiment involves extracting significant features from raw PCAP
    files using the CICFlowMeter (Lashkari, 2016) tool. It is an open-source network
    traffic analysis tool developed by Canadian Cybersecurity Institute, designed
    to analyze network flow data and extract important features related to network
    security. The authors preferred selecting CICFlowMeter over an array of available
    feature extraction tools, including Snort, Bro, nProbe, Argus, SiLK, and TcpDump,
    as it uniquely incorporates statistical features and deep packet inspection, culminating
    in superior accuracy compared to tools that solely utilize statistical or flow-based
    features. Furthermore, the authors acknowledge that CICFlowMeter expertly handles
    high-speed network traffic while requiring minimal resources as it leverages multi-threading
    and parallel processing. Therefore, the tool ensures optimal performance on even
    the most demanding networks. The primary objective of this experiment was to investigate
    the behavioral attributes of network flow and assess its effectiveness in managing
    anomalies in network traffic. The behavioral approach aligns with recent privacy
    standards concerning personal, confidential, or encrypted data in communication.
    The study employed feature extraction techniques that extracted statistical data
    from network flows in contrast to deep packet inspection methods involving examining
    individual packets. The approach significantly reduced the analysis time and computational
    resources required while maintaining robust anomaly detection capabilities. Though
    the research enterprises have published the benchmark datasets in CSV format,
    the CSV-based datasets presently available have varying sizes in terms of available
    attributes and the number of features. Therefore, it is critical to undertake
    feature extraction from PCAP to ensure the appropriate fusion of multiple datasets.
    The CICFlowMeter mines 84 network attributes from the PCAP files as bidirectional
    flow entries. The seamless fusion of datasets necessitates that they conform precisely
    to the exact dimensions. Therefore, the authors employed CICFlowMeter to extract
    features from the available raw packet captures to normalize the features to a
    consistent number of attributes. CICFlowMeter leverages a hybrid approach to obtain
    accurate feature sets that conform to the desired dimensions, enabling seamless
    dataset fusion and reliable analysis. The Algorithm 1 explains the details of
    the feature extraction process. The algorithm describes that the input PCAP files
    are passed into the CICFlowMeter as the parameter, which returns the feature set
    in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. Download : Download high-res image (342KB)

    Dataset amalgamation The amalgamated dataset generation involved extracting the
    subset of flow entries from multiple datasets (BoT-IoT, InSDN, and UNSW Sydney)
    and collating the entries as a single dataset (as presented in Algorithm 2). The
    intricacies involved in the generation of an amalgamated and comprehensive dataset
    from the benchmark dataset are expounded upon with meticulousness as follows:
    (i) The foundation for extracting CSV-formatted feature files using CICFlowMeter
    is built upon the benchmark datasets (BoT-IoT, In-SDN, and UNSW-Sydney) acquired
    in PCAP format. (ii) The data mining and feature extraction process from the labeled
    benchmarked datasets generated CSV formatted feature files for each included dataset.
    The fusion process combines the extracted flow entries in a single dataset. In
    addition, the feature extraction process also plays a vital role in preventing
    various biases in the dataset. The employed amalgamation process and standardized
    tools for extracting the features help ensure that the dataset is free from measurement,
    selection, convenience, response, and under-coverage biases. (iii) Subsequently,
    the CSV-formatted dataset flows undergo labeling as entries of Legitimate Flow,
    TCP Flood, UDP Flood, and HTTP Flood, respectively. (iv) After that, the experimentation
    process randomizes the amalgamated dataset rows to add more generalization and
    remove any bias at the model training stage. The randomization of flow entries
    eliminates potential biases and guarantees that the sample is a representative
    and unbiased population selection. Hence, randomizing the flow entries ensures
    the retention of integrity and accuracy of the dataset. The randomization process
    is the Stratified Random Sample, which seeks to create an unbiased and balanced
    population representation. (v) The final step in the dataset preparation algorithm
    involves carefully selecting a random subset of the amalgamated dataset deemed
    crucial for the model''s training purposes. Download : Download high-res image

    amalgamate dataset (ADS). The amalgamation dataset helps cover the contemporary
    scenarios in multiple benchmark datasets and supports building a generalized,
    extensible, and robust model. 4.3. Feature reduction and feature selection The
    feature selection process involves pre-processing the features to reduce insignificant
    network traffic attributes and applying the feature selection technique to select
    the most significant elements. The network features are initially classified as
    numerical and categorical features. Algorithm 3 explains the feature selection
    process described as follows: (i) The feature reduction process consists in removing
    constant features having a zero standard deviation. (ii) The next step in the
    algorithm removes the quasi-constant features (having negligible variance threshold).
    The quasi-constant features do not add value to the self-learning model. (iii)
    Furthermore, the algorithm calculates the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
    (Bhuyan et al., 2021) of the remaining features and removes the highly correlated
    features. EQ. (16) calculates PCC for the remaining features and forms a correlation
    matrix. (16) (iv) Subsequently, the algorithm identifies and removes the flow
    identifier features such as Flow ID, Source IP address, Source Port, Destination
    IP address, and Timestamp. As IoT devices are exponentially immense in number,
    flow identifier features may be a nightmare for the training models and may not
    articulate any value to the model. (v) Lastly, the feature selection process applies
    ANOVA to numerical features and selects the 15 best features from the remaining
    numerical features. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    and selection process identifies the 17 best features (will be described in Section
    6) for model training. The features second the philosophy for IoT DDoS detection
    and include the behavioral attributes of IoT devices. The result section further
    comprehends the details of the results for feature selection. 4.4. Model generation
    for IoT-DDoS detection The stacked-ensemble meta-model against IoT DDoS attacks
    is built in multiple subsequent stages with underlying XGBoost and Distributed
    Random Forest (DRF) algorithms at the ensemble''s heart. XGBoost selects the random
    subset of the features from the feature set, creates the decision trees, and makes
    the predictions. The process is repeated multiple times result of the forecast
    is fed to the next iteration of random feature selections and further predictions.
    Contrary to XGBoost, DRF makes the predictions from the feature subset, and the
    resultant prediction set is fed to the meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is trained
    on new training set from underlying base models. The mathematical details and
    algorithm for the Stack-Ensemble description are detailed in section 3.4.2. 4.5.
    Model deployment The defense framework model against IoT-DDoS attacks is deployed
    in four parallel vital software components, namely: (a) Traffic Capture, (b) Traffic
    Monitoring, Analytics, and Detection, (c) Attack Detection Service, and (d) SDN-based
    Mitigation. These software components are autonomous and independent in their
    work. However, each software component communicates to send or seek the data.
    Fig. 11 shows the comprehensive view of the deployment model. Further, Fig. 12
    illustrates the flow diagram for end-to-end IoT-DDoS mitigation modules. The comprehensive
    details of the individual framework components are elucidated as follows. Download

    image Fig. 12. Traffic capture sequence flow chart. 4.5.1. Automated traffic capture
    The Fog layer employs an automated Python script at the entry point leveraging
    standard ‘tcpdump’ to capture ingress traffic traces with configurable PCAP size.
    The ‘tcpdump’ is configured for the ‘number of packets’. The default configuration
    is set to 10,000 packets. The ‘tcpdump’ keeps listening to the network until it
    captures the configured amount of packets. When the desired packets (say, 10,000
    packets) are captured, ‘tcpdump’ outputs the packets into PCAP and listens to
    another set of packets. Therefore, the prime responsibility of the ‘Traffic Monitoring’
    module is to listen to ingress network traffic and dump the packets into the PCAP
    file. 4.5.2. Traffic monitoring, analytics, and detection Traffic monitoring,
    analytics, and detection module are implemented as a Watchdog and corresponding
    Watchdog Handler (as shown in Fig. 12). The watchdog triggers FileCreateEvent
    as soon as ‘tcpdump’ creates a traffic dump file. The FileCreateEvent event handler
    converts the PCAP into a CSV feature file and queries the ‘IoT-DDoS attack detection
    service’ module for blacklisting of IP addresses sending the attack traffic. The
    blocked IP addresses are stored in ‘Blacklist-DB.’ 4.5.3. IoT-DDoS detection service
    The IoT-DDoS Detection Service module is deployed on a Docker-based H2O.ai pipeline
    with master and worker configuration for analyzing the real-time traffic to make
    predictions. The service responds to incoming HTTP requests for attack prediction
    with the required attributes as parameters to HTTP requests. The attack detection
    service module is upheld with the exported trained binary model, which serves
    as the heart of the service. 4.5.4. SDN-based mitigation Algorithm 4 describes
    the pseudo-code for the SDN-based mitigation module. The sequence diagram in Fig.
    13 depicts the mitigation module and classifies the web resource request into
    legitimate and attack requests. Various stages are labeled at the top of the sequence
    diagram for end-to-end traffic flow. Download : Download high-res image (413KB)

    framework. The legitimate case explains that SDN intercepts the request for web
    resources. SDN-based mitigation module queries Blacklist-DB for any blocked IP
    address. SDN is not involved in analytics, making the mitigation framework lightweight.
    In the event of a legitimate request with no entry for the incoming IP address
    in the database, the SDN quickly transmits the signal, enabling the traffic to
    flow smoothly. In contrast, SDN finds the IP address from the incoming request
    in the database for attack traffic and installs the rule to block traffic from
    the prohibited IP address. The proposed work expounds upon the end-to-end IoT-DDoS
    attack detection and mitigation process in real time. Each stage involved in the
    framework describes the communication between the atomic yet connected framework
    components bridging the gaps in the cutting-edge solutions. Thus, the proposed
    work offers a comprehensive toolkit that researchers can leverage to augment their
    research and development endeavors. 5. Experimental setup The proposed system
    development and deployment is a two-stage process. The earlier stage includes
    dataset mining, feature selection, and model training. The later stage consists
    of model deployment onto a fog computing environment. The model development, including
    features mining, ADS dataset generation, model training, and testing, is carried
    out on Intel i5 (CPU 1.60 GHz, 16 GB RAM) using Scikit Learn and H2O.ai libraries.
    The model deployment involves preparing the stage with a simulation setup. The
    deployment includes setting up sensor servers, actual sensor setup, digital twin
    for physical sensors, HTTP server, Botnet Network, and HTTP clients. The Mininet
    hosts the complete configuration mentioned above. The Mininet is configured in
    Network Address Translation (NAT) settings so that botnet and cloud servers (Sensor
    servers and HTTP Server) reside outside the Mininet hosts. The Mininet is assumed
    to mimic a fog layer network with a traffic monitor, attack detection module,
    IoT-DDoS detection service, database to store the blocked (attack) IP addresses,
    and a pox controller. The IoT-DDoS detection service is deployed on the cluster
    of H2O.ai Docker containers to leverage distributed computing for attack detection
    in real-time and to handle the volumetric traffic. The distributed H2O.ai nodes
    work as load balancers during high traffic. The botnet and cloud servers are deployed
    on separate virtual machines. The details of the simulation setup are as follows:
    (a) Sensor Servers: The experiment involved deploying proprietary TCP, UDP, and
    HTTP servers for the Sensor network. (b) Real-Sensor Setup: The real-sensor setup
    was done using a ‘Raspberry Pi Model B’ for setting up the physical layer. The
    ‘Raspberry Pi’ was interfaced with temperature and humidity sensors (DTH22 Temperature
    and Humidity Sensor Modules) and was responsible for sending the data to the cloud
    server in raw-bytes format over TCP and UDP. DTH22 has the inbuilt conversion
    capability for A2D (Analog to Digital). Hence, it can be interfaced with Raspberry
    without any additional chips. (c) Sensor Simulators: Additionally, the temperature,
    humidity, and smoke sensor simulators were added to generate physical layer traffic
    for underlying physical layer extrapolation. The traffic was transmitted over
    TCP and UDP for raw-byte transfer and HTTP for application layer packet format.
    (d) Tuning the data transfer parameters in sensor nodes: The connection of sensor
    nodes and the packet sizes for data transfer to the server is simulated mimicking
    the IoT behavioral attributes from the employed amalgamated dataset. (e) HTTP
    Web-Server: Apache web server was deployed on one of the designated cloud nodes
    for delivering web pages over HTTP. (f) Simulation of Feedback loop: Furthermore,
    to close the feedback loop in the simulated cyber-physical system, an alert system
    was designed to generate alarms and alerts if the sensor values from the physical
    layer were reported to go beyond the threshold. The alerts were generated in the
    form of email alerts and delivered to the pre-configured email addresses. (g)
    Botnet Network: The botnet network involved the development of a C&C server and
    several Bots for executing the ‘LAUNCH’ command for the attack traffic. The Botnet
    network was coded leveraging Hping3 and SCAPY to support several DDoS attacks
    types (TCP, UDP, and HTTP). Moreover, the botnet architecture is extensible to
    support more attack types. (h) HTTP Clients: The custom HTTP clients were deployed
    over several nodes to query the HTTP server. 6. Results and analysis The experiment
    was initiated with the feature reduction and selection process. Subsequently,
    the investigation advanced to the training of a Stack-Ensemble of XGBoost and
    DRF models employing the selected features. The resultant outcomes at various
    stages of the experiment are detailed in the subsequent sections. 6.1. Dataset
    amalgamation and feature selection The dataset underpinning the experiment consisted
    of network traffic traces that combined legitimate traffic, TCP Flood, UDP Flood,
    and HTTP Flood. Table 4 presents the details of the flow statistics extracted
    from the benchmark datasets. The table highlights that the amalgamation dataset
    included ample instances of each attack category. Table 4. Flow extraction summary.

    400,424 143,296 173,121 12,17,050 The amalgamated dataset originally contained
    83 features (Excluding the output label). The features were classified into 72
    numerical, nine categorical, and two object features. During the numerical features
    processing (72 features), the feature reduction process initially examined the
    amalgamated dataset for constant features and identified four features as constants.
    Subsequently, the strategy identified and removed two quasi-constant features.
    After that, two duplicated features were removed from the dataset. The further
    stage involved removing the highly correlated features. Here, PCC (Bhuyan et al.,
    2021) was calculated (as defined in EQ. (16)) for the remaining feature set forming
    a correlation matrix as shown in Fig. 14. The correlation matrix resulted in thirty-six
    highly correlated features. Therefore, the numerical feature reduction resulted
    in 30 available features. The subsequent step applied ANOVA to the remaining thirty
    features and selected 15 best available numerical features. Table 5 shows the
    feature importance based on their ANOVA scores. The categorical features are represented
    with ANOVA scores as ‘NA’ i.e. ‘Not Applicable’. Download : Download high-res

    the study identified and removed five flow identifier features (Flow ID, Source
    IP, Source Port, Destination IP, and Timestamp). There are three categorial and
    two object features in flow identifiers. Henceforth, Chi-Square removed four more
    features from the categorial list based on their p-Values, leaving two categorical
    features for further processing. Therefore, the selection process left 17 best-suited
    features for further consideration (as depicted in Table 5). The presented table
    unequivocally indicates that device behavioral attributes occupy the highest ranking
    positions in the list of selected features. As a result, the experiment aligns
    with the overarching IoT-DDoS detection philosophy that underscores the significance
    of device-centric anomalies in identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks in IoT
    environments. 6.2. Model development The experiment entails evaluating the two-stage
    meta-model in multiple orientations. The study evaluates performance metrics such
    as Mean-per-class-error, Logloss, MSE, RMSE, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Model
    hit ratio, Recall, Precision, and F1-score. Therefore, multiple and exhaustive
    analysis of metric performance projects the resiliency of the model in an isometric
    view. There are multiple models involved in the course of constructing the Stack-Ensemble
    model. The following section elucidates the individual performance of each model
    through the comparison of losses. 6.2.1. Models leaderboards The ensembled models
    are trained and evaluated against an amalgamated dataset tuned to the hyperparameters.
    Table 6 presents the details of the model leaderboard describing the performance
    parameters. Table 6. Model performance details. Model ID Optimal Parameters Mean

    illustrates the optimal parameters for underlying algorithms and minimal error
    values. The statistical data presented in the table shows that the Meta model
    has the most negligible Mean Per-Class Error (7.49893e-05), Logloss, RMSE, and
    MSE values. The significantly low error infers that the predicted flow labels
    are skinned to actual values. Furthermore, the experiment observed the training
    time of 9940 milliseconds for DRF, 8234 milliseconds for XGBoost, and 31487 milliseconds
    for meta-model. 6.2.2. Model''s learning curves A model''s learning curve represents
    how the performance of a model improves as the amount of training data increases.
    It plots the learning performance of the model during the incremental training
    process over time. Fig. 15 defines the learning curve regarding the number of
    participating trees and logloss. The plot of logloss against incremental values
    of the number of trees signifies that the divergence of logloss decreases with
    increasing the trees in the learning mode. Download : Download high-res image

    15 (a) shows the higher deviation for the meta-model at the start of the training,
    and it starts stabilizing at nearly 20 decision trees. However, a value of 50
    is selected for a robust meta-model. The XGBoost learning curve has stabilized
    at a value near 60 (in Fig. 15 (b)). DRF''s learning curve (in Fig. 15 (c)) has
    assumed a value of 44 for stabilization. Training and validation have yielded
    a tightly coupled learning curve in the case of Meta-learner and XGBoost. However,
    DRF has shown high variation in learning curves for training, cross-validation,
    and validation data. 6.2.3. Confusion matrix and performance metrics The experimental
    observations collate the performance of the machine learning models in the Confusion
    Matrix. The confusion matrix plots the actual class (on the y-axis) and the predicted
    class (on the x-axis). The dictionary CM (in EQ. (17)) symbolizes the confusion
    matrix presentation of actual and predicted classes as: (17) The confusion matrix
    in Fig. 16 (a)-(e) depicts the results of the experiment on validation and cross-validation
    data for meta and base models. Each figure in the sequence is annotated appropriately
    and represents an unambiguous interpretation of the corresponding confusion matrix.

    as well as base models. The confusion matrix infers high True Positive (TP) and
    True Negative (TN) rates. The False Positives and False Negatives have values
    tending to zero. Hence, the confusion matrix advocates the underlying machine
    learning model as ideal. Therefore, the model''s accuracy is highly encouraging,
    with an accuracy percentage of 99.99. The confusion matrix in Fig. 16 depicts
    a very high accuracy in Meta-Model. The statistical data extracted from the confusion
    matrix for the meta-model are collated in Table 7. The table outlines vital performance
    metrics often ignored by researchers, such as Precision, Accuracy, Recall, and
    F1-Score. Furthermore, it is inferred by the presented statistical data that the
    system is highly accurate, with a value of 99.99% for the validation performed
    with Amalgamated Dataset. The high values of Accuracy (99.99), Precision (99.99),
    Recall (99.99), and F1-Score (99.99) endorse the highly accurate system model.

    from the confusion matrix (in Fig. 16 (c)) shows an accuracy of 98.84% on simulation
    data in the live production environment. The simulation resulted in the collateral
    damage of 1.52%, where legitimate traffic was reported as attack traffic. Fig.
    17 illustrates the performance summary visualization for Stack Ensemble model.
    The graphs are indicative of the high performance of the Stack-Ensemble algorithm
    as compared to XGBoost and DRF. Therefore, the Stack-Ensemble combines the two
    robust classifiers to build a resilient system. Here, the base models have been
    chosen as strong classifiers to have a minimal impact on any error propagation
    from the base models. Download : Download high-res image (422KB) Download : Download

    feature reduction on system performance The feature selection reduced the 84 extracted
    features by 80%, positively impacting the system performance. The system observed
    97.37% accuracy with the amalgamated dataset with all the features included and
    99.99% with the reduced feature set. However, the accuracy gaps increased when
    tested in the simulation environment. The model trained with all the features
    reported an accuracy of 65.32%, whereas the model trained on a reduced feature
    set maintained a high accuracy of 98.84% in the simulated environment. The above
    results inferred that the model trained on the complete feature set is barely
    resilient in the practical environment due to overfitting. Similarly, the experiment
    observed a reduction in training time for the reduced features in contrast to
    complete features in the amalgamated dataset from 545.87 sections to 9.94 seconds
    for DRF, from 513.80 seconds to 8.23 seconds for XGBoost, and from 2109.83 seconds
    to 31.49 seconds for meta-model. The experiment further noted an average prediction
    time of 23.6 microseconds with the complete feature set and 10.29 microseconds
    with the reduced feature set in the simulation environment. Therefore, feature
    reduction helped reduce 98.5% in training time and 56.4% in prediction time. 6.4.
    Empirical results for performance study (fog computing vs cloud computing Fog
    computing is an extension of cloud computing that brings computing and storage
    capabilities closer to the end-users. It provides the power to applications for
    real-time data processing and low-latency communication. In this context, the
    present paper conducts a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation
    of fog-computing-based IoT-DDoS defense solutions. The details of the empirical
    fog analysis are as follows. 6.4.1. Qualitative assessment Qualitative analysis
    of deploying IoT-DDoS defense solutions at fog computing offers subjective characteristics
    and qualities, such as its benefits and potential applications, through non-numerical
    methods. It can provide valuable insights into fog computing solutions'' feasibility,
    usability, and effectiveness as follows: (a) It acts as a reservoir of resources
    between the perception and cloud computing layers. (b) It saves network bandwidth
    by lowering network traffic to the cloud, cost savings, quicker reaction time,
    and enhanced security close to the edge devices. Hence, the solutions expecting
    low latency are recommended to be deployed at the fog-computing layer. (c) Fog
    works best for small deployment models, has less operational complexity, is more
    cost-effective due to low-specification machines, and works well even with intermittent
    network connectivity. (d) Fog nodes perform essential communication and networking
    functions close to the end-users, rather than redirecting tra?c data into the
    backbone network, allowing the cloud network to concentrate on its primary functions.
    Fog computing provides a network edge with cloud-like services. (e) Due to its
    proximity to end users, Fog Computing supports a variety of application domains.
    6.4.2. Quantitative assessment For quantitative analysis of the fog-based solution
    is done by conducting the performance assessment of the security solution deployed
    at the fog-computing layer. The experimentation setup was stress tested to evaluate
    the reliability and consistency of the web requests. Reliability is defined as
    the maximum execution time, and consistency is defined as the number of failed
    connections. The measurements were taken using the open-source stress/load testing
    tool JMeter. JMeter was configured for a continuous increase of load on the cloud-based
    web server. The load tests instructed the JMeter to simulate 100, 200, 500, and
    1000 concurrent connections and execute 1000 requests for each connection (For
    example, 100 simultaneous connections would result in 100,000 requests). The results
    are then compared with a similar setup with a security solution deployed at the
    cloud-computing layer. The setup has leveraged an Azure-based virtual machine
    (AVD) for the experimentation setup. Table 8 summarizes the maximum execution
    time for fog versus cloud requests for each stress test. The stress test results
    show that fog-based security solution records significantly lower maximum execution
    time, with differences in maximum latency measured at 99.4% (at 100 connections),
    70.7% (at 200 connections), 89.8% (at 500 connections), and 68.9% (at 1000 connections).
    Table 8. Max. execution time in milliseconds (fog vs cloud). No. of Parallel Connections
    Execution Time (Fog) Execution Time (Cloud) Difference Percentage 100 467 72,278
    71,811 99.4 200 28,642 97,811 69,229 70.7 500 8672 85,260 76,588 89.8 1000 16,387
    52,692 36,305 68.9 Similarly, Table 9 presents the number of failed connections
    for fog and cloud for each test scenario in the stress test. The results show
    zero failed connections for 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, and 1000,000 web requests.
    However, the study recorded a failure rate of 0.08% (for 100 connections), 1.58%
    (for 200 connections), 1.25% (for 500 connections), and 1.27% (for 1000 connections).
    Table 9. Failed requests (fog vs cloud). Parallel Req. Failed Req. Percentage
    Failed Req. Percentage Difference (X1000) (Fog) (%) (Cloud) (%) (Fog vs Cloud)(%)
    100 0 0 82 0.08 0.08 200 0 0 3,178 1.58 1.58 500 0 0 6,275 1.25 1.25 1000 0 0
    12,749 1.27 1.27 The quantitative study seconds the inferences of qualitative
    study for fog vs cloud setups. However, the outcomes of the experiment are a factor
    of underlying hardware, internet connectivity, software or hardware dependencies,
    or failure rates due to network disruptions. Hence, the fog model gives a better
    performance than the cloud-based security model. Additionally, apart from the
    quantitative/qualitative details of fog/cloud, the fog-computing is further justified
    as: (a) The IP addresses are gigantic during a DDoS attack. And, these IP addresses/attack
    devices grow on a gigantic level considering the exponentially growing IoT-devices.
    Hence, the system is designed for enormous IoT-devices. (b) Second, the decision
    making for attack traffic is not one time. The architecture of the system at fog
    computing layer shows that there is continuous monitoring of incoming network
    traffic, attack detection, and mitigation. Hence, the system represents a real-time
    defense system against IoT-DDoS attack. (c) The mitigation module blocks the incoming
    traffic from a blocked IP address for a configurable time window and is analogous
    to the flow table of SDN. Once the time window is expired for a particular IP
    address (say, blocked IP), the incoming traffic from the blocked IP is re-evaluated
    for its legitimacy. Hence, given that the empirical data for fog-computing for
    system performance, failure rate, high volume IP addresses, and continuous monitoring
    and mitigation of attack traffic, the fog computing is not an optional layer.
    6.5. Comparison with state-of-the-art defense frameworks It is vital to consider
    the influencing factors in multiple dimensions for assessing the security framework.
    The critically important is the training and validation of machine learning algorithms
    against benchmark datasets of superior quality. The model trained against a single
    benchmark dataset could be inefficient in handling the diverse attack scenarios
    containing diverse network traffic patterns. Hence, an amalgamated dataset yielded
    from multiple datasets can provide more reliable results and test the system''s
    effectiveness in various scenarios. Similarly, other benchmarks include vital
    performance metric discussion, computational load distribution, on-demand service,
    solution coupling approach (tightly coupled or decoupled), and latency reduction.
    Table 10 compares the proposed system with state-of-the-art against the parameters
    mentioned above. Table 10. Comparison with state-of-the-art defense frameworks.

    research on the IoT-DDoS framework seeks to evaluate the system''s efficacy by
    utilizing Machine Learning algorithms and multiple datasets. The system''s effectiveness
    is assessed based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as
    its resistance to novel and sophisticated attacks and its ability to handle volumetric
    and real-time data. Additionally, the proposed solution evaluates the framework
    in multiple dimensions. 7. Discussion and future scope The paper presents a comprehensive
    mitigation framework for IoT-based DDoS attacks. The ever-increasing adoption
    of IoT devices has increased security concerns, and DDoS attacks on IoT networks
    have become a significant threat. The authors have invested considerable efforts
    in designing and conducting experiments to develop a robust and reliable defense
    solution. The end-to-end system design comprised a five-stage defense framework
    that leverages physical devices'' behavioral attributes to identify and mitigate
    IoT-DDoS traffic. The experiment employed multiple stack-ensembled algorithms
    to enhance security against an ever-evolving threat landscape. Furthermore, the
    mitigation framework designed and published a service for attack detection on
    top of the Docker framework for a cost-effective, reusable, and portable framework.
    The responses to research queries, objectives, and accomplishments are as follows.
    The experiment involved proposing the IoT-DDoS detection philosophy based on IoT
    devices'' behavioral attributes to prepare a response to RQ1. The attack detection
    philosophy described that IoT devices are specialized, low-powered, less secure
    devices and exhibit specific behavioral patterns such as low-volume data exchange,
    specific flow durations, and sleep intervals between consecutive flows. The philosophy
    further described using behavioral attributes to detect IoT-based DDoS attacks.
    The work involved proposing a real-time mitigation framework against IoT-DDoS
    attacks. The experimental work involved acquiring three benchmark datasets: BoT-IoT,
    InSDN, and UNSW-Sydney. Further, the experiment thoughtfully combined the three
    datasets to form the amalgamated dataset to incorporate the diverse IoT-DDoS attack
    scenarios for a resilient mitigation framework. Moreover, the work involved setting
    up the simulation environment based on analyzing the amalgamated dataset. The
    work contributed the amalgamated and simulated dataset for IoT-DDoS to the research
    community, resolving RQ2. Further, the Stack-Ensemble model was trained and tested
    on the amalgamated dataset after performing the feature engineering. The encouraging
    results helped answer RQ3. The selected features followed the IoT-DDoS detection
    philosophy. Furthermore, the paper offered to decouple the mitigating module.
    The service-based architectonics at the fog computing layer offered a low-latent,
    cost-effective, reusable, and portable defense solution. The proposed solution
    delivered a light mitigation scheme in a fog-assisted software-defined environment
    and ensured a minimal impact on the SDN performance. The decoupled configuration
    deployed on the orchestration of Docker-based architecture for the mitigation
    solution offered effective responses for RQ4, RQ5, and RQ6. Though the paper fills
    the gap in state-of-the-art, there is a vast scope for further research. The number
    of IoT devices continues to increase, thereby increasing heterogeneous network
    traffic. The machine-learning algorithms have their limitation to work with gigantic
    network traffic. Therefore, the paper recommends using deep learning algorithms
    so that research focuses on developing more sophisticated and adaptive defense
    mechanisms to counter these threats effectively. The paper offered an approach
    for generating an amalgamated dataset by fusing multiple benchmark datasets. However,
    the paper recommends developing and integrating an automation framework to fuse
    newly released or simulated datasets into existing amalgamated datasets. Moreover,
    emerging techniques such as blockchain and artificial intelligence can provide
    more robust and efficient security solutions for IoT devices. Moreover, future
    work can cover more sophisticated and specialized protocols for IoT devices such
    as MQTT. 8. Conclusion The prolific increase in vulnerable IoT devices adapted
    by widely dispersed cyber-physical systems is accountable for inducing the volumetric
    network traffic. Moreover, IoT devices are involuntarily contributing to IoT-DDoS
    attacks. The paper has offered the IoT-DDoS detection philosophy based primarily
    on the behavioral characteristics of IoT devices. The research generated an amalgamated
    dataset from BoT-IoT, InSDN, and UNSW-Sydney for operative model training and
    comprehensive validation. The paper established that existing security solutions
    are deployed in the cloud environment and negatively impact cloud resource utilization
    and latency issues. Thus, the paper proposed an ameliorated fog-computing layer
    for data filtration, distributed computing, and reducing latency in data transmission.
    The experiment showcased the improvement of execution time between 68 and 99 percent
    and trivial failed requests in the fog computing environment. Further, the paper
    introduced a multi-stage stack-ensembled-based defense framework rooted in XGBoost
    and Distributed Random Forest. The paper demonstrated through empirical results
    that the model was outmatched with an accuracy of 99.99% when it was validated
    on an amalgamated dataset. The higher values of precision (99.99%), recall (99.99%),
    and F1-score (99.9%) endorsed the system''s resilience, robustness, and accuracy.
    The performance metric parameters in the simulated lab environment exhibited an
    accuracy of 98.84%, precision of 98.8%, recall value of 98.8%, and an F1-score
    of 98.8%. The collateral damage observed during the experimentation process where
    benign traffic was identified as attack traffic was 1.52%. The captured dataset
    for the simulated lab environment is published for the research community and
    is available on a request basis. The paper has proposed a cost-effective, reusable,
    and novel IoT-DDoS-Detection-as-a-Service (IDDaaS) interface for the research
    community. The docker-based distributed computing nodes deployed on the fog computing
    layer stand as the foundation for the IDDaaS interface. The paper offered a unique
    lightweight defense architecture for SDN-based networks. In future work, the solution
    is proposed to be extended to leverage the big-data tools for in-memory computations.
    The experimental study was limited to TCP, UDP, and HTTP flooding attacks. The
    article recommends extending the defense solution to cutting-edge technologies
    such as blockchain, unsupervised deep learning, and IoT protocols such as MQTT.

  description: Object Detection and Tracking have gained importance in recent years
    because of the great advances in image and video analysis techniques and the accurate
    results these technologies are producing. Moreover, they have successfully been
    applied to multiple fields, including the agricultural domain since they offer
    real-time monitoring of the status of the crops and animals while counting how
    many are present within a field/barn. This review aims to review the current literature
    on Object Detection and Tracking within the field of Precision Farming. For that,
    over 300 research articles were explored, from which 150 articles from the last
    five years were systematically reviewed and analysed regarding the algorithms
    they implemented, the domain they belong to, the difficulties they faced, and
    which limitations should be tackled in the future. Lastly, it examines potential
    issues that this approach might have, for instance, the lack of open-source datasets
    with labelled data. The findings of this study indicate that Object Detection
    and Tracking are critical techniques to enhance Precision Farming and pave the
    way for robotization for the agricultural sector since they provide accurate results
    and insights on crop and animal management, and optimize resource allocation.
    Future work should focus on the optimal acquisition of the datasets prior to Object
    Detection and Tracking, along with the consideration of the biophysical environment
    of the farming scenarios.

  explanation: 'Object Detection and Tracking (ODT) using computer vision techniques
    has emerged as a powerful tool in precision agriculture. This technology enables
    the identification, classification, and tracking of objects of interest in agricultural
    settings. The use of ODT has been demonstrated across various agricultural applications,
    including crop monitoring, pest detection, disease identification, and resource
    optimization.


    ODT involves two fundamental tasks: object detection and object tracking.


    * **Object detection** refers to the identification and localization of objects
    of interest within an image or video frame. Deep learning algorithms, such as
    convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for object detection.
    These algorithms are trained on extensive datasets containing labeled images to
    recognize and locate specific objects.


    * **Object tracking** involves following the detected objects over time, even
    if they move or change appearance. Object tracking algorithms typically use a
    combination of motion models and appearance matching techniques to maintain the
    object''s identity and location across consecutive frames.


    The integration of ODT into precision agriculture offers numerous benefits. By
    enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of crops and livestock, farmers and
    researchers can make data-driven decisions to optimize production processes, reduce
    costs, and minimize environmental impact.


    Here are some notable examples of ODT applications in precision agriculture:


    * **Crop monitoring**: ODT can assist in counting and measuring crop yield, assessing
    plant health, and detecting nutrient deficiencies using drone or satellite imagery.

    * **Pest detection**: ODT can identify and track pests, such as insects and rodents,
    enabling targeted pest control measures to reduce crop damage.

    * **Disease identification**: ODT can assist in the early detection of plant diseases
    by analyzing visual symptoms and patterns on leaves and stems.

    * **Resource optimization**: ODT can be used to monitor and optimize the use of
    resources, such as water and fertilizer, by analyzing irrigation patterns and
    crop growth rates.


    Despite the advantages of ODT, certain considerations and challenges should be
    taken into account for its successful implementation in precision agriculture:


    * **Data availability**: Training and validating ODT models require large and
    diverse datasets. Acquiring labeled data in agricultural settings can be time-consuming
    and expensive.

    * **Computational requirements**: ODT algorithms often demand significant computational
    resources for training and inference, which may not be readily available on-farm.

    * **Environmental factors**: Agricultural environments can be affected by weather
    conditions, illumination variations, and occlusions, which can impact the performance
    of ODT algorithms.

    * **Real-time requirements**: Many precision agriculture applications require
    real-time or near real-time processing of data, which poses additional challenges
    for ODT algorithms to meet latency constraints.


    Overcoming these challenges requires ongoing research and development in ODT algorithms
    and methodologies. Future advancements in deep learning, edge computing, and sensor
    technologies hold promising prospects for enhancing the capabilities and practicality
    of ODT in precision agriculture.'

    agriculturePrecision Livestock farming 1. Introduction Due to the constant increase
    in population (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs and Division,
    2022), the reduction in the amount of arable land (Azadi et al., 2011), and the
    unpredictable and increasingly severe climate patterns due to climate change,
    the current agricultural and food production systems are facing several challenges
    (Misra, 2014, Pereira, 2017). Precision Farming (PF) (Blackmore, 1994) originated
    from the need to farm with limited resources applying only the inputs that are
    required by the crop to enhance the productivity of the field while conducting
    the most sustainable farming practices and taking into consideration the environment
    (Auernhammer, 2001). Addressing these challenges through Precision Farming offers
    substantial economic and sustainability benefits. For instance, targeting chemical
    interventions allows enhanced economic viability for the farmer, but also contributes
    to sustainability by minimizing waste, reducing the environmental footprint, and
    ensuring long-term food security for a growing population (Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-Deboer,
    2004, Martos et al., 2021). Recent technological advancements offer innovative
    tools that harness their capabilities for diverse agricultural applications. These
    technologies include satellite (Vélez et al., 2022) and UAV-based remote sensing
    (Sishodia et al., 2020, Tsouros et al., 2019), data analytics, and Computer Vision
    tasks, which have empowered farmers with new tools to tailor farming practices
    to specific conditions and needs, improving the traditional image processing techniques
    and reducing the manual tasks required. These include the precise identification
    of pests and diseases, enabling accurate and precise chemical applications (Ariza-Sentís
    et al., 2023c, Qiang and Shi, 2022, Vélez et al., 2023), comprehensive vegetation
    assessments (Campos et al., 2019, Chang et al., 2020, Matese et al., 2017, Vélez
    et al., 2021, Vélez et al., 2020), insights into crop physiology (Lacerda et al.,
    2022), detailed analyses of plant structure (Escolà et al., 2023, Xiao et al.,
    2023), plant water stress assessment (Bellvert et al., 2015, Gutiérrez et al.,
    2018) and the evaluation of quality and biophysical parameters (De Grave et al.,
    2020, Frampton et al., 2013, Gatti et al., 2022, Martínez-Peña et al., 2023b,
    Martínez-Peña et al., 2023a, Matese et al., 2022). Furthermore, the adoption of
    automation and robotics for farming purposes has streamlined labour-intensive
    tasks, such as visual inspections of the fields and farms, making farming more
    efficient and sustainable (Marinoudi et al., 2019). In particular, Deep Learning
    (DL) (LeCun et al., 2015, LeCun and Bengio, 1995) has shown important advances
    in agriculture in performing various important tasks such as plant phenotyping,
    yield estimation, crop classification, or disease detection (Ariza-Sentís et al.,
    2023b, Bouguettaya et al., 2022, Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Zhou et
    al., 2023). In addition, when Deep Learning-based Object Detection is integrated
    with tracking, it gives rise to a distinct field known as “Object Detection and
    Tracking”, an area that has seen rapid growth in recent years, driven by advancements
    in GPU computing power (Davies, 2004), mainly due to the decrease in their costs,
    and the boost in image analysis techniques. Hence, the number of research studies
    performed on those domains has increased significantly, drawing significant attention
    to DL projects (Vargas et al., 2017). Object Detection along with Object Tracking
    offers a robust approach compared to Object Detection alone since it presents
    several advantages across applications. While Object Detection identifies objects
    in static frames, the integration of tracking provides temporal continuity, which
    enables object counting and trajectory analysis (Ahmed et al., 2019). Further,
    it generates richer datasets due to object-tracking across frames, which enhances
    accuracy and boosts informed decision-making. Moreover, the combination of Object
    Detection and Tracking preserves the identity of the object, aiding in scenarios
    involving occlusion (Babaee et al., 2018, Lee et al., 2014). The agricultural
    and livestock domain has also benefited from this trend. Object Detection and
    Tracking techniques have shown great potential to enable behaviour analysis and
    object interactions, which is crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles
    and enhancing animal welfare (Khairunissa et al., 2021); allowing plant ID recovery
    even if a plant temporarily leaves the view of the camera, ensuring individual
    plant recognition and avoiding repeated spraying by the robot (Hu et al., 2022);
    or to develop key tasks such as detecting plants and their fruits (de Jong et
    al., 2022, Zhang, Wang et al., 2022), which eases the inspection time which is
    currently carried out by field operators. Moreover, Object Detection and Tracking
    permit the automation of crop harvesting to improve field productivity and optimize
    operational costs (Junos et al., 2021), paving the way for robotization of the
    agricultural sector. Furthermore, Object Detection and Tracking allow for precise
    monitoring and management of livestock animals’ movement (Huang et al., 2023,
    Myat Noe et al., 2023). It facilitates real-time analysis of behaviours and health
    metrics, which optimizes care and resource allocation for each individual animal.
    The challenges and applications of Deep Learning in agriculture have been comprehensively
    addressed in prior surveys (Alibabaei et al., 2022, Bouguettaya et al., 2022,
    Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Wang, Cao et al., 2022). However, there is
    a notable absence of literature reviews specifically focusing on the integration
    of Object Detection and Tracking in enhancing Precision Farming techniques. Consequently,
    the motivation for writing this review article was to address the need for a comprehensive
    analysis of the utilization of Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques applied
    to Object Detection and Object Tracking within the field of Precision Farming,
    considering the increasing interest in this sector and the potential transformative
    effects on food security and fostering sustainable agricultural practices. To
    the best of our knowledge, this is the first review conducted in the field of
    Object Detection and Tracking applied to Precision Farming. This review aims to
    solve two research questions: RQ1: What are the current advancements, challenges,
    and potential future research lines in the implementation of Computer Vision and
    Deep Learning methods within Precision Farming? RQ2: How can the integration of
    Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques in Precision Farming be optimized
    to maximize their impact? The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 explains
    the methodology followed in this study to select and revise the research articles
    that exist inside the domain of study. After, Section 3 introduces the concept
    of Object Detection and Tracking, their applications, and how they have evolved
    until the present. Section 4 includes the most-known algorithms for Object Detection
    and Tracking used in the field of Precision Farming, along with several use cases
    that have already shown a lot of potential within the agricultural field and the
    conceivable problems that were found in the literature. Finally, Section 5 and
    Section 6 include the Discussion and Conclusions, respectively. 2. Methodology
    This review systematically analyses the current literature related to Object Detection
    and Tracking within the field of Precision Farming, following the Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al.,
    2009). Regarding the protocol and registration, the systematic review was conducted
    retrospectively, involving three main steps to carry out the bibliographic analysis:
    (1) identification of the available work, (2) filtering out work not related to
    the agricultural and livestock domain, and (3) meticulous and precise review for
    each of the papers collected in the previous step. Regarding the filtering stage,
    it aimed to refine the dataset and enhance the relevance of the selected papers.
    This step was necessary because, despite papers were searched with keywords belonging
    to the agricultural and livestock domain, some unarticles also appeared in the
    search results and, to solve that, the filtering step was required. For information
    sources, the search was conducted in three scientific databases (accessed between
    April 4th and April 6th, 2023): ScienceDirect (ScienceDirect [WWW Document], 2023),
    Springer (Springer [WWW Document], 2023), and Google Scholar (Google Scholar,
    2023), chosen for their extensive coverage of the scientific literature in technology
    and agriculture. Eligibility criteria for studies covered by the review included
    journal articles and conference papers published in English within the last five
    years (2018–2023) to ensure the inclusion of recent and up-to-date research findings.
    The search strategy combined keywords to adequately cover the scope of the study,
    and the following four search keywords were introduced in each of the three mentioned
    datasets: • “Object Detection and Tracking” AND “agriculture” OR “farming”. •
    “dataset” AND “Object Detection and Tracking” AND “agriculture” OR “farming”.
    • “Object Detection” AND “agriculture” OR “farming”. • “tracking” AND “agriculture”
    OR “farming”. An overview of all the research articles found utilizing the four
    mentioned search keywords in ScienceDirect is shown in Fig. 1. In the study selection
    process, a total of 150 papers were retrieved from each database, resulting in
    a combined initial dataset of 450 papers, from which 150 were filtered because
    they belonged to the agricultural and livestock domains. In addition, some interesting
    additional documents were added to this review, extracted from the references
    of the retrieved articles, for instance, databases and other reviews. The data
    collection process was systematically executed, with key information from each
    paper being documented, such as authors, publication year, and main results related
    to Object Detection and Tracking techniques within Precision Farming. Extracted
    data included detailed study characteristics such as objectives, methodology,
    outcomes, and findings pertinent to the study scope. Download : Download high-res

    of the number of research papers found in ScienceDirect when the four research
    keywords mentioned were introduced. To answer these research questions, each selected
    paper was reviewed and examined, the findings were documented, and key information
    about the research questions was extracted from each paper. The primary measure
    for synthesis was the contribution of each study to the understanding of Object
    Detection and Tracking techniques, considering the effectiveness and applicability
    of the research. Finally, the synthesis of results employed a qualitative narrative
    approach due to the diversity of methodologies and outcomes present in the literature,
    providing a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in the
    domain. All these steps aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
    current state of research related to Object Detection and Tracking techniques
    in the agricultural and livestock domain. 3. Object Detection and Tracking Object
    Detection and Tracking are a branch of Deep Learning and Computer Vision that
    is used to identify and follow instances of visual objects belonging to different
    classes within their environments (Porikli and Yilmaz, 2012, Yilmaz et al., 2006).
    It has evolved with time regarding the algorithms and architecture implemented
    (Fig. 2), having a further and deeper development during the 2010s for Object
    Detection and during the 2020s for Object Tracking. Object Detection and Tracking
    have already been applied to several domains. A relevant area of application is
    person identification for video surveillance systems (Fradi et al., 2018, Tang
    et al., 2014), to ensure social-distancing rules during Covid-19 pandemic (Punn
    et al., 2021), to estimate the human pose (Wang et al., 2020), and for people
    counting in crowded scenarios (Salim et al., 2019, Sidla et al., 2006), obtaining
    promising results that explain the increased focus they received in recent years.
    Another domain that has greatly benefited from the advances in Object Detection
    and Tracking is vehicle detection for smart transportation and surveillance systems
    (Amrouche et al., 2022, Hassaballah et al., 2021, Wang and Zhang, 2022), for enhanced
    autonomous driving (Sadik et al., 2022, Wael, 2020), and for number-plate identification,
    which can be used to fine any traffic-rule violations (Babu and Raghunadh, 2016),
    among other utilizations. However, to optimize these AI applications and achieve
    high-performance metrics, it is essential to consider multiple processing steps
    and the modifications made since their inception. Download : Download high-res

    milestones in Object Detection and Tracking, showcasing the progression of key
    algorithms and architectures from foundational approaches in 1980 to recent advancements
    in the 2020s, demonstrating the continuous innovation in Computer Vision over
    time. 3.1. Evolution of Object Detection R-CNN (Girshick et al., 2014) started
    in 2014 to improve Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It presented a novel two-stage
    detection architecture, which extracted regions in an image, called proposal regions,
    which used a selective method to combine images into larger ones. It was then
    fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Noble, 2006) to classify whether a specific
    region contained an object. This approach was faster than its predecessors, but
    at the time it was still incapable of real-time detection. Fast(er) R-CNN (Girshick,
    2015, Ren et al., 2015) was developed as an improvement to R-CNN. It enhanced
    the previous algorithm by creating a convolutional feature map that saved the
    region of the images, avoiding feeding multiple regions into the SVM over and
    over, which improved the speed of training and detection significantly. A succeeding
    advancement to Fast(er) R-CNN, proposed by He et al. (2017), was Mask R-CNN, which
    aimed to increase the accuracy of detected objects by applying instance segmentation
    on top of bounding boxes. The mask of each object was added just as an overhead
    to not affect the training and detection time significantly. Mask R-CNN was beneficial
    in detecting and recognizing packed objects such as cars in traffic, people in
    crowds, and other objects that need per-pixel accuracy to differentiate. After
    Fast R-CNN and its modified version Faster R-CNN were made, more efficient methods
    were developed that only had a one-stage detection step; (1) YOLO: You Only Look
    Once (Redmon et al., 2016) and (2) Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) (Liu et
    al., 2016). Unlike Fast(er)R-CNN and its predecessors, YOLO and SSD were detectors
    with a single stage. They applied a single neural network to the entire image,
    rather than extracting and verifying proposal regions. The neural network divided
    the image into many regions before simultaneously predicting and estimating bounding
    boxes and classes without an intermediate region proposal stage. Compared to its
    two-stage equivalents, the architecture of YOLO and SSD detected objects far more
    quickly than its two-stage counterparts, which expands their applicability to
    real-time detections. Nevertheless, these models might struggle with detection
    accuracy, especially in the case of small objects. Hence, it is relevant to choose
    the algorithm to be used considering the trade-off between detection accuracy
    and speed. YOLO has also received many incremental improvements such as YOLOv2
    and YOLOv3 (Redmon and Farhadi, 2018, Redmon and Farhadi, 2017). With each iteration,
    the speed and accuracy of YOLO improved significantly. YOLOv3 achieved a detection
    speed almost 100x (100 times) faster than Fast(er) R-CNN. However, YOLO was not
    accurate in identifying small objects in an image. There have been more iterations
    of YOLO (YOLOv2 to YOLOv8), which have tried to alleviate this problem while simultaneously
    improving the accuracy and speed. Lastly, EfficientNet (Koonce, 2021) is a convolutional
    neural network architecture developed by Google Research that uses a compound
    coefficient to uniformly scale all the dimensions (depth, width, resolution).
    3.2. Evolution of Object Tracking Object Tracking in Computer Vision typically
    involves processing a series of images or an entire video. Earlier algorithms
    often employed a technique that separated each frame''s moving object from the
    background (Wang et al., 2000), then developed a track for the detected object.
    However, due to the limitations at that time, there were many problems such as
    tracks being lost, low FPS, limited track numbers, and inaccurate detections.
    Nowadays, with the improvement of detection algorithms, Object Tracking is done
    in two steps: Object Detection using a detection algorithm, and then tracking
    the identified object. This framework is called tracking by detection (Leibe et
    al., 2007). The tracking by detection framework is the most widely researched
    method of tracking. The tracking step is done by utilizing different methods such
    as optical flow (Horn and Schunck, 1981) and Kalman filter (Welch and Bishop,
    2006). Other more modern methods include 3D convolutional layers (Carreira and
    Zisserman, 2017). Multi-Object Tracking (Leal-Taixé et al., 2015) has become a
    valuable Computer Vision task. Nevertheless, since the tracking is based on simple
    bounding boxes, its accuracy is reduced when objects are occluded. Furthermore,
    Multiple Object Tracking can utilize historical information within videos, which
    can be useful during the evaluation and identification of agricultural objects
    to achieve multi-surface detection of these products (Chen, An et al., 2021).
    Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) included instance segmentation to
    solve the issue mentioned above. It was developed by Voigtlaender et al. (2019),
    together with TrackR-CNN, the first end-to-end trainable framework for Object
    Tracking. It used the Mask R-CNN detection algorithm in conjunction with two 3D
    convolutional layers to give the algorithm the ability to associate detections
    over time, while also dealing with the temporal dynamics of the image sequence.
    Subsequently, TrackR-CNN decided which detections were the same between images
    with the help of the Hungarian algorithm. With the information it acquires, it
    subsequently links the detections over time. While it is a reliable tracking algorithm,
    there are several other more state-of-the-art algorithms to improve the tracking
    performance of TrackR-CNN. Following the introduction of TrackR-CNN, several MOTS
    algorithms were developed, such as PointTrack (Xu et al., 2020), ViP-DeepLab (Qiao
    et al., 2020), ReMOTS (Yang et al., 2019), ByteTrack (Zhang, Sun et al., 2022),
    and StrongSORT (Du et al., 2023), among many others. A common characteristic of
    the algorithms presented above is that all of them have been tested using a dataset
    annotated with MOTS standards that includes the classes of pedestrians and cars,
    called KITTI MOTS (Geiger et al., 2013). However, there are several different
    characteristics of each algorithm regarding the method of functioning. PointTrack
    reaches accurate metrics by converting images into 2D point cloud representations,
    which permits a tracking-by-points system (Neven et al., 2019). Instead, ViP-DeepLab
    implements 3D point clouds to estimate the class, spatial location, and temporal
    location of each point cloud (Nguyen and Le, 2013). ReMOTS employs a straightforward
    self-supervised method to enhance tracklets (a cluster of frames generated by
    the system) derived from predicted masks. ByteTrack operates on binary features
    extracted from object templates, which significantly reduces computational burden
    and memory usage. Finally, StrongSORT is the fusion of appearance and motion information,
    which allows the creation of robust and discriminative embeddings that are capable
    of encoding spatial and temporal information about tracked objects. 4. Object
    Detection and Tracking applications in Precision Farming There have been many
    advances in Object Detection and Tracking in several fields. However, they do
    not always easily apply to agriculture and farming because of the complexities
    and particularities of the domain, such as homogeneity and occlusion of objects,
    which complicates the tracking task. Hence, they require tailor-made solutions
    that adapt to the specific challenges (Pezzementi et al., 2018). All the relevant
    works regarding Object Detection and Tracking within Precision Agriculture, which
    were examined and selected according to the process described in the Methodology,
    are discussed in detail in this section. It starts by introducing the most commonly
    used algorithms and afterwards, it separates the papers concerning the research
    area that they belong to, and it ends by providing the issues that this topic
    is currently facing. 4.1. Object Detection and Tracking algorithms There is a
    great variety of algorithms used for Object Detection and Object Tracking. For
    Object Detection, Convolutional Neural Networks, a type of artificial neural network
    for recognizing patterns in images, are the most popular algorithms currently
    in use (Xu, Khan et al., 2022). Further, many CNN algorithms have been developed
    and published open-source in recent years, which has boosted the progress of Convolutional
    Neural Networks used for Object Detection in Precision Farming (Fuentes et al.,
    2017, Magalhães et al., 2023, Wosner et al., 2021). A very well-known CNN-based
    algorithm is YOLO and all its developed versions, including tracking in the latest
    version, called YOLOv8. There is a great variety of research papers regarding
    Object Detection in Precision Farming that have utilized YOLO algorithms for the
    identification of the target topic (Mota-Delfin et al., 2022, Myat Noe et al.,
    2023, Xu, Wang et al., 2022). Regarding Object Tracking, Deep Simple Online and
    Realtime Tracking (Deep SORT) (Wojke et al., 2017) has shown potential while obtaining
    high tracking precision and accuracy metrics (Osman et al., 2021) since the algorithm
    tracks based on object appearance. Table 1 provides a comprehensive summary of
    the five emerging methods that are widely used in the domain of Object Detection
    and Tracking in Precision Farming. Table 1. Most relevant algorithms used in Object
    Detection and Tracking in Precision Farming. Name of the algorithm How it works
    Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) (Solis-Sánchez et al., 2011, Yao et al.,
    2015) – Function: Identifies and matches features in an image. – Advantages: Robust
    to changes in scale, rotation, and illumination. – Explanation: SIFT detects and
    describes local features in images, making it ideal for object recognition or
    matching images across different perspectives.  Simple Online Realtime Tracking
    (SORT) (He et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2022) – Function: Identifies objects in
    the frame that are to be tracked. – Advantages: Lightweight and fast, suitable
    for real-time tracking. – Explanation: SORT computes a cost matrix based on the
    Intersection over Union (IoU) distance between detection and prediction locations,
    refining Object Tracking.  Speeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) (Rahmat et al., 2018,
    Rani et al., 2022) – Function: Detects and describes image features. – Advantages:
    Faster and more efficient than SIFT, suitable for real-time applications. – Explanation:
    SURF uses integral images and a series of filters to quickly identify interest
    points in an image.  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Čirjak et al., 2023, Ganesh
    et al., 2019, Li, Zhang et al., 2020) – Function: Trains on large datasets to
    identify objects or features in images. – Advantages: Highly accurate for image
    classification and Object Detection tasks. – Explanation: CNNs use layers of convolutions
    to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images.
    – Model Examples: i. Fast R-CNN: Uses selective search to generate Regions of
    Interest, speeding up the detection process. ii. Faster R-CNN: Introduces a Region
    Proposal Network (RPN) to generate region proposals directly. iii. Mask R-CNN:
    Adds a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest. iv.
    YOLO: Detects objects in a single forward pass of the network. v. SSD (Single
    Shot MultiBox Detector): Detects objects in various aspect ratios using a single
    forward pass, making it faster than many other methods. vi. EfficientNet: Optimized
    for performance and efficiency, often used as a backbone for more complex tasks.
    vii. EfficientDet: Builds on the EfficientNet architecture, offering state-of-the-art
    accuracy with fewer parameters and smaller model sizes.  Mean Shift (Friedman
    et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2019) – Function: Estimates the mode of a distribution
    to find the most likely position of an object. – Advantages: Non-parametric and
    doesn''t assume any prior shape on the data distribution, making it versatile.
    – Explanation: Mean Shift iteratively shifts a window towards regions of higher
    pixel density, tracking objects based on their previous location and movement.
    There are more algorithms used in Precision Farming. However, the ones mentioned
    in Table 1 are the ones most commonly used and the ones that provide the highest
    metrics. Nevertheless, the selection of the algorithm depends on many variables,
    such as the type of application, the number of accessible images and/or videos
    for training the algorithm, the type and size of the object to be detected and
    tracked, and the computational resources available (El-gayar et al., 2013). 4.2.
    Successful use cases Since the development of Object Detection and Tracking, there
    have been many research papers focused on enhancing the current methodology used
    in agricultural and farming systems, such as greenhouse detection (Li, Zhang et
    al., 2020) to monitor agricultural activities and land use management, and anomaly
    detection (Christiansen et al., 2016) in order to identify obstacles for tractors
    and animals, such as humans. Some of them combine both agriculture and livestock
    fields of study. For instance, Sadgrove et al. (2017) performed real-time feature
    extraction and object classification in agricultural landscapes, allowing for
    weed detection, together with cattle and quad bike identification (Sadgrove et
    al., 2018), which enables future research on intelligent cultural machine auto-guidance.
    Another related paper was presented by Qiu et al. (2020), where they used an improved
    version of YOLOv3 and Deep SORT with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) score
    of 0.779 to detect and track moving obstacles, such as humans and water buffalos.
    They aimed to develop an obstacle avoidance system for smart agricultural equipment
    operating in rice fields. Further, Yun et al. (2021) proposed a stereovision method
    for auto-guidance of a cultivator which was based on detecting and tracking the
    inter-rows between ridges and furrows. They were able to classify ridges and furrows
    with an accuracy above 90 % under outdoor conditions, with an RMSE ranging from
    2.5 to 6.2 cm, depending on the terrain, whether flat or hillside. 4.2.1. Horticulture
    and floriculture The majority of the research papers found regarding Object Detection
    and Tracking in horticulture focus on tomatoes in greenhouses as the subject of
    study. In 2021, a real-time robotic system for tomato fruit growth monitoring
    in greenhouses was developed (Seo et al., 2021). It reached 88.6 % of detection
    accuracy including fruits that were completely obscured to the camera and 90.2
    % when those fruits were excluded. It showed potential to use the system to predict
    harvest times, and yield, and to develop a harvesting robot. In 2022, Ge et al.
    (2022) included the yield prediction and improved the detection accuracy by comparing
    Deep SORT and YOLOv5 (Fig. 3). The former showed better metrics, with a mean average
    precision (mAP) of 93.1 %, 96.4 %, and 97.9 % for flower, green tomato, and red
    tomato detection, respectively, representing a 17 %, 2 %, and 2.3 % improvement
    compared to the results obtained with YOLOv5. In 2023, an improved method for
    tomato cluster yield estimation in greenhouses was proposed (Rong et al., 2023).
    It used the improved version YOLOv5-4D trained with data augmentation methods
    and reached 97.9 % detection accuracy and a mAP of 0.748. ByteTrack was adopted
    to track tomato clusters since it is specifically designed to overcome ID-shift
    problems. Nonetheless, there was still a counting error of 4.9 % due to ID shifting.
    Future work in the field of Object Detection and Tracking for tomatoes involves
    classifying tomato maturity to provide more accurate yield estimation. Download

    Ge et al. (2022) The biggest challenge identified in the strawberry harvesting
    field is regarding the ripeness of the fruits since they are commonly surrounded
    by obstacles to be avoided to properly automate the harvesting task. Xiong et
    al. (2021) combined YOLOv4 and Deep SORT to focus on the target during picking,
    even if the fruit was partially occluded by the gripper. They reached a 62.4 %
    accuracy rate, which improves by 36.8 % the metrics obtained in previous work.
    Future work involves working with multi-view perception to avoid fruit occlusion
    to the greatest extent. Apart from horticulture, there is a great industry devoted
    to Floriculture, which consists of the production of plants that produce colourful
    and showy flowers. Houtman et al. (2021) presented an automated flower-counting
    method that considered multiple viewpoints to avoid flower occlusion. It was tested
    on Phalaenopsis plants and was capable of tracking the flower movement even when
    those were not observed. They employed the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT)
    approach with a connected and an unconnected flower plant model. The achieved
    accuracy was 92 % for the model connected with the flower plant model, 70 % for
    the unconnected, 58 % with a heuristic method, and 44 % for a single-image approach.
    The high accuracy of the connected model was explained indicating that it reduced
    underestimation caused by flower-occlusion. Future work involves the estimation
    of the flower size. 4.2.2. Grain, fibre, and plantation crops Among the grain
    and fibre category, cotton is the most studied, accounting for 50 % of the research,
    followed by corn, likely because cotton and corn have higher revenue than other
    grain crops, such as barley and wheat (Singh, 2016). Hence, most of the research
    focuses on those crops. Regarding cotton, Yang et al. (2022) implemented an anchor-free
    Object Detection model based on CenterNet and Deep SORT with MOTS to prevent repeated
    counting (ID switching) of cotton seedlings. In this process, the method used
    a track confirmation mechanism for the unmatched trackers, which were assigned
    to unmatched detections. After, they were classified as tentative during the three
    following frames, until it was confirmed, in which case they stayed, otherwise,
    they were rejected. They obtained an R2 = 0.967 and RMSE = 0.394, indicating its
    potential for other applications. Also in 2022, Tan et al. (2022) combined YOLOv4
    and optical flow to enhance tracking speed. The F1 score obtained was 0.98, the
    average precision was 99.12 %, an ID switch of 0.1 %, and a relative error for
    counting across videos of 3.13 %. The counting speed increased from 2.5 to 10.8
    frames per second, offering the possibility of tracking cotton seedlings in real-time.
    However, the model failed to detect seedlings with different shapes, small sizes,
    and extreme occlusion conditions, a problem that might be solved by training the
    model with additional data. With respect to corn, Zhang, Lu et al. (2020) and
    Zhang, Kayacan et al. (2020) proposed a low-cost robot to automate plant trait
    extraction to reach efficient phenotyping in corn plants. Moreover, the robot
    was capable of counting corn stands by autonomously driving through the field.
    Faster R-CNN trained with only 169 images was used to detect corn plants in RGB
    images, obtaining accurate results and an RMSE of −3.78 %. The algorithm was tested
    on 53 plots and obtained an R2 = 0.96 when compared to ground truth data. Future
    work involves augmenting the training data to avoid underestimating the corn population.
    It was the first step towards autonomous field robot real-time phenotyping for
    corn. Lastly, Zhao et al. (2020) introduced the problem of missing open-source
    datasets and pre-trained models for bale detection, which are also affected by
    varying illumination conditions as is also the case of tea buds (Fig. 4). They
    trained YOLOv3 with 243 images counting with good illumination conditions and
    also combined the model with data augmentation. The detection accuracy obtained
    regarding illumination, shadow, hue change, and snow conditions were enhanced
    by 15 %, 26 %, 10 %, and 28 %, respectively. The detection accuracy was at least
    80 % for all conditions. Future work involves acquiring more images to train the
    algorithms and make them robust enough to be implemented under all conditions
    and potentially other crops. Another important issue while trying to detect and
    track continuous crops such as grain and fibre crops is occlusions. As already
    mentioned, multiple-camera systems can provide a solution to this, however, they
    introduce the concern regarding camera calibration and object matching (Khan and
    AlSuwaidan, 2022). Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download

    brightness images. (). Adapted from Li et al., 2023 4.2.3. Woody crops Woody crops
    are the category within Precision Agriculture with the most research papers regarding
    Object Detection and Tracking since tree and crown detection (Selim et al., 2019)
    together with fruit detection (Chen, An et al., 2021) have gained a lot of importance
    to monitor tree growth, fruit size (Zhang, Valente et al., 2021) and also to predict
    the yield to be harvested at the end of the campaign to contribute to the development
    of intelligent orchards (Lyu et al., 2022). Among woody crops, apple trees, citrus
    trees, and grapevines are the most studied. Moreover, woody crops such as apple
    and citrus trees share a lot of common characteristics. For instance, the colour
    of the fruit is different from the canopy once it is ripe and ready to be picked.
    Also, the fruit’s round shape, size, and geometry, which enables the research
    performed for one crop can easily be applied to the other crop. Most of the studies
    devoted to fruit identification have obtained high metrics above 90 % regarding
    the detection accuracy of the fruits (Ganesh et al., 2019, Kestur et al., 2019,
    Tu et al., 2020). However, some difficulties arise once tracking is added. Several
    articles have studied the detection and tracking of apples, oranges, lemons, and
    avocados, concluding that the biggest challenge found was that there is an occlusion
    factor during image acquisition and the creation of ground truth data (He et al.,
    2022, Villacrés et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2016) along with the dependency of
    the algorithm on the quality of the training set (Vasconez et al., 2020, Xu and
    Mishra, 2022). Another important issue is ID switching while tracking, which leads
    to inaccurate reference displacement and tracking deviation (Gao et al., 2022)
    and double counting of the fruit, which Zhang, Wang et al. (2022) solved by establishing
    a specific tracking region counting strategy. Vineyard management is a very valuable
    task since the quality of the wine, which is a highly rewarded product, depends
    on all the practices that are conducted in the vineyard and the inputs that are
    applied. Hence, it is important to monitor grape bunch development in order to
    maintain healthy and productive vines (Fig. 5). However, there are great differences
    between white and red varieties, which ease the detection of the latter when the
    bunches are ripe because of the colour distinction between the bunch and the canopy
    (Liu and Whitty, 2015, Torres-Sánchez et al., 2021, Zhang, Ding et al., 2022).
    Therefore, the detection and tracking of white varieties become a more demanding
    task. The two biggest challenges identified in the field of grape bunch detection
    were the occlusion of the fruit due to dense canopy (Ariza-Sentís et al., 2023a,
    Guadagna et al., 2023, Shen et al., 2023) and data scarcity, which Ciarfuglia
    et al. (2023) addressed training the datasets with pseudo-labels for the detection
    and segmentation tasks. Further, (Ariza-Sentís et al., 2023d, Santos et al., 2020)
    provided open-source datasets to solve data scarcity in vineyards. Download :

    Vision tasks applied to grape bunches. Source. Santos et al. (2020). 4.2.4. Weed
    detection Weeds are known to reduce crop yield since they take resources, such
    as water and fertilizer, that were applied to the field for the crop but are absorbed
    also by weeds, lowering the remaining amount for the crop itself (Klingman and
    Noordhoff, 1961). Moreover, weeds in a field make the crop compete for a fundamental
    resource: light. Therefore, weed detection is key in Precision Agriculture to
    optimize the inputs of the crop and to apply the chemical only to the areas that
    have the presence of weeds, lowering the cost for the farmer and producing a more
    sustainable end-product (Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-Deboer, 2004). Some studies
    work with RGB imagery for precise weeding, using CNN-based algorithms, such as
    Faster R-CNN (Khan et al., 2021), any version of YOLO (Gallo et al., 2023, Lac
    et al., 2022) (Fig. 6), and InceptionV4 (Mishra et al., 2022). An advantage of
    working with RGB imagery is that it is convenient for the farmers since these
    sensors are more affordable to have on a farm. Rani et al. (2022) provided a framework
    that combined Histogram of Gradients (HOG) and SURF (Speeded Up Robust Feature)
    algorithms. It was added to a field robot, which could automatically detect weeds
    for various crop types and sizes and decide whether to spray weedicide. However,
    research should also consider multispectral sensors since they are capable of
    evaluating information beyond the visible spectrum, which can be key to identifying
    issues at an early stage. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download

    using YOLOv5. (). Adapted from Alam et al., 2022 4.2.5. Disease and pest detection
    Diseases and pests interrupt or modify the vital functions of the crops, reducing
    the photosynthetic rate of the plant and leading to a lower yield at the end of
    the campaign and economic losses for the farmer. Moreover, the end-product might
    be contaminated by fungi (mycotoxins), bacteria, viruses, and animals such as
    insects, which can affect the rest of the food chain (Oliveira et al., 2014, Torres
    et al., 2019). Further, early identification of fungal and other microorganisms’
    attacks in crops can provide a proper time-window to effectively apply the appropriate
    treatment (Vélez et al., 2023), which can be done thanks to the development of
    Object Detection and Tracking (Coulibaly et al., 2022). Most of the research articles
    found regarding pest detection were identified within grain and oilseed crops,
    such as maize (Ishengoma et al., 2021, Sheema et al., 2021), wheat (Chen, Li et
    al., 2021, Li et al., 2019), and soybean (Abade et al., 2022, Tetila et al., 2020,
    Verma et al., 2021) (Fig. 7). The same pattern was diagnosed with disease detection,
    led by wheat leaf diseases (Jiang et al., 2022, Kumar and Kukreja, 2021, Lin et
    al., 2019, Singh and Arora, 2020, Su, Zhang et al., 2021), followed by rice (Bari
    et al., 2021, Zhou, Zhang et al., 2019), and soybean (Zhang, Wu et al., 2021).

    Fig. 7. Soybean insect pests examples used to train the pest detection algorithm.
    Source: Tetila et al. (2020). There were two big challenges found for disease
    and pest detection with Object Detection and Tracking. The first consists of the
    lack of public datasets to train the algorithms (Čirjak et al., 2023). The second
    is the capacity classify multiple diseases (Kaur et al., 2022) or pests simultaneously
    (Qiang and Shi, 2022, Wen et al., 2022, Zhang, Huang et al., 2022) or when are
    in dense clusters (Wang, Li et al., 2022) since most of the time, once the plant
    is debilitated by the presence of a pathogen or animal, it is more likely to develop
    more diseases or pests. Further, the developed algorithms should be able to generalize
    for other diseases or pests (Hong et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2022). Besides, the
    majority of disease and pest detection research papers were trained with CNN-based
    algorithms (Amrani et al., 2023, Pavithra et al., 2023, Rezk et al., 2022, Storey
    et al., 2022). Lastly, interesting research was performed by Acharya et al. (2022),
    where they detected and tracked droplets in images to measure their size and velocity,
    which provided insights into the effectiveness of spraying systems. In order to
    be able to apply precise spraying, the algorithm needs to offer real-time detection
    and tracking (Roy et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2021, Xu, Chen et al., 2022) and
    incorporate them in mobile terminals to boost agricultural productivity (Chodey
    and Noorullah Shariff, 2023). 4.2.6. Plant phenotyping Plant phenotyping is an
    emerging field of study that combines multiple methodologies and protocols in
    order to measure and extract plant traits. The obtention of those traits is important
    to better understand the functioning of the crops, which can lead to an increase
    in yield production and a more optimized calibration of crop models and enhanced
    genomic selection (Heffner et al., 2009, Jannink et al., 2010). High-throughput
    phenotyping in Precision Agriculture is relevant to upgrade management practices,
    while producing more efficiently and reducing the invested inputs, such as fertilizer,
    water, and pesticide (Qiao et al., 2022). It is of crucial importance to continue
    the development of phenotyping by combining it with the recent advances in technology
    (Mochida et al., 2019). For instance, Ariza-Sentís et al. (2023a) established
    a methodology to extract phenotyping traits of grape bunches and berries, such
    as their length, width, and shape. To do so, they first detected and tracked the
    grape bunches in RGB videos and afterwards, they identified berries within the
    detected bunches (Table 2). Further, Santos et al. (2020) detected and tracked
    grape bunches with several Computer Vision tasks, and Kierdorf et al. (2022) provided
    a method to estimate occluded grape berries by implementing conditional generative
    adversarial networks (cGAN), a variant of GAN that involves the generation of
    images with conditions imposed by a generator model. Table 2. Grape berry counting
    prediction compared with the ground truth value. . Image crop (Ground Truth) Spatial
    Embeddings prediction GT count vs prediction 43/47 22/23 45/39 Adapted from Ariza-Sentís
    et al. (2023a) Nevertheless, most of the research papers devoted to phenotyping
    perform Object Detection without considering the tracking part, even if the term
    tracking is mentioned. This is due to the fact that in many cases, tracking is
    understood as crop monitoring, without considering the methodology used, which
    in most cases is monitored using time series instead of tracking inferring the
    Computer Vision task. Phenotyping has shown a lot of potential in grain and oilseed
    crops because of their annual cycle, which allows observing the improvement made
    directly in the following campaign, which speeds up phenotyping tasks. Hence,
    most of the studies related to phenotyping are focused on continuous crops, such
    as maize (Kienbaum et al., 2021, Warman et al., 2021, Xiang et al., 2023, Zou
    et al., 2020), wheat (Furbank et al., 2019, Gong et al., 2021, Li, Li et al.,
    2021, Sadeghi-Tehran et al., 2019), rice (Deng et al., 2021, Tan et al., 2023),
    soybean (Li, Yan et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2023, Pratama et al., 2020, Yang et
    al., 2021), and forages (Castro et al., 2020). The same reasoning applies to horticulture,
    such as lettuce (Bauer et al., 2019), strawberries (Zheng et al., 2021), and cucumbers
    (Boogaard et al., 2020), which mostly breed for characteristics related to higher
    yield along with resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pests and
    diseases, and drought, salinity, and sodicity (Kumar, 2006). 4.2.7. Livestock
    and other animals The primary sector encompasses a wide range of activities, including
    agriculture, forestry, and fishing, among others. One area that has seen significant
    growth in recent years is the application of Object Detection and Tracking technologies
    for animal management (Alanezi et al., 2022). The inherent nature of this sector,
    which involves the rearing, breeding, and overall management of livestock and
    wildlife, has driven this surge in interest. These advanced technologies offer
    a multitude of benefits, such as monitoring animal health, tracking movement,
    and identifying specific individuals for breeding or research purposes (Morrone
    et al., 2022). As a result, various solutions have been developed and implemented,
    improving efficiency, productivity, and overall animal welfare (Tuyttens et al.,
    2022). The focus on animals in the primary sector highlights the potential impact
    of Object Detection and Tracking, encouraging further research and innovation
    to extend its application to other aspects of the sector (Yousefi et al., 2022).
    Most of the studies related to Object Detection and Tracking for livestock aim
    to count the number of animals that are present within the field of view of the
    surveillance camera (Zheng et al., 2023a) or a thermal camera (Kim and Kim, 2020),
    in the case of indoor animals, or construction time-lapsed camera or UAV, in the
    case of observing pastures (Bonneau et al., 2020, Cao et al., 2023). One of the
    direct applications of Object Detection and Tracking is the monitoring of the
    animals, which allows observing certain behaviours that might be causing some
    illnesses, such as lameness (Zheng et al., 2023b), or for disease prevention and
    control (Xu et al., 2021, Zhuang and Zhang, 2019). Some studies present a general
    methodology with applicability to other farming animals. For instance, Haalck
    et al. (2023) developed a methodology to study small animal behaviour in complex
    environments, which provides helpful information since their gained knowledge
    can be applicable to other terrestrial species under realistic conditions. The
    poultry industry has a lot of research on this topic, mostly for counting broilers
    for precision chicken management (Li, Zhao et al., 2022) (Fig. 8) and continuous
    movement monitoring on farms (Siriani et al., 2022). Also, it can be useful to
    compare two groups with different feeding possibilities, such as restricting and
    unrestricted feeding birds, and extract conclusions such as which target group
    walks more around the feeder, which be helpful for an optimized feeder design
    and resource placement (Li, Hui et al., 2021). The swine industry also allocates
    lots of resources to pig counting for efficient and low-cost farm management (Kim
    et al., 2022), to monitor individual activity as a measure of resilience (van
    der Zande et al., 2021), and to automatically identify social contacts such as
    head-head and head–tail contacts to enhance animal monitoring systems (Wutke et
    al., 2021). An interesting case study is the one presented by (Chang and Guo,
    2018), where they use IP cameras to detect monkeys that damage crops and alert
    farmers that they are approaching the fields to prevent crop losses. Download

    Identification of healthy and sick indoor broilers using Object Detection techniques.
    . Adapted from Zhuang and Zhang (2019) Three remarkable challenges were observed
    for animal detection and tracking: first, the lack of open-source datasets. To
    address this, Tu et al. (2022) provided a public dataset containing annotations
    of group-housed pigs, and (Vayssade et al., 2023) dealt with the issue utilizing
    an unsupervised learning method. The second identified difficulty in the sector
    is the placement of the camera because when animals move, certain positions are
    hidden from the camera, making it difficult to track them while being in an occluded
    location (Brunet et al., 2023, He et al., 2021, Neethirajan, 2022). The third
    limitation concerns the uneven distribution of the animals in the spaces covered
    by the camera (Zheng et al., 2023a), which leads to underestimation or overestimation
    of the present animals. Lastly, Wang, Zhang et al. (2022) performed real-time
    detection and tracking of abnormal behaviour in porphyry seabream while in a recirculating
    aquaculture system. They obtained a high tracking precision of 76.7 %, which leads
    to improved fish welfare and increased survival rates, which consequently generates
    higher economic benefits of aquaculture. 4.3. Potential issues Throughout this
    review, it has been observed that there are several limitations regarding Object
    Detection and Tracking within Precision Farming. The first is the occlusion of
    the target, for which research suggests using multiple fields of view to be able
    to fully see the objective. Another challenge is the real-time processing of the
    data, which can be computationally challenging when implementing Object Detection
    and Tracking algorithms. Real-time is relevant since many agricultural and farming
    applications require real-time or near-real-time feedback. Hence, it is important
    to consider the balance between accuracy and processing time for the specific
    farming case. Another limitation is the lack of comprehensive and reliable datasets
    for farming applications, which are analysed in this subsection. While there are
    existing datasets that can be very useful (Kaggle, 2023, Roboflow Universe, 2023),
    they have not been published or validated through scientific methods, raising
    concerns about their credibility and accuracy. The absence of standardized and
    reliable datasets hampers the development and fine-tuning of Machine Learning
    models, ultimately hindering the potential for improved agricultural practices.
    This deficiency calls for an urgent need to establish a more rigorous approach
    to dataset creation, including the collection, annotation, and validation of agricultural
    data, ensuring the reliability and generalizability of Machine Learning models
    in this crucial sector. In this way, despite the small number of datasets related
    to agriculture or the environment in public use, some researchers have published
    some datasets that could potentially be useful for Object Detection or Object
    Detection and Tracking, which are summarized in Table 3. Nonetheless, it is important
    to have diverse and representative datasets, for instance, from several geographical
    locations or seasons in order to generalize well and be able to apply the developed
    algorithm to other conditions. It can be observed that there are datasets older
    than 5 years as filtered in the Methodology section. However, to expand knowledge,
    all the public datasets found have been included in this research. Table 3. Public

    datasets strictly related to farming is very limited, and the accessibility of
    these datasets is often restricted and they are not publicly available since it
    is available upon request or the links are no longer active (Giakoumoglou et al.,
    2023a, Li, Su et al., 2022, Nilsback and Zisserman, 2006, Pezzementi et al., 2018,
    Tu et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2021, Zheng et al., 2019) (accessed on April 10th,
    2023). 5. Discussion In recent years, mostly from 2015 onwards (Fig. 1), there
    has been a growing interest in the application of Computer Vision and Deep Learning
    techniques regarding Object Detection and Tracking for farming purposes. The main
    reason to explain the hike in research papers devoted to this field can be the
    advances and availability of technology that is able to carry out precise and
    accurate detection and tracking of agricultural and farming objects. Nonetheless,
    it is important to remark that, since the world population is increasing (United
    Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022),
    there is a rising interest in increasing crop yield, reducing waste, and optimising
    resource allocation (Adli et al., 2023, Matese and Di Gennaro, 2015) to be able
    to feed everyone. Consequently, it is important to deeply analyse the advantages,
    challenges and future work that research in the field of Object Detection and
    Tracking will have to face in the coming years to be able to reach the second
    Sustainable Development Goal set for 2030: Zero Hunger (United Nations, 2015)
    along with reducing the environmental impact of the farming practices to produce
    food in a more green and sustainable way. However, Deep Learning and CNNs are
    not the unique solution for Object Detection and Tracking. For instance, Vision
    Transformers (ViTs) have already been implemented for plant disease detection
    (Gole et al., 2023, Parez et al., 2023). 5.1. Advantages of Object Detection and
    Tracking The increasing interest in Object Detection and Tracking within the field
    of Precision Agriculture and Precision Farming, along with the high detection
    and tracking metrics obtained, indicate that these technologies are suitable for
    several applications, such as fruit and animal counting and monitoring (Kim et
    al., 2022, Rong et al., 2023), diseases (Zheng et al., 2023b), weeds (Mishra et
    al., 2022), and pest detection (Ishengoma et al., 2021), and phenotyping purposes
    (Li, Guo et al., 2020, Mochida et al., 2019). Further, Object Detection and Tracking
    allow researchers to take advantage of useful new technologies, such as UAVs and
    new sensors, and expand their potential within the field of Computer Vision. Moreover,
    Object Detection and Tracking permit accurate monitoring and inspection of the
    identified items, which can assist logistics and the supply chain. For instance,
    to keep track of each individual fruit/animal when carrying out monitoring and/or
    inspecting. The field of Precision Agriculture has benefited a lot from these
    advances since, for instance, disease inspections in the field have always been
    performed through visual surveys, which are tedious tasks, time-consuming (Rahaman
    et al., 2015), and subjective to the operator on charge. Hence, all these improvements
    permit carrying out field inspections in a more objective way and most importantly,
    saving a lot of time for the farm manager, which allows them to apply the required
    chemical only to the plants that need it and within the most optimal time-window
    for chemical effectiveness (Ariza-Sentís et al., 2023a), which reduces the environmental
    impact of agriculture. Moreover, it benefits from the potential of edge computing
    since the developed models can be applied to edge devices, like as tractors or
    UAVs, which can reduce the need for data transmission and provide faster feedback.
    Furthermore, there is a need to establish automated pipelines and workflows in
    order to avoid human errors and reduce the waiting time between processes, and
    Object Detection and Tracking have the potential to provide insights into that
    topic. Another advantage of Object Detection and Tracking in Precision Farming
    is domain adaptation, that is, the fact that the knowledge gained in a very specific
    field and the models and algorithms trained for that specific use case can be
    straightforwardly or with few minor modifications applied to other similar scenarios,
    through transfer learning (Talukdar et al., 2018, Torrey and Shavlik, 2010). For
    instance, several fruits have a similar shape and circularity, such as peaches,
    citrus, apples, and mangoes. Therefore, a model can be developed to detect a particular
    fruit or several fruits (Chen et al., 2017, He et al., 2022) or directly be developed
    for a more general purpose: fruit detection and counting (Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard,
    2017). However, domain adaptation can also be generalized to cross-domain collaboration
    and innovation, meaning that advancements done in other fields of study that have
    traditionally employed Object Detection and Tracking techniques, for instance,
    intelligent transportation and security monitoring, can be applied to the farming
    domain to promote further development. Lastly, there have already been advancements
    in 3D Multiple Object Tracking technology (Pang et al., 2023, Weng et al., 2020),
    which showcase the promising potential for precise monitoring and analysis of
    various elements. For instance, it allows for accurate tracking of crops (Benet
    and Lenain, 2017) and livestock growth and calculation of volume variables such
    as the canopy volume and the animal volume, which can give insights into their
    development at several growing stages. Further, it leads to the usage of new sensors,
    such as LiDAR. 5.2. Challenges and Future work of Object Detection and Tracking
    One of the biggest challenges of Object Detection and Tracking is the presence
    of shadows in their datasets, which obscure the objects of interest and affect
    their appearance and hence their detection by the algorithm (Zhao et al., 2020).
    This difficulty has mostly been identified when trying to distinguish between
    weeds and crops (Dyrmann et al., 2017, Dyrmann et al., 2016). This problem is
    particularly important when the datasets contain aerial images and videos, for
    instance, acquired by UAVs since they are often affected by cloud cover, haze,
    and adverse atmospheric distortions (Porikli, 2006). In order to solve that problem,
    pre-processing techniques such as contrast enhancement (Pal et al., 2021) and
    denoising (B et al., 2019) are often used to improve the quality of the imagery
    and make them more suitable for detection and tracking. Another difficulty is
    that agricultural and farming environments need to detect and track a great variety
    of objects (Kaur et al., 2022), such as the crop or livestock animal itself, surrounding
    animals, multiple weeds, diseases, and pests within the same image/video. Further,
    these objects are homogeneous and can be present in different shapes (Nilsback
    and Zisserman, 2006), sizes (Bonneau et al., 2020), colours (Xu and Mishra, 2022),
    and textures (Chodey and Noorullah Shariff, 2023), which hinders the task of developing
    a unique and robust algorithm which is able to accurately detect and track all
    those objects for agricultural purposes, compared to car and people detection.
    Moreover, those objects might suffer from being partially occluded and challenging
    illumination conditions (Ariza-Sentís et al., 2023a), such as the colour similarity
    between the fruit and the surrounding canopy (Bargoti and Underwood, 2017, Chen
    et al., 2017), which can burden a lot the task of fruit counting, with fruit under-
    or overestimation. The necessity of large datasets for training algorithms and
    avoiding overfitting in Object Detection and Tracking presents a significant disadvantage
    in the field of Computer Vision (Pal et al., 2021). Acquiring, annotating, and
    storing such extensive datasets can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.
    Before applying Computer Vision algorithms for Object Detection and Tracking in
    agriculture, it is crucial to ensure that the image data is appropriate for analysis
    (Katal et al., 2013) and that the data along with the annotations have sufficient
    quality and accuracy for the final application since it can already be a limiting
    variable to reach high detection and tracking metrics. This is especially important
    in agriculture due to the complex and dynamic nature of the farming environment.
    Unlike other fields where Object Detection and Tracking are applied, agriculture
    and farming involve living organisms, varied landscapes, and unpredictable weather
    conditions. Furthermore, the detection and tracking of farming targets require
    a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the biophysical characteristics
    of the crops, animals, pests, and other organisms present in the ecosystem. For
    example, the use of visible light (RGB) cameras might not be adequate for the
    detection of certain diseases that affect crops, such as powdery mildew. Instead,
    multispectral and hyperspectral imaging techniques may be required to capture
    the subtle differences in reflectance that are indicative of the presence of the
    disease (Abdulridha et al., 2020, Kuska et al., 2018). Another example could be
    to detect livestock diseases, for which it might be more suitable to use thermal
    cameras (Tzanidakis et al., 2021, Zheng et al., 2022), similarly, thermal data
    has also been utilized as a tool for assessing water stress in plants (Buunk et
    al., 2023, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2019, Katimbo et al., 2022). Hence, it is important
    to remark that multimodal data, collected from different platforms and sensors
    can provide more comprehensive information to better support Precision Farming
    applications. It has been mentioned in this review and by other authors that there
    is a lack of public datasets regarding Object Detection and Tracking (Akbari et
    al., 2021), and as observed in Table 3, most of them only deal with Object Detection,
    leaving Object Tracking with very few open-source datasets. Furthermore, data
    collection is time-consuming, expensive, and might be even prohibited by law in
    very specific environments (Kiefer et al., 2021), such as flying UAVs close to
    an airport or being inside a natural park. However, synthetic data is faster,
    more flexible, cheaper, and has cutting-edge privacy compared to real data. Several
    authors have already benefited from synthetic data in order to train Machine Learning
    and Object Detection algorithms (Akyon et al., 2021, Giakoumoglou et al., 2023b),
    for which the scalability was tested by performing a similarity assessment between
    the real and synthetic data (Klein et al., 2023). GANs have already been implemented
    within the farming domain (Lu et al., 2022). However, those models are prone to
    instability problems (Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017, Goodfellow et al., 2020) and
    it is still challenging to train the models to generate meaningful images that
    can benefit the purpose for which they were created (Zhu et al., 2020) since the
    number of public training images available is low (Brock et al., 2019). Another
    alternative is image augmentation techniques (Wu, 2011), such as flipping, rotation,
    and scaling, which can be used to increase the amount of data available for training
    and testing. This helps to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of
    the model (Su, Kong et al., 2021a). Moreover, there is a problem of data imbalance
    with certain classes in agricultural datasets, like a specific disease or pest,
    which can be underrepresented and lead to lower performance of the detection and
    tracking models. Additionally, it is important to consider the quality of the
    image data, including factors such as resolution and noise, as this can impact
    the performance of the algorithm. Overall, careful pre-processing of the image
    data is essential for achieving accurate and reliable Object Detection and Tracking
    in agriculture (Cap et al., 2022, Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). In addition
    to these challenges, it is important to remark on the need for appropriate and
    efficient hardware (Zhang, Lu et al., 2020) and software infrastructure for Object
    Detection and Tracking, which might require substantial computational power and
    storage data, that can be a limiting factor for farmers in resource-limited settings.
    It is relevant to remark that contrary to other domains, agricultural hardware
    is exposed to real-world settings, such as mud, dust, rain, and chemicals, among
    others, which should be considered when selecting the appropriate hardware to
    be present in the field. For that, it is relevant to select the opportune sensors
    (Pádua et al., 2017), such as RGB, multispectral, thermal cameras or LiDAR, and
    the convenient platform from which the dataset will be acquired, which can be
    UAVs, ground robots, tripod, among others. Furthermore, it is important to determine
    the appropriate algorithm (Naeem et al., 2013), such as Faster R-CNN, any version
    of YOLO, or Deep SORT, for Object Detection and Tracking, and ensure that they
    are optimized for the specific task at hand. Furthermore, it is also key to select
    the appropriate technology for which the algorithm will be integrated, for instance,
    with IoT devices (Xu, Gu et al., 2022b). It is important to remark that, even
    if Object Detection and Tracking have shown a lot of potential and good detection
    and tracking accuracies, they face some difficulties and limitations, for instance,
    their applicability and method-acquisition by the farmers, who are the main stakeholders
    and for which research should target their applications (Snapp et al., 2003).
    Hence, research must consider which are the current challenges that should be
    solved to make them more affordable and attractive for the end user. A relevant
    point here is that the centre of attention is meant to be the Computer Vision
    task, but not the acquisition of the data and its optimization (Ariza-Sentís et
    al., 2023a, Mazumder et al., 2023), which might influence the quality of the collected
    data and might help to increase the metrics obtained. For instance, despite the
    importance of pre-processing image data, many studies in the field of Computer
    Vision and Object Detection in agriculture often overlook the appropriate methods
    for acquiring the images. For example, capturing images at a good angle to avoid
    ID switching while tracking, optimal altitude and camera angle, flying or walking
    path, or implementing other pre-processing methodologies such as image-stitching
    prior to Object Detection (Zhou, Rui et al., 2019b), can be crucial for obtaining
    high-quality images that contain relevant information about the objects of interest.
    For that, it is important to carefully design and plan the path that needs to
    be followed by the platform to collect the datasets in the most optimal way. In
    that sense, path planning can play a crucial role since it consists of designing
    the most appropriate route from the initial point to the end point, considering
    and avoiding the obstacles found on the way, for instance, trees (Gasparetto et
    al., 2015), transmission towers, and terrain slope. Moreover, the optimization
    of the route is crucial for the platforms, mostly UAVs, since they face low autonomy,
    for which the data acquisition should be carried out within the minimum amount
    of time (Aggarwal and Kumar, 2020, Oksanen and Visala, 2009). Failure to consider
    these factors can lead to low-quality images that are difficult to analyse, which
    can impact the performance of the algorithm. Moreover, it is important to mention
    the importance of interpretability in Deep Learning models to not only obtain
    a result, for instance, a disease prediction but also to understand the reason
    behind the model detecting that particular issue, especially when it comes to
    Decision Support Systems (DSS) for disease detection. Therefore, it is important
    to emphasise the need for appropriate image acquisition methods and to encourage
    researchers to consider these factors when designing experiments or collecting
    data. By doing so, we can ensure that the image data used for Object Detection
    and Tracking in agriculture is of high quality and suitable for analysis, leading
    to more accurate and reliable results. Lastly, it is important to remark that,
    even if the integration of Object Detection and Tracking has shown substantial
    benefits for Precision Farming, such as optimization of resource allocation and
    enhancement of animal welfare, the implementation of such systems may face barriers
    often overlooked. Factors like limited connectivity in rural areas, insufficient
    digital literacy among farmers, and uncertainties regarding return on investment
    can present major challenges for the field. The mere presence of technological
    advantages does not guarantee its widespread adoption. Therefore, it is relevant
    to address these barriers and ensure accessibility, education, and clear demonstration
    of long-term benefits to foster the adoption of these technologies by farmers.
    6. Conclusions This paper undertook a comprehensive review of Object Detection
    and Tracking within the frame of Precision Farming, for which over 300 research
    articles were examined and the particular field of study, the algorithms used,
    the metrics obtained, the difficulties and limitations faced, and the availability
    of public datasets, were evaluated. The purpose of this review was to solve the
    two main research questions while providing an analysis of how Computer Vision
    and Deep Learning techniques can be optimized to maximize their impact within
    Precision Farming and presenting a detailed overview of the current advancements
    in Object Detection and Tracking techniques and applications, showing the advantages
    and limitations to encourage more researchers to experiment with Object Detection
    and Tracking for farming functionalities and to motivate them to make their datasets
    open-source. This open-source approach can save the scientific community from
    the time-intensive task of manual annotation with each new Deep Learning project.
    Our findings suggest that while Object Detection and Tracking can be applied to
    any crop, having ample revenue facilitates its implementation due to the investment
    required in modern technology. Nevertheless, Object Detection and Tracking is
    a promising area of research that holds potential for revolutionizing crop and
    livestock management while optimizing resource allocation, paving the way for
    robotization of the farming sector. The future of Object Detection and Tracking
    lies in overcoming the difficulties analysed in this review, for instance, target
    occlusion because of camera altitude, angle, leaf density, or crowded scenarios.
    A proposed solution to that problem is to plan optimal data acquisition before
    actually acquiring the data and to implement multiple-angle viewing systems to
    observe the target from multiple points of view to be able to properly detect
    and mostly track the object in its full size. Furthermore, it would be beneficial
    to emphasise the significance of model interpretability within agricultural contexts.
    Discerning the rationale behind a model''s decision is imperative for establishing
    trust among farmers and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards. Additionally,
    the integration of diverse data sources, including but not limited to thermal,
    lidar, multispectral, and hyperspectral sensors, in conjunction with Object Detection
    and Tracking techniques has the potential to revolutionize the food production
    sector. Such integration has the potential to facilitate a holistic understanding
    of the agricultural landscape. Directions for Future Research: (1) Shifting the
    emphasis from Object Detection and Tracking algorithms and metrics towards optimal
    data acquisition. (2) Incorporating prior knowledge of the biophysical environment
    to design optimal path planning. (3) Adopting multiple points of view and angles
    to circumvent object occlusion. (4) Releasing additional open-source labelled
    datasets. (5) Leveraging synthetic data generation techniques to supplement limited
    real-world datasets. (6) Designing efficient and robust hardware setups suitable
    for agricultural environments, which are often harsher than other scenarios, considering
    factors like durability, adaptability, and real-world exposure. (7) Addressing
    barriers to widespread adoption of these technologies in agriculture, including
    connectivity issues, lack of digital literacy, and uncertainties regarding return
    on investment. (8) Emphasising interpretability of Object Detection and Tracking
    models to boost agricultural DSS. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mar

    Systems


    Object Detection and Tracking have gained importance in recent years because of
    the great advances in GPU computing power (Davies, 2004) and the boost in image
    analysis techniques. Hence, the number of research studies performed on those
    domains has increased significantly, drawing significant attention to DL projects
    (Vargas et al., 2017). In particular, Deep Learning (DL) (LeCun et al., 2015,
    LeCun and Bengio, 1995) has shown important advances in agriculture in performing
    various important tasks such as plant phenotyping, yield estimation, crop classification,
    or disease detection (Ariza-Sentís et al., 2023b, Bouguettaya et al., 2022, Kamilaris
    and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Zhou et al., 2023). In addition, when Deep Learning-based
    Object Detection is integrated with tracking, it gives rise to a distinct field
    known as “Object Detection and Tracking”, an area that has seen rapid growth in
    recent years, driven by advancements in GPU computing power (Davies, 2004) and
    the boost in image analysis techniques. Hence, the number of research studies
    performed on those domains has increased significantly, drawing significant attention
    to DL projects (Vargas et al., 2017).


    The agricultural and livestock domain has also benefited from this trend. Object
    Detection and Tracking techniques have shown great potential to enable behaviour
    analysis and object interactions, which is crucial for applications like autonomous
    vehicles and enhancing animal welfare (Khairunissa et al., 2021); allowing plant
    ID recovery even if a plant temporarily leaves the view of the camera, ensuring
    individual plant recognition and avoiding repeated spraying by the robot (Hu et
    al., 2022); or to develop key tasks such as detecting plants and their fruits
    (de Jong et al., 2022, Zhang, Wang et al., 2022), which eases the inspection time
    which is currently carried out by field operators.


    Moreover, Object Detection and Tracking permit the automation of crop harvesting
    to improve field productivity and optimize operational costs (Junos et al., 2021),
    paving the way for robotization of the agricultural sector. Furthermore, Object
    Detection and Tracking allow for precise monitoring and management of livestock
    animals’ movement (Huang et al., 2023, Myat Noe et al., 2023). It facilitates
    real-time analysis of behaviours and health metrics, which optimizes care and
    resource allocation for each individual animal. The challenges and applications
    of Deep Learning in agriculture have been comprehensively addressed in prior surveys
    (Alibabaei et al., 2022, Bouguettaya et al., 2022, Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú,
    2018, Wang, Cao et al., 2022). However, there is a notable absence of literature
    reviews specifically focusing on the integration of Object Detection and Tracking
    in enhancing Precision Farming techniques. Consequently, the motivation for writing
    this review article was to address the need for a comprehensive analysis of the
    utilization of Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques applied to Object
    Detection and Object Tracking within the field of Precision Farming, considering
    the increasing interest in this sector and the potential transformative effects
    on food security and fostering sustainable agricultural practices.'

    algorithms 1. Introduction A WSN is an intelligent system when compared to others
    because that can independently achieve data fusion, collection, and communication.
    It integrates the real physical and logical information world to comprehend the
    \"ubiquitous computing\" method [1]. A WSN is used in untended target fields,
    namely health care, battlefields, agriculture, habitats, and environmental monitoring
    and they encompass tiny sensor nodes (SNs) that have limited computational ability
    and battery power [2]. These nodes sense the environment to gather information
    from the environment and transfer it to the closest gateway node (GWN) through
    a wireless channel for transmitting to exterior users. Usually, the WSN node works
    in an unprotected environment and is not monitored periodically. This makes it
    especially vulnerable to different attacks and thus critical information can easily
    be revealed to unauthorized parties causing privacy risks and serious security
    [3]. As progressively sensitive data is produced and transferred, cryptographic
    security must be deployed to avoid recognized attacks by hiding data within a
    complex string of seemingly random symbols [4]. However, it remains challenging
    to accept a traditional encryption system in this tiny wireless sensor due to
    the vast quantities of data being generated and switched between the SNs. Standard
    cipher is deployed for resource-rich devices on high bandwidth networks and they
    are almost impossible for limited networks such as WSNs [5]. As heavy encryption,
    implementation might result in failure and frequent disconnection of this node
    due to energy consumption, the energy constraint is the most overwhelming restraint
    in WSN. Excessive cryptographic security could be harmful to the system [6]. Due
    to limited time, energy resources computation power, and communication constraints,
    it frequently causes security requirements to combat real-time dynamic performance.
    It is necessary to provide security during or before the transmission. Data availability,
    data confidence, and data integrity are four different safety aspects to be concentrated
    during data communication [7]. Besides, the security of transmission data networks
    must guarantee the authenticity and confidentiality of all network nodes. Until
    now, several schemes and protocols have been introduced intending to be effective
    in the secure transmission of data [8]. Encryption standards are crucial that
    use keys of lesser length, and only less memory is required. Moreover, ECC grows
    the size of encoded information as well as requires further modification. The
    contemporary study has recommended a lightweight encryption system to overcome
    the problem of resource constraint [9]. The security limits employed through classical
    cryptographic methodology are lessened in lightweight encryption systems to enhance
    the competence of encryption. Light-weight cypher is gentler on resources since
    they require shorter execution times, less memory space, less energy consumption,
    and less computational complexity [10]. Key management strategy is another noteworthy
    feature of WSN security which includes updating, generation, distribution, and
    storage. This article designs an Efficient Key Distribution for Secure and Energy-Optimized
    Communication using Bioinspired Algorithms (EKD-SOCBA) for WSN. The purpose of
    the EKD-SOCBA technique is to accomplish security and energy efficiency in WSNs.
    Initially, the EKD-SOCBA technique applies a golden jackal optimization (GJO)
    based clustering approach to cluster the nodes and select cluster heads (CHs).
    Moreover, DS-TEA is applied to secure data transmission in the network. Finally,
    a lightweight key management phase is employed to protect the encryption key and
    decrease energy utilization and overhead costs. To exhibit the enhanced performance
    of the EKD-SOCBA methodology, a comprehensive pair of imitations was involved.
    2. Literature review Mezrag et al. [11] developed a novel identity-based authentication
    and key agreement system for CWSNs termed IBAKAS that integrates identity-based
    cryptography (IBC) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to offer common verification
    and create secret session keys over uncertain networks. IBAKAS attains the required
    safety assets of the main contract and averts precise cyber-attacks on CWSN. Misbha
    [12] developed a new light-biased key distribution device for energy-efficient
    and safe communication in WSN. At 1st stage, a hybrid optimization plan is developed
    which is known as the coot upgraded butterfly algorithm with logistic solution
    space (CUBA-LSS) technique to optimum grouping through picking up ideal CH. Data
    transmission is a successive procedure where developed technique safeguards protected
    transmission via enhanced ECC. Roja and Misbha [13] present an effective lightweight
    secure key distribution protocol (LSKDP) for improving procedure security in assorted
    medicinal WSNs. In addition to that, performance and safety diagnoses are directed
    at demonstrating the recommended methodology''s efficiency. The safety analysis
    is executed to determine the projected method''s exposure to system threats. Abi-Char
    and Riman [14] introduce a secure and lightweight genuine key management system
    utilizing Bilinear Pairing (BP) and Elliptic Curve (EC). The system establishes
    unique pairwise keys between devices after authentication, demonstrating resilience
    against various threats and enhanced flexibility against node capture attacks.
    In [15], a lightweight privacy and security system is proposed for WSN routing.
    Employing modified Diffie-Hellman key exchange, symmetric encryption, scalar blinding,
    and elliptic curve cryptography, the system ensures data integrity and effective
    validation while preserving privacy during routing. Xiong and Su [16] project
    a new random key pre-distribution system that depends upon a hash chain. Altering
    assured structure parameters like hash chain length, the number of shared support
    nodes and the sum of hash chains and device nodes requires preloading some key
    that makes it probable to create pairwise basic with great possibility between
    its nearby nodes. Guermazi et al. [17] propose the Key Distribution and Safe Routing
    (KDSR) protocol for securing communication in large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs). The protocol introduces a secure network architecture and employs lightweight
    local procedures for key segmentation in Local Broadcast, Pairwise, and Global
    Broadcast scenarios. Lee and Chen [18] present an efficient Group Key Agreement
    (GKA) structure for WSN, utilizing prolonged hectic maps and eliminating the need
    for a reliable online verification server. Additionally, they propose a forward-privacy-enhanced
    pattern through a long hectic map-based Diffie-Hellman key exchange within the
    developed GKA structure. In [19], a hybrid data routing algorithm is proposed
    using metaheuristic techniques, integrating swarm optimization and an energy-efficient
    heuristic method to enhance route finding for heterogeneous WSNs in the IoTs.
    Mehta and Saxena [20] introduce fuzzy multi-criteria clustering and bio-inspired
    energy-efficient routing (FMCB-ER) model by employing a grid-based clustering
    technique, adaptive fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making for cluster head selection,
    and emperor penguin optimization for optimal data transmission routes. 3. The
    proposed model In this article, we design an EKD-SOCBA algorithm for WSN. The
    purpose of the EKD-SOCBA technique is to accomplish security and energy efficiency
    in WSNs. Fig. 1 demonstrates the workflow of the proposed EKD-SOCBA method. Download

    Workflow of EKD-SOCBA approach. 3.1. System model The assumption made is given
    below [21]. 1. The SN is deployed randomly in a 2D geographical space. 2. The
    BS is positioned at the center of the network and there is multi-hop transmission
    from CH to BS 3. The SN is split into equivalent groups and is distributed randomly
    within the group. 4. The SN is homogeneous within the group and mobility is limited
    to 0.2 5. BS and nodes participating in multi-path transmission may contain continuous
    power sources. 5. BS implements the model for the selection of CH and it gathers
    the information collected from the CH Two different channel models based on the
    radio energy method of SN are given as follows: multi-path propagation fading
    technique for multi-hop path transmission and free space path loss method for
    single-hop transmission. Thus, the power usage for transferring an -bit packet
    over distance is evaluated using Eq. (1): (1) where energy dissipation coefficient
    of multi-path attenuation module energy dissipation coefficient of free-space
    attenuation module packet length energy required for transmitting or receiving
    1-bit data. distance between sender and receiving nodes threshold distance At
    Rx, the amount of power used to receive -bit data packet is evaluated by (2) The
    number of packets expected from SNs are followers of specific clusters, data collection
    implemented by CH, and the number of collected packets transferred from CH to
    BS are parameters that contributed to the power utilization at CH. Consequently,
    the power utilization at CH is shown below as (3) number of SNs in a specific
    cluster data fusion energy/bit. For each SN excluding CHs, the power utilization
    is . The overall residual energy (RE)at iteration can be evaluated as follows:
    (4) overall RE at th iteration number of CHs in the iteration overall amount of
    alive nodes in the iteration energy expended by CH energy expended by SN 3.2.
    Clustering using GJO algorithm Initially, the EKD-SOCBA technique applies a GJO-based
    clustering approach to cluster the nodes and select CHs. The golden jackal is
    nothing but a canid type originating in Eurasia. It shows greatly advanced social
    conduct [22]. Cooperative hunting is one of the most dangerous among their countless
    skills, with an achievement rate about 3 times greater than separate hunting.
    Nitish Chopra has proposed a GJO and swarm intelligence algorithm due to his interest
    in the hunting behavior of golden jackals. The technique is mainly developed depending
    upon key phases of the golden jackal hunting procedure such as pointing for imminent
    prey, nearby and annoying prey till it stops movement and aggressive and catching
    prey. After these phases of hunting, the GJO technique is demonstrated. In the
    initialization stage, the following populaces are casually created. (5) whereas
    N is the number of persons in the populace, and is the quantity of sizes owned
    by persons. After computing the capability of each individual in the present populace,
    the optimal individual is considered a male golden jackal, whereas the sub-optimal
    distinct is called a female golden jackal, and the rest as prey. Affording to
    a value of E and eluding energy, dual methods accessible to upgrade the populace.
    (6) whereas designates the decreasing energy of prey; signifies the early stage
    of its energy; is a random number from to 1; represents the present iteration
    and is the maximum number of iterations. Fig. 2 depicts the steps involved in
    GJO. Download : Download high-res image (331KB) Download : Download full-size

    follows: (7) (8) (9) whereas denotes a male golden jackal; represents a female
    golden jackal; , and Prey (t) individually state to data of male, female as well

    plan: (10) (11) whereas and are random values between to 1, is a default constant
    set to 1.5. When is a method to renovate the population as follows: (12) (13)
    (14) The GJO technique originates a fitness function (FF) for the optimal cluster
    creation process. The FF employed in the developed method is given in the below
    equation. (15) In Eq. (15), and functions describe the sum of distances among
    CMs to CH of each cluster in the network and the difference of clusters in route
    length. Based on Eq. (16), function is calculated. (16) Where, displays the distance
    of Euclidean calculated for a total amount of clusters. The distance between every
    vehicular to CHs connected to all clusters from the total amount of clusters.
    Similarly, function signifies the absolute degree that is shown below. (17) In
    Eq. (17), implies an overall amount of CM nodes from route length with degree
    emphasizing the constant value of cluster density. Notice that smaller density
    can be familiar by lowermost value. 3.3. Encryption using DS-TEA model At this
    moment, lightweight DS-TEA is applied for secure data transmission in the network.
    TEA is a Feistel structure encryption scheme that functions on dual 32-bit unsigned
    integers that are driven from a 64-bit data block and exploits a 128-bit key [23].
    Furthermore, this model recommends 64 rounds for the standard execution of pairs
    called cycles. Based on the symmetry of cycles, multiples of the magic constant
    are employed to avoid the attack. However, TEA has certain shortcomings. It mainly
    suffers from corresponding keys that imply all keys are equivalent to three others.
    Especially, TEA is insupportable as a Cryptographic hash function. The encryption
    efficiency is increased when the memory consumption is decreased. DS-TEA is a
    block cypher that recollects Feistel structure. DS-TEA makes use of a 64-bit block
    and 128-bit key with 32 cycles or 64 rounds similar to the TEA. The two bits are
    utilized for selecting the subkeys. Accordingly, the subkey is further added.
    Also, we add a shift of 13 into the key schedule to aid subkeys loom out of order.
    The further adaptation to make DS-TEA is rearranging the XOR functions, additions,
    and shifts. Now, the subkeys generate subkey and . In the DS-TEA, dual rounds
    are employed to generate one encryption cycle. An initial round is dependent on
    . The value of amount & 4 is sum logic AND with 4, 0 × 04 , or 0012 , defines
    subkey selection in this round. The next round depends on . The value of sum >>
    14 & 4, is shifted by 12, monitored by logic, AND with 4,0 × 04 , or 0013 , defines
    subkey selection in this round. This signifies a bit of change possibility. Repeat
    the process with different ’ ’ generated by inverting 64 bits of unencrypted block
    , which produces an overall of 64 probabilities and calculates the average of
    64 bit-change possibilities. Algorithm 1 demonstrates the process of DS-TEA. Algorithm
    1 Dynamic Step-wise TEA 3.4. Key management Finally, a lightweight key management
    phase is employed to protect the encryption key. Since the WSN transfers information
    through an unprotected open channel, each connectivity of the network should be
    secured [24]. The key managing technique must retain minimum overhead cost for
    the key distribution, creation, and agreement in the limited network. In the system,
    a lightweight key managing technique is performed to decrease the transmission
    latency and power usage. Furthermore, it is capable of creating a verified and
    secure connection between the CHs and SNs connected to them and, lastly linking
    to the access point. The key management structure is composed of two different
    stages. The first step is generating a symmetrical encryption key. The second
    stage is the session key would be created and sent to all the nodes to protect
    the entire node’s symmetric key. The key security cannot be safeguarded since
    they are stored as well as transported in plain sight in wireless devices. To
    satisfy the safe key criterion, a private key βk is generated in this technique
    through a logistic map. Then, the Enhanced ECC uses the private key βk to protect
    the messages for the node. After encrypting its Plain Text (PT), the key and other
    encryption variables are encrypted during the second stage before being transmitted
    to CH. Each node has a physical ID which is protected down. Given the ID of the
    selected CH, each node connected is updated with all the new CHS. The CH evaluates
    its session key (sk) before the beginning of the information communication session
    and allocates it to the related node. The period of the transmission session is
    chosen to avoid overhead generated by using a random strategy for creating sk.
    A new sk is generated whenever CH is transmitted over the nodes. It utilizes it
    to generate a master key (mk) if the node interconnects with CH and gets sk. SN
    will evaluate a new value that uses a hash function to remove the probability
    that attackers might find out ID of CH. The received CH-ID values are hashed with
    the MD5 hash technique for obtaining Hash ID (HID). Then, the node will evaluate
    mk by applying the XOR function to integrate the sk and HID of CH are interconnected
    to all nodes. Subsequently, mk is used for encoding the βk, αk, and Sk parameters.
    When the encryption variable (Cparm) is added, then the payload is transmitted
    to the CH. Initially, the AP computes HID through CH''s registered ID on the AP
    side. Then, the sk and HID are XOR-ed to define mk. The ciphered encryption variable
    is decoded by the acquired mk and decodes the Cipher Text (CT) of the node. The
    repeat process enables each node connected to the CH to deploy the same mk for
    decoding their parameters and attaining the PTs. 4. Performance validation This
    section offers a brief result analysis of the EKD-SOCBA technique under several
    measures. Table 1 presents a detailed distance analysis of the EKD-SOCBA technique
    under 100 and 200 nodes [12]. The results infer that the EKD-SOCBA technique reaches
    decreased distance values under all rounds. On 500 rounds, the EKD-SOCBA technique
    gains a reduced distance of 41 whereas the AOA, ARCHOA, CA, BOA, and CUBA-LSS
    models obtain increased distances of 61, 62, 68, 59, and 50 respectively. Moreover,
    on 2000 rounds, EKD-SOCBA models attain a decreased distance of 40 whereas AOA,
    ARCHOA, CA, BOA, and CUBA-LSS techniques get increased distances of 62, 69, 65,
    59, and 51, individually. Under 200 noes, the EKD-SOCBA method increases the reduced
    distance of 43 whereas AOA, ARCHOA, CA, BOA, and CUBA-LSS approaches gain increased
    distances of 62, 62, 72, 53, and 53 respectively. Furthermore, on 2000 rounds,
    the EKD-SOCBA model acquires a reduced distance of 48 whereas AOA, ARCHOA, CA,
    BOA, and CUBA-LSS techniques achieve increased distance of 57, 61, 58, 55, and
    53, separately. Table 1. Distance analysis of EKD-SOCBA approach with recent systems

    Table 2 portrays a detailed comparative energy result of the EKD-SOCBA technique
    under 100 and 200 nodes. The results confirmed that the EKD-SOCBA technique accomplished
    increased energy values. With 1000 rounds, the EKD-SOCBA technique provides an

    Conclusion This article designs an Efficient Key Distribution for Secure and Energy-Optimized
    Communication using Bioinspired Algorithms (EKD-SOCBA) for WSN. The purpose of
    the EKD-SOCBA technique is to accomplish security and energy efficiency in WSNs.
    Initially, the EKD-SOCBA technique has accomplished energy efficiency using GJO
    based clustering approach to cluster the nodes and select CHs. Besides, the DS-TEA
    is applied to secure data transmission in the network. Finally, a lightweight
    key management phase is employed to protect the encryption key and decrease energy
    utilization and overhead costs. To exhibit the enhanced act of the EKD-SOCBA method,
    an inclusive set of simulations was involved. An extensive outcome stated enhanced
    performance of the EKD-SOCBA technique over other models on WSN. The EKD-SOCBA
    model boosts WSN security and energy efficiency with clustering, lightweight encryption,
    and key management; yet, it faces challenges in adapting to dynamic network conditions.
    Future work can focus on the design of data aggregation approaches to improve
    energy efficiency in the WSN. Institutional review board statement Not Applicable.

  description: The need to combat climate change and its devastating impacts while
    simultaneously addressing the urgent need to achieve zero hunger and no poverty
    as well as promoting good health and well-being makes transforming Africa’s smallholder
    agriculture towards greater sustainability an urgent necessity. This study examines
    the influence of the agricultural practices with climate-smart agriculture potentials
    (AP-CSAPs) on labour (and other production factors’) demand and input substitution.
    The study was based on primary data collected in a cross-section survey, in which
    1500 smallholder rice farmers were drawn by a multistage random sampling across
    farming communities, local government areas, and states in Nigeria. The econometric
    data analysis was within the framework of Zellner’s Seemingly Unrelated Regression
    method in estimating parameters of a set of factor share equations. The study
    found that labour and fertilizer could not be readily substituted in Nigeria;
    hence, an increase in the unit price of labour and fertilizer results in a higher
    share of labour and fertilizer in the budget. In terms of the effects of AP-CSAP
    use on factor cost share, most of the AP-CSAPs are labour-intensive with the exception
    of agroforestry. Similarly, the use of organic manure and residue retention is
    significantly pesticide saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and
    fertilizer using. Given that most AP-CSAPs require higher labour requirements,
    their success is often impeded by labour shortages. Some of the policies to promote
    AP-CSAPs include creating incentives in the form of higher wages and/or compensation
    to bring people back to agriculture. Accessibility and availability of key inputs
    such as improved crop variety and seed of green manure and/or cover crops, and
    leveraging on community-driven development approach to provide labour-saving equipment
    to rice farmers, may boost the adoption of labour-using AP-CSAPs in Nigeria.

  explanation: The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between
    the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAP) and resource allocation
    decisions made by rice farming households in Nigeria. The researchers are specifically
    interested in how CSAP use influences the demand for various inputs and the degree
    to which inputs can be substituted for one another in the production process.
    The study is motivated by the need to identify strategies for increasing agricultural
    productivity and adapting to climate change in a sustainable manner.
  extract_1: In terms of the effects of AP-CSAP use on factor cost share, most of
    the AP-CSAPs are labour-intensive with the exception of agroforestry that is labour
    neutral.
  extract_2: The use of organic manure and residue retention is significantly pesticide
    saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and fertilizer using.

    impeded by labour shortages. Some of the policies to promote AP-CSAPs include
    creating incentives in the form of higher wages and/or compensation to bring people
    back to agriculture. Accessibility and availability of key inputs such as improved
    crop variety and seed of green manure and/or cover crops, and leveraging on community-driven
    development approach to provide labour-saving equipment to rice farmers, may boost
    the adoption of labour-using AP-CSAPs in Nigeria. Similar content being viewed

    access 08 December 2022 1 Introduction Agricultural production systems are expected
    to rise to the challenge of producing sufficient food for a global population
    expected to reach nine billion people by 2050 (United Nation Fund for Population
    Activities (UNFPA), 2023), with Nigeria expected to emerge as the third most populous
    country in the World with population in excess of 400 million people by 2050 (UN
    2017). This requires major transformations to increase the productive capacity
    and stability of smallholder agricultural production. Identifying the most appropriate
    technologies and practices to achieve this objective is critical as climate change
    poses a great threat to agricultural productivity, food security, and income of
    millions of people around the world (Gwambene 2011; Lobell et al. 2011). The impacts
    of climate change are felt by the people through an increasing number of dry seasons,
    rainfall seasons ending earlier than normal, poor distribution in rainfall within
    seasons, and change in temperature (Coulibaly et al. 2015; Aune 2012). The need
    to combat climate change and its devastating impacts (Sustainable Development
    Goal [SDG] 13) while simultaneously addressing the urgent need to achieve zero
    hunger (SDG 2) and promoting good health and well-being among others makes transforming
    Africa’s smallholder agriculture towards greater sustainability an urgent necessity.
    Across the African continent, the livelihood of smallholder farmers depends largely
    on subsistence agriculture with few alternative options. They are usually caught
    in low productivity traps where unsustainable agriculture and livestock-rearing
    practices deplete and degrade natural resources, which compromises ecosystem health
    and results in pervasive low agricultural yields. This vicious circle renders
    smallholder farmers extremely vulnerable to climate change, climate variability,
    and extreme weather events that further lead to a decline in agricultural productivity.
    This together with rapidly growing populations often drives an expansion and intensification
    of agricultural production on already degraded land. Expansion of cultivated areas,
    increasingly deeper tillage, and loss of vegetation cover owing to deforestation
    and overgrazing have led to accelerated loss of soil organic matter, which impairs
    the regulatory function of the ecosystem. In the process, large amounts of greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions such as CO2 and methane that contribute to climate change
    are released. In response to the growing food demand, the expansion of crop area
    as well as intensive use of pesticide and fertilizer have been the practice for
    several decades in Africa and this tends to proffer solutions in the short-term
    as productivity of most staples progressively increases (FAOSTAT 2022). Nevertheless,
    production growth has imposed stresses on soil and water resources, the yield
    has been declining drastically, and direct emissions from the agricultural sector
    account for 11% of global GHG emissions (OECD 2020). In Nigeria, smallholder agriculture
    accounts for over 80% of the food supply (Oyaniran 2020; Cervigni et al. 2013),
    about a quarter (24%) of the national gross domestic product (Statista 2023),
    and about a quarter of the nation’s greenhouse gases. In view of this, the Federal
    Government of Nigeria, with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organisation
    (FAO) and other development partners, has been promoting a shift to climate-smart
    agriculture (CSA) as one of the key strategies in pursuit of SDGs and Nigeria’s
    intended Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to GHG mitigation. By CSA,
    reference is made to an integrated approach to food production targeted at addressing
    the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change with the aim of
    sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and farm incomes, adapting and
    building resilience to climate change, and reducing agricultural GHG emission
    (FAO 2013; 2010; Lipper et al. 2014). CSA generally entails integrated adoption
    of a set of context-specific resilient production technologies or practices—herein
    referred to as agricultural practices with CSA potentials (AP-CSAPs)—that provide
    the possibility to produce more from the same area of land while conserving resources,
    reducing negative impacts on the environment, and enhancing natural capital and
    the flow of ecosystem (FAO 2016). These include zero/minimal tillage; mulching;
    crop rotation; cultivation of high-yielding, disease-resistant, and drought-tolerant
    varieties; agroforestry; legume intercropping; and integrated nutrient, water,
    pest, and weed management, with emphasis on minimal soil disturbance and reduced
    pesticide, energy, and resource use (Shittu et al. 2021; Khatri-Chhetri et al.
    2017; McCarthy 2014; Branca et al. 2011). Evidence from the literature suggests
    that AP-CSAPs can lead to increased productivity and stability of agricultural
    production systems (Branca et al. 2013; Woodfine 2009). These practices are however
    generally labour-intensive; thus, this study seeks to answer the research questions—what
    will be the implications of using AP-CSAPs on labour demand and substitution for
    other inputs in view of rising labour scarcity and the need to reduce chemical
    dependence in Nigeria agriculture. Arising from the foregoing, this study builds
    on previous research done by Dalton et al. (1997), who found that there is a moderate
    substitutability between labour, biochemical inputs, and capital and that per-hectare
    yields rise roughly in proportion to a simultaneous increase in all inputs. Otunaiya
    et al. (2013), however, found that the demand for inorganic fertilizer was price
    inelastic, and that fertilizer was a technical substitute for planting materials
    and other intermediate inputs like insecticides and tractor services and a technical
    complement of labour and land in the production of food crops. This study, therefore,
    seeks to assess the influence of the AP-CSAPs on labour (and other production
    factors’) demand and input substitution, despite the increasing global emphasis
    on CSA as a pivotal strategy for achieving SDGs and NDCs related to GHG mitigation.
    There is a notable gap in the existing literature regarding how some of the conventional
    inputs can be substituted for AP-CSAPs in such a way that will bring about an
    increase in yield while simultaneously building resilience and adaptation to climate
    change with minimal harm to the environment. Addressing this research gap would
    entail conducting a comprehensive study that examines the intricate labour dynamics,
    input substitution patterns, and equity implications associated with the adoption
    of specific AP-CSAPs among smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The results show
    that the adoption of most AP-CSAPs except agroforestry are significantly labour-using,
    implying that AP-CSAPs increase smallholder rice farmers’ demand for an already
    too scarce labour. The findings could have significant policy implications for
    achieving the SDGs and NDC commitments in Nigeria, ultimately contributing to
    more informed and holistic decision-making in the realm of sustainable agricultural
    development. In the next section, we present a brief on CSA in Nigeria, the study
    methodology including the description of the study area, data collection and sampling,
    analytical techniques, and model specification. The fifth presents and discusses
    the results, while the final section presents the main conclusions and the policy
    implications. 2 Brief on climate-smart agriculture The vulnerability of African
    countries to climate change and its impacts have serious implications for livelihoods,
    poverty reduction, and meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Policies
    that will promote a transition to CSA to mitigate climate change while maintaining
    agricultural productivity are therefore crucial to meet the current and future
    challenges posed by climate change in Africa, Nigeria inclusive. CSA encompasses
    a combination of long-existing practices such as innovative farming practices
    and agricultural technologies that aim to address climate change adaptation, mitigation,
    and food security (Newell et al. 2019; Aryal et al. 2018). Some of the commonly
    used climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) across the globe include conservation
    agriculture, organic manuring, composting, crop diversification, usage of wetland,
    drought-tolerant crops, disease-tolerant varieties, residue retention, crop rotation,
    zero/minimum tillage, green manuring, integrated crop management, agricultural
    water management, and agroforestry (Zhou et al. 2023; Kehinde et al. 2022; Shittu
    et al. 2018; Ojoko et al. 2017). Despite the potential benefits of CSA, the adoption
    rates for CSAPs remain generally low in many African countries, for example, the
    adoption of complete conservation agriculture systems (zero/minimum tillage, permanent
    soil cover, and crop rotation) stood at 2.5% in Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Orchardson
    2019). Similarly, empirical evidence from the literature asserts that adoption
    of CSAPs is low in Nigeria, usually between 15.5 and 54.0% (Shittu et al. 2018;
    Kehinde et al. 2022) and much lower for some CSAPs like water harvesting (15%)
    and alternate wet and dry irrigation (10%) Onyeneke et al. 2018). The low adoption
    is linked to weak extension service delivery across various states in Nigeria,
    inadequate capital, high labour cost, lack of technical know-how, low potential
    for irrigation, and most importantly present markets that cannot accurately account
    for the value of the environmental benefits that CSA delivers (Onyeneke et al.
    2021; Ahiale et al. 2020; Shittu et al. 2018). Among the factors that hinder CSA
    upscaling in Africa include heterogeneous farming systems, limited finance, high
    cost of agricultural inputs, and technology (Ogunyiola et al. 2022). In addition,
    Medugu et al. (2012) observed that the intricate challenge of rural out-migration
    facing Nigeria’s rural area—where labourers seek more lucrative opportunities
    in the informal sector—has significant implications for CSA adoption, particularly
    due to its labour-intensive nature. Recent findings from the study carried out
    by FAO and ICRISAT in 2019 have indicated that several CSA projects exist in the
    northern part of Nigeria to strengthen farmers’ resilience to climate change.
    Worthy of mention is the smart agricultural intervention and empowerment programs
    in Adamawa, Borno, and the Yobe States. Adesina and Loboguerrero (2021) noted
    that over 70% of the inhabitants of Borno State are into crop production, animal
    husbandry, and fishing due to Lake Chad’s presence. However, the shrinking of
    lakes, severe drought, degraded soil, inadequate infrastructure to support producers,
    and floods coupled with the State’s recent insecurity challenges have reduced
    agricultural productivity (FAO and ICRISAT 2019). Therefore, people now depend
    heavily on humanitarian assistance from international bodies such as the World
    Food Program. Some of the ongoing efforts that helped to facilitate CSA adoption
    and adaptation to changing landscapes in Borno State are the National Policy on
    Climate Change and Response Strategy and Agricultural Promotion Policy development.
    A typical practice of CSA in southern and northern Borno State is the adoption
    of terracing due to the rocky topography of the area. The farmers affirmed a higher
    yield of sorghum and maize on terraced farms (47% higher) when compared to non-terraced
    ones (FAO and ICRISAT 2019). In the same vein, Oyawole et al. (2019) found that
    the factors influencing the adoption of CSA practices in northern Nigeria include
    social capital, land ownership, gender, off-farm work participation, and plot
    distance from homestead. Similarly, Alhassan and Haruna (2024) found that agricultural
    extension programs and community social networks influenced rural farmers’ CSAP
    adoption in both Ethiopia and Nigeria, thus reinforcing the earlier findings of
    Oyawole et al. (2019). In a further research, Oyawole et al. (2020) affirmed that
    while the plots managed by women have a higher likelihood of adopting green manure
    and agroforestry, there are no significant gender differences in the adoption
    of organic manure and zero/minimum tillage. However, Fapojuwo et al. (2018) discovered
    that female farmers adopted agroforestry in derived savannah, guinea savannah,
    and rain forest, while the male farmers employed organic manure, zero tillage,
    and crop rotation in the same agro-ecological zones, respectively. In a comparative
    study between Nigeria and Ethiopia, Alhassan and Haruna (2024) highlighted the
    important role of income, farm size, and climate-related information for investing
    in CSAPs to curb food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered that household
    income and plot size influence farmers’ adaptation options in promoting CSAPs
    in both Ethiopia and Nigeria. This is in agreement with the findings of Sang et
    al. (2024) who used the 2020 China Rural Revitalization Survey data and found
    that CSAP adoption intensity positively and significantly affects household income,
    net farm income, and income diversity. In terms of the relationship between CSA,
    yields, and food security, Paul Jr. et al. (2023) found that bundling the CSAPs
    might lead to greater yield and food security gains as against the independent
    use of CSAPs such as adopting climate-smart groundnut varieties, cereal-groundnut
    intercropping, and the use of organic fertilizers. Furthermore, Li et al. (2024)
    identified four factors—socio-demographic, institutional, resource endowment,
    and socio-economic factors—that influenced farmers’ decisions to adopt CSAPs.
    They found that most of these factors had either a positive or negative impact
    on the adoption of CSAPs. On the contrary, variables such as labour endowment,
    land tenure security, membership in farmers’ organizations, non-governmental organization
    support, and climate conditions, as well as access to extension services, agricultural
    training, and information, consistently and positively affect the adoption of
    CSAPs across the globe. The CSA story is however not different in the East Asia
    region where Vatsa et al. (2023) accessed the extent to which adoption of CSAPs
    can contribute to food security by improving crop yields among rice farmers across
    five Chinese provinces. The study focussed on the adoption of minimum tillage,
    improved rice varieties, farmyard manure, water-saving technology, and bio-pesticides
    and they found that intensifying the adoption of CSAPs improved rice yield by
    1410 kg/ha. Additionally, the study highlighted that educated farmers, those who
    experienced a drought during the most recent growing season, and individuals who
    perceived the rainfall to have changed during the 5 years preceding the survey
    were more likely to intensify the adoption of CSAPs. Likewise, Zhou et al. (2023)
    considered 10 CSAPs—disease-tolerant banana varieties, banana diversification,
    crop rotation, intercropping, minimum tillage, crop residual turnover, soil testing,
    organic fertilizer, farmyard manure, crop-livestock systems—and assessed whether
    agricultural cooperatives can assist in promoting farmers’ adoption of CSAPs.
    They found that cooperative membership significantly increases the farmers’ adoption
    of banana diversification, crop residual turnover, and soil testing. Furthermore,
    Nwajiuba et al. (2015) examined the current state of CSA knowledge in Africa using
    Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as case studies. They
    found that CSA is yet to be an explicit government policy and there are no agricultural
    practices defined as CSA in the three African countries earlier mentioned. Conversely,
    some of the identified gaps in policy across the three countries include key stakeholders’
    engagement in national CSA dialogue, low awareness about CSA, mainstreaming CSA
    into national agricultural development policy, capacity building and training
    of the extension workers, and actively engaging the youth and schools in CSA extension
    program strategies to widen dissemination and achieve more significant impact.
    In the same vein, Ogunyiola et al. (2022) identified additional policy insights
    needed for the upscaling of CSA practices and technologies in Africa as implementing
    stronger land tenure regulatory frameworks, approaching local knowledge by the
    development partners with care and respect, and implementing inclusive financial
    policies and institutional arrangements in consultation with smallholder farmers
    by government and development partners. In summary, the low adoption of CSAPs
    is still a serious issue in regions like West Africa, East Africa, and East Asia
    (Li et al. 2024; Zhou et al. 2023) coupled with barriers that hinder its upscaling
    across these regions. Though there are several empirical studies on CSAPs, there
    is a need to be intentional about the upscaling of CSAPs in Africa and the appropriateness
    of AP-CSAPs gaining prominence in the context of labour scarcity. Hence, there
    is an urgent need to explore how these practices influence labour demand and the
    broader production factors’ dynamics. 3 Analytical framework This study assumes
    that a farm household largely faces more effective markets (though not perfectly
    competitive) for other farm inputs like fertilizer and seed. Differences in transaction
    costs in different rural locations affect the return to individual smallholder
    farm households from the purchase of fertilizer from urban markets and the value
    of the product, which is normally sold at the farm level (Lopez 1986). For most
    smallholder farmers who operate in the imperfect market environments, their utility
    and profit-maximizing decisions are jointly determined, where the optimal production
    and consumption levels are determined within an integrated framework (Lopez 1986).
    But given the desired level of output that gives the maximum utility or profit
    level, these farmers (producers) would want to minimize their respective cost
    of production, notably costs of purchased inputs. Hence, producers will minimize
    their production cost, given their respective level of output. Therefore, let
    the production function (Eq. 1) of a farm be: $$Q=q(X, Z)$$ (1) where Q represents
    the household’s farm output, i.e., rice harvested in kg; \\(X\\) represents vectors
    of purchased input quantity (seed, labour, fertilizer, pesticide, and mechanization
    service) while \\(Z\\) is the vector of technological practices. The production
    function in Eq. 1 is assumed to be a concave function (twice differentiable where
    the first-order condition is positive and the second-order condition is negative).
    The cost of purchased input is given Eq. (2) as follows: $$C = PX$$ (2) where
    \\(P\\) represents the vector of input prices (which also reflects the differences
    in transaction costs for input at various locations). We assume that farmers minimize
    their cost of production subject to their respective level of output; as shown
    in Eq. 3: $$MinC = PX$$ (3) $$s.tQ = q(X, Z)$$ Setting up the Lagrange function:
    $$L = PX + \\lambda (Q-q(X, Z))$$ (4) Solving the first-order conditions and adding
    vectors of household fixed factors and other characteristics of the farm household
    give a vector of purchased factor input function of the form: $${X}^{*} = x(P,
    Q, Z)$$ (5) Substituting Eq. 5 into Eq. 2, the corresponding minimum cost function
    is derived as follows: $${C}^{*} = c(P, Q, Z)$$ (6) Christensen et al. (1973)
    derived factor cost share equations by transloging the cost function. The translog
    cost function is flexible and does not impose priori restrictions on scale economies
    and substitution of factors. The translog cost function is the most particularly
    useful function for estimating the factor demand functions. Rewriting Eq. 6 in
    natural logarithm, the cost function C* takes the form, $${lnC}^{*} = c(lnP, lnQ,
    Z)$$ (7) where \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(and Z\\) are defined above. Following Binswanger
    (1974) and Bamiro and Shittu (2009), the translog cost function of smallholder
    rice production in the study area was specified as follows: $$\\begin{array}{c}ln\\;C={\\beta
    }_{0}+{\\beta }_{q}\\;ln\\;Q+\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{i}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum
    \\limits_{i=1}^{5}\\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{ij}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{j}+\\sum
    \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{qi}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;Q\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}\\\\
    \\text+\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta }_{ik}{Z}_{k}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;{P}_{i}+\\sum
    \\limits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta }_{kq}{Z}_{k}\\;{\\text{ln}}\\;Q+\\varepsilon \\end{array}$$
    (8) where \\(C\\) is the total cost of production (₦/ha), and \\({P}_{i}\\) or
    \\({P}_{j}\\) is the unit cost (price) of \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) or \\(j{\\text{th}}\\)
    input (\\(i, j =1, 2, \\dots , 5\\)) including seed (₦/kg), labour (₦/workday
    per person), inorganic fertilizer (₦/kg), inorganic pesticides (₦/litre), and
    mechanization service (₦/ha per ploughing operation) while \\(Q\\) denotes rice
    output (kg/ha). In addition, \\({Z}_{k}\\) is the technology-related dummy variable
    for use of the kth AP-CSAP including zero/minimum tillage, rotational cropping,
    green manuring, organic manuring, residue retention, and agroforestry. Each of
    the dummy variables takes on the value of one if used and zero if otherwise. On
    the other hand, \\({\\beta }_{s}\\) are vectors of parameters associated with
    various explanatory variables in the model, which are distinguished by the use
    of subscripts: \\(q\\) for output, \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) for input prices, and \\(k\\)
    for AP-CSAPs, and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a stochastic error term. Neoclassical
    theory suggests the matrix of second-order terms implicitly in Eq. (8) is symmetric
    (\\({\\beta }_{ij} ={\\beta }_{ji}\\): note that \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are similar).
    In addition, the cost function is homogeneous of degree one in input prices such
    that: $$\\begin{array}{cc}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{i}=1\\mathrm{\\;and\\;}\\sum
    \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{ij}=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{qi}=\\sum
    \\limits_{i=1}^{5}{\\beta }_{ki}=0& \\mathrm{for\\;all\\;}i,\\;j\\end{array}$$
    (9) As noted by Bamiro and Shittu (2009) as well as Binswanger (1974), imposing
    homogeneity of degree one in input prices on the translog cost function (Eq. 8)
    does not impose homogeneity of degree one on the underlying production function.
    In addition, almost no other constraints are imposed on the elasticity of factor
    demand or substitution derived from the translog cost function. Logarithmic differentiation
    of the cost function (Eq. 8) and the use of Shepard’s lemma yield the following
    cost share equations: $${S}_{i}={\\beta }_{i}+{\\beta }_{qi}{\\text{ln}}Q+\\sum
    \\limits_{j}^{5}{\\beta }_{ij}\\mathrm{ ln}{P}_{j}+\\sum \\limits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta
    }_{ki}{Z}_{k}+{\\xi }_{i}$$ (10) where \\({S}_{i}\\) is the share of production
    costs associated with the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) input (\\(i\\) = 1, 2, …, 5 for
    seed, labour, inorganic fertilizer, inorganic pesticides, and mechanization services,
    respectively). The cost shares for the purchased inputs are calculated as follows:
    $${S}_{i}=\\frac{{P}_{i}{X}_{i}}{\\sum {P}_{i}{X}_{i}}$$ Imposing homogeneity
    forces one of the input prices to be a numeraire price (Akridge and Hertel 1986).
    Hence, unit costs (prices) of mechanization services, labour, inorganic fertilizer,
    and inorganic pesticides (\\({P}_{2}-{P}_{5}\\)) were expressed in terms of the
    seed price (\\({P}_{1}\\)), and the share equation for seed (\\({S}_{1}\\)) dropped,
    yielding the following system of estimating equations. $${S}_{i}=\\frac{\\partial
    lnC}{\\partial ln{P}_{i}}={\\beta }_{i}+{\\beta }_{qi}lnQ+\\sum \\nolimits_{j=2}^{5}{\\beta
    }_{ij}{\\text{ln}}\\left({P}_{j}/{P}_{1}\\right)+\\sum \\nolimits_{k=1}^{6}{\\beta
    }_{ki}{Z}_{k}+{\\varepsilon }_{i} (i = 2, 3, \\dots , 5)$$ (11) The system of
    Eq. (11) was the final estimation equation adopted in this study. The parameters
    were estimated jointly using the iterative seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)
    procedure in STATA version 16. Parameters of the seed equation dropped in (11)
    were derived from the coefficients of the estimated cost shares equations using
    the symmetry and homogeneity restrictions in (9). The constant output own-price
    and cross-price elasticities of factor demand were estimated following Biswanger
    (1974), Johnston (1985), and Bamiro and Shittu (2009) as follows: $$\\eta_{ij}=\\frac{\\beta_{ij}+S_iS_j}{S_i}\\mathrm
    f\\mathrm o\\mathrm r\\;\\mathrm a\\mathrm l\\mathrm l\\;i,\\;j;\\;i\\;\\neq j$$
    (12) $$\\eta_{ii}=\\frac{\\beta_{ii}+{Si}^2-Si}{Si}\\mathrm f\\mathrm o\\mathrm
    r\\;\\mathrm a\\mathrm l\\mathrm l\\;i$$ (13) where \\({\\eta }_{ii}\\) is the
    constant output own-price elasticity of demand for the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) factor,
    \\({\\eta }_{ij}\\) is the constant output cross-price elasticity of demand for
    the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) factor due to changes in the price of the \\(j{\\text{th}}\\)
    factor, and \\({\\beta }_{ij}\\) is the parameter of the \\(j{\\text{th}}\\) input
    price in the i cost share equation. Similarly, \\({\\beta }_{ii}\\) is the parameter
    of the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) input price in its own cost share equation and \\({S}_{i}\\)
    and \\({S}_{j}\\) are respectively the shares of the \\(i{\\text{th}}\\) and \\(j{\\text{th}}\\)
    inputs in the production cost. The Morishima elasticities of input substitution
    were also computed, following Blackorby and Russel (1989) as well as Bamiro and
    Shittu (2009) as follows: $${\\delta }_{ij}^{M} = \\frac{{\\beta }_{ij}+{S}_{i}{S}_{j}}{{S}_{i}}-\\frac{{\\beta
    }_{ii}+{Si}^{2}-Si}{Si}$$ (14) where \\({\\delta }_{ij}^{M}\\) is the Morishima
    elasticity of substitution of factor i for j while \\({\\beta }_{ij}\\), \\({S}_{i}\\)
    and \\({S}_{j}\\) are as earlier defined. 4 Methodology 4.1 Study area The study
    was conducted in selected farming communities reputed for rice production across
    the six geopolitical zones, and covering five of the seven agro-ecological zones
    (AEZs) of Nigeria. Nigeria is situated in the West African sub-region and lies
    between longitudes 3 and 14 and latitudes 4 and 14. It has a landmass of 923,768
    sq. km. Nigeria shares a land border with the Republic of Benin in the west, Chad
    and Cameroon in the east, and Niger in the north. Its coast lies on the Gulf of
    Guinea in the south and it borders Lake Chad to the northeast. Administratively,
    it is made of 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The States are
    commonly grouped into six (6) geopolitical zones: Northeast, Northwest, North-central,
    Southeast, Southwest, and South-south geopolitical zones. Nigeria is covered by
    three types of vegetation: forests (where there is significant tree cover), savannahs
    (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees), and
    montane land, and is commonly divided into seven agro-ecological zones, namely
    the Sahel Savannah, the Sudan Savannah, and the Northern as well as Southern Guinea
    Savannahs. Other AEZs include the Derived Savannah, the Mid-Altitude, and the
    Humid Rainforests, all of which are suitable for the cultivation of maize and
    rice, among several other crops like cassava and yams. 4.2 The study design The
    study was part of the FUNAAB-RAAF-PASANAO project implemented by the Federal University
    of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), in partnership with the National Cereals Research
    Institute, Baddegi, and funded by the Economic Community of West African States
    (ECOWAS). The central focus was on incentivizing the adoption of climate-smart
    agricultural practices in cereal production in Nigeria. The data were collected
    in a Nationwide Farm Household Survey conducted across the six geopolitical zones
    in Nigeria, focusing on maize and rice farmers. The sub-set of the study data
    used in this study was from smallholder rice farmers in Nigeria. The respondents
    were selected in a three-stage sampling process, described as follows: Stage I:
    Purposive selection of 16 States that have been the leading rice producers in
    Nigeria (excluding conflict-prone areas), based on production statistics from
    [National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), 2016] Stage II: Purposive selection of three
    (3) Agricultural Blocks per State from the main rice-producing areas of the State
    and two (2) Extension Cells per block—that is, three (3) blocks per state, six
    (6) Cells per State, and 96 Cells in all Stage III: Proportionate stratified random
    selection of 16 Rice farmers from members of the Rice farmers’ association in
    each of the selected Cells This process yielded 1536 households of rice farmers
    but only 1500 households from which a complete dataset was collected through personal
    interviews of the farmer and other farming members of their households were used
    for the study. Data were collected on a wide range of issues, including the households’
    socio-economics, climate-smart practices, production systems, production resource
    use, costs, and outputs on farmland cultivated during the 2016/17 farming season.
    4.3 Descriptive statistics of the study variable The description of the study
    that influences the factor demand and input substitution among smallholder rice
    farmers in Nigeria was identified based on the review of related literature variables
    and the summary statistics of the variables are given in Table 1. As expected,
    labour took the highest (three-fifths) cost share followed by fertilizer and seed
    that took about one-seventh of the total cost share, respectively. It is important
    to note that herbicide and mechanization cost took the lowest share of the total
    budget for agricultural inputs used by the smallholder rice farmers. Table 1 Definition
    of study variables and their descriptive statistics Full size table Focusing on
    the AP-CSAP technologies used by the rice farmers in the study area (Table 1),
    specifically, a little above half of the respondents (55%) used minimum tillage
    on their rice farms while one-third of them practiced agroforestry (34%) and residue
    retention (33%) during the 2016/2017 production season. Worthy to note is the
    fact that organic manure has the least patronage, which was used by only 9% of
    the rice farmers in the target area. This may be due to the bulky nature of farmyard
    manure and/or animal dung coupled with the fact that large quantities required
    may not be readily available (Kehinde et al. 2023). With respect to socio-demographic
    characteristics, Table 1 shows that the average age of the rice farmers across
    the six geopolitical zones is 45 years. This implies that the majority of the
    respondents were still in their active years implying significant participation
    in the farming activities. This result is similar to the findings of Adeyonu et
    al. (2022) who found the mean age of rural households in Nigeria to be 48 years.
    Only 9% of the respondents were female indicating that the majority of the sampled
    rice farmers were male. The mean year of schooling is 8 years while those that
    had access to extension services and belong to farmers association or the other
    were 62% and 95%, respectively. The mean size of household landholdings was 2.21
    ha portraying the respondents as smallholders. In the same vein, an average rice
    farmer reported the yield of 2.3 tonnes across the study area. This corroborates
    the findings of the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (2023) which reported that
    the Nigeria rice yield in the 2016/2017 production season is 2.2 t/ha. 5 Result
    and discussions 5.1 Effect of input price on the factor cost share The results
    of the estimated system of factor share equations are summarized in Table 2. The
    results show that the coefficients \\({\\beta }_{ii}\\) (the coefficient between
    price and share of the same factors) are greater than zero, with the exception
    of that of pesticides and this satisfies the theoretical constraint on non-decreasing
    factor prices. This implies that the cost share of seed, labour, fertilizer, and
    mechanization increases with an increase in the price of the respective input.
    This might be because most of these inputs do not have a perfect substitute. However,
    the reverse is the case for pesticide, probably because the rice farmers have
    access to the other alternatives like farm labour (as against the use of herbicides)
    and indigenous ways to control birds and other major pests. Table 2 Estimated
    SUR factor share equations Full size table Concerning the effect of input prices
    on factor cost share in Table 2, the results show that a unit increase in the
    prices of labour per day and that of fertilizer per kg will significantly increase
    the labour cost share at 1% level while it reduces the mechanization cost share
    at 1% and 5% levels, respectively. An increase in the price of labour (wage rate)
    results in a higher share of labour in the budget because labour cannot be readily
    substituted in this part of the world. Likewise, if the price of fertilizer goes
    up, it will lead to a higher cost share of fertilizer because it cannot readily
    be substituted and the soil is heavily degraded; hence, the smallholder rice farmers
    are increasingly becoming agrochemical dependent. In addition, an increase in
    the unit price of mechanization service per hectare significantly reduces the
    labour cost shares at 5% level and increases significantly at 1% level the budget
    allocated to pesticides and mechanization service. This is logical, as an increase
    in the unit price of mechanization service will make farmers jettison the use
    of mechanization for some of the farm operations and employ more labour. On the
    other hand, the increase in mechanization prices has resulted in a higher budget
    share of pesticides and mechanization service, respectively. The coefficient of
    rice yield is significant at 5% level in the labour equation. The coefficient
    of rice in the labour share equation is negative (− 0.0263). Thus, the scale effect
    is labour-saving, which implies that as more rice is produced, the share of labour
    cost decreases. 5.2 Effect of AP-CSAPs on factor cost share Focusing on the labour
    share equation, the results show that coefficients of all the AP-CSAPs, except
    agroforestry, are positive and significant at 1%, 5%, or 10% levels. This shows
    that most AP-CSAPs are labour-using, except for agroforestry that is labour neutral.
    This implies that usage of minimum-tillage, crop rotation, organic manure use,
    green manure, and residue retention will increase the smallholder rice farmers’
    demand for an already too scarce labour. Hence, a shift to AP-CSAPs will lead
    to a significant increase in labour demand by the smallholder rice farmers in
    Nigeria. Focusing on the fertilizer share equation, results in Table 2 show that
    the coefficient of minimum tillage was positive and significant at 1% level while
    those of other AP-CSAPs were fertilizer-neutral. This shows that while most AP-CSAPs
    use, except minimum tillage, are fertilizers saving, the effects are largely not
    significant. The results regarding the pesticide use, however, show that the coefficients
    of organic manuring and residue retention were negative and all significant at
    1% level while those of minimum tillage and crop rotation were positive and significant
    at 1% level. These show that the use of organic manure and residue retention is
    significantly pesticide saving while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and
    fertilizer using. The results with respect to mechanization service further show
    that the coefficients of AP-CSAPs such as minimum tillage and organic manure are
    negative and significant 1% levels. This shows that the use of those AP-CSAPs
    is mechanization service saving. In other words, the cost shares of mechanization
    service decrease with the use of minimum tillage and organic manure. Other estimates
    in Table 2 also show that the use of most AP-CSAPs is seed-saving. 5.3 Elasticities
    of factor demand and input substitution The estimated own-price and cross-price
    elasticities of factor demand as well as elasticities of input substitution-based
    SUR results in Table 2 are summarized in Table 3 and 4, respectively. The results
    of the elasticities of factor demand are reported in Table 3. All the own price
    elasticities of factor demand have expected signs. Seed, labour, fertilizer, and
    mechanization are all negatives and less than one, implying that the demand for
    these resources decreases with an increase in their respective prices but inelastic.
    This result is consistent with the law of demand, which states that ceteris paribus,
    the quantity demanded of a commodity is inversely proportional to the price of
    the commodity. Whereas the own price elasticity of pesticide is negative but elastic,
    this implies that the demand for pesticide will greatly rise more than the price
    changes by a larger proportion with an increase in its prices. Table 3 Own price
    and cross-price elasticities of factor demand Full size table Table 4 Morishima
    elasticity of factor substitution Full size table The elasticity of demand for
    labour is relatively low; this suggests that the demand for agricultural labour
    is highly inelastic. Labour can therefore be regarded as a necessity because changes
    (increase or decrease) in the price of this input have a negligible effect on
    the quantity demanded. It is important to note that other inputs such as fertilizer
    and mechanization have a relatively lower price elasticity of demand than that
    of seed (Table 3). This suggests that the demand for seed is relatively more elastic
    than that of fertilizer and mechanization. This is in line with the findings of
    Otunaiya et al. (2013) who found that all other inputs, except planting material,
    have a relatively lower price elasticity of demand than that of inorganic fertilizer.
    5.4 The cross-price elasticity of demand for factors The off-diagonal elements
    of the estimates in Table 3 are the cross-price elasticity of demand for various
    factors. They measure the degree of responsiveness of the demand for a factor
    (say labour), to a percentage increase in the price of another factor (say seed).
    Positive cross-price elasticity of demand means that the factors are substitutes
    while negative cross-price elasticity of demand implies that the inputs are complements.
    The results suggest that seed is a technical substitute for pesticides and mechanization
    while it is a technical complement for labour and fertilizer in smallholder rice
    production. Likewise, labour was found to be a technical substitute for fertilizer
    and pesticides, thus indicating that farmers tend to replace costly fertilizer
    and pesticides with labour. Reference can be made to labour-fertilizer and labour-pesticide
    substitutability in terms of bigger family size that implies more cheap labour
    while resources for purchasing fertilizer are reallocated to family labour. However,
    labour is complementary to the price of mechanization service and seed, indicating
    that the greater the households’ mechanize some of the farm operations and plant
    more seeds, the more likely it will translate to higher employment in the farm
    activity. Pesticide was found to be a technical substitute for seed and labour
    and technical complement for fertilizer and mechanization service. This implies
    that as the price of pesticide and mechanization services increase, less pesticide
    and mechanization services are demanded and more of seeds are demanded and utilized.
    Similarly, as the price of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides increase, the demand
    for inorganic fertilizer and pesticide declines and more labour is demanded and
    utilized. On the other hand, the complementarities of seed-labour pair and seed-fertilizer
    pair imply that an increase in the price of seed will reduce demand for seed and
    result in a consequential decrease in demand for labour and fertilizer. This result
    corroborates that of Mensah-Bonsu (2010) who found that the cross-price elasticity
    between seed and hired labour was negative, hence suggesting complementarity between
    the two inputs. In the same vein, the complementarities of the mechanization service-labour
    pair and mechanization-pesticide pair imply that an increase in the price of mechanization
    service will reduce the demand for mechanization service and therefore a consequential
    decrease in demand for labour and pesticide. These results are further confirmed
    by the Morishima elasticities of input substitution in Table 4. The elasticity
    of the factor of substitution reflects the relative importance (change) of a factor
    while the cross-price elasticities do not. In other words, the elasticity of input
    substitution measures the ease of substitution with which the inputs can be substituted
    for the other. Ease of substitution between factors of production improves with
    an increase in the value of elasticity of substitution (\\(\\delta\\)). The results
    in Table 4 show that fertilizer has a high degree of substitutability (2.1348)
    for seed. Conversely, seed has very low substitutability (− 0.4732) for labour.
    This result is expected because sufficient quantity and good quality seed reduce
    crop failure. Table 4 further shows that labour has a large substitution possibility
    (1.5067) for pesticides as well as fertilizer (1.2060). Similarly, seed has a
    fairly high degree of substitutability for pesticides (1.352) and mechanization
    service (2.9907), respectively. This implies that if there is a relative rise
    in the price of pesticide and fertilizer, it would result in a higher demand for
    seed and labour. An increase in the price of fertilizer and pesticide would increase
    the intensity of the use of labour and improved crop variety. 6 Conclusion and
    policy implications 6.1 Conclusions This study used household survey data of smallholder
    rice farmers to assess the influence of the AP-CSAPs on labour (and other production
    factors’) demand and input substitution in Nigeria. The descriptive result shows
    that about 55% of the respondents used minimum tillage on their rice farms while
    one-third of them practiced agroforestry (34%) and residue retention (33%) during
    the 2016/2017 production season. In terms of cost share, labour took about 60%
    of the total cost share followed by fertilizer and seed that took about one-seventh
    of the total cost share, respectively. The SUR result shows that labour and fertilizer
    cannot be readily substituted in Nigeria; hence, an increase in the unit price
    of labour (wage rate) and fertilizer results in a higher share of labour and fertilizer
    in the budget. On the contrary, an increase in the unit price of mechanization
    service per hectare reduces significantly the share of labour cost and increases
    significantly the budget share allocated to pesticides and mechanization service.
    In terms of the effects of AP-CSAP use on factor cost share, most of the AP-CSAPs
    are labour-intensive with the exception of agroforestry that is labour neutral.
    The use of organic manure and residue retention is significantly pesticide saving
    while zero/minimum tillage use is pesticide and fertilizer using. Demand for most
    of the production factors, except pesticide, was also found to be price inelastic,
    suggesting that policies aimed at taxing agrochemical use may not cause a substantial
    reduction in chemical dependence in Nigeria’s smallholder agriculture, even though
    it may significantly reduce pesticide use. 6.2 Policy implications Arising from
    the foregoing, promoting the use of AP-CSAPs such as minimum tillage, green and
    organic manure, residue retention, and crop rotation will create more demand for
    labour, which is very important for employment creation. However, it is a serious
    challenge due to rising labour scarcity with rural–urban migration posing a serious
    threat; the supplementary thing might be to create incentives in the form of higher
    wages or compensation to bring people back to agriculture. In addition, intervention
    via the input market such as improved crop variety, seed of green manure and/or
    cover crops, and agricultural extension services can be made readily available
    to farmers by the government agencies, relevant private institutions, and development
    partners advocating for the adoption of AP-CSAPs. Given that most AP-CSAPs require
    higher labour requirements, their success is often impeded by labour shortages.
    The development partners, NGOs, and other relevant stakeholders can leverage on
    the community-driven development approach to provide the smallholder farmers with
    the platform for machine-sharing where necessary equipment such as jab planter
    and self-propelled rice transplanter among others are provided and managed at
    the community level. This may boost the adoption of labour-using AP-CSAPs in Nigeria.
    In an attempt to promote a shift to climate-smart agriculture and contribute to
    sustainable ecosystem management in Nigeria, both moral suasion and Payment for
    Ecosystem Services (PES) approaches can be adopted to promote positive change
    and foster a sense of stewardship among local communities. Moral suasion entails
    persuading, appealing, and encouraging farmers/landowners/communities to voluntarily
    adopt ethical and responsible practices that promote the well-being of the environment
    without relying on financial incentives. Some of the key components of this approach
    include creating awareness about the importance of environmental conservation
    and sustainable agricultural practices, educating the farmers/landowners/communities
    about the consequences of unsustainable farming practices, and appealing to their
    sense of responsibility and morality. An example is the use of moral suasion by
    conservation organizations and government agencies in Nigeria to encourage the
    local communities to protect endangered species like the Cross River Gorilla.
    Similarly, conservation of iconic wildlife species like Elephants, Rhinoceros,
    and Lions in Kenya relies solely on moral suasion. Consequently, Kenya’s wildlife
    conservation has successfully reduced poaching, established wildlife reserves,
    and promoted ecotourism through ethical persuasion and cultural values. Payment
    for ecosystem services on the other hand involves compensating farmers/landowners/communities
    for actions that enhance ecosystem service like carbon sequestration and biodiversity
    protection. A specific example is the collaboration of Nigerian Erosion and Watershed
    Management Project with local communities to restore degraded landscapes, prevent
    erosion, and improve water quality where farmers were paid for adopting sustainable
    land management practices like reforestation and agroforestry that contribute
    to soil conservation and water regulation. Thus, in addition to creating incentives
    in the form of higher wages to bring people back to agriculture and leveraging
    on community-driven development approach to provide labour-saving equipment to
    rice farmers, integrating moral suasion with PES will enhance the adoption of
    AP-CSAPs. There is therefore no doubt that combining PES with moral suasion can
    create a more holistic and effective approach to sustainable ecosystem management
    and environmental conservation in Nigeria, and Africa at large. In conclusion,
    integrating PES with moral suasion recognizes both economic and intrinsic motivations
    that foster behavioural change, promote social norms, and deepen community engagement
    as well as ensuring commitment to sustainable agricultural practices in the long
    run. Data availability The data will be made available when requested. References

    IntelligenceInternet of Things 1. Introduction According to the World Bank report,
    food security is guaranteed by the agricultural sector, which constitutes one
    of the economic pillars in the majority of the world''s countries (Burki, 2022).
    Intensifying production and increasing agricultural yields are closely linked
    to good irrigation practices, given the direct positive effect of water on crop
    income (DeJonge et al., 2007). Excessive use of water resources, especially in
    the agricultural sector, which is responsible for consuming most of the world''s
    freshwater, is making these resources less and less available. In addition, the
    effects of climate change have aggravated the situation, making rational use of
    water resources essential (DeJonge et al., 2007, Burki, 2022, Kocian et al., 2023).
    Adopting a sustainable agricultural management strategy that achieves the highest
    yields without depleting natural resources is a solution strongly encouraged by
    the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and one in which
    all countries of the world must be involved (Burki, 2022). Closed-loop irrigation
    (Bwambale et al., 2022), also known as smart irrigation (Obaideen et al., 2022),
    is a promising solution that harnesses new Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence
    technologies to manage and schedule irrigation, applying water at the optimum
    time according to crop needs. Crop water requirements are influenced by the process
    of crop evapotranspiration, which includes two inseparable phenomena responsible
    for water losses: soil evaporation and crop transpiration (Anderson and French,
    2019). The indirect dual crop coefficient method suggested by (Anderson and French,
    2019) is the standard method used for precise irrigation scheduling. This method
    is essentially centered on the calculation of the crop evapotranspiration coefficient
    ETc, which enables the estimation of the exact amount of water to be applied by
    taking into consideration the meteorological conditions summarized in the reference
    crop evapotranspiration coefficient ETo and the phenological conditions of the
    plants estimated by the crop coefficient Kc (Abou Ali et al., 2023, Feng et al.,
    2023, Gonçalves et al., 2023; X. Han et al., 2021; Vories et al., 2021). Several
    new studies have benefited from the development of new technologies for estimating
    the evapotranspiration coefficient of ETc crops. For example, (Zhangzhong et al.,
    2023) proposed a mobile solution for real-time monitoring of the irrigation requirements
    of certain types of lettuce grown in greenhouses using sensors and machine learning
    algorithms. (Kocian et al., 2023) have suggested an Internet of Things-based solution
    for monitoring water use for crops grown in greenhouses. However, estimating the
    water requirements of crops grown in controlled environments is much simpler than
    estimating them in arable fields, since several factors enter into the formation
    and evolution of the evapotranspiration process. (Wu et al., 2023) attempted to
    estimate, in a semi-humid region in China, the irrigation requirements of maize
    by training meteorological data from a local weather station and crop data measured
    by a lysimeter, in machine learning models, while (Y. Zhang et al., 2023) used
    crop data acquired by sensors based on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate
    the daily ETc of maize. Using the dual crop coefficient method to estimate irrigation
    requirements can be an effective but not efficient solution if it is not accompanied
    by a prior and accurate understanding of the climatic, physical, chemical, biological
    and hydrological characteristics of the arable field. By way of example, if farmers
    grow a type of crop in a field that is not compatible with the field''s characteristics,
    the best possible irrigation strategy in this case is not necessarily the efficient
    solution. On the other hand, the solution that consists in changing the type of
    crop, according to the field''s characteristics, and accompanying it with good
    irrigation management is necessarily in this case the efficient solution in terms
    of managing natural resources and obtaining the best possible yield in the field
    under study. (Karimzadeh Soureshjani et al., 2019) studied the existing relationship
    between crop yield and air temperature and came to the result that management
    practices such as adjusting planting date can be applied by knowing the critical
    periods during which crops are most vulnerable to climate change conditions. To
    the best of our knowledge, to date there has been no literature review study that,
    in addition to bringing together the key factors affecting the evapotranspiration
    process in a field, explores the new Internet of Things and artificial intelligence
    technologies used to monitor, detect, locate and predict these factors, which
    are the climatic, physical, chemical, biological and hydrological characteristics
    of a field with a view to efficient irrigation management. 2. Related work Intelligent
    and sustainable irrigation management has become a necessity whether in smart
    cities or agricultural fields. (Gimpel et al., 2021) proposed an irrigation system
    for urban trees using Internet of Things (IoT) architecture technologies and meteorological
    data. The proposed solution achieved promising results in terms of reducing irrigation
    water consumption. (Veerachamy et al., 2022) have proposed an irrigation monitoring
    and control system using IoT technology. The suggested solution can be managed
    manually through the analysis of data displayed on a mobile app, or automatically
    by determining the threshold soil moisture value of the field to be irrigated.
    The system can be enhanced by the introduction of Artificial Intelligence algorithms
    as used by (R et al., 2023) who proposed an autonomous system based on Artificial
    Intelligence and IoT-6 G that both predicts climate change and precipitation patterns
    and measures soil moisture levels for the coming days. The system has been tested
    in a controlled environment, achieving high accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) have proposed a system that takes into consideration
    crop data such as: soil type, crop type as well as its planting date, and some
    field data to calculate evapotranspiration and make irrigation decisions based
    on neural methods. (Xie et al., 2022) proposed a system for irrigation control
    and soil moisture level monitoring in a Litchi orchard. The system used data from
    a soil moisture sensor and data from a weather station as inputs to an improved
    Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results showed that the system
    is highly accurate, easy to implement and applicable in real time. (Alibabaei
    et al., 2022) studied the ability of reinforcement learning to schedule the irrigation
    of a tomato field without affecting productivity. They proposed a deep Q-network
    model (LSTM) that indicates when and how much to irrigate. The proposed model
    increased productivity and reduced water consumption. (Cordeiro et al., 2022)
    proposed deep neural network architectures using Long short-term memory (LSTM)
    and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to develop economical soil moisture prediction
    models. The problem of missing input data was also addressed by using the k-nearest
    neighbors (KNN) algorithm to fill in the unknown values and guarantee a high degree
    of reliability. One of the perspectives of this work is the evaluation of the
    energy consumption of fog nodes. (Maria Manuel Vianny et al., 2022) proposed an
    irrigation system for a banana field that reduces energy and water consumption
    through the use of IoT sensors, a storage system and the KNN, Gradient boosting
    and LSTM algorithms. (Goap et al., 2018) have also proposed a water and energy-efficient
    system that relies on field sensor data and weather forecast data as inputs to
    a method developed based on the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm and
    K-means clustering. One of the perspectives of this work is to further develop
    the system so that it works with multiple sensor nodes while minimizing system
    cost. (Khan et al., 2022) have proposed a smart irrigation solution that is energy-efficient,
    reliable and secure. They have used methods based on Artificial Intelligence to
    select the optimal location of sensor nodes, to regulate energy and to choose
    the most optimal routing path. (Al-Ali et al., 2019) have designed a prototype
    solar energy system based on IoT and a fuzzy logic algorithm for irrigation control
    and decision-making. Table 1 shows more details of the irrigation systems studied.
    Table 1. Related work using new technologies in irrigation management. Reference
    Goal Results Future works (Veerachamy et al., 2022) Proposal for an automated
    irrigation control system using field sensors and a Cloud platform. The system
    saves water and labor in the irrigation process. - Due to poor network coverage,
    the system can malfunction, making it necessary to improve it. - The system can
    be improved by introducing machine learning algorithms and other input parameters
    for more reliable forecasting. (R et al., 2023) Development of an efficient crop
    irrigation methodology using artificial intelligence and IoT-6 G technologies.
    The proposed system was tested in a controlled environment and achieved an accuracy
    of 86.34%. The solution needs to be tested in a real environment with several
    field characteristics. (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) Development of a low-cost
    intelligent irrigation system that enables irrigation scheduling and decision-making.
    The system was tested on spinach seeds during their growing period, and achieved
    water savings of around 67% compared with traditional methods. Future work will
    focus on the application of such a system to other types of crop and in other
    environments. (Xie et al., 2022) Design of an irrigation control system using
    soil moisture level monitoring in a Litchi orchard. The average soil moisture
    value estimated by the developed method is closer to the optimum soil moisture
    defined by the system. - The generalizability of the system can be improved by
    carrying out this study on different types of regions or orchards. - The spatial
    distribution of soil moisture needs to be taken into account for more accurate
    measurements. (Alibabaei et al., 2022) Study of the ability of reinforcement learning
    to schedule the irrigation of a tomato field without affecting productivity. Compared
    with fixed-base and threshold-based irrigation methods, the trained model increased
    productivity by 11% and reduced water consumption by 20–30%. The input data for
    the model developed were simulated, hence the need to train the model with field
    data to make it more realistic. (Cordeiro et al., 2022) Construction of soil moisture
    prediction models for coconuts and cashews based on deep neural network architectures.
    The real experiment showed promising results, with more accurate predictions in
    the deepest soil layers than in the surface layers. Evaluation of the energy consumption
    of fog nodes. (Maria Manuel Vianny et al., 2022) Optimizing water and energy use
    in banana agriculture using IoT and machine learning algorithms. 31.14% of water
    consumption is reduced in a period characterized by low rainfall. External interference
    such as signal noise must be eliminated to improve prediction accuracy and decision-making.
    (Goap et al., 2018) Development of a soil moisture prediction algorithm using
    field sensor data and weather forecast data. A web interface has been developed
    to view sensor data in real time and plan irrigation and the results of the prediction
    system are very encouraging. Further develop the system to work with multiple
    sensor nodes while minimizing system cost. (Al-Ali et al., 2019) Irrigation management
    using a renewable energy source to provide the energy needed to keep the system
    running smoothly. The prototype provided excellent irrigation using only solar
    energy. Implement such a system in a real agricultural environment. (Alves et
    al., 2023) Creation of a simulation model to simulate and evaluate the behavior
    of an irrigation system defined in an application scenario. The results show that
    the system can increase water use efficiency by evaluating several irrigation
    strategies with data collected from multiple sources. The study doesn''t use actual
    data from a farm, so in the future, it''s important to evaluate the behavior of
    the IoT platform in a real environment in order to validate the communication
    between the devices and the platform. Another technology that can be beneficial
    in irrigation management and scheduling is the Digital Twin. (Alves et al., 2023)
    used this technology to develop a closed-loop monitoring and control system for
    irrigation. The proposed solution was used to evaluate the behavior of an IoT
    platform and irrigation strategies before applying them on the agricultural field.
    The results show that the system is capable of collecting data to create a daily
    irrigation schedule. 3. Research methodology A targeted, relevant literature review
    leads to strong and solid results. The methodology of systematic literature review
    SLR is widely used to conduct a successful literature search.It is a method of
    determining, assessing and evaluating all available research relevant to a particular
    research question or phenomenon of interest (Kitchenham et al., 2009). The SLR
    guidelines used in this document are those of (Kitchenham et al., 2009), which
    have been adapted to software engineering from the medical literature. The SLR
    protocol defined in this article was adapted from the protocol used by (Nyoman
    Kutha Krisnawijaya et al., 2022; Tummers et al., 2019), also based on (Kitchenham
    et al., 2009). The identification of the research questions was our first step,
    followed by the search protocol definition which include determining the search
    string and the sources to be consulted. The definition of the search protocol
    was an iterative process, in which the results of one search string were used
    to adjust the next search string. Defining the criteria for selecting the studies
    was our third step. In the fourth step, we applied the criteria to the search
    results. After this step, we obtained the articles we used for an in-depth evaluation
    based on a quality assessment method. The fifth step involved extracting useful
    data from the selected articles. The third, fourth and fifth steps were iterative.
    Finally, in the sixth stage, we defined the method used to synthesize and present
    the data. 3.1. Research questions Irrigation compensates for crop evapotranspiration
    losses, so several research questions arise from this starting point: • RQ1: What
    new technologies are being used to estimate and predict the ETo climate parameter?
    • RQ1.1: Does a good prediction of this coefficient guarantee good irrigation
    scheduling? In other words, is irrigation intensification always the optimal solution
    to compensate for the effect of soil evaporation, or do we need to think differently?
    • RQ2: What factors have a significant influence on the crop coefficient Kc as
    mentionned in FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper? • RQ2.1: What effect do soil
    physical properties have on agricultural management in general? What new technologies
    are being used in this field of research? • RQ2.2: What effect do soil chemical
    properties have on agricultural management in general? What new technologies are
    being used in this field of research? • RQ2.3: What are the soil''s hydrological
    properties to be taken into account when managing irrigation • RQ2.3.1: What new
    technologies are being used to estimate soil moisture • RQ2.3.2: What is the effect
    of groundwater on crop growth, and how can we exploit new technologies to estimate
    and predict groundwater levels • RQ2.3.3: What is the effect of hydraulic conductivity
    on irrigation scheduling, and how can we exploit new technologies to estimate
    and predict hydraulic conductivity? • RQ3: What is the effect of non-standard
    elements such as weeds and plant diseases on crop development and yield • RQ3.1:
    What new technologies are being used to manage weeds • RQ3.2: What new technologies
    are being used to manage plant diseases • RQ4: Do the farming practices adopted
    in a field affect the crop coefficient, and if so, how does this manifest itself
    The first research question is addressed by identifying new technologies used
    for short, medium and long-term ETo estimation and prediction. This question has
    generated another sub-question which highlights the solution of irrigation intensification
    to compensate for the effect of climatic parameters on the soil and discusses
    the feasibility of this solution in cases of climate changes. This sub-question
    is addressed by analyzing case studies that investigate the effect of climate
    changes such as temperature on irrigated crop yields. The answer to this question
    led us to the second research question, which discusses the soil properties that
    influence crop evapotranspiration, namely soil physical, chemical and hydrological
    properties. This question is followed by three sub-questions. The first sub-question
    is addressed by identifying new technologies used for the prediction and classification
    of soil textures and their irrigation requirements. The second sub-question is
    addressed by identifying new technologies used for the prediction and real-time
    monitoring of soil chemical properties. The third sub-question, which discusses
    soil hydraulic properties, has been addressed firstly by identifying new technologies
    used for the short and long-term prediction of soil moisture, secondly, by identifying
    new technologies used for the short and long-term prediction of groundwater levels,
    and thirdly, by identifying new technologies used for the prediction and mapping
    of saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The third research question,
    which discusses the effect of non-standard elements such as pests and weeds on
    crop evaporation, was addressed firstly by identifying new technologies used for
    weed detection, localization and prediction, and secondly by identifying new technologies
    used for plant disease detection and severity. Finally, the fourth research question,
    which discusses the effect of agricultural practices on crop evapotranspiration,
    was developed by analysing some case studies that investigate the effect of sometimes
    inappropriate agricultural practices such as the mode of application and the quantity
    of water on crop yield. 3.2. Search protocol To answer the research questions,
    we carried out a systematic search of the literature available in digital libraries
    that publish high-quality articles such as IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer,
    Web of Science and Scopus. The use of new technologies in agriculture has become
    increasingly frequent in recent years. Consequently, literature from the last
    eight years (2015–2023) was used in this study. The targeted articles were journal
    articles. In order to find as many relevant results as possible, an automated
    search and a manual search were carried out. The automated search was carried
    out using search strings in the digital libraries listed above. The syntax of
    each database is different. An example of the general syntax of the search string
    is illustrated by the following query: (\"Smart irrigation \" OR \" Irrigation
    planning \") AND (\"Reference crop evapotranspiration \" OR \" Soil classification
    \" OR \"Soil chemical properties\") AND (\"Artificial intelligence \" OR \" Machine
    learning \" OR \" Internet of things \"). A manual search was carried out by manually
    going through the list of references of articles discovered by the automated search
    (snowball effect). Table 2 shows the keywords used to find relevant articles Table

    413 studies, and the source containing the lowest number of studies was Springer
    with 19 studies. In total, 625 articles were identified by the automated search
    and 47 articles were added by the manual search. Table 3. Overview of search results

    Journal articles, conference papers and book chapters were potentially provided
    after applying the search strings. Based on the search results, we applied the
    selection criteria presented in Table 4 to identify the most relevant studies.
    First, the selection criteria were applied by choosing only journal articles and
    reading the title, keywords and abstract of the studies. Next, we proceeded to
    a detailed reading of the studies and the application of exclusion criteria. After
    applying these criteria, 55 of the 672 articles were retained. The selection process
    is shown in Table 3. Table 4. List of selection criteria. No Criteria EC 1 Articles

    the quality of the 55 studies before moving on to the data synthesis stage. In
    this research, quality assessment was part of data extraction. When reading the
    articles, the quality criteria presented in Table 5 were applied as adopted by
    (Kitchenham et al., 2009) and other SLR researches. Studies were ranked according
    to the quality of their final product, and a three-point scale (yes, partial,
    no) was used for each criterion found during the process. At this stage, articles
    scoring less than four points out of eight were excluded. Fig. 1 shows that all
    primary studies obtained a score between five and seven after evaluation of all
    articles. Consequently, no exclusion decision was made regarding these studies,
    and all the 55 studies will be used in the data extraction process. Table 5. List

    necessary to read the 55 primary studies carefully and in full. For this reason,
    a data extraction table was developed to collect and retrieve all relevant information
    from these studies. The development of the data extraction table followed an iterative
    process. First, we rigorously read several arbitrarily selected articles to create
    the data extraction table. Then, the initial data extraction table was used on
    other selected articles to extract the data, and if it turned out that the table
    still didn''t cover all the information, we updated it and used the revised table
    on subsequent articles. This process was repeated. Finally, our final data extraction
    table includes general information such as study title, authors, year of publication
    and place of publication. It also contains specific information that directly
    answers the research questions such as the target domain, the main objectives
    of the study, the material used, the artificial intelligence algorithms used,
    the results and the limitations of the study. Details of the data extraction table
    are provided in the Table 6 in appendix A.(Table 6) Table 6. The data extraction

    is the process of gathering and summarizing the extracted data in a way that answers
    the questions posed. To achieve this, we tried to extract the obstacles and limitations
    of each study and to search, in the selected primary articles, for other solutions
    and innovations capable of filling the gaps found. We used tabular representation
    of the data where possible, which enabled us to make comparisons between studies.
    In this way, we were able to extract the future paths of research that remain
    to be explored. 4. Results This section presents the results of data extraction
    and synthesis. The first sub-section presents the general statistics of the primary
    studies, and the following sub-sections discuss the results corresponding to the

    questions analysis The ultimate goal of our study is intelligent irrigation management.
    We have tried through the research questions to build up a holistic idea of almost
    all the characteristics of a field and how they affect and interact with plantations
    to ensure efficient irrigation planning. Our research questions are progressive,
    the answer to one question generates another. In this section, we will attempt
    to answer these questions by analyzing and criticizing previous works. 4.2.1.
    RQ-1: What new technologies are being used to estimate and predict the ETo climate
    parameter? The total amount of water lost through evaporation per unit area of
    soil where crops are grown is known as reference crop evapotranspiration (Hunasigi
    et al., 2023). ETo is a complex and non-linear parameter that is therefore difficult
    to measure and is influenced by several meteorological factors, which, combined
    together, affect the soil evaporation process. ETo is generally evaluated by means
    of empirical and semi-empirical equations in which temperature, wind speed and
    humidity are forming some of the key climatological data that provide the energy
    required for evaporation and remove water vapour from the evaporating surface
    (Anderson and French, 2019). Fig. 5 shows some of the meteorological factors that
    influence the value of the ETo parameter. Download : Download high-res image (131KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Meteorological factors influencing
    the ETo parameter. The development of new technologies has greatly helped researchers
    to move from assessment to estimation and prediction of this coefficient by combining
    empirical equations in artificial intelligence algorithms to make short and long-term
    predictions of ETo in order to fully understand this phenomenon in the field and
    therefore manage the resources needed to make up for soil evaporation losses.
    (Lu et al., 2023) proposed a hybrid prediction model based on signal processing
    methods combined with the propagation neural network (BPNN) model to increase
    the reliability of ETo time series estimation. The study achieved very good estimation
    results for a period of up to seven days, but after that, the model''s performance
    began to degrade. To improve the study, an analysis of the contribution rate of
    various meteorological factors can be included, as used by (L. Zhao et al., 2022)
    who relied on the KNN algorithm to extract the contribution rate of meteorological
    factors and use those with a high contribution rate as inputs to the Elman forecast
    model which has been optimized by optimization algorithms. The proposed model
    presented high accuracies only in regions where temperature factors change relatively
    little throughout the year, a feature that does not affect model calculations.
    We can conclude that another algorithm other than Elman should be chosen for other
    regions with considerable variations in input factors in order to improve ETo''s
    daily prediction study. Another method of determining the meteorological factors
    that have a major influence on a study area is to make a comparison between empirical
    equations for calculating ETo as used by (Wu et al., 2022) who, after dividing
    China into four climate classes, made a comparison between twelve empirical equations
    to find the most accurate equation for use with machine learning algorithms to
    predict ETo.The results showed that the Penman model presented the best estimate
    of ETo across China.(Sharafi et al., 2023) made a comparison between three empirical
    equations; BARO, JEHA and Penman in Iran. The results showed that machine learning
    models based on the combination of input variables from the three equations obtained
    the best accuracies, especially in semi-arid climates. One recommendation suggested
    by the authors consists in using relative humidity as a crucial parameter in ETo
    prediction for humid regions. The aim of the articles discussed above was to estimate
    ETo on a daily basis. (Di Nunno and Granata, 2023) took a different approach to
    predict long-term ETo in areas of Italy. They relied on historical climate parameters
    (Tmax and Tmin) taken from historical CORDEX data, and future ones based on two
    future scenarios of greenhouse gas concentration trajectories combined with machine
    learning algorithms for long-term ETo prediction taking into account the impact
    of climate change. Since the study was based solely on historical and future temperatures
    and extraterrestrial radiation Ra, it can be very useful in identifying the most
    sensitive areas in terms of potential water deficit in the future rather than
    estimating ETo. In addition, the use of data from weather stations near the study
    area could have resulted in more reliable climatic variables. Table 8 gives more
    details of the systems studied. Table 8. Studies using new technologies to estimate
    and predict ETo climate parameter. Main function Study area Technologies used

    of northern China Propagation neural network model (BPNN) The estimation results
    were very good for a period of up to seven days, but after that, the model''s
    performance began to degrade. The proposed model was unreliable at weather stations
    where minimum temperatures were lower than at other stations. (Lu et al., 2023)
    Machine learning algorithms The Catboost model outperformed other models in ETo
    predictions with the same input data. Further study should consider evaluating
    model performance using ETo experimental data as targets. (Y. Zhang et al., 2020)
    different climates in China -KNN algorithm -Elman algorithm -Optimization algorithms
    The study revealed that each model has the highest accuracy with the combination
    of surface radiation input (Rs) and temperature (T) input. The proposed models
    did not respond in the same way in terms of accuracy in all the study regions.
    (L. Zhao et al., 2022) -Extreme learning machine algorithm -Whale optimization
    algorithm (WOA) The results showed that the optimized empirical Penman model presented
    the best estimate of ETo across China. Other machine learning algorithms need
    to be tested to compare their performance with the one used in this research.
    (Wu et al., 2022) different climates in Iran Machine learning algorithms The best
    accuracies were obtained especially in semi-arid climates. Most models were wrong
    in estimating daily ETo in hyper-arid and humid climates, due to the great complexity
    of the evaporation process. (Sharafi et al., 2023) different climates in Iran
    - Machine learning algorithms -Optimization algorithms The proposed hybrid model
    was able to estimate ETo values for the whole of Iran using the simplest climate
    variables, that is, temperature and wind speed. The model''s performance needs
    to be tested under conditions of climate change to improve results. (Maroufpoor
    et al., 2020) Short, medium and long-term prediction of ETo different climates
    in China -Extreme learning machine algorithm - Optimization algorithms The proposed
    hybrid model made it possible to accurately estimate ETo on different time scales
    and with limited input data. ETo''s predictions for areas with climatic complexities
    were not good. (Gong et al., 2021) Long-term prediction of ETo Coastal and inland
    areas in Italy Machine learning algorithms The established solution enabled a
    complete analysis and assessment of reference evapotranspiration trends. The study
    was based on a small number of variables, which made it necessary to take other
    parameters into account. (Di Nunno and Granata, 2023) We can conclude from all
    these articles that, to date, there is no universal model for estimating ETo and
    therefore the effect of soil evaporation in different areas having the same climate.
    Models need to be developed for each region of the world, indicating the best
    input parameters and the best artificial intelligence model to use to accurately
    predict ETo. RQ1.1: Does a good prediction of this coefficient guarantee good
    irrigation scheduling? In other words, is irrigation intensification always the
    optimal solution to compensate for the effect of soil evaporation, or do we need
    to think differently? Some climatic changes such as the increase in atmospheric
    CO2 concentration and temperature accelerate water loss through evaporation. The
    most obvious and simple solution to compensate for these losses is to increase
    irrigation intensity, but this is not always the most optimal solution. (Becker
    et al., 2023) conducted a research study in a heat-stressed region to see how
    the yield of certain crop types varied with increasing temperature. They found
    that the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere of the study region had a positive
    effect on the yield of certain crop types, and so heat stress in this case led
    to a reduction in water demand. Nevertheless, these results could be different
    in the case of constantly rising temperatures. Another study carried out by (Karimzadeh
    Soureshjani et al., 2019) that addressed the existing relation between crop yield
    and temperature conditions came to the following result: management practices
    such as adjusting planting date can be applied by knowing the critical crop periods
    during which these crops are most vulnerable to climate change conditions. According
    to these results, the irrigation scheduling is not only dependent on climatic
    changes due to weather conditions, but also on the biophysical responses of crops
    summarized in the crop coefficient Kc, which in turn is affected by several factors
    that are the physical, chemical, biological and hydrological characteristics of
    the soil. RQ2: What factors have a significant influence on the crop coefficient
    Kc as mentionned in FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper? The value of the Kc coefficient
    varies considerably according to a number of factors including crop-specific factors
    such as crop type, season and growth stage, etc., soil-related factors such as
    the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil, and agricultural
    practices. For precise and real-time irrigation management purposes, the Kc coefficient
    is driven by two coefficients, a base crop coefficient Kcb which describes the
    plant transpiration process and a soil water evaporation coefficient Ke (Anderson
    and French, 2019). In the next part of this article, we''ll try to shed light
    on the factors we believe have the greatest influence on determining the Kc coefficient.
    We will discuss and analyze new researches that use Internet of Things and Artificial
    Intelligence technologies for the detection and prediction of each factor. RQ2.1:
    What effect do soil physical properties have on agricultural management in general?
    What new technologies are being used in this field of research? Texture is a physical
    soil property quantified by the relative proportions of sand, clay and silt particles.
    It is these proportions that primarily indicate the physical quality of the soil
    in terms of hydraulic conductivity and water storage capacity, so determining
    soil texture is of paramount importance for planting and irrigation management
    purposes (Kurtulmuş et al., 2022). (Inazumi et al., 2020) used a smartphone to
    capture images under different lighting conditions and soil surface appearances
    with the aim of identifying three soil types using a neural network model. The
    solution discussed allowed the identification of all the sand images, whereas
    the results were not good for the other soil types as they required adjustment
    of the learning parameters which was not easy for the authors to do given the
    limited performance of the equipment used. This study could be improved in this
    direction, and even for sandy soil detection by taking into account other conditions
    such as soil moisture. The detection and classification of four clay soil types
    was the main focus of (J. and T., 2023) who captured images with a smartphone
    during all seasons and at different altitudes in every hectare of the study area
    to appropriately predict soil color characteristics. The proposed multi-stack
    ensemble model achieved very good results in terms of accuracy and precision.
    (Al-Naji et al., 2021) took images of a set of silty soil samples at different
    times and light levels, via a video camera placed at different distances, to analyze
    it using a back propagation neural network for irrigation need prediction purposes.
    The proposed solution achieved ideal results. However, the system focused on a
    particular soil type and should be extended to other soil types. This was the
    aim of the study carried out by (Kurtulmuş et al., 2022) who relied on deep learning
    algorithms to distinguish between three classes of soil texture under different
    illumination and hydration conditions for irrigation scheduling. This work, considered
    to be the first work that used deep learning for texture-water class identification,
    can be improved by taking real-time image samples containing green plants with
    a wider range of conditions. Table 9 gives more details of the systems studied.

    Neural Network model The proposed solution produced ideal results, as demonstrated
    by a coefficient of determination R²=1. The system has focused on one particular

    planning by distinguishing between three classes of soil texture: clay, silt and
    sandy silt Deep learning algorithms The proposed model led to very satisfactory
    results in terms of accuracy despite the fact that it was not the best in terms
    of detection speed. This work can be improved by taking real-time image samples
    containing green plants with a wider range of conditions. (Kurtulmuş et al., 2022)
    We can conclude that soil texture is an essential factor in precision agriculture.
    Researches aimed at identifying and classifying soil textures can be exploited
    in plantation management by choosing the type of crop that will give the best
    yield according to the physical properties of the field under study, as well as
    for irrigation planning and management purposes, since soil color can give an
    idea of the soil''s hydric properties. If we could come up with a model that encompasses
    all soil textures for crop management and irrigation purposes, then we could say
    that this model is the leader for this factor. Future works can be directed towards
    the creation of a model based on Artificial Intelligence and on Internet of Things
    technologies, that encompasses the totality of soil textures for crop management
    purposes and combines physical factors with soil chemical and biological factors
    for precise irrigation planning. RQ2.2: What effect do soil chemical properties
    have on agricultural management in general? What new technologies are being used
    in this field of research? Soil chemical properties are just as important as soil
    physical properties. Monitoring soil nutrient levels, cation exchange capacity
    and soil organic matter is of great importance as changes in these parameters
    directly influence crop coefficient and therefore yield (López-Arredondo et al.,
    2017). Fig. 6 shows the role of macronutrients, organic matter, cations and soil
    bacteria on plant development and growth. Download : Download high-res image (182KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. The role of macronutrients in crop
    growth (López-Arredondo et al., 2017). Many studies have exploited new technologies
    to predict soil chemical properties. The research conducted by (Andrade et al.,
    2020) illustrates this. They used soil characteristic data acquired by portable
    X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF) to train machine learning algorithms to
    predict: total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity and soil organic matter. In
    general, the model results were acceptable. The samples taken concerned Eucalyptus
    plantations, so the model can be developed and improved by taking other: crop
    types, soil variabilities and environmental conditions. (Srisomkiew et al., 2021)
    created digital soil maps to assess soil nutrient levels for the main reason of
    improving rice yield in the study area. The model developed in the study is MLR,
    which included soil data, terrain variables from a digital elevation model and
    satellite images collected under specific conditions to identify the most important
    spectral indices for prediction. Table 10 gives details of the systems studied.
    Table 10. Studies using new technologies to predict soil chemical properties.
    Target Technologies used Results Limitations Citation Prediction of total nitrogen,
    cation exchange capacity and soil organic matter -Portable X-ray fluorescence
    spectrometry (pXRF) -Machine learning algorithms In general, the model results
    were acceptable as this study is one of the few conducted on soil types under
    tropical conditions. The proposed model was influenced by the highly dynamic behavior
    in the soil environment of the input variables caused by soil management. (Andrade
    et al., 2020) Assessment of soil nutrient levels -MLR model -Digital elevation
    model -Satellite images The digital maps generated made it possible to accurately
    assess various soil properties. Some characteristics failed the test due to the
    timing of sampling which took place during a dry season. (Srisomkiew et al., 2021)
    Predicting the ion composition of soil samples to avoid soil salinity Machine
    learning models The model proposed with the input combination of soil temperature,
    soil water content and electrical conductivity was able to predict all soil salinity
    parameters with better accuracy, stability and generalizability than other models.
    Model generalization and stability become poor with multiple input parameters.
    (Xiao et al., 2023) Monitoring and predicting soil chemical properties also helps
    prevent major soil problems such as soil salinization. If soil salinity parameters
    exceed a certain level, plants will find it difficult to absorb water and nutrients
    and the evapotranspiration process may even stop. Predicting soil salinity to
    guide planting and irrigation was the main reason for the research conducted by
    (Xiao et al., 2023). They evaluated the performance of machine learning models
    to predict the ion composition of soil samples in an arid region of China. The
    results showed that the greater the number of input parameters the higher the
    accuracy of the model, but on the other hand, the lower the generalization capacity
    and stability. This study sees prospects in combining Internet of Things technologies
    with Artificial Intelligence algorithms for a more efficient and cheaper saline-soil
    monitoring. Soil organic matter is a key factor determining variation in soil
    mechanical and hydrological properties (Hatanaka et al., 2022, Lin et al., 2022).
    (Lin et al., 2022) found that the improvement of soil mechanical properties (degree
    of compaction) is linked to the preservation or increase in soil organic matter
    content, while (Hatanaka et al., 2022) found that the alleviation of soil water
    deficit is linked to the accumulation of soil organic matter which contributes
    to moist, heavy metal-poor and nutrient-rich conditions. We can conclude that
    the evapotranspiration process is also linked to the chemical properties of the
    soil. Maintaining a suitable level of these properties, according to agricultural
    needs, helps to increase yields by avoiding, on the one hand, problems linked
    to soil salinity and, on the other, mechanical and hydrological soil problems.
    RQ2.3: What are the soil''s hydrological properties to be taken into account when
    managing irrigation? Accurate real-time irrigation scheduling requires the use
    of the dual crop coefficient approach Kc=Kcb+Ke, where Ke is the soil evaporation
    coefficient. Estimation of Ke requires daily monitoring and calculation of soil
    water content in the upper arable layer (Anderson and French, 2019), hence the
    need to monitor soil moisture levels for irrigation management purposes. RQ2.3.1:
    What new technologies are being used to estimate soil moisture? (Chandrappa et
    al., 2023) used Internet of Things technologies presented by soil moisture sensors
    installed at different depths decided according to the depth of plant roots in
    the study site and installed at different zones in terms of water retention capacity
    of the study area in order to predict soil moisture. In addition to prediction,
    another aim of the study was to understand the relation between soil moisture
    and seasonal variation in meteorological data. The results showed a strong correlation
    between seasonally grouped input parameters and non-seasonal ones. Combining remote
    sensing and Internet of Things technologies to simulate soil moisture distribution
    was one of the authors'' proposals for improving the study. Integrating remote
    sensing data may also be helpful to overcome the problems of sensor data quality
    such as noise, errors and data discontinuity due to equipment failure or network
    problems (Abowarda et al., 2021). The study conducted by (Togneri et al., 2022)
    could have achieved more accurate and precise results if it had included real-time
    remote sensing data on crop phenology such as leaf area index (LAI) and normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), and not relied on traditional statistically
    defined coefficients to predict maximum and minimum next-days soil moisture values
    for reasons of monitoring the risk of extreme values. Table 11 gives details of
    the systems studied. Table 11. Studies using new technologies for soil moisture
    prediction. Target Technologies used Results Limitations Citation Seasonal soil
    moisture prediction -Soil moisture sensors -Machine learning and deep learning
    algorithms The algorithms performed differently from season to season. Each season
    had a specific algorithm that performed better than the others. Simulation of
    soil moisture distribution must be included in the study to determine the optimum
    location for sensors. (Chandrappa et al., 2023) Daily prediction of maximum and
    minimum soil moisture values -Soil moisture sensors -Machine learning algorithms
    The results showed that the LightGBM algorithm performed best in terms of accuracy
    and stability. Maximum humidity is difficult to predict due to uncertainties linked
    to input parameters. (Togneri et al., 2022) Continuous spatio-temporal prediction
    of soil moisture in the root zone -ConvLSTM model -Remote sensing data -Hydrus-1D
    physical model The results of the model estimation, especially for deep layers,
    have increased significantly compared to the products of the GLDAS global system.
    The study showed that there is a high correlation between groundwater level and
    soil moisture, but due to the lack of information, this level was not taken as
    a predictor variable in the ConvLSTM model. (A et al., 2022) Short- and long-term
    soil moisture prediction Multi-head LSTM model The model produced highly accurate
    results, with a coefficient of determination R²=95.04% for future predictions.
    The model can be enhanced by adding other physical attributes as input data. (Datta
    and Faroughi, 2022) Remote sensing-based variables such as normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) and vertical spatiotemporal soil moisture data from the
    Hydrus-1D physical model were used by (A et al., 2022) as input variables to the
    ConvLSTM model for continuous spatiotemporal prediction of root zone soil moisture
    with good large-scale accuracy. Hourly, daily, weekly and even monthly soil moisture
    prediction was the objective of the study carried out by (Datta and Faroughi,
    2022). They trained a multi-headed LSTM model with past soil moisture time series
    to estimate its future values. The proposed model was very efficient and can be
    improved by adding other physical attributes as input data. In hydrology, estimating
    soil moisture is paramount as a key regulating element in understanding groundwater
    conditions (Masrur Ahmed et al., 2021). The relation between groundwater and soil
    moisture was discussed by (A et al., 2022), they showed that there is a strong
    correlation between groundwater level and soil moisture. The recharge and support
    functions between soil moisture and groundwater depend on the depth of the groundwater.
    RQ2.3.2: What is the effect of groundwater on crop growth, and how can we exploit
    new technologies to estimate and predict groundwater levels? We can''t talk about
    agriculture without water resources, and among these resources, groundwater is
    of great importance in the agricultural sector. For example, the water balance
    of the root zone is modified by shallow groundwater, which has a more complex
    impact on crop growth and production (Chen et al., 2022). (M. Han et al., 2015)
    found that groundwater level has a significant impact on crop growth in the study
    area as well as on various aspects of soil water balance. Cotton growth was influenced
    by groundwater levels at various locations, both favourably and unfavourably.
    Capillary rise in the water table is also strongly influenced by cotton growth.
    Consequently, groundwater is a vital element that needs to be taken into account
    in agricultural management. Groundwater level prediction is also used for irrigation
    planning purposes and to prevent overexploitation and depletion of underground
    water resources. Several studies have taken advantage of new technologies to predict
    groundwater levels for irrigation management purposes. (Sheikh Khozani et al.,
    2022) have used a hybrid model that combines the ARIMA statistical model, the
    LSTM algorithm and optimization algorithms to capture the non-linear and linear
    components of a groundwater level time series for groundwater index prediction
    purposes over periods ranging from three to nine months without the use of climatic
    data. The proposed model is very useful in situations where modellers do not have
    access to meteorological data, but despite this valuable contribution, according
    to the authors, the model can be developed and improved either by integrating
    meteorological parameters to better understand the relation between these parameters
    and groundwater, or by relying on future scenarios for simulating meteorological
    parameters in the context of climate change and using other Artificial Intelligence
    algorithms coupled to the ARIMA model. (Gharehbaghi et al., 2022) used, in addition
    to observed hydrological and groundwater depth data, regional meteorological data
    to predict groundwater levels in different arid and semi-arid agricultural zones
    in Iran. The final model proposed, entitled GRU2+, was deemed innovative and unique.
    Despite all this, the proposed model has certain limitations as it requires continuous
    measurements of the various inputs in addition to the difficulty of prediction,
    since groundwater level is a non-stationary, complex and inconsistent phenomenon.
    The regional study conducted by (Cai et al., 2021) had two main objectives. The
    first objective was the prediction of groundwater levels using the GRU neural
    network, and the second objective was to study the impact of regional characteristics
    on improving prediction accuracy. The proposed model performed better in regions
    with climatic, geological and topographical features that favor more effective
    groundwater responses to dynamic external changes than in other regions where
    results were worse. This drawback could have been overcome if physical constraints
    had been included in the algorithms used to interpret the physical significance
    and hence generality of the model. The approach adopted by (Cai et al., 2022)
    addressed this need by integrating groundwater-related water balance equations
    as physical constraints in pure and hybrid deep learning architectures. Despite
    all the efforts made, the black-box nature of the proposed hybrid model is still
    not revealed due to the lack of detailed geographical information, insufficient
    hydrometeorological data and historical observations, and tedious manual adjustment
    of the learning parameters. The model therefore still needs to be improved to
    ensure its universality. Table 12 gives more details of the systems studied. Table
    12. Studies using new technologies to predict groundwater levels. Target Technologies
    used Results Limitations Citation Prediction of groundwater level index -LSTM
    algorithm -ARIMA statistical model -Optimization algorithms The model was able
    to provide accurate forecasts for current periods, while accuracy decreased with
    increasing forecast horizon. The model can be expanded to include meteorological
    parameters to better understand the relation between these parameters and groundwater.
    (Sheikh Khozani et al., 2022) Groundwater level prediction in different arid and
    semi-arid agricultural areas in Iran GRU-based neural network models The model
    demonstrated its superiority over other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of
    accuracy, simplicity and efficiency of long-term groundwater level prediction.
    The proposed model has certain limitations as it requires continuous measurements
    of the various inputs, in addition to the difficulty of prediction due to the
    fact that groundwater levels are a non-stationary phenomenon. (Gharehbaghi et
    al., 2022) Groundwater level prediction and study of the impact of regional characteristics
    on improving prediction accuracy GRU neural network The proposed model performed
    better in regions with characteristics that favor more effective groundwater responses
    to dynamic external changes. The model performance depended on the characteristics
    of the study area. (Cai et al., 2021) Pure and hybrid deep learning architectures
    The results showed the superiority of the proposed hybrid model over pure deep
    learning models, making the model more accurate and interpretable. The black-box
    nature of the proposed hybrid model has yet to be revealed. (Cai et al., 2022)
    Groundwater quality for irrigation purposes is another area of study. In addition
    to the existence of groundwater, the quality of this water for irrigation purposes
    needs to be ascertained. (Liu et al., 2022) found that human activities affect
    the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater. The increase in some chemical
    characteristics has reduced vegetation growth and limited plant cover, and worse
    than that, posed risks to human health. (Bennett, 2023) assessed the quality of
    groundwater used for irrigation in Tanzania. They found that the majority of groundwater
    in the study area is classified as poor to unsuitable for irrigation, so treatment
    is essential before use in irrigation to avoid low yields. The use of a tolerable
    rate of fertilizer in order to minimize the concentration of chemical components
    unsuitable for vegetation growth in the study area, is one of the solutions proposed.
    RQ2.3.3: What is the effect of hydraulic conductivity on irrigation scheduling,
    and how can we exploit new technologies to estimate and predict hydraulic conductivity?
    Saturated hydraulic conductivity and unsaturated hydraulique conductivity are
    other important parameters in irrigation scheduling. They are used to characterize
    many aspects of soil water flow such as infiltration, water balance, nutrient
    migration, irrigation and drainage system design and monitoring (D’Emilio et al.,
    2018). Direct measurements cannot easily deduce these parameters under natural
    conditions, whatever the scale of interest (Rezaei et al., 2021) as they present
    a high degree of spatial heterogeneity (Fu et al., 2021). (Tian et al., 2018)
    have attempted, through the use of thermal pulse sensors and a simple water balance
    approach, to continuously estimate the fine depth-scale dynamics of unsaturated
    hydraulic conductivity under field conditions. Although this method has shown
    promising results, it has only been tested in a sandy loam soil and under simple
    meteorological conditions, hence the need for more in-depth studies under other
    field conditions, which is difficult due to the financial and practical constraints
    associated with routine hydraulic conductivity measurement. Pedotransfer functions
    (PTFs) are indirect methods for estimating hydraulic conductivity from other easily
    measurable soil properties such as organic carbon, ph, hydraulic conductivity,
    etc. (Vereecken et al., 2010). (Mozaffari et al., 2022) made a comparison between
    visible-near-infrared spectroscopy with classical regression pedotransfer functions
    for the prediction of saturated and quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity of
    calcareous soils. The results showed that the PTFs developed are more accurate
    in terms of hydraulic conductivity prediction. This better performance of PTFs
    can be linked to the use of different attributes such as soil structure properties
    and particle size distribution parameters. The use of machine learning algorithms
    has become frequent in the development of TFPs. (Veloso et al., 2022) evaluated
    the performance of four machine learning algorithms in predicting saturated soil
    hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture PTFs at specific stresses in the Brazilian
    savannah. The results showed that regression trees were the best for predicting
    saturated hydraulic conductivity. (Albalasmeh et al., 2022) showed that the generalized
    regression neural network (GRNN) provided reliable predictions of saturated hydraulic
    conductivity in arid and semi-arid environments. (H. Kashani et al., 2020) developed
    and tested a hybrid model based on artificial neural networks to improve the accuracy
    of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity prediction in an arid region of Iran.(Aguilera
    et al., 2022) have exploited the advantages of artificial neural networks to develop
    a new methodology for mapping saturated hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil
    of their study area, based on quick and inexpensive auxiliary data.(Rezaei et
    al., 2023) have used remote sensing and field measured data for appropriate saturated
    hydraulic conductivity prediction and mapping in a sandy agricultural environment
    using machine learning algorithms based on trees. Table 13 gives more details
    of the systems studied. Table 13. Studies using new technologies to predict saturated
    hydraulic conductivity. Target Technologies used Results Limitations Citation
    Assessing the performance of machine learning algorithms in predicting saturated
    soil hydraulic conductivity Ks -Machine learning algorithms Algorithms based on
    regression trees obtained better results for Ks prediction. In addition, the predictor
    set with soil texture, structure and moisture variables showed the best results
    compared to the other predictor sets. The models overestimate low Ks values, while
    the property is underestimated at higher Ks values. This can be attributed to
    the high spatial variability of Ks and the relatively small number of samples
    used in this study. (Veloso et al., 2022) Evaluate the potential use of a generalized
    regression neural network to identify the optimal set of soil characteristics
    for predicting Ks in arid and semi-arid environments. Generalized regression neural
    network (GRNN) Soil texture parameters and electrical conductivity improved Ks
    prediction capability. In addition, the GRNN model provided reliable predictions
    of Ks. The predictive accuracy of Ks in sandy soils was not good due to the small
    sample size of this particular class. (Albalasmeh et al., 2022) Develop and test
    a hybrid intelligent model based on a multiple model strategy (MM-ANN) for soil
    Ks estimation. -Machine learning algorithms The results showed that the proposed
    model serves as an effective pedotransfer function for predicting soil Ks using
    readily available soil parameters as input variables. There were relatively high
    model estimation errors in the western part of the study area. (H. Kashani et
    al., 2020) Develop a new methodology for mapping topsoil Ks based on rapid and
    inexpensive auxiliary data. Artificial neural networks (ANN) The proposed model
    is robust and outperforms all the reference PTFs tested, and the methodology presented
    provides an inexpensive representation of the Ks distribution. The under-performance
    of the model is due to the anthropization of soils, hence the need to further
    improve the model by including other terrain attributes and spectral data. (Aguilera
    et al., 2022) Exploit remote sensing data with limited soil data and tree-based
    machine learning models to predict soil Ks. -Tree-based machine learning algorithms.
    - remote sensing The results of the RF model are robust and can therefore be applied
    to Ks mapping. The model led to slight overestimates and underestimates of Ks.
    (Rezaei et al., 2023) The difficulty in predicting hydraulic conductivity is due
    to the fact that the soil properties that affect this parameter depend on the
    spatial scale (Fu et al., 2021). (W. Zhao et al., 2023) have shown that the predictive
    accuracy of saturated hydraulic conductivity PTFs is affected when the sample
    size is too small to cover the study area, leading to seriously biased estimates
    if the assumed relationship does not verify in the region of extrapolation, so
    they concluded that there is still a lack of saturated hydraulic conductivity
    prediction models universally applicable to different regions that have nearly
    the same characteristics. RQ3: What is the effect of non-standard elements such
    as weeds and plant diseases on crop development and yield? Another factor affecting
    the evapotranspiration process is the presence of pests and weeds. Functions essential
    to crop development such as photosynthesis and water and nutrient uptake are disrupted
    and limited in the presence of weeds and pathogens (Gao et al., 2021), sometimes
    leading to catastrophic yields. Pest and weed detection is a highly advanced field
    that has benefited from the development of algorithms especially those of deep
    learning for the detection and classification of plant pests and diseases. Despite
    technological advances, this field still has certain shortcomings, which we will
    discuss below. RQ3.1: What new technologies are being used to manage weeds? Uncontrolled
    weeds can adversely affect the soil evaporation process. The use of herbicides
    is the solution used by farmers to control the spread of weeds. This solution
    can be a double-edged sword if not adopted rationally. Excessive use of herbicides
    can increase weed resistance to them and may even affect soil characteristics
    and food security. The study carried out by (Dang et al., 2023) focused on this
    aspect of precise weed location for rational herbicide application. They attempted
    to compare the performance of seven versions of YOLO object detectors for multi-class
    detection of weeds in the Cotton crop in real time. The robustness of the models
    can be improved by including more representative training data and optimized training
    strategies, as well as by testing other YOLO models. Table 14 gives more details
    of the systems studied. Table 14. Studies using new technologies to manage weeds
    and plant diseases. Main function Sub area of study Technologies used Crop type
    and cultivation environment Results Citation Weed management Real-time weed location
    -7 versions of YOLO object detectors -Digital and Smartphones cameras Cotton arable
    fields. The models offered differed in terms of precision, speed and complexity
    but in general, all versions offered great performance. (Dang et al., 2023) Weed
    location and detection in predictable and unpredictable scenarios -YOLOv3 detection
    model -Industrial cameras Arable fields of sugar beet and potatoes. The proposed
    model considerably reduced the generalization error, but the change in the type
    of camera used and the noise caused by fallen tree leaves affected the model''s
    performance. (Ruigrok et al., 2023) Weed seed detection -6 CNN models -Industrial
    image acquisition system 140 weed species collected from the wild and processed
    in an industrial environment. The performance of the models differed in terms
    of accuracy, cost and speed, and the choice of the best model depended on the
    specific requirements of use. In general, the best detection accuracies were linked
    to seeds with clear shape characteristics. (Luo et al., 2023) Plant disease management
    Real-time detection of plant diseases using a mobile application -Simplified model
    of MobileNetV2 architecture -Digital and Smartphones cameras -Images of apple
    tree leaves from an orchard. -Images of tomato, citrus and apple leaves from data
    available on the internet. The proposed lightweight deep learning model showed
    high detection accuracy with less computational resource requirements. Since the
    proposed model requires only a small amount of storage space, several models can
    be integrated into the same application. (Janarthan et al., 2022) Detection and
    classification of diseased leaves according to disease level and severity. -Image
    segmentation algorithms -DL model based on Kohonen network and INC-VGGN architecture
    Images of various crop types acquired from the Plant Village and Plant Doc databases.
    The results of the proposed model were better in terms of sensitivity, specificity
    and accuracy. (Pal and Kumar, 2023) Detecting the type and the degree of a plant
    disease -Transformer based models -RGB camera -Real-time images of cucumber plants
    and banana leaves. -Images of potato and tomato disease leaves from controlled
    environments. The results showed that the proposed model is robust, able to determine
    with high accuracy the type of diseases and their degree in complex contexts containing
    several noise sources and in stable contexts. (Guo et al., 2022) Classification
    of the type and severity of plant diseases simultaneously and separately Model
    based on a three-branch Swim transformer classification network 31,718 disease
    images acquired from the AI Challenger 2018 dataset. The proposed model performs
    very well in disease classification with an accuracy of 99%, while for severity
    classification, the accuracy is 88.73%. (Yang et al., 2023) Developing a general
    location and detection model that can be used in all predictable and unpredictable
    field scenarios is another hot topic. (Ruigrok et al., 2023) have tried, through
    the use of the YOLOv3 detection model, to study the effect of increasing the number
    of training images as well as their quality on the generalization of the weed
    detection model in order to decrease the error caused by generalization. They
    found that the addition of new image samples covering new variations led to an
    improvement in generalization, whereas the simple addition of images brought no
    added value in terms of generalization. Detection between the seeds of several
    weed species and crop seeds is the objective of the study conducted by (Luo et
    al., 2023). They proposed a system for detecting and classifying 140 weed species
    using sensors and deep learning algorithms trained on image samples containing
    several phenotypic characteristics of the seeds. Expanding the dataset is a proposal
    for improving this study. RQ3.2: What new technologies are being used to manage
    plant diseases? Accurate and rapid identification of plant diseases is a necessity
    in the agricultural sector. (Janarthan et al., 2022) have proposed a mobile application
    for the detection of diseases in different types of crops, the mobile application
    proposed does not require internet connectivity to operate. The generality of
    the application can be ensured by integrating active learning and incremental
    learning to classify unknown diseases, this is the first perspective of the study,
    the second perspective is to ensure the interpretation of results and recommend
    solutions to farmers. Taking measures according to the severity of diseased plants
    is a solution that limits the excessive use of pesticides. (Pal and Kumar, 2023)
    have proposed a model that ensures the detection and classification of diseased
    leaves according to disease severity level. Future work in this area will focus
    on: detecting multiple diseases in an image, knowing in addition to disease severity
    the stage of the disease in order to take suitable actions and using other samples
    from real-life scenarios. (Guo et al., 2022) used data acquired under natural
    and controlled environmental conditions to detect the type and the degree of a
    disease. Complexity and large size are the two drawbacks of the model, and these
    drawbacks increase both: the memory and the hardware requirements of the proposed
    model. Improvements need to be made in this area. (Yang et al., 2023) have proposed
    a model that enables the classification of disease type and severity simultaneously
    and separately. The model can be improved and generalized by taking a larger dataset
    and using it on mobile applications. So, we can conclude that pest and weed management
    is of great importance. The spread of weeds and pathogens simultaneously affects
    both evaporation and transpiration processes, leading to low yields. RQ4: Do the
    farming practices adopted in a field affect the crop coefficient, and if so, how
    does this manifest itself? The appearance of weeds can be caused by agricultural
    practices that are sometimes not adapted to the agro-system. (Souza et al., 2020)
    studied the effect of two irrigation systems on weed establishment and crop yield
    in the study area. They found that the mode of application and the quantity of
    water, directly affect weed dynamics, and these disturbances affect yield and
    the effectiveness of irrigation practices. It is therefore necessary to choose
    the appropriate irrigation method (micro-sprinkler, drip, etc.), according to
    the crop''s water requirements, and to ensure that it is placed in an optimal
    location (Sawadogo et al., 2023). Crop water requirements also differ according
    to the type of crop and more specifically, its growth stage. Crops generally pass
    through four growth stages: initial stage, crop development stage, mid-season
    stage and end-of-season stage (Anderson and French, 2019). Each growth stage has
    its own irrigation requirements, which is why Kc crop coefficient values change
    from one stage to the next. Precise estimation of the Kc coefficient for each
    crop type according to these growth stages, for irrigation planning purposes,
    remains a difficult operation up to now since several factors, as discussed earlier,
    enter into and affect the crop evapotranspiration process. Few studies have attempted
    to estimate the crop coefficient Kc using new technologies. (Shao et al., 2021)
    used the leaf area index (LAI) and six multi-spectral vegetation indices extracted
    from images acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to train them in machine
    learning algorithms for field-scale estimation of the Kc value of the maize crop.
    The proposed model had a coefficient of determination R²=0.65. The study by (Shao
    et al., 2023) is an improvement of the previous study, they added four other multi-spectral
    vegetation indices and also took water stress into consideration. The results
    showed a coefficient of determination R²=0.65. Further improvement is therefore
    required by including other factors and other crop types. A good understanding
    of the characteristics of agricultural zones enables farmers to adapt the most
    suitable cultivation practices to their needs, resulting in excellent yields while
    optimizing water use.(W. Zhang et al., 2022) analyzed and evaluated the effect
    of combining mulching and drip irrigation on crop yields. The use of mulch in
    the study area produced good results in terms of crop yield and water use efficiency
    compared with areas where mulch was not included. The choice of the type of mulch
    to be applied depends on the climatic, crop and hydrological characteristics of
    the study area. 5. Discussion The dual crop coefficient method is widely used
    for irrigation scheduling (Anderson and French, 2019). Estimating and forecasting
    the parameters involved in the calculation of this method has so far proved difficult
    despite all the technological advances we are currently experiencing (Shao et
    al., 2021, Shao et al., 2023). The first question of our research was about the
    climate parameter ETo, its importance and the new technologies used for the estimation
    and prediction of this coefficient. We concluded that the models proposed in this
    direction are not global in character, and therefore more extensive studies need
    to be carried out. Models need to be developed for each region of the world, indicating
    the best input parameters and the best artificial intelligence model to use to
    accurately predict ETo. These results led us to another research question which
    discusses the effect of predicting this parameter on irrigation scheduling while
    shedding light on the solution of irrigation intensification to compensate for
    the effect of climatic parameters on the soil and its feasibility in all cases.
    We found that irrigation intensification is not always the optimal solution, sometimes
    other agricultural practices such as adjusting planting date by knowing the critical
    crop periods during which these crops are most vulnerable to climate change conditions
    are more suitable and give more efficient results than irrigation intensification
    (Karimzadeh Soureshjani et al., 2019). At this point we came to the conclusion
    that it is important to study, in addition to meteorological effects, the biophysical
    responses of crops for good irrigation management. The biophysical responses of
    crops are summarized in the crop coefficient Kc which in turn changes according
    to several factors leading to the second research question which discusses the
    factors that influence the Kc coefficient. Soil physical, chemical and hydrological
    properties are assumed to be the key factors directly affecting crop growth (Anderson
    and French, 2019). The first subquestion in this path was about soil texture and
    its role in agricultural management in general, and about the existence of studies
    using new technologies in this field of research. We found that soil texture plays
    a vital role in planting and irrigation management (Kurtulmuş et al., 2022) and
    that researches in this field using new technologies are still in their infancy.
    The proposal of an intelligent model that encompasses the totality of soil textures
    for planting and irrigation management purposes will undoubtedly be of great benefit
    to the agricultural sector. The second subquestion was about soil chemical properties,
    their importance and the new technologies used in this field of study. We found
    that monitoring soil nutrient levels and organic matter is essential for both
    selecting crops that match the chemical properties of the field and managing the
    quantities of nutrients to be applied during the crop development phase (Srisomkiew
    et al., 2021) as well as combating serious problems that negatively affect the
    evapotranspiration process and yield and contaminate the soil (Xiao et al., 2023).
    Models that combine connected object technologies and artificial intelligence
    algorithms to manage the type and timing of planting according to field properties
    and to monitor soil nutrient levels in real time according to various crop types
    remain to be improved. The third subquestion was about the hydrological properties
    of the soil that need to be taken into account when managing irrigation. We discussed
    three hydrological properties: the water-holding capacity of the soil referred
    to in the article as soil moisture, the soil permeability which led us into a
    discussion of groundwater levels and quality and finally the hydraulic conductivity.
    So this question generated three others. The first was about new technologies
    for estimating soil moisture. We found that new technologies are widely used in
    this field of research, but elaborate studies should be carried out to plan irrigation
    needs for each growing season according to all the factors mentioned above. The
    second was about groundwater, its impact on crop growth and the new technologies
    used to estimate and predict groundwater levels and quality. We found that groundwater
    directly feeds the roots of certain plants if it is not deep (Chen et al., 2022;
    M. Han et al., 2015) and that farmers rely heavily on this water for irrigation,
    hence the need to monitor its level for rational planning of water resources over
    the short, medium and long term. The domain of groundwater level monitoring using
    new technologies presents several difficulties due to the non-stationarity and
    complexity of this phenomenon (Gharehbaghi et al., 2022). An accurate model that
    gives correct interpretations in this domain will be very useful and beneficial,
    but this can only be guaranteed with detailed and precise informations about the
    study environment (Cai et al., 2022). Groundwater quality is another area of research.
    Excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides is adversely affecting
    the quality of these waters. In this case, the use of these resources presents
    serious dangers to human health and prevents the proper growth of crops, hence
    the need to check the quality of these waters before use (Bennett, 2023). The
    third was about hydraulic conductivity and the new technologies used to estimate
    saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.The conclusion found by (W. Zhao
    et al., 2023) is that there is still a lack of hydraulic conductivity prediction
    models universally applicable to different regions with the same characteristics
    because this parameter presents a high degree of spatial heterogeneity (Fu et
    al., 2021). The rational use of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides can guarantee
    good water quality for irrigation. This point led us to the third research question
    which in turn led us to two other subquestions all of which discuss the effect
    of non-standard elements such as pests, weeds and plant diseases on crop development
    and yield, and the new technologies used to detect, locate and classify these
    elements with the aim of limiting the use of pesticides and herbicides. We have
    found that deep learning algorithms are being used extensively in this field of
    study for real-time monitoring of weeds, pathogens and degrees of plant diseases
    and their severities, but despite all these advances, there are still avenues
    of research to be explored such as real-time learning of field circumstances (Janarthan
    et al., 2022), interpretation of results and proposal of recommendations for problems
    found according to disease stage, degree and severity (Pal and Kumar, 2023). Sometimes
    inappropriate farming practices can stimulate the appearance of plant pests and
    diseases, hence the final research question which studies the effect of farming
    practices on the crop coefficient. We have found that the right choice of farming
    practices can achieve the desired yield while optimizing the use of natural resources
    (Souza et al., 2020). The profitability of a crop field is closely linked to the
    right strategies adopted in a specific crop plot. The beneficial and favorable
    effect of water on crop income has led us to propose the following approach, modeled
    in Fig. 7, which aims to plan and manage irrigation efficiently. Download : Download
    high-res image (925KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. model of different
    approaches of irrigation through the use of new technologies. Choosing the right
    irrigation strategy is a key link in the agricultural production chain. Our model
    aims to use new Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence technologies to
    understand and manage the various characteristics of the field, i.e. meteorological,
    physical, chemical and hydrological characteristics in order to choose the appropriate
    type of crop in the field of study and then schedule irrigation according to the
    type of crop chosen and the field characteristics studied. The agricultural production
    process does not stop at this point, as control and monitoring of non-standard
    conditions and disruptive elements, as well as the choice of suitable cultivation
    practices, are necessary to achieve the best possible yield from the field under
    study. Fig. 7 shows the different approaches adopted for irrigation and farm management
    in our systematic literature review. For each property studied, we have mentioned
    the data used to arrive at the desired property prediction (green colored part
    in model), the sources from which the data were acquired e.g. IoT technologies,
    weather stations etc, (orange colored part), the artificial intelligence algorithms
    used to predict the output variables (blue colored part), the variable to be predicted
    (gray colored part) and finally the future research directions (red colored part).
    6. Conclusions In this study, we systematically reviewed the scientific literature
    of the last eight years to explore the new Internet of Things and artificial intelligence
    technologies used, on the one hand, to monitor and predict the climatic, physical,
    chemical and hydrological characteristics of a field and, on the other, to detect,
    locate and prevent the biological characteristics of a field. To our knowledge,
    this is the first SLR of its kind, and the first to examine the use of new technologies
    to predict and monitor every field characteristic in order to manage irrigation
    efficiently. Adopting an SLR as a method of answering our main research questions
    has proved to be a very useful choice, and has enabled us to obtain significant
    information that could be useful to both the committee of researchers and the
    stakeholders. We have identified that the profitability of a crop field is closely
    linked to the right strategies adopted in a specific crop plot, and these strategies
    can only be defined after a good understanding of the field''s characteristics.
    For the climatic properties of the field, the ETo parameter was studied. For the
    physical properties of the field, the soil texture classes and their irrigation
    requirements were discussed. For the chemical properties of the soil, the nutrient
    level and soil chemical properties were discussed. For the hydrological properties
    of the soil, soil moisture, hydraulic conductivity and groundwater level and quality
    were studied. For the biological properties, the detection and localization of
    weeds and plant diseases were studied. This sytematic literature review has enabled
    us to develop an intelligent model that brings together the different approaches
    adopted for irrigation scheduling and to pave the way for further research. This
    systematic literature review focuses on the field scale, it can be expanded by
    covering essential irrigation management issues for large-scale irrigation areas
    or large-scale farmland. Finally, we hope that the contributions of this review
    will help anyone interested in the field of irrigation management to form a holistic
    and clear view. CRediT authorship contribution statement Afaf Bounajra: Writing

  description: Fog-native computing is an emerging paradigm that makes it possible
    to build flexible and scalable Internet of Things (IoT) applications using microservice
    architecture at the network edge. With this paradigm, IoT applications are decomposed
    into multiple fine-grained microservices, strategically deployed on various fog
    nodes to support a wide range of IoT scenarios, such as smart cities and smart
    farming. Nonetheless, the performance of these IoT applications is affected by
    their limited effectiveness in processing offloaded IoT requests originating from
    multiple IoT devices. Specifically, the requested IoT services are composed of
    multiple dependent microservice instances collectively referred to as a service
    plan (SP). Each SP comprises a series of tasks designed to be executed in a predefined
    order, with the objective of meeting heterogeneous Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
    (e.g., low service delays). Different from the cloud, selecting the appropriate
    service plan for each IoT request can be a challenging task in dynamic fog environments
    due to the dependency and decentralization of microservice instances, along with
    the instability of network conditions and service requests (i.e., change quickly
    over time). To deal with this challenge, we study the microservice instances selection
    problem for IoT applications deployed on fog platforms and propose a learning-based
    approach that employs Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to compute the optimal
    service plans. The latter optimizes the delay of application requests while effectively
    balancing the load among microservice instances. In our selection process, we
    carefully address the plan-dependency to efficiently select valid service plans
    for every request by introducing two distinct approaches; an action masking approach
    and an adaptive action mapping approach. Additionally, we propose an improved
    experience replay to address delayed action effects and enhance our model training
    efficiency. A series of experiments were conducted to assess the performance of
    our Microservice Instances Selection Policy (MISP) approach. The results demonstrate
    that our model reduces the average failure rate by up to 65% and improves load
    balance by up to 45% on average when compared to the baseline algorithms.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) has now exciting applications that touch all aspects
    of people’s lives. Prominent examples include smart healthcare [1], smart policing
    [2], smart farming [3], and more generally smart cities [4]. Such IoT applications
    are typically characterized by their intensive processing requirements and sensitivity
    to response delays. On the other hand, IoT devices have often limited computational
    capabilities that cannot meet alone the computation requirements of IoT applications.
    One solution is to offload the computation from IoT devices to remote cloud servers
    to ensure the efficiency of the application. However, offloading a large number
    of computation requests to cloud servers introduces significant delays and incurs
    additional bandwidth costs. To this end, a new effective and flexible computing
    paradigm has been introduced for IoT applications called fog computing [5]. As
    an extension of cloud computing, fog computing enables IoT devices to benefit
    from a nearby distributed computing and storage infrastructure, where diversified
    delay-sensitive IoT applications can be deployed in proximity, resulting in reduced
    latency for accessing IoT services and faster processing of IoT requests. Microservice
    Architecture (MSA) is another important paradigm that is widely regarded as a
    solution to address the scalability, flexibility and reliability issues encountered
    in traditional monolithic application architectures [6]. Driven by software-oriented
    architecture [7], [8], [9], MSA decomposes the monolithic application into a set
    of small, modular units that individually process distinct business functionalities.
    The adoption of the microservice architectural paradigm introduces a notable level
    of adaptability and reusability, wherein distinct microservices operate independently
    and can be efficiently deployed, managed, and scaled in real-time [6], [10]. In
    microservice-oriented fog computing platforms, multiple fog nodes are provisioned
    to deploy diverse microservice-based applications. Technically, each microservice
    can have one or several instances deployed on multiple fog nodes [11], [12]. This
    deployment strategy is based on real-time workload conditions and the geographical
    distribution of IoT requests, ensuring efficient servicing of each request by
    a nearby instance. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of fog computing, where
    network conditions fluctuate over time and various heterogeneous IoT requests
    are offloaded from different sources, a significant challenge arises concerning
    the distribution of IoT requests to their corresponding IoT applications. This
    challenge involves identifying the appropriate microservice instances for each
    individual IoT request, while adhering to their individual quality of service
    (QoS) requirements such as considerations for delay-criticality and high bandwidth.
    From an application perspective, an IoT request is typically represented by a
    composition of one or more microservices with a data dependency referenced as
    a service plan (SP). Furthermore, each service plan may involve multiple distributed
    and competing microservice instances, which necessitate their optimal selection
    and subsequent invocation in a predefined order. On the other hand, considering
    the dynamics of the fog computing networks, the policy for instance selection
    should not rely solely on one QoS criterion, such as proximity (i.e., response
    delay), to determine the optimal selection. Rather, it should also consider ensuring
    a fair distribution of the load among microservice instances to proactively anticipate
    critical events, such as unpredictable bursting workload scenarios. Consequently,
    the criticality of determining the appropriate instances and selection policy
    when offloading a request cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the life
    cycle of microservice applications. Note that, The issue of determining the optimal
    deployment for each microservice and how many instances are needed are beyond
    the scope of this work, and has been addressed by several works, such as [13],
    [14]. 1.1. Motivating example Let us consider a typical scenario, in which a smart
    city platform hosting multiple IoT applications has been deployed within a fog
    computing environment. In Fig. 1(a), the environment consists of fog servers interconnected
    with fog gateways (base stations) where users (IoT devices) can offload their
    computation workloads to microservices operating in the vicinity. In this context,
    Fig. 1(b) presents the Intelligent Alert System (IAS). The IAS is a microservice-based
    application that allows the government to manage critical crises (e.g., earthquakes),
    as well as illicit behaviors in urban areas such as assaults and car speeding.
    To achieve this goal, the IAS system exploits various IoT detection devices, such
    as motion sensors, smoke detectors, webcams and mobile devices that are strategically
    placed in the monitored urban area. For the sake of clarity, we will focus on
    two services of the IAS: the anomalous behavior detection service ( ) and the
    emergency alert processing service ( ). • Anomalous behavior detection service
    ( ): It consists of data event acquisition microservice that collects relevant
    data from various IoT sources, such as motion sensors, smoke detectors, and webcams.
    The collected data are parsed to extract relevant information, which are then
    forwarded to microservice for anomaly analysis using advanced machine learning
    algorithms. In the event of any deviations from the established norm, the anomalies
    are promptly flagged by invoking the event processing microservice . • Emergency
    alert processing service ( ): Users can report anomalous and suspicious events
    through a mobile application . Events are then analyzed by the microservice to
    identify unusual patterns of behavior. If any potential threat to public safety
    is detected, the event processing microservice is invoked to initiate appropriate
    actions, such as notifying emergency responders or alerting law enforcement agencies.
    In Fig. 1(c), the fog platform hosts the deployment of the anomalous behavior
    detection service AD = , with variable instances of each microservice strategically
    placed on some fog nodes. Given the scenario where an IoT device UD1 is located
    within the coverage area of fog node 1 (Fn1) and initiates a request for the service
    AD, UD1 possesses the flexibility to choose from a range of feasible execution
    plans in the fog platform. For instance, UD1 can select from plans such as , ,
    , and so on, where the notation denotes that microservice instance is deployed
    on fog node . The selection of at time slot would offer the optimal service delay
    ( ) for the request due to its minimal routing delay ( ) and the relatively low
    load of requested instances when considering the approximate waiting delay for
    each instance as shown in Fig. 1(c). Note the service delay is the summation of
    waiting and routing delays. Unfortunately, this particular plan may not necessarily
    be the most suitable choice under different scenarios. For example, in time slot
    , the service delay for is , whereas an alternative plan such as would offer a
    more favorable service delay of . The service delay in a fog computing platform
    is susceptible to various unstable factors, including fluctuating network conditions,
    a heterogeneous distribution of offloaded requests, and varying loads of microservice
    instances. Opting for the optimal long-term service plan requires an ultimate
    policy that learns from its environment. Download : Download high-res image (663KB)

    selection in fog computing. Moreover, a selection policy that exclusively prioritizes
    the optimization of application delays based on proximity may lead to significant
    load imbalances among microservice instances. This issue is further highlighted
    in Fig. 1(c), where we consider that the microservice instance deployed on the
    fog node is always selected based on its proximity. As a result, the requests
    processed from the coverage area of at time lead to an overload situation on at
    time , resulting in an additional processing delay for subsequent requests. Hence,
    the selection process must further balance the load between instances to extend
    the life of the microservices and distribute the requests fairly. Accordingly,
    it is essential to carefully consider an appropriate online trade-off between
    service delay and load balancing in order to achieve an optimal policy for selecting
    microservice instances. 1.2. Challenges and contribution Identifying the optimal
    policy for microservice selection in a time-varying environment is a complicated
    task. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been introduced as a potential
    online solution for managing decision-making dynamic systems modeled by a Markov
    Decision Process [15]. MDP features an agent that can learn from previous actions
    and reach an optimal policy without relying on a mathematical model of the environment.
    However, there exist three significant challenges when implementing RL in the
    realm of fog computing: • IoT service requests arrive in an arbitrary order and
    at random times. Moreover, the network conditions are not stable over time (e.g.,
    fluctuations in the channel conditions). This dynamism introduces complexity into
    the learning process, which may not guarantee the Markov property. Consequently,
    it is crucial to carefully define the model representation to enable optimal learning
    in the fog network. • The presence of inter-service dependencies between microservices
    in an IoT application and the necessity to meet QoS requirements for each service
    plan within a dynamic environment presents a significant challenge for RL to learn
    effectively. This is mainly due to the delayed action effect and the variability
    of the action set, as not all requests can select the same service plan, and the
    learning model may not receive the reward immediately. Therefore, an optimal state–action–reward
    representation must be employed. • The need to consider competing requirements
    and performance trade-offs, such as the application-level QoS (e.g., load-balancing)
    and the user-level Quality of Experience (QoE) (e.g., service delay), is crucial
    prior to implementing any expensive scaling methodologies to manage heavy workloads.
    In this paper, we propose an adaptive microservice instances selection policy
    for service plan requests under a stochastic fog environment. The targeted policy
    is based on deep reinforcement learning that ensures a trade-off between service
    delay and load balancing. We summarized our main contributions as follows: • We
    investigate the problem of selecting the optimal service plan for an IoT microservice-based
    application in a dynamic and heterogeneous fog platform. Then, we formulate the
    non-convex Microservice Instances Selection Policy (MISP) problem, with the goal
    of minimizing the potential occurrence of deadline violations and the application
    load imbalance. • To achieve the optimal selection policy, we propose a model-free
    Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) model for microservice instances selection. Our
    learning solution handles the variable action space, the time-varying channel
    state, the heterogeneous offloading pattern, and the delayed effect of action
    due to the tardiness in completing the service plan. • We conduct an exhaustive
    simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MISP, where an online
    training is executed on microservice-based applications, followed by a comprehensive
    assessment of the proposed MISP. The performance results demonstrate the superior
    performance of our approach over the compared baselines. The subsequent sections
    of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the related
    works. Section 3 outlines the system model and the problem formulation. In Section
    4, the learning formulation and solution are presented, followed by the presentation
    of the DDQL model and training procedures in Section 5. The performance evaluation
    and results are discussed in Section 6, and ultimately in Section 7 we conclude
    our work. 2. Related work The advent of fog computing has aroused interest within
    the research community on different axes. Over the past few years, the most responsive
    direction has been around the management of resources at the edge, (e.g., resource
    allocation, service provisioning, etc.), where many efforts have been made to
    efficiently orchestrate computation tasks generated on the edge network. Primarily,
    we can distinguish two categories in the task orchestration problem, namely resource-oriented
    task orchestration and service-oriented task orchestration. The resource-oriented
    task orchestration problem attempts to allocate tasks to the appropriate resources,
    such as CPU and memory, which need to be first provisioned and then executed to
    achieve the highest possible level of performance after being freed up for other
    tasks. On the other hand, a service-oriented task orchestration problem involves
    the delegation of user tasks that rely on a pre-deployed application comprising
    a set of service instances distributed across multiple nodes, where each service
    is responsible for processing the associated task. Throughout this section, we
    summarize existing work in both directions. 2.1. Resource-oriented task orchestration
    Recently, the integration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) with Flying Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a potential solution to enhance the spatial
    coverage and flexibility of MEC [16]. Through this integration, Zhang et al. [17]
    proposed an end-to-end DRL model that can simultaneously optimize the trajectory
    of the UAV and the partial offloading task, with the aim of minimizing overall
    task delay and energy consumption. Similarly, Xu et al. [18] investigated whether
    the task generated by IoT devices should be processed locally or offloaded to
    UAV. They employed the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to optimize
    the binary offloading policy, which involves determining whether to place IoT
    tasks in the local computing queue or the local offloading queue and allocate
    the corresponding bandwidth resource. The primary objective of this study is to
    balance the competing goals of energy consumption and queue length. In order to
    maximize the completion of tasks prior to their corresponding deadlines, Azizi
    et al. [19] studied the scheduling policy of IoT tasks in heterogeneous fog networks,
    and proposed two priority-aware semi-greedy algorithms, PSG and PSG-M, designed
    to efficiently map IoT tasks to available fog nodes while ensuring superior quality
    of service (QoS) for IoT users in terms of response time and minimizing the energy
    consumption of fog nodes. Considering the resource allocation problem, Karimi
    et al. [20] proposed a task offloading strategy for the purpose of guaranteeing
    the requisite response time within a highly dynamic vehicular edge computing environment.
    Their approach involves leveraging DRL to facilitate the migration of tasks between
    the limited resources of MEC and central cloud servers. Another work by Li et
    al. [21] addressed the deadline constraint in a multi-eNB MEC environment by employing
    an actor–critic framework to facilitate the learning process, while utilizing
    a k-nearest neighbor (K-NN)-based action representation approach to address the
    scalability challenges associated with the explosion of action space in deep Q-networks.
    In the multi-user multi-server MEC environment, Yu et al. [22] jointly studied
    the task offloading and resource allocation strategy using a partially improved
    Dueling-DQN model to achieve the dual objectives of decreasing the completion
    delay of offloaded tasks and minimizing energy consumption across all terminal
    devices. Several noteworthy contributions have investigated the task orchestration
    aspect in fog computing [23], [24], encompassing both online and offline methodologies
    and seeking to optimize different QoS metrics such as energy consumption, response
    delay, and system performance. However, the aforementioned research works made
    the assumption that every fog node is equipped with the necessary installed environments
    to perform any computational task. This may not always be the case, as user-generated
    tasks may belong to distinct service categories that necessitate diverse databases/libraries
    and computing resources, which may exceed the storage resource constraints of
    the fog nodes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the scenario of the task
    offloading strategy limited to the deployed service instances in particular edge
    locations. 2.2. Service-oriented task orchestration The orchestration of service-oriented
    tasks can present significant challenges in fog platforms, wherein the pertinent
    services are required to be downloaded from the remote cloud to the fog nodes
    upon the arrival of user tasks. Alternatively, frequently accessed services can
    be pre-cached within the fog node. For example, Gao et al. [25] aimed to optimize
    user satisfaction, determined by the fulfillment of task requirements, and resource
    efficiency through a study of the joint utilization of service placement and task
    offloading in edge–cloud computing. To address this problem, the authors proposed
    a hybrid algorithm that incorporates particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Lévy
    flight movement, in conjunction with a three-stage offloading heuristic method.
    Similarly, Xiang Liu et al. [26] conducted a collaborative investigation into
    service placement and task offloading to effectively reduce the maximum delay
    experienced by all users. Given the storage and computational limitations of MEC
    servers, Li et al. [27] leveraged an online joint optimization framework that
    integrates Lyapunov optimization and Gibbs sampling techniques. Their primary
    objective was to minimize system delay while ensuring energy efficiency through
    the optimization of service caching and task offloading. In the presence of stochastic
    task arrivals and dynamic network connections, Liu et al. [28] proposed a joint
    service deployment and computing resources allocation approach using a parameterized
    deep Q-networks in order to minimize the overall task delay. Nevertheless, a considerable
    portion of research work neglects the granularity aspect of applications and have
    regarded the deployed services as independent entities of one another. Although
    certain studies have accounted for service dependency [29], they typically optimize
    a singular sequential service plan while ignoring the sharing and competition
    of instances in a more complex workflow. The issues of granularity and service
    composition constitute crucial aspects of microservice architecture. The fine-grained
    characteristics of microservice enable the representation of an application as
    a collection of composite services, in which multiple small self-governing components
    interact with each other to fulfill a particular service plan requested by the
    user. In addition, multiple instances of each microservice are deployed in order
    to mitigate the possibility of overload scenarios. Because of the intricate nature
    of microservice architecture, limited attention has been devoted to the process
    of selecting appropriate instances for microservice applications in fog computing.
    Liang et al. [30], designed a task-chain load balancing algorithm for microservices
    application, which involves selecting the target service instances upon the reception
    of an API request to achieve load balance by considering system resource usage,
    and the number of data transmissions between physical machines as a parameter
    to reduce the response time. Three suboptimal solutions were evaluated, namely
    PSO, simulated annealing (SA), and genetic algorithm (GA), with the genetic algorithm
    ultimately being selected as the optimal solution. For the load balancing problem
    scenario, Niu et al. [31] proposed a load balancing approach that is oriented
    towards microservice instances chain selection. The authors modeled their approach
    as a non-cooperative game and employed a Nash bargaining solution to effectively
    balance the workload and allocate microservice instances among competing request
    chains. Similarly, Yuand et al. [32] proposed a linear program formulation for
    the basic load balancing problem, by taking the microservice interdependencies
    as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) into account. A fully polynomial-time approximation
    scheme was developed to achieve load balancing for the QoS-aware problem in microservice
    application deployment. On the other hand, Yu and al [33] investigated the problem
    of allocating resources for service requests and placing microservices instances,
    in order to jointly reduce resource usage and end-to-end response time of request
    chains in a joint effort to save costs, conserve energy, and guarantee QoS. They
    proposed a three-step approach, named LEGO, to solve this problem. In particular,
    the approach first identifies and optimizes resource allocation decisions to serve
    incoming requests at the CPU cycle level in each microservice instance. Then,
    a set of microservice instances is configured to route IoT requests to those instances
    in a balanced way. Finally, the approach enables the deployment of these instances
    on a minimum number of servers. In the cloud environment, Ding et al. [34] studied
    the microservice service selection problem under the competition of multiple composite
    services, in which two service selection strategies were proposed to analyze the
    scheduling urgency and execution order of each task. Subsequently, the microservice
    instance selection strategy constructs an optimal service path based on the sub-deadline
    and urgency of tasks. Inspired by the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) approach,
    Selvakumar et al. [35] proposed an enhanced Weighted Fair Queuing approach designed
    to manage complex chains of microservices and reduce user request delay. Their
    approach takes into account load balancing and inter-service affinity while scheduling
    requests to their appropriate service instances in a cloud-native environment.
    The works cited above have been designed within the context of cloud computing,
    without considering the critical aspect of delays in IoT applications during the
    selection process, which is influenced by the edge network. Moreover, most existing
    studies on microservice selection have proposed heuristic methods [33], [34],
    [35], convex optimization [31], and meta-heuristic approaches [25], [30] to address
    the selection problem. However, due to their time-consuming and complex nature,
    these methods are generally not suitable in dynamic fog computing as they often
    result in falling into local optima solutions, rather than being optimized for
    long-term performance. In contrast, some works [14] address the issue of microservice
    selection as a scheduling concern, where they aim to find the optimal placement
    of microservices in fog computing rather than managing user requests for deployed
    microservice instances in the long term. Different from the aforementioned works,
    the present work jointly considers the dependencies among microservice instances,
    the completion delays constraints of each service plan, the offloading strategy
    in a multi-user multi-instance dynamic fog network, and a load balancing strategy.
    Furthermore, we propose an online selection policy with a dual-action representation
    to tackle the challenge of plan-dependency. We also address the often-neglected
    issue of delayed rewards, which need to be updated until the completion of the
    IoT request. This aspect is not commonly considered by traditional DRL-based methods.
    3. System model and problem formulation In this section, we provide a preliminary
    definition of the fog platform and the microservice-based application. Then we
    formulate the Microservice Instances Selection Policy (MISP) problem using the
    deadline violation and load balance degree as the optimization goal. A microservice-based
    system is composed of a set of logical service plans, wherein each plan comprises
    one or multiple physical instances that are deployed on distinct fog nodes. Each
    microservice manifests a multitude of tasks, and dependencies emerge due to a
    series of task calls for a particular service plan. 3.1. A preliminary definition
    The present subsection details the definition of the fog computing platform and
    the microservice-based application, along with an examination of the user IoT
    request and the selection criteria for the physical service plan. Definition 1
    Fog Platform Let be a fog computing platform represented by an undirected graph,
    where represents a finite set of fog nodes, and is a finite set of edges defined
    by pairs of distinct fog gateways. The network interconnection among fog gateways
    occurs via a wired link, which is characterized by a transmission bandwidth denoted
    as (Bps). Conversely, the interaction between IoT user devices and fog gateways
    takes place through a channel bandwidth denoted as (Hz). Each is co-hosted with
    a fog gateway , e.g., the base station in the local area network (LAN) or the
    metropolitan area network (MAN). Definition 2 Fog Node Let define a fog node,
    which can either be a single fog server or a cluster of multiple fog servers.
    Here, denotes the total computing resources that can provision for microservice
    instances, and represents the fog gateway that is co-located with the corresponding
    fog node . Each has the capability to establish communication with other nodes
    using fog gateway links in order to collectively handle IoT requests. The total
    routing delay of an IoT request is determined according to the shortest routing
    path by the routing protocols. Definition 3 Microservice Let be an IoT application
    composed of several microservices. Each microservice is characterized as a tuple
    , , where: • denotes the set of tasks exposed by , and each task is described
    by , where is the computing resource (measured in CPU cycles per second) required
    to execute task and represents the selectivity of the output data size based on
    the input data of the request . • represents the maximum allocated processing
    capacity (CPU frequency) required by . • designates the set of instances of and
    their relative placement in the fog platform, where indicates that instance of
    the microservice is placed in the fog node . Definition 4 IoT User Device Let
    define an IoT user device distributed over the fog platform, where designates
    the IoT device location from which an IoT request is offloaded, is time slot during
    which offloads a request , and indicates that the IoT device initiates a request
    for the execution of task exposed by the microservice , with as the input data
    size of the request and as the maximum tolerable delay of the request . Definition
    5 Logical Service Plan Let be the requested logical service plan, which is represented
    by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where defines a set of invocation microservice
    tasks, and represents the instances dependency through a set of dependency pairs
    between the invoked microservice tasks. For example, the deployment of Traffic
    Sensors in a city can improve the traffic conditions for users. To achieve this
    goal, a sequence of interdependent microservice tasks is involved in traffic management
    applications. Firstly, the Traffic Sensors microservice task gathers real-time
    data on traffic patterns. Subsequently, the Analytic microservice task processes
    this data to identify areas of high congestion and slow-moving traffic. In turn,
    the Traffic Control microservice task receives recommendations from the Analytic
    microservice to adjust traffic signals in the identified area. In parallel, the
    Emergency Responsive microservice task monitors the area for any accidents and
    alerts the Analytical service to adjust traffic signals to reroute traffic around
    the accident scene. Definition 6 Physical Service Plan Let be the definition of
    the physical service plan state for the IoT request . The physical plan state
    involves selecting the optimal deployed microservice instances for individual
    IoT requests, which is represented by a matrix of binary decision variables denoted
    as , where corresponds to the total number of microservices for the IoT application,
    and represents the maximum number of available instances among microservices.
    To ensure that no more than one instance is selected for each microservice in
    , we can add the following constraint to the formulation: (1) (2) where indicates
    whether the instance of microservice is selected, independently of the fog platform.
    As an illustrative example, let us consider a scenario in which an IoT request
    invokes the anomaly behavior detection service, represented as (refer to Fig.
    1(b)). In Fig. 1(c), it can be observed that is implemented with three microservices
    . Among these microservices, has three available instances, which represents the
    maximum number of instances for the IAS application, while microservices and each
    have two available instances. Consequently, the matrix representation can be derived
    as follows: Table 1 provides an overview of all symbols and notations used in
    this paper. Table 1. Summary of notations used in the formulation. Fog platform

    selection problem formulation In this subsection, we formulate the Microservice
    Instances Selection Policy (MIPS) problem within the fog computing platform. The
    optimization objective in our study is based on two key factors, namely the deadline
    violation and the load balancing degree. 3.2.1. Deadline violation When an IoT
    user device requests a logical service plan , the first microservice invoked is
    determined on the basis of the request profile . Specifically, an IoT request
    is characterized as the invocation of a specific task provided by the entry microservice.
    This request follows a routing process where it is initially directed towards
    the corresponding microservice responsible for the first requested task. Subsequently,
    a sequence of aggregated microservices is invoked, forming a composition plan
    of interconnected microservices tasks to successfully fulfill the entirety of
    the request. According to the system model, the end-to-end delay of request is
    affected by three delays routes, including (i) the access delay from the IoT user
    devices to their nearby fog gateway , (ii) the aggregated communication delay
    on the fog platform, and (iii) the processing delay for each microservice instance
    in . Thus, we can define a binary variable to represent the deadline violation
    and determine whether the request delay has not been exceeded. (3) (1) The access
    delay: Given the current IoT device placement , the access delay is calculated
    using the uplink offloading delay over the wireless channel to the nearby serving
    . Initially, establishes communication with the closest , which subsequently forwards
    the request to the corresponding microservice. The transmission rate between and
    is calculated using Shannon’s capacity formula1 as follows: (4) where is the total
    upload bandwidth allocated by the fog gateway to the IoT devices, which is evenly
    distributed among the served devices. is the time varying channel gain between
    the and it is nearby , denotes the transmit power of the in the upload link and
    denotes the receiver noise power. Consequently, the access delay for a given request
    is: (5) (2) The network delay: The network delay is constrained by the interdependency
    among microservice instances in the service plan and their geographical placement
    in fog nodes. If the selected instances are not deployed in the vicinity of the
    IoT device, the request will be routed to the corresponding instance via WAN network
    otherwise, it is negligible, i.e. equal to 0. (6) (7) (8) Eq. (6) refers to the
    first part of the offload process, in case the requested task exposed by the first
    selected instance of microservice is not in the vicinity of the generated request
    . On the other hand, Eq. (7) corresponds to the network delay between each pair
    of microservice instances affected by the returned output data size from the data
    selectivity function , where defines the fog node on which the instance of microservice
    is deployed. (3) The processing delay: Upon reaching the selected instance, the
    request is first processed in a queue that adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
    model. We assume that each instance maintains an input queue and processes requests
    in the order of their arrival. Thus, the processing delay comprises both the execution
    delay and the queueing delay. Specifically, considering the processing capacity
    of the instance , the execution delay and the queueing delay can be expressed
    as follows: (9) The processing delay mainly depends on the computing capacity
    of each microservice. In this case, the queuing delay is calculated by the sum
    of the execution times for all requests before the current request in the queue.
    3.2.2. Load balancing A Microservice instance selection approach that consistently
    emphasizes the selection of each request at the ideal physical plan in terms of
    service delay, may face severe load imbalance between instances if some regions
    generate more load than others. To guarantee the stability of applications and
    the reliability of instance selection in the long term, an Imbalance load metric
    is employed between instances of microservices. Lower imbalance values depict
    a better load distribution between instances of each microservice. We define the
    imbalance degree as the summation of the standard deviation of computation workloads
    across individual instances pertaining to a given application by: (10) where denotes
    the computing utilization resource on instance of microservice , and represents
    the mean value of computation utilization across all instances within microservice
    . 3.2.3. Optimization problem definition Given a fog computing platform , a deployed
    microservice application and a set of IoT user devices. For each IoT request ,
    the Microservice Instance Selection Policy problem consists of selecting the physical
    service plan that determines the optimal routes between each pair of adjacent
    instances deployed in the fog platform such that the load balance degree is minimized
    and the request delay is no greater than its deadline. By combining Eqs. (3) to
    (10), the optimization problem is defined as follows: (11) Subject to the constraints:
    where is the importance weight of deadline violation and load balancing degree.
    Constraint C1 guarantees that, for each microservice, only one instance deployed
    in a fog node is selected. Problem (11) is a non-convex mixed-integer linear programming
    problem, which involves binary decision variables (i.e., physical service plan
    selection) under a non-convex constraint attributed to C1, the feasible set and
    objective function of the optimization problem. Such problems are typically known
    to be NP-hard [20], highlighting their nontrivial nature of finding optimal solutions,
    particularly when operating in a large-scale dynamic environment. To address this
    challenge, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning approach to effectively solve
    the formulated optimization problem. 4. DQL - Based online microservice selection
    algorithm In our study, we adopt a time-slotted model where a collection of time
    slots is denoted as . Within each time slot , multiple IoT user devices can submit
    requests for a logical service plan. We assume the offloaded requests follow a
    Poisson distribution with an arrival rate and the system can process requests
    } within a given time slot . Considering the potential variability of IoT requests
    that may induce the system to enter different states, the microservice selection
    process can be effectively modeled by employing the formal framework Markov Decision
    Process (MDP) to determine the optimal selection policy. MDP captures the stochastic
    variability of the environment and acts as a model for decision making by allowing
    the decision-maker (i.e., agent) to interface with our fog environment platform
    based on the provided observations. The environment in which the microservice-based
    application is deployed on the fog platform is represented as MDP defined by a
    tuple consisting of four essential components, i.e., , where stands for the state
    representation at a given time slot , the action taken, is the reward obtained
    after action is performed and demonstrates the transition probability from state
    to when executed action given by: (12) To find the optimal physical service plan
    selection policy and solve the optimization problems of MDP, we propose an online
    approach based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, using the model-free Q-learning
    algorithm. Since the fog computing platform is dynamic, the model-free suppresses
    the need for a transition probability when exploring the environment. As such
    the new component design for Q-learning in the fog platform scenario is described
    below. 4.1. State representation The appropriate representation of the system
    state is a critical factor in determining the optimal selection policy. Considering
    our system model, the Q-learning agent observes the fog platform environment and
    takes an action choosing the optimal physical plan when a request is offloaded
    to the corresponding logical plan. Since the offloaded requests follow a Poisson
    distribution at a given time slot , processing the incoming IoT requests } in
    parallel and distributing them with a single action can lead to the divergence
    of the Q-learning model. This divergence is primarily due to an explosion in the
    action space (i.e., all possible physical plans), which is influenced by the distribution
    of multiple requests from multiple IoT devices across the system. To address this
    challenge, the agent processes the incoming requests sequentially in a mini-batch
    manner within a time slot . Specifically, we assume that certain state attributes
    remain invariant during a given time slot , such as the channel state of each
    fog gateway, while the remaining attributes (e.g., the processing request) vary
    across each time step with being significantly smaller than , such that . The
    state can be formulated based on time step as a composite of four essential components,
    including the load of microservice instances, the offloaded IoT request, the fog
    platform state and the arrival rate in a given time slot (13) where is the request
    profile processed during the time step , reflects the previous load status of
    microservice instances, with denoting the computing utilization resource on instance
    of the microservice , is the transmission rate, which is affected by the bandwidth
    and the variation of channel gain at each time slot and denotes the total number
    of offloaded requests during the time slot . 4.2. Action space and variable action
    set The agent’s actions constitute the focal point of our study, which aims to
    identify the most suitable physical service plan for each IoT request within a
    fog platform. At first sight, the action space is where action , can be defined
    as below: (14) where the physical service plan described in Definition 6 incorporates
    a binary variable to denote the selection status of instance of the microservice
    . Therefore, the action space comprises possible actions computed based on the
    microservice-based application definition: (15) In which encompasses all conceivable
    combinations of physical plans for the given request . However, due to the plan-dependent
    request problem, the feasibility of certain actions is restricted for specific
    logical plans which imposes additional challenges for designing the learning algorithm.
    For instance, in the context of the IAS application depicted in Fig. 1(b), a request
    that requires can only be offloaded to instances of , , and , respectively, while
    ensuring that is excluded from the selection options. Therefore, we propose two
    distinct methods of action representation: • Action masking representation: Given
    that the feasible set of actions changes constantly with variations in the state,
    the learning process is dependent on conditions that require the selection of
    an action from the set of feasible actions based on the request profile . The
    updated action definition is presented below: (16) where represents a binary mask
    vector of size , where a value of 0 in the th position of indicates that the th
    row of should be masked. An illustration of this process can be observed by employing
    the logical plan presented in Fig. 2. In this case, the mask vector is configured
    as , which results in the third row corresponding to being visually marked in
    red, indicating its exclusion from the selection process, as illustrated by the
    potential physical plans such as or in Fig. 2. • Action mapping representation:
    When dealing with large-scale applications, the generation of all conceivable
    combinations for a physical service plan containing numerous microservice instances
    can result in an exponential increase in the action space. This can pose a considerable
    challenge for the learning agent tasked with identifying an optimal solution.
    Consequently, we introduce an action mapping approach that aims to identify the
    most suitable selection algorithm, using three straightforward heuristic selection
    mapping algorithms. The definition of action mapping is straightforward with ,
    where each action corresponds to a distinct algorithmic selection, specifically
    the Load-Aware, the Proximity-Aware, and the Hybrid-Aware algorithm. Further details
    of these algorithms are provided in Section 5.1.1. Download : Download high-res

    selection action example. 4.3. Reward function In our study, it is necessary to
    consider an optimal trade-off between the deadline violation and the system load
    balancing. In other words, after a selection action is performed by the agent
    at state , an immediate reward is acquired according to the objective model, where
    is the reward at time step . We define the immediate reward function as the negative
    of the request deadline violation and the load imbalance degree incurred in a
    time step . (17) The parameter represents the importance weight, which can be
    adjusted to accommodate diverse preferences for different IoT applications. It
    is important to note that the goal of Q-learning is to maximize the expected long-term
    reward. To this end, a discount factor is introduced to control how an agent considers
    future rewards: (18) Download : Download high-res image (582KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The DDQL model structure. 4.4. Q-value The Q-value (a.k.a
    the action-state function) refers to the expected computed reward for performing
    an action at a given state in accordance with a policy. The learning model utilizes
    the Q-value to achieve an optimal policy that yields the highest expected reward
    over the long term. Therefore, under a policy the Q-value is written as: (19)
    (20) The core of the Q-learning algorithm relies on the use of the recursive nature
    of Bellman equation to estimate the Q-Value stored in Q-table. As a simple Q-value
    iteration update the learning process is written as: (21) where is an action-state-function
    multiplied by the discount factor at time step . However, using Q-learning to
    find the optimal selection policy in a fog platform poses two challenges. Firstly,
    the learning algorithm relies on the use of a Q-table to store Q-values, which
    can result in a computationally expensive and time-consuming learning process,
    as the agent needs to update Q-values for every possible state–action pair. Secondly,
    the agent is faced with a large, non-stationary search space, which can lead to
    model divergence and hinder the identification of the optimal selection policy.
    To overcome these challenges, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate
    the Q-value, thereby reducing the search space and improving the accuracy of the
    selection. Further details are discussed in the following Section. 5. DQL-empowered
    microservice-instance selection Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) stands at the
    intersection between the field of dynamic programming (reinforcement learning)
    and deep learning (neural network) [24]. DRL combines the strengths of both fields
    by utilizing a neural network as a function approximator, resulting in an innovative
    approach that addresses complex and large-scale dynamic problems. 5.1. DRL framework
    To bypass the look-up table during the learning process and effectively dealing
    with the large number of states, we adapt the approximation approach by employing
    deep Q-learning (DQL) as a combination between deep neural networks (DNNs) and
    Q-learning. DQL considers the complex nature of the system states, where the new
    Q-value definition is updated by learning the parameters of the DNN instead of
    utilizing a traditional Q-table. Specifically, the process of updating the policy
    in DQL involves calculating the output of the online network, also known as the
    Q-Network, by feeding in the state as input and obtaining the maximum Q-value
    as output. DQL incorporates two progressive features to stabilize the learning
    process and prevent divergence during the learning, namely the experience buffer
    and the fixed Q-target method. Initially, we apply an experience buffer (a.k.a
    replay memory) that stores the observed experience interactions and samples them
    uniformly as a mini-batch of experience tuples during the run-time of the application
    for policy updates. Inspired by supervised learning, experience buffers prevent
    the temporal correlations during the training process. Concretely, at each time
    step , the state transition, the corresponding selection action, and the resulting
    reward are stored in the buffer. Once sufficient training data is collected, the
    model accurately adjusts the Q-value for different state–action pairs. However,
    in our study, the agent is unable to get an immediate reward upon performing a
    selection action due to the possibility of delays in the IoT request frame, which
    may exceed the duration of a time step . To provide an illustration, consider
    a scenario in which an IoT device requests the logical plan depicted in Fig. 2.
    The completion delay for the plan is approximately 0.1 s, while the time step
    is set to 10 ms. In this situation, the experience record that represents this
    request is stored in the buffer with an empty reward value, making it unsuitable
    for feeding into DQL until the request is completely fulfilled. This issue holds
    significant importance because the agent is unable to access immediate reward
    information, which prevents its ability to effectively learn the selection policy.
    In order to tackle this issue, we suggest enhancing the replay mechanism with
    a Boolean value named to the experience records, denoted as . When the agent performs
    an action in state , the experience elements are stored in the buffer. If the
    reward can be immediately obtained, then is set to ; otherwise, it is set to .
    Once the required sample batch is reached, the agent is exclusively supplied with
    the selected experience pool, whose element is designated as . By adopting this
    approach, the agent is able to undertake online training by overcoming the detrimental
    effects of delayed rewards. Further details regarding our proposed methodology
    can be found in Fig. 3 and Algorithm 2. On the other hand, DQL incorporates a
    separate network known as the target network (also referred to as target Q-Network)
    from the primary approximated Q-network. The target network has fixed parameters
    that are copied from the Q-Network after a specified number of iterations. By
    adopting this strategy, DQL can mitigate the problem of the Q-values fluctuating
    continuously, thereby enhancing the stability of the training process. Nevertheless,
    the use of the target Q-Network for both action selection and evaluation in DQL
    may result in overestimation and instability during the learning phase. This issue
    is particularly significant when dealing with noisy or high-dimensional state
    spaces, as it can lead to suboptimal policies and reduced efficiency of the learning
    procedure. To mitigate the overestimation problem, we propose the adoption of
    the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm. This involves defining the target
    network according to Eq. (22), with the Q-network being utilized for action selection,
    and the target Q-network serving to evaluate actions. (22) With the combination
    of target Q-Network and delayed experience buffer, the TD error (aka the loss
    function) can be expressed as the disparity between the target value, and the
    present estimation of Q-value by the formulation below: (23) The presentation
    of the selection process for microservice instances using the developed DDQL model
    is illustrated in Fig. 3. The proposed framework consists of three components:
    the fog platform, the microservice application, and the DRL agent. An DRL agent
    is primarily associated with each application and functions as a request orchestrator
    to synchronize and determine the suitable physical service plans for each IoT
    request. The placement of the orchestrator is not a subject of concern in our
    research as we assume that the DRL agent has a comprehensive view of the environment
    in which it can interact and learn from the experience of the trials. In a real-world
    scenario, the agent can either be integrated into an orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes)
    or operate as a gateway in a multi-fog cluster. During each iteration, the DRL
    agent selects an action based on the observation obtained from the environment.
    Subsequently, the offloaded IoT request is routed according to the corresponding
    physical plan. The role of the environment is to provide feedback records to the
    DRL agent, such as the next state and reward value, which are stored in the experience
    replay buffer to train our DDQL model. Given that our approach deals with delayed
    rewards, the model stores each record with an appropriate value, which can be
    updated upon request completion. This process continues until the training dataset
    is generated. The agent then draws training data from the experience buffer with
    value equal to towards the target value by minimizing the loss function and training
    the Q-network within the DDQL model. 5.1.1. Q-masking and Q-mapping algorithms
    The agent has to learn the appropriate physical plan for every IoT request. However,
    the standard extraction of the best action value by applying a max (or softmax)
    operator on the output layer through deep Q-learning becomes more complicated
    due to the plan-dependent problem, as described in Section 4.2. Given that not
    all actions may be feasible for every request, a straightforward approach to surmount
    the problem is allowing the agent to select an invalid action, i.e., a microservice
    instances in which the request cannot be routed according to its logical service
    plan definition, and associate a penalty reward for each invalid action. By doing
    so, the agent will eventually learn to avoid invalid actions. Nevertheless, the
    agent may expend considerable time and resources in exploring irrelevant actions,
    leading to slower learning and suboptimal policies. Moreover, the inclusion of
    invalid actions effectively increases the size of the action space, thereby posing
    challenges for the agent to learn efficiently, especially when only a small subset
    of actions remains valid. For instance, if more than 50 logical service plans
    exist within the IoT application, wherein each plan requires a minimum of 3 microservices,
    and only two instances of each microservice are deployed, this would result in
    the existence of more than 300＋ invalid actions. Accordingly, we proposed two
    separate approaches for designing the action selection process • Q-masking: The
    DRL agent is trained with a Q-masking layer that is imposed on the output Q-values
    before applying the softmax operation, as shown in Fig. 3. Specifically, we consider
    that each subset of Q-values is associated with a dedicated subset of actions
    through a complementary plugin that relies on a request profile . Considering
    a particular state , the output Q-values are transformed using the masked plugin
    which restricts a set of invalid actions so that the agent does not spend more
    time from expending excessive resources on exploring or learning unnecessary instance
    selection information. • Q-mapping: The DRL agent is trained to choose the optimal
    selection algorithm among the three Best-fit algorithms. Algorithm 1 details the
    current mapping strategy, which involves presenting three greedy-based mapping
    algorithms. The selection algorithm is being mapped using the action index (line
    1–10) returned by the DRL agent. The Load-Aware algorithm ( ) selects instances
    for each microservice with the least CPU load (line 4). On the other hand, the
    Proximity-Aware algorithm ( ) selects the closest instances based on network latency
    (line 6). In the case of the Hybrid-Aware algorithm ( ), it integrates both load
    and proximity selection strategies. Initially, two candidate instances are chosen
    based on their network latency. Then, the algorithm evaluates the current load
    of these instances and selects the one with lower CPU load (line 8–9). The procedure
    is repeated iteratively based on the mapping action for each microservice until
    the physical plan matrix is completely updated. Download : Download high-res image

    The pseudocode of the DDQL MIPS algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2. Initially,
    an initialization is performed on the experiment replay buffer, and the two neural
    Q-networks are set with the same weights . Additionally, all relevant hyperparameters
    to the model, including the learning rate, exploration rate, update frequency,
    and epsilon-greedy parameters, are set in line 1. The training process is conducted
    in an episodic manner, where the environment is reset at the conclusion of each
    episode (line 3), and the iterative procedure is repeated until the model converges.
    Given that we have proposed a dual-action representation to address the problem
    of plan-dependency, our DRL agent was executed and trained using both action representations
    as described in Section 5.1.1. In Algorithm 2, we defined the variable Q-type,
    initialized with either a Q-map or a Q-mask, to determine the action selection
    approach, whether based on Q-masking or Q-mapping. The dataset trials are generated
    using the epsilon-greedy method. The learning agent interacts with the microservice-based
    application and fog platform environment, resulting in an experience record denoted
    as , which includes the current state, the action taken, the reward received,
    the next state, and the sampling validity status. The process of selecting an
    action depends primarily on the configured selection approach defined in -type,
    which can be either Q-mapping approach or Q-masking approach. At each time step
    , the agent randomly explores the environment with a probability of (lines 8–11).
    In the context of the Q-map, the agent randomly selects among three distinct actions
    associated with the greedy selection algorithm (i.e., the Load-Aware, Proximity-aware
    and Hybrid-Aware algorithms). Conversely, when employing the Q-mask, the agent
    randomly selects from the possible physical service plans for a given IoT request,
    determined by the applied mask . On the other hand, between lines 13 and 16, the
    agent selects the best action based on the current state from the neural network
    with a probability of . The -greedy method balances exploration and exploitation
    over time, enabling the model to develop environmental knowledge by exploring
    initially and then gradually drawing more from a valid experience as decays with
    time. Upon the completion of a request, the reward is updated for a valid record
    having a value of True, facilitating the model to learn from completed experiential
    information (lines 5–21). Between lines 23 and 30, the model enters the learning
    phase following the selection of a minibatch of samples through the fetching mechanism
    previously described in Section 5.1. The learning agent minimizes the TD error
    (loss function), by calculating the target Q-value and subtracting it from the
    Q-value of the local Q-network outputs. We leverage the Adam algorithm to update
    the weights of the local Q-network and optimize the loss function. The loss function
    is updated through the stochastic gradient descent method as follows: (24) Consequently,
    the parameters of Q-network at time step can be updated using as the learning
    rate by: (25) The weights of the local Q-network are updated through gradient
    descent, whereas the weights of the target Q-network are replaced with the weights
    of the local Q-network at a frequency of every update. To achieve a gradual modification
    of the target Q-network, we utilize the soft-update method, where target Q-network
    receives a small portion of the discounted change in local weights during updates
    as follows: (26) where is the update coefficient, . Download : Download high-res

    analysis In this section, we evaluate the performance of our MISP approach through
    its convergence and objective performance. We first introduce the experimental
    settings used in our conducted simulations, followed by a description of the competing
    baselines. Then, we demonstrate the performance achieved under various parameter
    configurations. 6.1. Experimental setup The running microservice application in
    fog computing was implemented using the Python multiprocessing module, which allows
    each microservice instance to operate as an independent process that communicates
    with other instances through a dedicated queue for exchanging requests. Specifically,
    We adopt a Python-based simulator for both the fog platform and the DRL agent.
    The DRL model was built using PyTorch on an Ubuntu 21.04 LTS system, with an Intel
    i7-7700HQ CPU workstation featuring a 2.80 GHZ frequency, 16 GB of memory, and
    an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 GPU. In order to capture the dynamic aspects of fog
    computing, we deployed 15 fog nodes following the fog platform definition described
    in 3.1. We then synthesized the IoT application with its associated microservice
    components, followed by simulating the application’s popularity and generating
    request patterns to mimic real-world usage scenarios. In this experiment, similar
    to [36], we modeled the time-varying channel gain using the Rayleigh fading channel
    model represented by the following equation : ɛ , where is the average channel
    gain and ɛ is a random fading factor with an exponential distribution around a
    mean of 1. The average channel gain was calculated using the free space path loss
    model: , where is the antenna gain, is the carrier frequency, is the path loss
    exponent and is the distance from the IoT device to the . During the experiment,
    the values of , , and were fixed at 4.11, 915 MHz, and 2.8, respectively. The
    value of was randomly selected from a uniform distribution within the range of
    (2.5, 5.5) meters. To model the distribution of IoT requests and simulate personalized
    preferences for logical service plans within the application at different time
    slots, we integrate a request generator process into the system. Furthermore,
    the performance of the system is also evaluated by considering the placement of
    IoT devices, as the study involves modifying the of IoT device . The channel bandwidth
    is set 10 MHz, while the transmission bandwidth is randomly sampled within the
    range of 10 to 30 Mbps, and the request data size is taken in the interval of
    [200, 500] Kb. Table 2 lists the parameter settings that are relevant to the study.

    Fig. 4. Four representative microservice applications. 6.2. Application setup
    In regards to the microservice-based application setup, we set up 3 different
    composed applications with a varying number of microservice instances, as illustrated
    in Fig. 4. The microservice application (a) serves as the primary subject for
    the evaluation experiment, while the remaining three applications, namely the
    sequential-based, tree-based, and DAG-based applications following the video processing
    architecture in [37], are employed to illustrate the efficacy of agent-based learning
    in diverse compositional model configurations. In order to establish appropriate
    deadlines for the various service plans within a fog platform, we took into account
    the resources consumption for each instance and the service delay when formulating
    the application parameters. Specifically, we examined the average service execution
    delay for each logical service plan to determine the computational resources necessary
    to complete each task and subsequently established a reasonable deadline by multiplying
    the service delay for each logical service plan by a factor representing the desired
    deadline. The range of this factor is between 1 and 2, as values increase, there
    is a corresponding relaxation of the imposed deadline constraints. Table 2. Simulation

    performance. The number of instances of each microservice component was determined
    on the basis of the request workloads and the distribution of users in the fog
    environment. For instance, the video processing workflow in Fig. 4 receives a
    significant amount of input data for video and audio processing, and each service
    plan requires a significant amount of computation. As such, we increased the number
    of instances of these types to accommodate the workload. Additionally, we adjusted
    the number of instances based on the source request to ensure that the processing
    capacity of instances is sufficient to complete all service plans distributed
    over the network within the specified deadline, while also taking into account
    the heterogeneity of the fog platform. Considering the trade-off between the deadline
    violation and load balancing, MIPS was trained using five different coefficient
    importance weights, with an average value of 100 episodes for each weight presented
    in Table 3. In the event that the weight is excessively large (e.g., around 0.8),
    the agent may opt to disregard the selection of certain instances and their respective
    loads in order to reduce the incidence of deadline violation. On the other hand,
    if is too small, approximately 0.2, some requests may be dropped due to routing
    and waiting delays, thereby resulting in an increase in request delay and, conversely,
    a more evenly distributed workload. In the comparative analysis, the results are
    evaluated with a weight of 0.8, prioritizing deadline violation over load balancing.

    In order to determine the most appropriate algorithm settings for the subsequent
    evaluation, we first assess the adaptability of agent learning under the influence
    of different neural network hyperparameters including the impact of batch size,
    learning rate and -decay. We set the number of episodes to = 160, with each episode
    being carried out over 1000 time steps. We construct the neural networks with
    four layers: an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden
    layers are set to have 128 neurons, and the input and output layers are equal
    to the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively. At first sight in Fig.
    5, we can observe that the learning curve differs for each of the hyperparameters,
    indicating their significance; in the learning phase. In Fig. 5(a), we set four
    different learning rates during training. As the learning rate increases, the
    model converges more quickly towards a sub-optimal set of weights, resulting in
    the instability of the policy as shown by the divergence of the model when the
    learning rate is set to 0.1 during the training. On the contrary, when the learning
    rate is small (e.g., lr=0.0001), the training process experiences less fluctuation
    in the cumulative rewards leading to fast convergence. In our study, we selected
    a learning rate of 0.0005, which achieved a slightly higher reward value. Fig.
    5(b), illustrates the impact of batch size on the convergence of the agent. A
    smaller batch size improves the estimation of the error gradient, leading to fast
    model learning. However, on the other hand, it takes a longer training time to
    converge. Interestingly, we observe that the agent converges faster and higher
    when the batch size is equal to 128. Upon considering the convergence speed, we
    opted for 128 as the batch size in our study. We adopt the -greedy approach to
    balance the learning process between exploration and exploitation. Fig. 5(c) shows
    the impact of -decay in the learning phase. As the model starts by exploring the
    environment randomly, we can notice that the larger the value of (i.e., ), the
    better the performance achievement as the model takes its time to explore the
    environment. On the other hand, the utilization of a smaller decay value (i.e.,
    ), the model may face challenges in achieving the optimal global policies due
    to reduced exploration phase, ultimately leading to the generation of suboptimal
    solutions. To achieve a dual objective of optimizing resource utilization during
    the learning process and ensuring more efficient convergence towards optimal policies,
    we choose a value of equal to 0.9. In conclusion, the model converges to the optimal
    policy approximately around 50 episodes. We use the Adam optimizer with a preferable
    learning rate of 0.0005 deducted by the agent’s training evaluation. The size
    of the experience buffer is set to with a mini-batch size of 128 transition samples
    per update. The final parameter settings used in the simulations are listed in
    Table 2. 6.4. Performance results To assess the performance of our proposed MIPS
    using Q-masking approach (referred to as MIPS-MASK) and Q-mapping approach (referred
    to as MIPS-MAP), we compare it with six baselines algorithms in terms of average
    request failure rate, load balancing, and average delay, as listed below. • CS-Random:
    This is a client-side random approach that distributes requests randomly among
    microservice instances. • CS-WRR: This is a client-side weighted round-robin algorithm
    designed to prevent congestion by distributing requests among microservice instances
    in a round-robin manner. Each microservice instance, equipped with a dedicated
    local load balancer, is assigned a weight that dynamically adjusts based on its
    CPU load. Consequently, instances with higher weights handle more requests compared
    to those with lower weights. • Best-fit algorithms: These are the greedy selection
    algorithms, which include the Load-Aware, Proximity-Aware, and Hybrid Load-Proximity-Aware
    algorithms presented in Algorithm 1, each of which is evaluated separately. •
    LBI-WFQ: Similar to [35], we have implemented a weighted fair queuing system,
    wherein each queue is associated with a distinct requested service plan, and the
    allocation of weights to these queues is determined upon the Load Balancing Indicator
    (LBI). The LBI computes the compromise between the load balance degree and communication
    affinity between each pair of microservices, which, in turn, determines the priority
    of each queue. However, the solution described in [35] assumes that identical
    microservice instances are deployed on the same node. This assumption does not
    always hold true, particularly within the realm of resource-constrained fog computing,
    which can affect the accuracy of the LBI indicator. To address this, we have enhanced
    the Load LBI to assist in selecting the appropriate physical service plan and
    have introduced weighted queues for each request based on their respective deadlines.
    For instance, in each time slot, incoming requests are ranked based on their deadlines
    within their respective queues, and the service plan is selected based on the
    LBI indicator, such as , where prioritizes reducing the load across each instance
    in the service plan, while prioritizes the dependent instances deployed on the
    same fog node. In the subsequent evaluation study, we employed the term “MIPS”
    to encompass both the MIPS-MAP and MIPS-MASK approaches. Similarly, the term “Greedy
    approaches” was utilized to encompass Load-Aware, Proximity-Aware, and Hybrid-Aware
    selection algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Comparison of different approaches based on accumulative
    rewards, average failure rate, load balancing degree, and average delay across
    episodes. 6.4.1. Performance analysis with increasing episode number Fig. 6(a)
    shows the evolution of the cumulative reward with respect to the training episode
    for each baseline approach. We can observe that our MIPS approach converges faster
    to its optimal policy around 50 episodes and achieves the highest reward when
    compared to the CS-Random, CS-WRR, LBI-WFQ and the Greedy approaches. In the initial
    episodes, it can be noticed that MIPS-MAP exhibits a higher reward compared to
    MIPS-MASK. This is because the Greedy algorithms employed in MIPS-MAP have a prior
    comprehension of the environment, allowing it to start with a reward of 350. On
    the other hand, MIPS-MASK starts by randomly selecting physical plans, which may
    result in considerable delays and consequently leads to lower cumulative rewards
    during the initial exploration. However, both policies eventually converge to
    approximately similar optimal values. Meanwhile, the Greedy approaches, LBI-WFQ,
    CS-WRR and CS-Random methods are not bound by adherence to any specific learning
    policy. As a consequence, the reward values obtained through these methods are
    low and approximately stable as the number of episodes increases. The cumulative
    reward is a holistic representation of both the scale of deadline violation and
    the degree of load balancing achieved. To confirm the model’s ability to jointly
    optimize multiple QoS metrics, we evaluate our approach with respect to the sub-objectives
    comprising the reward components in formula (17), which include the average failure
    rate, load balancing degree, and average delay. Fig. 6(b), depicts the average
    failure rate of requests in comparison to the baseline approaches (i.e., the number
    of requests that have not been processed before their respective deadlines). It
    is worth noting that the request rate and the number of IoT users per gateway
    were intentionally set at notably high values, exceeding 10 users per fog gateway
    and 50 requests within each time slot . Consequently, it is plausible that certain
    requests may become infeasible to accomplish prior to their respective deadlines.
    Explaining the fact that none of the approaches achieved a 0.0% failure rate.
    Overall, our proposed model has a relatively lower number of uncompleted requests
    after convergence. Specifically, MIPS is capable of processing over 90% of requests,
    while the CS-WRR, CS-Random, Load-Aware and LBI-WFQ approaches can process approximately
    between 50% and 60% of requests. In contrast, the Proximity-Aware method shows
    a relatively lower processing capability, managing approximately 40% of the requests.
    As anticipated, each individual Greedy algorithm produced different improvements,
    with the Hybrid-Aware approach achieving the most favorable rate of request completions.
    Conversely, the Proximity-Aware approach consistently selects the same nearest
    instances, causing a significant overload and producing the worst results. Nevertheless,
    the combination of the Greedy algorithms in MIPS-MAP provided the agent with the
    ability to select the most appropriate approach for each situation, ultimately
    leading to convergence levels comparable to the MIPS-MASK approach. On the other
    hand, the standard CS-Random, CS-WRR, and LBI-WFQ approaches achieved consistent
    and average results since they operate without knowledge of the network and the
    complexity of the fog platform. Fig. 6(c) shows the state of the workload among
    microservice instances during the episodes, with a particular focus on highlighting
    the fairness distribution of requests. We can observe that the proposed model
    consistently achieves a stable variance of the load among microservice instances
    after 20 episodes. This indicates that our model takes into account the current
    load conditions within the system and adapts its selection process accordingly
    while ensuring the timely completion of requests. Surprisingly, despite the fact
    that the CS-WRR and Load-Aware algorithms consider the load of instances during
    the selection process, the MIPS-MASK approach manages to achieve a more equitable
    distribution of workload. This is because considering the load of instances does
    not necessarily lead to a balanced workload allocation, particularly when there
    are heterogeneous requests with varying levels of CPU demand. On the other hand,
    CS-WRR achieves a higher degree of stability and a lower degree of load imbalance
    in comparison to LBI-WFQ. This is due to the fact that the LBI-WFQ approach considers
    transmission affinity during the selection process, which can result in the selection
    of instances in close proximity to each other, rather than effectively balancing
    the load between instances. In comparison to the MIPS-MAP approach, the MIPS-MASK
    yields better results as MIPS-MAP is restricted by the greedy algorithms, while
    MIPS-MASK has a larger exploration space, enabling it to gain expertise in selecting
    the optimal instances that accommodate different levels of CPU demands. When prioritizing
    the attainment of load balance with an importance weight of , we can observe that
    MIPS achieves a minimum of 25%, 28%, 30%, 60%, and 75% improvement compared to
    the CS-WRR, LBI-WFQ, CS-Random, Load-Aware, and Hybrid-Aware approaches, respectively.
    Further, we evaluated the performance in terms of the aggregated delay of requests
    as illustrated in Fig. 6(d). Regarding the learning approaches, initially, the
    overall request delay was observed to be higher due to the randomness actions
    and mapping algorithms which failed to appropriately select instances. However,
    after the 50th episode, the model acquired knowledge by interacting with the environment,
    consequently enhancing its policy and optimizing the number of offloaded requests
    it served. Interestingly, MIPS-MAP has outperformed MIPS-MASK approach on request
    delays. Because the MISP-MASK approach only focuses on preventing deadline violations,
    which can lead to many requests almost exceeding the deadline. In contrast, MISP-MAP
    utilizes greedy algorithms that take into account both the load and the proximity
    of instances, resulting in lower delays. Because the Proximity-Aware algorithm
    did not attain good results in the comparison, it is not included in the following
    comparative experiment. Download : Download high-res image (469KB) Download :

    under different architectures An efficient selection mechanism is characterized
    by the ability to maximize the cumulative rewards, given the constraints imposed
    by the environment and the architecture of the application. This assertion is
    visually evident through the illustrative Fig. 9 where different application architectures
    were evaluated, including a sequential application consisting of 4 microservices
    with a total of 4 logical plans, the tree-based application with 7 microservices
    and 7 logical plans and the DAG-based application encompassing 11 microservices
    and 3 logical plans. Upon examination, we can observe that the total reward achieved
    by the model varies across the three applications. This variation can be attributed
    to several factors such as the number of SPs and instances, as well as their placement
    in the fog platform, which differ in each scenario. However, it is noteworthy
    that our approach eventually converges to the optimal value for all three applications.
    Specifically, the DAG architecture attains a reward of 700 and converges at a
    faster rate, approximately 40 episodes, compared to other architectures. This
    outcome can be attributed to the reduced number of service plans present in the
    application, which facilitates the model to learn faster with fewer actions. However,
    despite having fewer SPs, the SEQ-based application achieves a relatively lower
    reward, primarily attributed to the placement of microservice instances in highly
    congested areas and significant distances from the request generation source.
    6.4.3. Performance under different request arrival rates and numbers of users
    per gateway The performance of the microservice-based application-oriented fog
    computing platform is influenced by multiple factors, including the number of
    IoT users, their distributions, the microservice instances placement, and the
    network traffic within the fog platform. Therefore, we also show the performance
    of the model under different parameter settings such as the request arrival rates,
    the number of users per gateway, the variable request sources and the deadline
    relaxation factor. Throughout the experiment, we computed the average performance
    across 100,000 offloaded requests for each specific parameter setting within the
    designated time slot. The durations of the warm-up and cooldown periods are not
    pre-established in the experiment. Upon the arrival of an IoT request, the DRL
    agent dynamically routes the request to the appropriate service plan. After processing
    the final request in a given configuration, we transition to the next set, following
    to the predetermined evaluation parameters. To mitigate errors introduced from
    the warm-up and cooldown intervals, which denote the initial and final periods
    when the proposed model is inactive before reaching a stable, steady-state region,
    we excluded the initial and final 5% of requests. This ensures that the evaluation
    results accurately reflect the system’s stable operational state. In Fig. 7, Fig.
    8, we evaluate the impact of the number of requests on both the average failure
    rate and load balancing. The experiment was conducted with a variable request
    rate ranging from 10 to 60 constraint of a maximum of 10 users per gateway. As
    depicted in Fig. 7(a), the selection policy gradually fails to allocate requests
    to their appropriate instances as the number of requests increases. This is due
    to the saturation of the instance queue, which results in extended waiting delays
    and ultimately contributing to the overall delay. Nevertheless, MIPS achieves
    the lowest failure rate. On average, MIPS is capable of reducing the average failure
    rate by 65%, 62%, 58%, 52% and 45%, when compared to LBI-WFQ, Load-Aware, CS-WRR,
    CS-Random and Hybrid-Aware, respectively. When the request rate is high (i.e.,
    60 ), MIPS-MASK showed a slightly better performance compared to MIPS-MAP, highlighting
    the limitation of relying on the local optima of the greedy algorithms during
    the selection process. Nevertheless, the overall results suggest that MIPS has
    superior exploration ability, which allows for the identification of pivotal selection
    decisions to reduce request processing delay in varying overload scenarios. Download

    Performance comparison under different architectures. Similarly, we varied the
    number of users per gateway with a fixed constraint of 50 as illustrated in Fig.
    7(b). It is noteworthy that the Hybrid-Aware approach in both cases outperforms
    alternative strategies, primarily due to its ability to discriminate between proximate
    fog nodes and prioritize instances with lower resource utilization. It is important
    to note that due to the dynamic nature of the fog platform, the standard baseline
    methods such as CS-random and CS-WRR exhibited a high failure rate of requests,
    even when the number of users per fog gateway was small (i.e., 4 ). Despite the
    fact that LBI-WFQ prioritizes requests with minimum deadlines, it did not give
    good results. This is primarily because LBI-WFQ fails to capture the overall request
    delay and merely selects the instance that minimizes the current LBI (a trade-off
    between the instance load and instance affinity) at each time step, without considering
    a long-term instance selection strategy. Furthermore, in systems where microservice
    instances are dispersed geographically, the concept of affinity can be ineffective,
    potentially leading to the selection of instances situated far apart from each
    other. In such scenarios, this can introduce additional network delay, ultimately
    resulting in a higher rate of request failures. Conversely, our proposed approach
    achieved the lowest failure rate, and it maintained its performance as the number
    of users increased from 4 to 20. In the context of load balancing, we can clearly
    see that the variability of the request rate and user distribution between fog
    nodes is lower for baseline methods than for the proposed algorithm in Fig. 8.
    The present results are consistent with expectations, given that the evaluation
    proceeded with an importance weight of 0.8 for deadline violation. This weightage
    signifies that the proposed algorithm effectively employs a rational offloading
    approach, by minimizing the overall request failure, while simultaneously maintaining
    a stable load equilibrium across all instances. Nevertheless, when the importance
    weight was set to for load balancing degree, MIPS successfully attained a lower
    degree of imbalance, particularly in the event of an overload scenario characterized
    by a request rate of 50 and users per gateway. Download : Download high-res image

    different numbers of fog gateways. 6.4.4. Performance under different IoT user
    distributions The next evaluation is to appraise the capacity of MISP to effectively
    sustain fog platforms and IoT applications that experience variable numbers of
    sources from IoT user devices. Fig. 10 illustrates the average failure rate, considering
    a constraint of a maximum of 10 IoT users per fog gateway, a fixed request rate
    of 50 , and a varying number of sources ranging between 6 and 10. Respectively,
    we can see that the failure rate exhibits a linear decrease as the number of sources
    increases. The observed phenomenon is caused by two factors. Firstly, the reduction
    in the number of sources by removing the fog gateways in close proximity to the
    deployed instances has led to an increase in routing delays, ultimately leading
    to some requests exceeding their respective deadlines. Secondly, maintaining high
    request rates with limited sources has resulted in a concentration of a larger
    number of requests towards a single fog gateway, resulting in a subsequent prolongation
    of the access delay. Overall, The MIPS algorithm achieves superior long-term performance
    with a slight improvement of the MISP-MAP approach compared to the MIPS-Mask approach.
    In comparison with the CS-Random, Load-Aware, CS-WRR, LBI-WFQ and Hybrid-Aware
    schemes, MIPS can reduce the failure rate by 82%, 80%, 74%, 74% and 72%, respectively.

    Fig. 11. Performance comparison under different deadline factors. 6.4.5. Performance
    under different deadline factors Fig. 11 depicts the influence of the deadline
    factor over the performance of selection approaches. The observation reveals that
    the decline in the failure request rate of the approaches is associated with an
    increase in the deadline factor. This trend can be attributed to the gradual relaxation
    of deadline constraints, providing the algorithms with a greater pool of alternatives
    for instance selection. When the deadline factor is 0.8, our proposed approach
    reduces the failure request rate by 50% compared to the baseline. On the other
    hand, when setting the factor to a high value (i.e., 1.6), The baseline approaches
    were unable to attain a request failure rate below 10%. Nonetheless, our model’s
    performance remained effectively sustained. 6.5. Limitations Despite the positive
    results demonstrated by the MIPS-MASK and MIPS-MAP approaches, the choice between
    them will depend on the particular use case and context, as both have their respective
    strengths and weaknesses. • Scalability: The MIPS-MASK approach presents notable
    challenges in terms of scalability, particularly when compared to the MIPS-MAP
    method. In the context of overload/underload situations for an application, it
    is crucial to have the capability to scale specific microservices or groups of
    microservices that experience either low or high pressure, in order to free up
    resources or address potential overloads. However, the design of MIPS-MASK introduces
    complications to this process, as the selection representation is inherently bound
    to a fixed number of instances and service plans. Consequently, if the application
    requires a scaling step or the integration of a new service plan, the model must
    be retrained to account for the changes, which can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive
    undertaking. • Applicability: The use of Deep Q-learning in MIPS-MASK can increase
    the complexity and difficulty of learning when dealing with a large number of
    service plans. This is because it leads to an increase in the number of available
    actions, which makes it challenging for the agent to explore and learn the optimal
    policy. On the other hand, MIPS-MAP approach is limited to the use of the Greedy
    algorithms, which can result in additional processing time for each request since
    it must first select the appropriate selection algorithm, which is followed by
    additional processing to offload the request. Moreover, Greedy algorithms are
    characterized by limited exploration and a lack of flexibility since they are
    designed to make locally optimal choices at each step. This means that the algorithm
    may not consider other potentially superior alternative selections, thereby restricting
    its ability to deal with a wide range of scenarios. Thus, it can be argued that
    MIPS-MASK is more suited for small-scale and stable applications. While MIPS-MAP
    is better suited for more flexible applications. 7. Conclusion To address the
    challenge of selecting microservice instances in a dynamic fog computing platform
    that exhibit a time-varying network state, multiple dependent microservice instances
    and dynamic request generation, a Double-DQN-based approach has been formulated
    and developed in this paper. The selection decisions aim to determine the optimal
    physical service plans, including the requested microservice instances by IoT
    devices connected to the fog platform, with the aim of minimizing the occurrence
    of deadline violations and load imbalances in the IoT application. Two selection
    schemes, namely the Q-mapping and Q-masking approach, have been designed to effectively
    address the plan-dependent problem. Simulation outcomes have demonstrated that
    the proposed model can achieve a noteworthy improvement in performance when compared
    to the benchmarks in terms of average failure rate, load balancing, and consistency.
    In the future work, we plan to investigate the scalability issues, with the objective
    of incorporating the microservice selection policy in conjunction with auto-scaling
    decisions within a more complex and dynamic fog platform. CRediT authorship contribution

    of edible fruits or vegetables. Limited areas of the fruitage disease remain explored,
    necessitating further investigation into the research gaps and challenges identified
    for implementing the smart practices in real-field farmlands. In this paper, a
    comprehensive survey of recent advancements in fruit and vegetable disease identification
    and classification is presented. The technology-wise state-of-the-art findings,
    gaps, challenges, and future opportunities for fruitage disease recognition have
    been presented, covering 99 research articles. Moreover, the corpus of publicly
    available fruit and vegetable datasets has been investigated, with the existing
    gaps, improvements, and future requirements. The research paper concludes with
    challenges and a future outlook that promises to be a very significant and valuable

    learningInternet-of-ThingsFruit and vegetable datasets 1. Introduction Agriculture
    and horticulture are the largest economic contributors in India. Approximately
    58% of the Indian population still depends on agriculture for their livelihood
    (IBEF, 2023). About 20.19% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Indian economy
    is contributed by the agricultural sector (GDP, 2022). As per the reports of the
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), India is the second largest global producer
    of fresh fruits and vegetables, yielding 12% of overall production (ICAR, 2022).
    National Horticulture Board Statistics (NHBS) recorded that India has produced
    a cumulative of 102.48 and 200.45 million metric tons of fruits and vegetables,
    respectively, in the year 2020–21 (APEDA, 2022). Fruit cultivation covers nearly
    9.6 million hectares of land, while vegetable farming covers 10.86 million hectares
    of land. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of primary fruits and vegetables across
    different zonal regions of the country. Moreover, the FAO of the United Nations
    claimed that food security demands would be the world’s prime concern in the upcoming
    years due to the rapid expansion of the world population. The Ministry of Food
    Processing Industries (MFPI) of India reported that approximately million metric
    tons of fruit and vegetable costing 10.6 billion USD deteriorates annually due
    to lack of proper management and technology. The objective of the United Nations’
    sustainable development is to achieve “Zero Hunger by 2030” across the world.
    However, the COVID-19 pandemic made it harder to overcome the global nutrition
    crisis and showed the significance of technological support to confront hunger,
    malnutrition, and non-communicable diseases linked to diet (FAO, 2022b). India
    ranked 107 among 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index-2022 (GHI, 2022). The
    National Family Health Survey (2019–21) reported that around 200 million Indian
    children under five years were undernourished (Survey, 2022). Fruit and vegetable
    demand is jeopardized by the proliferation of disease, insects, pests, nutritional
    deficiencies, and fertilizer deficits, causing considerable production losses.
    The disease diagnosis at an early stage is the primary requirement for crop protection
    and epidemic control. The conventional methods employ visual inspection and knowledgeable
    human experts for early disease detection, which are sometimes less available,
    especially for small-scale farmers in developing nations (Lee et al., 2020). Additionally,
    less experienced farmers are not able to make smart decisions regarding pest identification,
    resulting in a dwindling agriculture economy and efficacy. Moreover, ingesting
    microbially contaminated vegetables and fruits may pose a grave risk to human
    health. World Health Organization (WHO) reported that nearly 600 million individuals
    become ill annually due to food contamination (WHO, 2022). Consequently, this
    crucial problem necessitates incorporating innovative and practicable technical
    solutions to ensure the mechanism for the fruit disease detecting system. Additionally,
    it will be fruitful in packaging, quick transportation, valuation, dietary guidance,
    and consumer health. Agriculture 4.0 has revolutionized the agriculture industry
    with the alliance of several intelligent and innovative techniques, thus helping
    agrarians in improving the quantity, fertility, and quality of fruits and vegetable
    crops (Sharma et al., 2022). With the continuous development of precision farming
    techniques, agriculture, and other allied sectors have compensated for the production
    loss by implementing autonomous disease detection techniques using Computation
    Intelligence (CI), real-time sensors, computer vision, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV), and Neural Networks (NN) to overcome the issue of the fruit production
    scarcity, time lacking, high cost and requirement of extensive skilled and experienced
    labors. In a nutshell, precision farming plays a crucial role in acquiring timely
    and precious information about disease prediction, thus providing effective methods
    for aiding decision-making and intelligent management in several fruit and vegetable
    domains such as autonomous harvesting robots, grading and sorting, category identification,
    real-time fruit disease classification and prediction, and quality evaluation.
    Recently, a number of machine learning, deep learning, and Internet-of-Things-based
    techniques have been introduced by several researchers for early prediction of
    fruit and vegetable disease. Intelligent technological support for early disease
    identification is the need of the hour for sustainable agricultural development.
    Moreover, finding the current research trends, future opportunities, and optimal
    models based on the parameters, datasets, experimental scenarios, and multiple
    hardware configurations is still a challenging task for the researchers (Dhaka
    et al., 2021). As an effective data-driven framework, machine learning models
    and other imaging techniques offer precise, generalized methods for complex relationships
    between massive ranges of variables (Sharma et al., 2020). Deep learning methods,
    especially Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and their derivatives, have recently
    gained substantial attention and offered practical approaches to complex real-world
    agricultural problems. CNN trains using image features and automatically extracts
    contextual information and global descriptors, which significantly reduces errors
    and offers several benefits over conventional image processing techniques. Deep
    Transfer Learning (DTL) has also been significantly used to develop reliable models
    on customized datasets (Jin et al., 2020, Hasan et al., 2023). The sensor-generated
    data collected and communicated through the Internet-of-Things, and cyber-agriculture
    methods may be used by agrarians to monitor their fruit and vegetable crops remotely.
    As a result, the combination of contemporary UAV camera sensor technology and
    deep learning algorithms might be a viable approach for early fruit disease identification
    (Quy et al., 2022). Thus, an exhaustive literature survey is necessary to consolidate
    the recent technological advancements and challenges in smart agriculture for
    the fruit and vegetable industry. The overall contribution of the study is detailed

    background and motivation The economic growth rate of developing countries is
    closely tied to agriculture. Fruits and vegetables encompass a broad spectrum
    of plant foods that differ substantially in calorie and nutritional density. Fruits
    and vegetables are a great source of fiber, which has been linked to a reduced
    risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity. As per the reports from the FAO, about
    30%–40% of the fruits and vegetables are lost due to pest attacks globally (FAO,
    2022a). Moreover, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) has estimated a 10%–15%
    loss of overall production in the upcoming years. Therefore, accurate and timely
    estimation of disease severity, defects incidence, and negative consequences of
    disorders on the fruits and vegetables is crucial for improving pesticide efficacy,
    fruit & vegetable breeding, and productivity. The traditional disease identification
    method includes studying visual pathogen symptoms (rots, blight, anthracnose)
    using fruit phenotype by trained subject experts, which is labor-intensive and
    tedious. Nevertheless, visible symptoms are subject to human bias and temporal
    variation, causing inaccurate and varied outcomes. Therefore, autonomous early
    disease recognition and detection have been identified as an emerging field in
    intensive plant research, which can aid in stopping disease spread in other parts
    of the fruits and vegetables like roots and leaves. To transform the conventional
    agriculture system to ecological agriculture 4.0, different disruptive intelligent
    technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, Internet-of-Things, drones,
    and wireless sensor networks are used to mitigate the risks associated with fruitage
    diseases (da Silveira et al., 2021) as picturized in Fig. 2. Ecological informatics
    bridges the gap between ecosystem and informatics by combining ecological values,
    leading-edge technologies, and massive environmental factors to better fruit and
    vegetable disease detection and pest control. Moreover, fruit pathogens thrive
    in an environment with ecological factors like high humidity and wetness, overwatering,
    and soil contamination, which causes the spread of bacteria, viruses, and fungus
    (Caleb et al., 2013). Fruit and vegetable diseases lower yield estimation and
    cause quality and quantity degradation, resulting in loss of commercial production.
    To remedy this, insecticides and pesticides are used, which may increase the toxic
    content in food products. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the disease early
    to minimize pesticide consumption. Table 1 presents literature studies performed
    in the last six years to automatically detect and classify fruit and vegetable
    disease, aggregating 22 available studies. Different researchers examine the impact
    of solely smart techniques for single and multiple cultivars of fruits and vegetables.
    Iqbal et al. (2018) highlighted the impact of computer vision & machine learning
    algorithms for early disease detection in citrus species. Chandrasekaran et al.
    (2019) suggested a comprehensive survey about near-infrared and hyperspectral
    spectroscopy on multiple agro-products using computer vision imaging systems.
    Naranjo-Torres et al. (2020) urged the impact of CNN and image processing in the
    field of the fruit and vegetable domain. Bhargava and Bansal (2020c) introduced
    an exhaustive survey on the disease severity estimation of multiple apple cultivars
    using spectral imaging techniques. Behera et al. (2020) addressed the fruit grading
    and disease classification problem using computer vision and machine learning
    methods. Patil et al. (2021a) examined the grading and sorting of dragon fruit
    based on their maturity level in the computational intelligence field. Dhiman
    et al. (2022b) summarized the survey on the quality evaluation and future opportunities
    of the multiple cultivars based on the disease severity levels using machine and
    deep learning algorithms. Sivaranjani et al. (2022) presented an overview of the
    disease classification for varied agro-products. Rizzo et al. (2023) explored
    the different non-destructive methods for ripeness categorization in the fruit
    & vegetable industry. The problems of disease detection in fruit images persist
    due to considerable variations in natural surface color in different fruits and
    their species, color, and texture. However, no study in the literature has been
    performed, which includes an extensive survey covering state-of-the-art technologies
    for the automated disease detection of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, researchers
    find it hard to choose an effective model based on the parameters, datasets, experimental
    scenarios, and multiple hardware configurations due to the availability of a multitude
    of research works in implementing innovative agriculture models for predicting
    fruit and vegetable diseases (Dhaka et al., 2021). Thus, there is a need for an
    exhaustive literature survey from the existing research work that can help the
    researchers in identifying a suitable innovative model as per pre-processing techniques,
    forecasting, and classification of different diseases in multiple cultivars of
    fruits and vegetables. Thus, a Systematic Literature Survey (SLR) plays a tremendously
    significant role in understanding the controlling factors to avoid similar agro-product
    losses in the future. The primary contribution of the survey is to analyze the
    current fruitage industry scenario at the empirical and qualitative levels and
    disseminate information regarding the progress of Agriculture 4.0 at the global
    level. Download : Download high-res image (798KB) Download : Download full-size

    and present the survey of existing machine learning, deep learning, and Internet-of-Things-based
    methods for disease detection and monitoring in multiple cultivars of fruits &
    vegetables. The current research survey follows the standard methodology pattern
    to make the study work transparent and impartial regarding information selection
    and result representation (Keele et al., 2007). The study starts with research
    questions and their motivation and ends with the final selection of qualified
    research papers. Study Selection Process: The selection of the research papers
    has been carried out using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
    Meta-analysis (PRISM) technique (Liberati et al., 2009) which contains (1) Initial
    identification; (2) Screening or introductory filtering; (3) Secondary filtering;
    and (4) Exclusion and inclusion. Table 2 addresses the research objectives and
    their respective motivation in the field of precision farming. It helps to design
    the present review paper’s complete research framework, which can help to provide
    concise and relevant research information in the fruit & vegetable disease classification
    domain. The next phase of the study is to search for significant existing research
    papers on the relevant topic for the custom year range from 2018 to 2023. A pilot
    search using specific keywords has been performed through multiple digital repositories
    and search engines like Web of Science and Google Scholar to collect related information
    about the fruitage disease framework. The repository list chosen for review work
    includes Elsevier, Springer, ACM, MDPI, IEEE Xplore, etc. The research papers
    were obtained using all possible combinations of auxiliary keywords that were
    screened to get the best source for the answers to the defined research objectives.

    After collecting the research papers, screening was performed to get the current
    trends in the fruit or vegetable disease recognition system as the standards suggested
    by Dybå and Dingsøyr (2008). The overall statistical flow of review papers selection
    is depicted in Fig. 3. The preliminary screening step includes the papers that
    match and satisfy the pre-defined research objectives and titles. The secondary
    screening is performed after reading the abstract of the papers collected during
    the primary phase. The abstract gives a brief idea about the proposed research
    methodology, datasets, and result comparison, thus, helping to make a notable
    repository. Initially, more than 200 papers were included from the aforementioned
    digital library based on the current technologies. The research papers having
    duplicate and irrelevant titles were eliminated to design an optimized library.
    The screening process has been employed to include the papers in the context of
    smart agriculture, satisfying research questions, search criteria, abstract, publishing
    year, and full article, resulting in 123 papers. For instance, most research papers
    were excluded due to plant leaf disease identification instead of edible fruit
    or vegetable itself. Therefore, the outcome of the study is 99 primary studies
    which will become the foundation of the review work. Table 3. Search strings.

    Fig. 3. Different steps involved in Systematic Literature Review. 4. Machine learning
    Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of computer intelligence that emphasizes
    useful knowledge-driven algorithms and self-learning of machines for good prediction
    and classification. These algorithms have the extrinsic capability for self-learning
    the various field applications affecting agriculture, such as disease detection,
    yield prediction, maturity level, evapotranspiration or water management, stress
    prediction, and fruit grading. Food defects are identified as abnormal changes
    that may hamper the functional growth of the plant, which can be caused by some
    viruses, fungi, or bacteria. Early prediction of such pathological disorders could
    reduce food pre and post-harvest losses. However, farmers must ensure significant
    enhancement in food production by adopting leading-edge ML technologies in intelligent
    or precision farming. Decision tree (Dai et al., 2016), -nearest neighbors (KNN)
    (Singh and Kaur, 2018), random forest (Chaudhary et al., 2016), and Support Vector
    Machine (SVM) (Yu et al., 2018), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (Dhiman et
    al., 2021), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Jahanbakhshi and Kheiralipour,
    2020), Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) (Langford et al., 2019), Histogram
    of Oriented Gradient (HOG) (Roy et al., 2021b), K-means (Bhargava and Bansal,
    2020b), etc. are some of the classical exemplars of ML algorithm used for the
    fruit disease detection. Table 4 depicts the basic ML formulations used in the
    disease classification for the fruit & vegetable domains. Table 4. Machine learning

    using ML techniques The manual fruitage disease inspection and grading are tedious
    as they suffer from poor accuracy due to unskilled human efforts. Recently, a
    number of ML-based methods have been introduced for the automated detection of
    fruit and vegetable diseases. Table 5 presents an overview of the recent studies
    related to fruit/vegetable disease identification, classification, grading, and
    sorting using machine learning-based methods. Habib et al. (2020) developed an
    exploratory online architecture for autonomous disease classification in jackfruit
    tissue using a ML approach. K-Means grouping-based segmentation method was exploited
    to segregate the infected region from the non-infected part of the jackfruit image.
    A linear kernel-based SVM outperformed the other state-of-the-art, achieving a
    recognition accuracy of 88.67%. Similarly, ML algorithms can be integrated with
    optimization algorithms for best feature selection. The optimization algorithms
    adjust the model hyperparameters and optimize the mean square error between the
    actual and predicted output. A whale-optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    model for tomato disease identification was introduced by Kumar et al. (2020b).
    The Firefly algorithm was used for efficient morphological-driven color image
    segmentation, which was further processed by Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM).
    El-Dosuky et al. (2020) developed a Cockroach Swam Optimization (CSO) optimized
    SVM method for apple disease classification. The image features were extracted
    using the K-means algorithm, which was further classified by CSO optimized SVM
    method. CSO fine-tuned three attributes ( representing non–linear hyperplanes,
    P representing error penalty, and D representing hyperplane splitting the data),
    thus generating 140 different SVM model variants. Ji et al. (2018) proposed an
    apple grading method utilizing the color and surface defects using PSO-optimized
    SVM. The fruit segmentation from the background noise with color feature extraction
    was carried out by Otsu’s segmentation method for proper H values. Additionally,
    the external defects boundary of the fruit was identified using the hysteresis
    threshold canny edge detection method for appropriate I values and segmented utilizing
    a morphological approach. SVM and their predecessors play a crucial role in the
    classification network. Bhargava and Bansal (2020a) presented an SVM-based fruit
    classification and defect prediction method. The quality of food was ranked into
    three classes, namely, 1,2, and defective based on the disease severity levels.
    The experiments revealed that the SVM-based classification outperformed other
    considered methods showing 98.48% fruit disease classification accuracy. Similarly,
    Mojumdar and Chakraborty (2021) acknowledged a multi-class SVM for orange tissues
    disease classification. The image partitioning was performed using K-means clustering,
    whereas the GLCM method was used for feature extraction. Likewise, Doh et al.
    (2019) developed an SVM-based method for citrus disease detection. The infected
    citrus region was segmented using the K-Means algorithm based on four phenotypic
    attributes, namely, color, structure hole, texture, and physical appearance. The
    author experimented that SVM out-competed ANN-based methods by showing a mean
    accuracy of 93.12%. On the same footprints, Bhargava and Bansal (2020b) introduced
    an autonomous fruit grading framework to detect the defect of the ‘Golden Delicious’
    apple. Images were segmented using Otsu’s and K-means clustering followed by best
    geometric, statistical & textural feature vector extraction, which were then fed
    to SVM. Almadhor et al. (2021) developed a framework for disease classification
    and detection in guava species. The paper experimented with different classifiers
    (Cubic SVM, Fine KNN, Bagged Tree, Complex Tree, Boosted Tree) for disease level
    and image level classification. It was concluded that the bagged tree classification
    method achieved 99.00% accuracy against the healthy guava fruit. El-aziz et al.
    (2020) implemented a computer vision-based apple disease detection and classification
    system using SVM and KNN. The proposed system extracted the textual features,
    whereas, the K-means algorithm was used for segmenting the extracted features.
    Furthermore, a low-cost inline tomato grading system was developed by Ireri et
    al. (2019) using computer vision and machine learning methods. The ROI images
    were segmented using the average value of the Calyx and Stalk Scar (CS) areas.
    The paper evaluated the performance of the proposed method and was validated on
    four state-of-the-art SVM methods, namely, various SVM likewise cubic-SVM (C-SVM),
    quadratic-SVM (Q-SVM), linear-SVM (L-SVM), and radial basis function-SVM (RBF-SVM),
    decision tree, ANN, and random forest for different gradings based on the severity.
    The hybridized RBF-SVM method outperformed other hybrid models by achieving 97.09%
    accuracy. Yu et al. (2018) fused computer vision and spectral imaging to identify
    the physical deformation of Nanguo pears. The conventional GLCM method was employed
    for homogeneity, energy, contrast, entropy, and correlation discriminative texture
    feature vectors, which were tested against SVM and backpropagation networks. Additionally,
    the segmentation technique helps to partition the images into meaningful ROI,
    where each region represents a distinct object. Dubey et al. (2020) implemented
    a fast and effective disease recognition framework using SVM. The resized grayscale
    images were carried out for infected area segmentation using canny edge detection
    to classify fruitage in defective and non-defective binary and first, second &
    final defect multi-classification. Additionally, unsupervised learning methods
    can be utilized for assembling the defective area. The research paper showed that
    the Gaussian Mixer Model (GMM) segmentation method overshadows the other image
    processing-based segmentation method by showing a silhouette score of 0.63 (Roy
    et al., 2021b). Clustering, an unsupervised learning method, divides the data
    into clusters where data points are more similar to one another than to those
    in other clusters. Kumari et al. (2021) presented a backpropagation-based mango
    grading method. The Extended Fuzzy K-Means grouping algorithm was employed for
    detecting infected segmented areas, which experimentally performed better than
    Fuzzy C-Means and traditional K-Means clustering. The color, texture, and geometric
    features were optimally extracted using Maximally Correlated Principal Component
    Analysis (MCPCA). Lastly, severely infected regions were classified by the Backpropagation
    Based Discriminant Classifier (BBDC) into three categories (good, average, and
    bad) Analogously, James and Sujatha (2021) implemented a web-based Hybrid Neural
    clustering method that exploited the feed-forward neural network and K-Means clustering
    approach for training and testing the apple disease classification. The proposed
    algorithm segmented the diseased part using the Maximum Likelihood Pixel Fusion
    method and feature extraction using the Essential Factor Investigator (EFI) method.
    Kumar et al. (2020a) devised a dual classification system using cascading of two
    SVM models for tomato disease classification. In the first stage, binary classification
    was performed to determine tomato and non-tomato species using species feature
    vectors designed from the captured images. The color features were used to classify
    the tomato quality based on the infectious level. The infected area was then segmented
    through the Gabor wavelet transform for good or bad binary classification, which
    was then cascaded to SVM for classifying the disease category. In a similar manner,
    an SVM-based method for mango and apple disease identification was introduced
    by Hemamalini et al. (2022). The -means-based segmentation was performed to detect
    the infectious area using color and texture features. The experimental results
    affirmed that the developed SVM-based method outperformed other considered methods
    by achieving 98.00% accuracy. Table 5. Machine learning fruit & vegetable disease

    algorithms allow the ML models to map input variables to continuous output for
    fruit disease detection. Al-Sanabani et al. (2019) identified the freshness level
    of multiple cultivars of mangoes by comparing the Partial Least Square (PLS) &
    SVM regression models. The collected Near Infrared (NIR) images were calibrated
    using extended multiplicative signal correction and the Gaussian method for noise
    removal, which were further processed using an MA871 optical machine (Refractometers,
    2022) for refractive index measurement to determine the Brix sugar concentration.
    Similarly, the Logistic Support Vector Regression (LSVR) based sorting method
    for six fruits and vegetables, namely, bananas, apples, lime, orange, pomegranate,
    and guava was implemented by Ghodke et al. (2022). The shape features were extracted
    using the Fast Fourier Convert (FFC) method, which became fed to the LSVR classifier
    into low and high-quality fruits for binary disease classification. Sugiarti et
    al. (2021) investigated an image processing-driven solution for disease recognition
    in apple fruits. The image samples were segmented to identify the ROI containing
    the infected part using the -means grouping method, which was further fed to the
    GLCM technique to obtain homogeneity, energy, contrast, and correlation discriminative
    texture feature vectors. The experimental results witnessed that the developed
    naive-bayes classifier surpassed other considered methods by achieving the disease
    classification accuracy of 96.43%. Mohammed et al. (2023) designed the autonomous
    palm mite detection in two cultivars, namely Khalas and Barhee, of the date fruits.
    Decision Forest Regression (DFR) and Linear Regression (LR) models were used to
    extract the meteorological and physicochemical features. The experiments showed
    the developed DFR model showed better accuracy with . Furthermore, a non-destructive
    nutrient detection for pears was proposed using a two-class decision jungle network
    (Dubey and Rocha, 2023). The geometrical features, namely, area, perimeter, eccentricity,
    diameter, major and minor axis, and orientation, were retrieved from the dataset
    and classified into calcium-deficient and healthy pears. The proposed method achieved
    98.00% accuracy. Tripathi and Maktedar (2023) introduced an ensemble classifier
    that utilized random forest, SVM, KNN, and Lion-Binary crossover mask base Whale
    Optimized (LBWO) ANN for automatic mango grading. The RGB images were denoised
    using the adaptive Gaussian method. Gray Level Run-Length Matrix (GLRM), NIR,
    and GLCM features were extracted from the processed dataset. The extracted feature
    vectors were reduced to the principal vectors using the PCA method, which was
    then fed to the ensembled network for disease classification. 5. Deep learning
    The study of infectious and non-infectious pathogenic agent traits is the foundation
    for agro-product disease prognosis and epidemiology. The factors affecting fruit
    and vegetable symptoms may be in the context of environmental conditions, climate
    conditions, accessibility of pathogens, and many more. The extensive methodology
    for disease diagnosis is to identify the fruitage lesion followed by pre-processing
    and detection (Moore et al., 2001). Classical machine learning and deep learning
    are two mainstream methods in precision agriculture. Recently, Deep Learning (DL)
    techniques have been significantly used by researchers for the early identification
    of fruit & vegetable diseases due to automatic feature extraction. The DL techniques
    have been revolutionized and recognized after winning the 2012 ImageNet Large
    Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) (ImageNet, 2023) by AlexNet architecture
    (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) over traditional SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). The
    winning architectures in the successive years are ZFNet, GoogLeNet(InceptionV1),
    VGGNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, SENet, and PNASNet-5, respectively. The top-5 error rate
    has been reduced from 15.3% to 3.8%, which proves the direct correlation between
    classification accuracy and model depth (He et al., 2015). 5.1. Fruit & vegetable
    disease detection using DL techniques The nutritional content of fruits and vegetables
    has boosted the researchers to mine the precision agriculture methods by appending
    more depth to the pre-trained deep models. In the last decade, DL models have
    received significant attention from researchers and agronomists due to their ability
    to automate feature extraction and classification of images with minute regions
    of interest. Table 6 outlines the recent research work carried out in the fruitage
    domain exploiting DL methods. Janarthan et al. (2020) designed a region-based
    lightweight deep model for classifying citrus diseases. The proposed model consisted
    of three major components: deep siamese embedding, clustering module, and neural
    architecture. The deep embedding module calculated the patch embeddings of all
    eligible patches using Euclidean distance, which were grouped using the -means
    clustering. Dhiman et al. (2022a) proposed the classification model to detect
    the low, medium, high, and healthy severity levels of citrus. The images were
    segmented by the felzenszwalb graph method, whereas the Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
    method was used to cluster similar regions. The highest similarity index regions
    were merged to determine the Intersection over Union (IoU) regions which became
    an input to the Adam-optimized VGGNet model. The optimization methods can be incorporated
    with deep belief networks to optimize the hyperparameters. Rehman et al. (2022)
    presented a WAO and MobileNetV2 & DenseNet201 hybrid model for citrus disease
    detection. The image dataset was expanded using geometric augmentation, followed
    by an average-based threshold contrast stretching for image quality enhancement.
    The classification was performed using five classifiers namely, three state-of-the-art
    SVM classifiers, ensemble subspace discriminant, and LDA. Likewise, Tian et al.
    (2021) utilized the different network depths to better classify apple disease.
    The optimized InceptionV4 and Inception-ResNetV2 models were concatenated with
    the multi-scale framework (Szegedy et al., 2015). An improved You Only Look Once
    (YOLO) model was leveraged for identifying and computing the number of olive fruit
    flies (Mamdouh and Khattab, 2021). The author exploited the negative training
    sample images by appending original Dacus Image Recognition Toolkit (DIRT) images
    with Leeds butterfly datasets (LEEDS, 2022). The images were normalized using
    the yellow average color method to unify the trap background color. An improved
    U-Net architecture was presented by Roy et al. (2021a). It enhanced the U-Net
    architecture by incorporating a convolution2D, max pooling 2D, and convolution
    transpose 2D layer between the encoder and decoder. The depth level in the suggested
    En-UNet architecture was increased from 128 to 512, resulting in increased disease
    classification accuracy. Yasmeen et al. (2021) introduced the InceptionV3 and
    ResNet-18 models for citrus feature extraction, which are optimized by an Improved
    Genetic Algorithm (ImGA). The disease identification was performed using ten state-of-the-art
    methods. Experimental results demonstrated that the F-KNN method surpassed the
    other remaining considered methods in terms of accuracy and F-measure. Yao et
    al. (2022) presented a mask-scoring R-CNN model where the loss function of the
    original R-CNN model was replaced with the focal loss to reduce classification
    error and class imbalance problems. An improved instance segmentation method was
    used to identify, locate, and segment the lesion for prominent regions from the
    21 classes of the peach. Table 6. Deep learning fruit & vegetable disease detection

    can be further deployed to study the internal defects Consequently, an improved
    YOLO-JD architecture was suggested for real-time disease detection in jute (Li
    et al., 2022). The Spatial Pyramid Pooling Module (SPPM), Deep Sand Clock Feature
    Extraction Module (DSCFEM), and Sand Clock Feature Extraction Module (SCFEM) were
    used for high-quality feature extraction. Lastly, the final detection module,
    in combination with the Non-Max Suppression (NMS) method, was used to select the
    final anchor box. Oppenheim et al. (2019) addressed the disease identification
    problem in potato tubers using deeply improved CNN architecture. The resized images
    were classified using a deep CNN model with eight tunable layers, which includes
    five convolution2D with max pool layers, three fully connected layers, and one
    softmax activation layer. A grading and sorting method was developed by da Costa
    et al. (2020). The method utilized the fomesa machine to capture 1500 tomato images.
    Vasumathi and Kamarasan (2021) classified the pomegranate fruit into infected
    or non-infected classes utilizing the deep convolution network pipelined with
    long short-term memory for detection. Selvaraj et al. (2019) collected 12,600
    balanced real-world banana images at different growing phases with different resolutions,
    illumination conditions, and varying environmental conditions to avoid underfitting,
    overfitting, and generalization errors. The author performed the analytical study
    of Faster R-CNN InceptionV2, Faster R-CNN ResNet50, and SSD MobileNetV1 networks.
    The experiments were conducted to detect disease and pest symptoms and classify
    the whole plant, fruit bunch, pseudo-stem, and cut fruit. Meshram et al. (2021)
    compared the misclassification rate of two proposed models FC_InceptionV3 (Fruit
    Classification InceptionV3) and MFC_InceptionV3 (Merged Fruit Classification InceptionV3)
    by utilizing the “Divide and Conquer” concept (The design, 2022). FC_InceptionV3
    architecture implemented the pre-trained model InceptionV3 while MFC_Inception
    V3 architecture was developed using a novel Merged Net (MNet) framework. The first
    FC_InceptionV3 architecture dealt with multiple fruit recognition, while the second
    FC_Inception V3 architecture dealt with fruit quality bad or good binary classification
    simultaneously, which were merged together into a single pertinent classification
    class. Although some researchers reviewed the state-of-the-art models for automatic
    disease detection, Thangaraj et al. (2020) worked on the state-of-the-art Adam-optimized
    MobileNet model using transfer learning for automatic disease recognition in avocados.
    The transfer learning method replaces the final classification layer with a fine-tuned
    layer with eight disease classes. Kizilboga et al. (2020) manifested AlexNet and
    improved CNN deep neural networks to classify the disease in the apple and quince
    datasets. Consequently, Saini et al. (2021) studied the pre-trained architectures,
    namely, VGG16, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and VGG19, using the transfer learning
    method for identifying and classifying the diseases in citrus. The author experimentally
    showed that the VGG19 prototype outperformed the rest state-of-the-art models
    with a classification accuracy of 99.89%. A novel Correlation Coefficient & Deep
    Features (CCDF) method was adopted for disease detection in multiple fruits &
    vegetables (Khan et al., 2018). The first stage performed a contrast stretch operation
    for better infected area visualization. The second stage exploited the Caffe AlexNet
    and VGG16 state-of-the-art models for feature extraction, which were fused together
    to aggregate the features. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) selected the most critical
    features from the maximum feature vectors, which became the input to the multi-class
    SVM classifier. Buyukarikan and Ulker (2022) compared the amalgam of VGG16 and
    VGG19 for 4096 feature extraction, ResNet50, ResNet152, and ResNet101 for 2048
    feature extraction, and LR, SVM, XGBoost, and RF models with fivefold cross-validation
    approach for disease classification against original (1080) and augmented (4320)
    apple data images. Furthermore, Turkoglu et al. (2019) applied three tier Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM) model as an aggregated majority voting classifier for
    multi-class disease classification in the apples. DenseNet201, GoogleNet, and
    AlexNet extracted the feature vectors of dimensions 1000, 1024, and 4096, respectively,
    which were then taken as an input to three LSTM layers followed by the combination
    of an FC, softmax, and a classification layer. Khattak et al. (2021) addressed
    the automatic citrus species disease classification problem by integrating manifold
    CNN layers. The proposed model exploited the first convolution and max pooling
    layers for feature extraction and dimension reduction, respectively. On the other
    hand, the second convolution and max pooling layers were used for high-level feature
    mapping and image downsampling. Finally, the flatten layer is followed by the
    classification layer for disease detection. An autonomous multi-fruit sorting
    system was designed by Dhiman et al. (2021). The grayscale image quality was enhanced
    using contrast enhancement and CLAHE edge operator for light balancing and object
    boundary detection. Using the PCA method, the author proposed a recurrent neural
    network for binary classification after extracting good-quality and bad-quality
    feature vectors. Moreover, Chaturvedi et al. (2023) presented autonomous external
    lesion detection in tomatoes. The paper compared the five state-of-the-art architectures.
    The experimental results witnessed that EfficientNetB4 surpassed the other models
    by achieving the recognition accuracy of 97.97%. A CNN-LSTM-based model was used
    for early disease classification of the citrus (Dhiman et al., 2023). The images
    were segmented using canny edge detection and the -Means clustering. The model
    was trained and tested with pruning and quantization methods for five-class classification.
    Moreover, an improved YOLOV5 method was proposed for two defect detection, namely
    black spots and surface damage in citrus (Hu et al., 2023). The Convolution Block
    Attention Module (CBAM) was integrated into the YOLOV5 model, whereas the loss
    function was optimized using Distance Intersection over Union (DIoU). The performance
    was evaluated using Generalised Intersection over Union (GIoU), Complete Intersection
    over Union (CIoU), and Efficient Intersection over Union (EIoU) loss functions.
    6. Internet-of-things and Cyberphysical System Recently, Internet-of-Things (IoT)
    and Cyberphysical Systems (CPS) have emerged as innovative and promising edge-cutting
    technologies, offering trustworthy and effective solutions for smart agriculture.
    IoT comprises heterogeneously connected physical entities, empowering them with
    new autonomous computation power. Moreover, IoT offers new capabilities, connecting
    virtual and physical devices, where Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interaction makes
    the interconnection between things and cloud applications. The Internet Architecture
    Board (IAB) defines IoT as a collection of embedded network devices utilizing
    communication internet protocols. In 1999, Kevin Ashton first referred to IoT
    as distinctly identifiable, coherent, interconnected entities with Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID) technology to track and count goods in supply chains (Floerkemeier
    and Lampe, 2005). The Indian government has launched the “Digital India” flagship
    program intending to incorporate digitalization into every aspect of society.
    Different research organizations have predicted a wide span of projections concerning
    the significant impact of IoT on the future internet and their global economy.
    For instance, Cisco (CISCO, 2022) expects its global economy of almost $24 billion
    in IoT connections. On the other side, Huawei (Huawei, 2022) projects $100 billion
    in network-connected devices, and McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al., 2015)
    forecasts their IoT global economy from $3.9 to $11.1 trillion by 2025. Thus,
    internet traffic will exponentially grow as connected IoT devices increase. Cisco
    (CISCO, 2022) expects the volume of internet traffic from non-PC devices will
    rise from 40% to 70%. The volume of “Machine to Machine” (M2M) interconnections
    in all IoT verticals, including farming, healthcare, industrial, smart city, automotive,
    transportation, home, unmanned aerial vehicles, and others, will rise from 24%
    to 43% in the coming future. As per the global precision agriculture market trends
    (Agriculture, 2022), it is expected to touch 15.34 billion by the end of 2025.

    3) 6.1. Iot enabled E-Agriculture IoT-based precision farming comprises multiple
    physical components (sensors, actuators, microcontrollers), data gathering from
    IoT-based sensors, data processing, and data analytics. A sensor (transducer)
    is a physical device that senses the abrupt change in the environment and converts
    the data from physical phenomena (like humidity, pressure, temperature, light,
    and motion) to another form of energy. Conversely, an actuator is a physical device
    that performs in the counter direction of the sensor. Whereas, microcontroller
    devices (ATMEGA series, Arduino, Raspberry Pi) control the functionality of device
    identification and service discovery in the network through network-connected
    remote devices. To facilitate the transceiving of agriculture data, different
    application layer messaging protocols like WebSocket, Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT), Secure MQTT (SMQTT), Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
    (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational State Transfer
    (REST), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Java Message Service (JMS) and communication
    protocols like Zigbee, IPv6 over Low Power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs),
    Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave, IEEE
    802.15.4, SigFox, Wireless HART are employed to provide homogeneous and standard
    communication from different embedded devices. IoT edge or ubiquitous fog computing
    can be analyzed in various domains of precision agriculture like soil monitoring,
    weather prediction, livestock management, field monitoring, greenhouse monitoring,
    and pest monitoring fields. Moreover, Agriculture robots (agribots) can be used
    to maximize crop yields and resource utilization using innovative advanced Information
    and Communication Technology (ICTs) (Gollakota and Srinivas, 2011). E-agriculture
    involves gathering real-time data from the IoT sensors, monitoring the fruitage
    environmental attributes, routing the data from the farmlands to the control center
    for processing the collected information, and presenting the result visualizations
    to the agrarians. The basic flowchart of the IoT-enabled E-Agriculture has been
    depicted in Fig. 4, which has been layerwise discussed below: • Data Acquisition:
    The initial layer is the data sensing layer, which comprises various smart sensors
    to gather real-time information from the farmlands. For instance, optical sensors
    collect the reflectance data and measure soil attributes like moisture, and pH.
    These smart sensors are mounted at a specific height from the farmland’s surface
    to observe and regulate diverse physiological indicators related to the soil,
    fruitage crops, and environment, which are either directly or indirectly crucial
    to disease identification in the fruitage domain. Additionally, UAVs equipped
    with thermal cameras, IoT cameras, and agribots are employed in the agriculture
    fields to measure the ecological factors for disease classification, displaying
    the findings through images. • Network Communication: The layer focuses on the
    connectivity between the sensory nodes and data routing technologies. Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) enable real-time monitoring & enhancement of fruit production
    quality, alongside the capability for extensive monitoring with a high density
    of data points. It can ensure the optimal conditions for the highest fruit yield
    by continuously tracking the complex interaction between the IoT sensor nodes
    distributed across the field using communication protocols. For instance, Long
    Range (LoRa) communication protocol facilitates long-range transmission with minimal
    power consumption, ideally suited for battery-powered wireless IoT devices. It
    employs the Decision Support System (DSS) to analyze the aggregated data using
    micro-controllers like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP8266, as shown in Table 7.
    • User Interface: This layer integrates the smart prediction models to deliver
    visualization insights concerning disease identification in fruits and vegetables.
    It presents the informative decisions collected from different IoT devices in
    an understandable format. It guarantees that both informational and control features
    about the farms are readily available on diverse smart devices, such as smartphones,
    tablets, computers, and specific interfaces. This accessibility allows farmers
    to engage with the IoT system at their convenience from any location. The end-user
    agrarians can take immediate action based on the IoT system’s response for higher
    production yield. 6.2. Fruit & vegetable disease detection using IoT In the last
    decade, IoT has significantly placed in fruit disease classification and prediction
    by employing deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision techniques.
    Table 8 contextualizes the study of existing IoT-integrated approaches for autonomous
    visual disease detection systems of real-time fruits and vegetables. Zhang et
    al. (2022) integrated the IoT ecosystem with multi-scale dual-channel CNN (DMCNN)
    to identify apple diseases. The IoT architecture consisted of Jetson Xavier Nx
    and TensorRT accelerator. The method extracted relevant texture information using
    twin-factor weight optimization in the attention algorithm. The extracted features
    were fused using the cross-fusing method to construct DMCNN. Mishra et al. (2019)
    analyzed the heat index value to differentiate the ripened stage of lime, lemon,
    guava, orange, plum, green peas, potato, carrot, cucumber, and carrot. The IoT
    architecture was developed using an optical sensor integrated with an infrared
    camera for real-time infrared image acquisition, an Arduino processor for heat
    index, and a Wi-Fi module for communication over the network. The ripe, unripe,
    and rotten species were investigated based on the heat signature parameter. The
    validation of the proposed architecture can be further tested against multiple
    large-scale varieties of fruits and vegetables. Also, further research can be
    carried out to emphasize additional parameters of fruits other than the heat index.

    of the pre-trained model can be further replaced with other CNN models to extend
    the accuracy Furthermore, the YOLOV3 object detection model for autonomous maturity
    level detection of the strawberry was analyzed by Zhou et al. (2021). The proposed
    method collected three datasets from UAV at 2 and 3 meters height using DJI Phantom
    4 Pro equipped with RGB cameras that were further normalized using an adjusted
    reflectance instrument. Similarly, near-ground digital images were captured using
    a Canon EOS 5D Mark III camera at a height of 0.5 m. Thereafter, a pre-trained
    YOLOV3 model was used to detect the seven different maturity stages (from flower
    to rotten) for RGB images, whereas, three different maturity stages (flower, mature,
    immature) were analyzed for the UAV images. Akhter and Sofi (2021) incorporated
    IoT-based wireless sensor networks to identify apple scab disease using ML algorithms.
    Real-time data acquisition was performed using six DHT22 IoT sensors (S1 to S6)
    with an MIB 520 embedded IRIS 2.4 GHz module and Zigbee protocol to record temperature
    and humidity. Likewise, Jawade et al. (2020) introduced a random forest and IoT-based
    model for early disease prediction in Alphonso mangoes using ATMEGA microcontroller.
    Mango disease prediction was made by experimenting with a random forest classifier
    against real and past data of 20 years from the meteorology office of Vengurla,
    Sindhudurga. Moreover, IoT-based prototypes can be used for fruit sorting purposes.
    Ismail and Malik (2022) developed a prototype consisting of two Raspberry Pi components
    for inspecting the grading of apples and bananas based on the disease severity
    levels. The training and testing images were segmented using shift and watershed
    methods respectively (Cheng, 1995, Vincent and Soille, 1991). The classification
    performance was tested against five state-of-the-art models, namely, EfficientNet,
    MobileNetV2, ResNet, NASNet, and DenseNet. The experimental results illustrated
    that the EfficientNet model outperformed four other methods by achieving an accuracy
    of 93.80% and 96.70% for bananas and apples, respectively. Furthermore, Arya and
    Gangwar (2021) investigated the ripeness severity of the apple, banana, and orange.
    Different real-time sensors were used to collect the parameters like pH level,
    temperature, time, and ripeness. On the same footprint, a novel Raspberry Pi-3-enabled
    Compressed Sensing Web-Enabled Disease Detection System (CS-WEDDS) was addressed
    for the disease detection problem (Aasha Nandhini et al., 2018). The diseased
    images were segmented using a Mean-based Threshold Strategy (MTS), which was further
    processed using the DCT algorithm to generate sparse matrices (Indumathi et al.,
    2017). Further, the storage overhead was mitigated by employing the hybrid measurement
    matrix method (Nandhini et al., 2015). Finally, texture features were extracted
    using the GLCM, which was passed to a linear kernel-based SVM classifier. Likewise,
    a smart IoT system was designed to capture images using an RGB and thermal camera-SEEK
    with a thermal sensor (Bhole et al., 2020). During data acquisition, 11 different
    agro-products were revolved on the tray fixed at the top of a stepper motor to
    capture 3D video frames. The stepper motor was controlled by an Arduino Uno-microcontroller
    attached to ICA4988. Eleven outer texture features were collected using GLCM,
    which were further classified into infected and non-infected classes by random
    forest and KNN. The experiments concluded that the random forest classifier overshadowed
    the KNN algorithm for texture features of both RGB and thermal images. Gawas et
    al. (2021) suggested an intelligent farming system for monitoring the freshness
    level of apples, bananas, and oranges. The architecture consisted of a conveyor
    belt that was integrated with a motor, sensors, three cameras, and nodeMCU8266.
    MQ3 and MQ4 sensors determined the species’s ethanol (C2H6O) and methane gas (CH4)
    concentrations. Transfer learning with the inception V3 model was leveraged for
    recognition and disease classification. Similarly, An IoT-cloud-based method was
    developed for early disease detection in pomegranate tissues (Pawara et al., 2018).
    Digital temperature sensor (DHT22) and humidity sensor (AM2302) were used to collect
    the real-time temperature and humidity values, which were processed by Arduino
    Uno microcontroller. The processed images were sent to the ThinkSpeak cloud. The
    framework then fed the captured cloud dataset to the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
    using a base station to predict the bacterial blight disease based on probability
    distribution. Recently, swarm-optimized IoT models have received significant attention
    from researchers for the parameter optimization of IoT-based smart systems in
    agriculture. Microsoft (2022) implemented a PSO-optimized CNN with IoT modules
    for multiple disease detection in citrus tissues. Real-time citrus images were
    collected using camera sensors and transferred to the ThinkSpeak cloud via the
    Raspberry Pi3 IoT interface. The Adam-optimized cross-entropy loss function was
    evaluated as a fitness function for the CNN network. During the velocity computation
    phase, the variation of pooling layer parameters from the fully connected layer
    is determined by decision factor C . If r then variation from the pooling layer
    (gBest) to the current layer is chosen; otherwise, the variation from the fully
    connected layer (pBest) to the current is chosen where r [0,1]. If the current
    layer parameters have comparable layer types to gBest and pBest, the velocity
    computation is applied. The developed method outperformed other considered methods
    by achieving an accuracy of 96.08%. An agro-weather system was developed for automatic
    disease detection of potato and tomato vegetables (Khattab et al., 2019). The
    proposed system acquired eleven real-time attributes relevant to the tomato vegetables.
    ATmega2560 microchip integrated with an open-source Arduino bootloader was used
    to send the sensor’s information (ATmega, 2022). The back-end layer implemented
    a software-based expert system for disease prediction. The software module exploited
    the GLAIR AI agent (Grounded Layered Architecture with Integrated Reasoning) for
    forecasting the results (Shapiro and Bona, 2010). Abdulridha et al. (2019) utilized
    ML-enabled smart UAVs for estimating late, early, and asymptomatic symptoms of
    canker disease in citrus tissues. Indoor hyperspectral images were collected using
    an imaging setup consisting of a two-dimensional Pika-L-2.4 camera and SpectrononPro
    control software. Similarly, Outdoors hyperspectral images were collected using
    a two-dimensional Pika-L-2.4 camera and UAV with DJI Matrice 200 multi-rotor and
    Pro Hexacopter. The captured hyperspectral images were calibrated to radiance
    images using an Imager Calibration Pack (ICP) installed with Spectronon Radiance
    Conversion (SRC) plugins. Pavel et al. (2019) utilized IoT-based sensors for real-time
    image acquisition of tomato, cucumber, and eggplant tissues using the camera interfaced
    with the Arduino Mega 8560 microcontroller. The resized RGB images were further
    transformed to the L a b color subspace. Finally, the images were segmented to
    identify the disease-infected regions using the -means clustering algorithm. Xiao
    et al. (2022) introduced a smart UAV with a DJI-Matrice 200 multi-rotor and the
    MicaSense RedEdge-M camera for multispectral image acquisition. The images were
    calibrated using Pix4DMapper software for radiometric and geometric calibration
    to generate the orthophotos and digital surface model. The top three Vegetation
    Index (VI) features, namely, Triangular Vegetation Index (TVI), Anthocyanin Reflectance
    Index (ARI), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), and their optimal correlation were
    determined using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method. Additionally,
    iForest (isolation Forest) algorithm was used to identify the fire blight disease
    in the apple (Liu et al., 2008). On the same footprints, a SAM and GNSS-based
    model was introduced by Moriya et al. (2021). The hyperspectral images with twenty-five
    sensor bands and multispectral images with three sensor bands were acquired from
    Rikola DT-0014 camera integrated with the UAV-UX4 model (HSI, 2022) to generate
    hyperspectral cubes. The radiometric calibration and ortho-calibration of hyperspectral
    cubes were performed by UV/NIR ASD spectrometer (Honkavaara et al., 2013). The
    processed images were passed to investigate the health level of the citrus trees.
    Furthermore, Devi et al. (2020) delineated the IoT system in which real-time fruitage
    parameters (MQ135 sensor for atmospheric gas, DHT11 sensor for temperature and
    humidity, pH sensor) were collected, which were pre-processed using Arduino Uno
    microcontroller. The processed features were saved on the ThinkSpeak cloud via
    the ESP8266 wireless communication module. The result showed that GoogLeNet architecture
    performed superior as compared to the other considered methods. A novel robot
    prototype was introduced to pluck agro-products based on disease severity level
    (Dairath et al., 2023). However, the tissue defect percentage was calculated to
    select the threshold value. The grading result was further transmitted to the
    robotic arm via Arduino Uno microcontroller. Moreover, autonomous defect detection
    of tomatoes was categorized into ripe(red) and unripe(green) based on the color
    vision and IoT system (Vanitha et al., 2023). The servo motor moves the tomato
    to the conveyor’s right side. The IR Sensor counted the number of ripe and unripe
    tomatoes, whereas the color was decided based on the frequency of the radiation.
    A recent IoT-based system was developed for the pest identification of longans
    and lychees using Raspberry Pi and VGG16 network (Zhu et al., 2023). The important
    features were extracted using the Hanlp toolkit, whereas the sooty blotch as a
    disease entity, hypitima longanae as a pest entity, and colletotrichum spp as
    a bacteria entity were used to develop the knowledge graph. The cosine similarity
    score was used for knowledge fusion which was further stored using the Neo4j database.
    7. Data sets Fruits and vegetables are prone to disease as human beings. Accurate
    and rapid fruitage disease categorization and early disease recognition as per
    their physical appearance (color, shape, and size), index, and quality parameters
    are the unfulfilled demands of Agriculture 4.0. With life-long shifts in the environmental
    scenarios, ecologically adaptable agro-product cultivars are becoming crucial
    in agriculture. Thus, it is necessary to assess the features at every growth phase
    to select potential species that can be utilized in recent technologies for multiple-dimensional
    areas. This section aims to develop the metadata of existing fruit and vegetable
    datasets with considerable disease categories, which may help the domain researchers
    to get consolidated one-place information for the study. Table 9 presents some

    7.1. Fruit and vegetable datasets The Guava tissue dataset was prepared by Rajbongshi
    et al. (2022) for real-time disease classification. The dataset contained resized
    images having four categories of fruit (Healthy, Scab, Phytophthora, and Styler
    end rot) and two classes of leaves (Healthy and Red rust). The dataset consists
    of 681 images divided into five disease classes, namely, Scab (106), Phytophthora
    (114), Styler end rot (94), Red rust (87), and Healthy (280). Rauf et al. (2019)
    introduced a novel citrus plant dataset for fruit, stem, and leaves. The researcher
    collected 759 images of citrus tissues (fruits and leaves) following Healthy (22
    & 58), Canker (78 & 163), Black spot (19 & 171), Greening (16 & 204), Scab infected
    fruits (15), and Melanose infected leaves (13). The FruitNet dataset consisting
    of 19 526 images was developed by Meshram and Patil (2022). The dataset contained
    images of six different species, namely, banana, lime, apple, orange, pomegranate,
    and guava. The images were categorized into Good, Bad, and Mixed classes, with
    11 664, 6778, and 1074 images, respectively. Further, grading is a similar term
    used to inspect the quality of fruits and vegetables. Kumar et al. (2021) created
    a pomegranate dataset of ruby cultivars. The dataset was divided in three gradings
    (G1, G2, & G3) and four qualities classes (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4). The grades were
    decided based on the tissue’s color, size, weight, and physical appearance, where
    G1, G2, and G3 signified the superior and good appearance with complete ripeness.
    The database comprised 30 sample images from each grade making up 90 pomegranate
    images. Das et al. (2020) introduced a tomato grading dataset. A total of 6470
    tomato images were collected for 90 days and graded from labels 1 to 10. The classification
    accuracy of the benchmark dataset was also compared against different state-of-the-art
    models. Some datasets cover the different parts or cultivars of plants infected
    by the pathogens instead of the edible part of the fruit and vegetable. PFSD (Medhi
    and Deb, 2022) dataset consisted of different banana parts (stems, leaves, flowers,
    and fruits). The images infected from Scarring beetle (150), Panama disease (102),
    Pseudo-Stem Weevil (2736), Bacterial soft rot (1078), Yellow Sigatoka (264), Aphids
    (366), and Black Sigatoka (474) were acquired under natural light. Moreover, 102
    stem images, 2343 leaf images, and 216 fruit images of four banana varieties (Jahaji,
    Bhimkol, Malbhog, and Kachkol) were collected. Moreover, Altaheri et al. (2019)
    acquired a date palm dataset using three cameras under natural sunlight from June
    to September for yield detection, disease classification, and robotic farming.
    The first dataset covered 8079 images belonging to different variants (Sullaj,
    Khalas, Meneifi, Barhi, and Naboot Saif) with varying stages of maturity (Tamar,
    Rutab, Khalal, and Immature). The second dataset contained 152 Barhi dates with
    13 palms at different ages and heights. VegNet cauliflower dataset was introduced
    by Sara et al. (2022). The dataset was divided into four classes, namely, Downy
    mildew (177), Bacterial spot rot (173), Black rot (100), and Healthy (206), which
    was increased to 1770, 1730, 1800, and 2060 respectively, by applying the data
    augmentation method. Similarly, Tariq et al. (2022) developed a fruit fly dataset
    containing 2000 images of Bactrocera dorsalis, and Zonato species. The resized
    images of 416 416 pixels were collected through Raspberry Pi cameras equipped
    with an intelligent trap tool. The YOLOV5 model was used for species detection
    and annotation with a mean accuracy of 85.00%. Kaufmane et al. (2022) designed
    the “QuinceSet” Japanese quinces dataset containing 1515 RGB images that were
    labeled as class 0 (ripe) and class 1 (unripe) for phenotyping and detection.
    The dataset contained raw images derived from ripe (650) and unripe (889), which
    were annotated to 17 171 using state-of-the-art YOLO architecture. The quality
    and productivity of the fruitage crops are also affected due to physiological
    disorders. The sugarcane billets dataset was developed by Alencastre-Miranda et
    al. (2018). The dataset consisted of 120 sample images, categorized into six classes,
    namely Healthy, Cracked, Crushed, Two buds, One bud, and No bud. The labeling
    was performed based on no visual marking, red marking, blue marking, green marking,
    orange marking, and yellow marking, respectively. DiaMOS (Fenu and Malloci, 2021)
    dataset contains 3505 pear images (3006 leaves and 499 fruits) from Septoria Piricola
    species. The images were collected during the entire planting season from February
    to July 2022. The fruit images were categorized into four classes: ripening, nut
    fruit, fruit set, and fruit growth. At the same time, leaves were classified into
    Healthy, Unhealthy, Spot, and Curl classes. The image annotation was carried out
    through the YOLO model. Rauf and Lali (2021) developed an image gallery of 306
    guava images. The dataset was classified into four disease class labels, namely
    Rust (70), Canker (77), Dot (76), and Mummification (83). Furthermore, a digital
    library of papaya tissue datasets containing 214 images was developed by Munasingha
    et al. (2019). The dataset was augmented into five defect classes: Black spot,
    Powdery mildew, Phytophthora, Ringspot, and Anthracnose disease. The CNN model
    was employed for papaya disease multi-classification with nearly 92.00%, which
    outperformed the SVM architecture. The powdery mildew class took the maximum time
    for classification, whereas the black spot disease recorded the minimum time.
    Similarly,multi-fruit datasets were also developed to build a robust disease classification
    system. Kaggle (2022) created a banana, apple, and orange dataset of 13 599 images
    for binary classification (rotten or fresh). The dataset can be summarized as
    fresh images (2088 apple, 1962 banana, and 1854 orange) and rotten images (2943
    apple, 2754 banana, and 1998 orange). Mendeley (2022) designed an extensive database
    with eight varieties of fruits (apple, orange, strawberry, banana, guava, grape,
    pomegranate, and jujube). The dataset was labeled into fresh and rotten classes
    for binary classification. The dataset had 3200 original images, which were increased
    to 12 335 images with basic augmentation methods such as rotate, scale, translate,
    and blurring. Meshram et al. (2020) generated the “FruitGB” dataset of six popular
    agro-products: apple, orange, lime, banana, guava, and pomegranate. The dataset
    contained 6000 multi-fruit images divided into good and bad classes. Han et al.
    (2021) collected 74 apple images to analyze the binary fruit defect classification
    (Anthracnose or Non-anthracnose) with an improved Mask R-CNN network. The images
    were annotated using 1 to 9 rounded boundary regions per image. IFW (2022) developed
    a CASC-IFW database of 8632 for autonomous disease detection in multiple variants
    of apple fruits (Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, York, and Fuji). Oltean (2021)
    processed the images using a flood fill algorithm for background noise removal.
    The proposed dataset can be used for multiple dimensions: ripeness determination,
    clustering, defects, edible (binary classification), and maturity detection, seed
    quantity, growth stage, hardness level, and fruitage type (multiclass classification).
    A total of 131 classes from different fruits, seeds, and vegetables, summing up
    to 90 483 images, were incorporated into the database. Gené-Mola et al. (2021)
    developed PFuji images with 3D data points during the growth phase and annotated
    them. The dataset was designed using 303 apple trees (2018) and 312 apple trees
    (2020), thus making up 615 real-time images. The dataset was divided into four
    phases first phase (raw images), the second phase (data points from the east and
    west side), the third phase (merging and segmentation of 3D points), and the fourth
    phase (Apple tree information and location). Similarly, the apple dataset was
    developed by Tian et al. (2021). The dataset comprised leaf images (Healthy (1354),
    General scab (1205), Severe scab (1026), General cedar (972), Serious cedar (460),
    and Spot (488)), and fruit images (Healthy green (1360), Healthy red (1360), Ring
    rot (93), General anthracnose (78), and Severe anthracnose (87)). Mamdouh and
    Khattab (2021) designed an olive fruit fly species detection framework utilizing
    YOLOV4 for object detection and localization with a mean accuracy of 96.68%. The
    DIRT image dataset with 848 images (positive samples) was collected from liquid
    aromatic McPhail traps. The Leeds butterfly image dataset containing 832 images
    (negative samples) of Danaus plexippus species was acquired from the internet.
    A jute dataset infected for multiple diseases and pest detection using YOLO-JD
    architecture was introduced by Li et al. (2022). A total of six fungal diseases
    (Black band, Dieback, Tip blight, Soft rot, Anthracnose, and Stem rot), two viral
    diseases (Chlorosis and Mosaic), and two pests (Comophila sabulifers and Hairy
    caterpillar) were appended to the database, which was pre-processed (filtering
    and illumination correction) for better accuracy. Vasumathi and Kamarasan (2021)
    created a novel pomegranate dataset that combined real-time and existing datasets
    for binary disease classification (normal and abnormal) using deep CNN and LSTM
    models. The dataset combined 328 images from the Cofilab dataset and 90 images
    from the Kaggle dataset, while the rest of 6101 pomegranate images were acquired
    under real-time environmental conditions. 8. Research gaps, challenges, and future
    opportunities The survey comprehends the significance of smart techniques to identify
    complex problems in the fruitage disease identification domain. The state-of-the-art
    algorithms have shown remarkable outputs by minimizing produce losses in farming.
    Agriculture productivity is enormously increasing while utilizing such techniques,
    but the benefits come with its cost. A few of such challenges with their viable
    solutions are mentioned below: 8.1. Machine learning research gaps and future
    directions in fruitage domain • Data Pre-processing: Fruitage data is one of the
    key components for the success of any machine model. Several public digital repositories
    for fruits and vegetables are available for the use of researchers. Generally,
    the real field fruitage data is acquired using UAV, satellite, or mobile camera
    in different seasons. Thus, these fruitage datasets are present with several limitations,
    such as improper data formatting, poor quality, incompatibility, imbalanced or
    noisy data, redundant features, hazed, low resolution, and unknown data values.
    Thus, exquisite and robust pre-processing techniques are required to incorporate
    the eligible data for testing, validation, and training of the models, which is
    time-consuming and error-prone. The literature witnessed the challenges of fruitage
    data pre-processing, like spatial loss information, color distortion, and over-enhancement
    for disease classification model (Habib et al., 2020). The majority of research
    work studied the impact of extracting the best statistical and texture feature
    maps of the dataset for better classification (Bhargava and Bansal, 2020a, Mojumdar
    and Chakraborty, 2021, Almadhor et al., 2021). Different methods like Gaussian
    filtering, color histogram equalization, segmentation, and color space conversion
    help to perform the data preprocessing for precise fruitage defect detection model
    convergence (El-aziz et al., 2020, Roy et al., 2021b, Ghodke et al., 2022, Bhargava
    and Bansal, 2020a). Such techniques can also exaggerate the background noise,
    giving the fruitage image a noisy appearance in the region of interest. Also,
    multi-modal data is another room for improving the statistical and data interpretation
    methods to understand the food domain better such as fruitage waste production,
    crop harvest prediction, and fruit nutrient determination. The fruitage images
    acquired in extreme weather conditions such as rain, fog, and night is another
    major challenge that may affect the model’s performance. To mitigate this, image
    dehazing and thermal imaging methods may be introduced as effective data pre-processing
    techniques (Yu et al., 2018). Sequential Pre-processing Through Orthogonalization
    (SPORT) method may be future direction for effective data-processing that hybridizes
    the multiple pre-processing methods to ensure high disease classification accuracy
    (Mishra et al., 2020). • Bias & Dynamic Problems: Generally, ML models trained
    on fruitage datasets suffer from the label bias problem as the majority of the
    real field datasets are imbalanced. Thus, the testing performance of the models
    does not meet the standards of the training performance. The improper selection
    of training and testing data samples may lead to model instability resulting in
    poor performance of the model in real-time scenarios. The research studies witnessed
    that the feature engineering methods are useful to reduce bias by incorporating
    the relevant and important features and removing irrelevant or discriminatory
    features (Bhargava and Bansal, 2020b, Kumari et al., 2021). Careful feature engineering
    can greatly enhance a model’s ability for generalization and prediction accuracy
    (Shafiq et al., 2020b, Shafiq et al., 2020c). The fruit and vegetable feature
    maps can be extracted using the delta E ( ) method (Cugmas and Štruc, 2020, Almadhor
    et al., 2021). The study extracted homogeneity, energy, contrast, and correlation
    discriminative texture features using GLCM while other relevant fruitage factors
    like area, perimeter, eccentricity, diameter, major and minor axis, and orientation
    were extracted during the feature engineering process (Dubey and Rocha, 2023,
    Sugiarti et al., 2021). Similarly, meteorological and ecological factors like
    environmental temperature and soil moisture are dynamic, making it difficult to
    provide an accurate prediction. The meteorological & ecological features affecting
    the fruitage growth like wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, and temperature,
    and the physicochemical features such as firmness, weight, soluble solids, sugar,
    moisture content, and tannin content may be extracted for disease detection (Mohammed
    et al., 2023). The literature survey deduced that disease categories present in
    the fruitage domain generally suffer from maturity bias, seasonal bias, and label
    bias. Such data bias-ness problems may be handled using continual or incremental
    machine learning methods (Li and Chao, 2020). Additionally, fair machine learning
    algorithms for re-sampling or re-weighting feature maps, demographic parity, or
    equal opportunity algorithms can be employed for bias mitigation. A few statistical
    techniques, such as KL divergence or Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and distribution
    or domain adaptation can be introduced to detect shifts in data distribution that
    help to handle the dynamic issues in the fruitage disease detection (Hien and
    Gillis, 2021). Semi-supervised machine learning methods like Expectation–Maximization
    (EM), Self-Training, Co-Training, and Multi-View Learning leverage the unlabeled
    data to improve model performance (Zhu, 2005). • Limited Fruitage Data: Machine
    learning models’ training and validation process requires massive fruit data to
    assess models’ performance before deploying in a real-world environment. Moreover,
    the effective training process requires high-performance hardware resources, large
    storage devices, and testing tools. Under-training and over-training are the open
    issues in the fruit industry that must be addressed while training the model.
    For instance, the unripe banana shows different color features than the ripe banana.
    Limited model generalization may result from a dataset lacking these variances,
    which can be controlled using regularization methods (Wang and Ni, 2019). Regularization
    techniques (L1 & L2), fold validation, early stopping, decision tree pruning,
    and ensemble methods can be exploited to address such issues. It is also recorded
    from the literature that the availability of a robust fruitage dataset is a major
    challenge for the effective training of the model. To overcome this, traditional
    image augmentation methods may be used to handle the complexity of model overfitting
    and bias-ness towards the specific class. Rotation, flipping, shearing, and random
    erasing are the few instances to expand the fruitage images. Synthetic data generation
    methods like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Deep Synthetic
    Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE) can also be used to handle class imbalance
    issues (Alzubaidi et al., 2023). However, recent machine learning methods such
    as self-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and active learning open
    up the likelihood of handling smaller labeled datasets. Collaborative learning,
    time-lapse image acquisition, cross-domain adaptation, and multi-task learning
    are the open solutions to be addressed in fruit and vegetable disease detection.
    • Optimal Model Deployment: A large number of ML models are available for classification
    and prediction tasks. Thus, selecting an optimal model for the specific fruit
    or vegetable is still challenging. The naïve approach is to select a model randomly
    with different attributes using a trial and error approach, which takes a long
    time to conclude the result. The literature survey revealed that different ML
    models show varied performance with different problem domains like disease classification,
    grading, and disease segmentation in the fruitage dataset. The lightweight classifiers
    such as Cubic SVM, Fine KNN, Bagged Tree, Complex Tree, and Boosted Tree can be
    employed for fruitage disease identification which can be trained on less number
    of image samples with reasonable performance (Almadhor et al., 2021). Similarly,
    different SVM variants like cubic-SVM (C-SVM), quadratic-SVM (Q-SVM), linear-SVM
    (L-SVM), and radial basis function-SVM (RBF-SVM), decision tree, ANN, and RF may
    be deployed for fruitage grading purpose (Ireri et al., 2019). The study utilized
    a self-clustered method by using the likelihood of nearest neighbor and extended
    Gaussian kernel approach to identify the lesions in the real-field farms (Hasan
    et al., 2023). The fruitage disease classification requires the segmenting of
    every fruit or vegetable, classifying the pixel-by-pixel disease severity, and
    then predicting the disease category. It is an inherently difficult task to segment
    individual real-time fruits due to their overlapping or occlusion. Different segmentation
    methods such as Histogram, random walker, entropy-based segmentation, and GMM
    can be applied for rotten area identification in fruits and vegetables (Roy et
    al., 2021b). Whereas, Watershed Transform, Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Conditional
    Random Fields (CRF) may be the future directions to be explored for better fruitage
    disease segmentation. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a co-domain of the AutoML,
    automates the network’s topology with limited computational resources to obtain
    the best disease classification network (Zhang et al., 2021). Pruning, quantization,
    factorization, and knowledge distillation methods may be exploited to compress
    the model parameters which reduces memory utilization without compromising the
    disease classification accuracy. • Model Complexity: The computational complexity
    of the machine learning models is also a prime concern for agricultural applications.
    Linear machine learning algorithms predict the output as the linear combination
    of the input feature maps. They are easy to implement but do not capture the complex
    defect patterns in fruits and vegetables. For instance, the LR model may be exploited
    for disease detection in the fruits where each disease class has balanced weights
    or sampling and has distinct spectral or visual symptoms (Mohammed et al., 2023).
    On the same note, non-linear machine learning algorithms have multiple layers
    and can include activation functions to introduce non-linearity, but these techniques
    are computationally expensive with respect to hardware, software, storage devices,
    and data availability. An improved non-linear SVM and backpropagation model may
    be implemented for disease identification where high-dimensional data shows large
    variation towards feature diversity (Yu et al., 2018). Thus the tradeoff between
    the model complexity and disease classification accuracy is another room for improvement
    in the fruitage domain. Dimension reduction techniques like PCA, LDA, t-distributed
    Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
    can be utilized to minimize the number of feature maps while retaining model variance.
    Also, analyzing the multi-class disease problem into multiple instances of binary
    disease classification problems can help to ease the network’s decision-making
    process. Evolutionary algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization, GA, Artificial
    Bee Colony Algorithm, and Hybrid and Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms are
    another dimension to optimize the network parameters (Drugan, 2019). • Ecological
    Fruitage Diversity: Increasing demand for high-quality fruits & vegetables requires
    a better understanding of pathogens that are indirectly affected by ecological
    factors. The fundamental knowledge of the ecological process is essential for
    the development cycle of the fruit species. For instance, climate conditions not
    only impact the physiology and phenology of fruits and vegetables but also affect
    the biotic and abiotic agents during the pollination of the crops (Tasnim et al.,
    2021). The ecological datasets are complex, high-dimensional, and non-linear in
    nature. Traditional linear statistical approaches like generic linear models are
    poor in identifying the complex patterns and relationships underlying ecological
    datasets (De’ath and Fabricius, 2000). Machine learning, on the other hand, can
    simulate non-linear associations in ecological data without requiring the limiting
    assumptions associated with parametric techniques. The survey witnessed that Classification
    and regression trees (CARTs) can be utilized in handling the ecological datasets
    (Al-Sanabani et al., 2019). Also, there are certain diseases like brown rot, blister
    rust, and cavity spots which are unusually available on fruits and vegetable surfaces.
    One-shot and Zero-shot learning helps to develop the model to classify new disease
    categories while dealing with rare fruitage datasets. They can be applied to the
    remotely sensed data to detect ecological indicators related to the vegetation
    health, for instance, particular plant tissues that flourish under certain conditions.
    Also, they can train the model to identify the fruiting or flowering stages to
    track the ecological phenology. 8.2. Deep learning research gaps and future directions
    in fruitage domain • Fruitage size and Computational resources: The fruit and
    vegetable data sample size is one of the prime challenges for deep learning models.
    For the effective training of the deep models, large training data samples are
    required. However, the collection of labeled fruitage datasets is a challenging
    task due to several dependencies such as weather, season, and pathogen attacks.
    Generally, the field-collected datasets are imbalanced and limited in size. As
    noted in the literature, the diseased classes are the minority ones in most of
    the repositories so it is difficult to get diseased fruitage as per the requirements
    in the limited tie domain. The fruitage dataset expansion may be carried out using
    conventional image augmentation methods, which include geometric and photometric
    transformation (Khalifa et al., 2022). Also, the color jittering might augment
    the fruit datasets by adjusting contrast, saturation, and brightness in the different
    color sub-spaces. However, these traditional augmentation methods fail to capture
    the feature diversity while balancing the fruitage dataset. On a similar note,
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have drawn remarkable attention in expanding
    the fruit and vegetable dataset using deep learning techniques. Vanilla GAN, Conditional
    GAN, Wasserstein GAN, Cycle GAN, and StarGAN are a few instances used to generate
    synthetic fruitage images. A novel image augmentation method known as Random Image
    Cropping And Patches (RICAP) may also be used to expand the training dataset from
    four randomly selected fruitage images (Noguchi et al., 2020). Also, the mask
    scoring R-CNN model can be deployed in the same direction to overcome the limited
    fruitage dataset problem (Yao et al., 2022). The mode collapse problem might cause
    the GAN neural network to generate only a subset of fruits and vegetables, disregarding
    the dataset’s diversity. Deep learning techniques like diversity-promoting losses
    or progressive growing, mini-batch discrimination techniques may be used to handle
    mode collapse problems. The deep models are computationally complex which requires
    high-performance TPUs and GPUs with large storage capacity to handle enormous
    datasets. However, for agricultural applications, lightweight models need to be
    developed to meet the current demands. In the future, advanced and lightweight
    hybrid models may be developed to mitigate the current challenges of deep learning-based
    models. A lightweight CNN model having 101,000 numbers of network parameters has
    been developed for disease classification in banana, mango, and guava species
    (Hari and Singh, 2023). On the contrary, the lightweight CNN fails to capture
    the complex structural irregularities in the fruitage dataset. Dilated convolution
    is another approach to increase the receptive field without increasing the trainable
    and non-trainable parameters, thus helpful to develop the lightweight CNN network.
    ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, EfficientNet, and MobileNets are considered as lightweight
    CNN models (Rangarajan et al., 2022). The adversarial noises, Progressive GANs,
    SRGANs, and superscaled image resolution may be deployed for better image representation.
    • Limited Fruitage Annotations: Fruitage image annotation is an integral process
    during the pre-processing stage, which helps to categorize and label unknown samples
    using volunteers or subject-experts (which might be hard to participate). Such
    experts might be prone to make errors while annotating the samples, especially
    in identifying types of diseases in the different parts of the plants. To remedy
    this, the majority voting of experts may be used for labeling the images in the
    agricultural domain (Gené-Mola et al., 2021). However, the availability of domain
    experts is also one of the challenges. Thus, advanced data labeling methods may
    be developed in the future to annotate the data automatically. However, automated
    annotations may result in degenerated labeling due to missing boundary regions,
    redundant datasets, and outliers. The research study witnessed the image annotation
    by visualizing boundary box coordinates to identify the severe areas in vegetables
    and fruits (Dhiman et al., 2022a). Deep learning methods such as YOLO, CenterNet,
    Faster R-CNN, and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) can be employed for real-time
    fruitage disease detection at multiple aspect ratios and scales. Also, image segmentation
    is crucial in data annotation that facilitates the disease classification process
    by identifying the IoU regions. It segregates the infected fruitage image into
    multiple segments, where each segment represents the particular pixel-level disease
    symptoms. Segmentation techniques like UNet, DeepLab, NDVI masking, and Mask-CNN
    can be exploited for multi-scale contextual information for precise pixel-level
    segmentation. Keypoint annotation offers detailed information about object characteristics
    that conventional semantic labels or bounding boxes are unable to capture (Naik
    et al., 2023). Comprehensive work can be done in the direction of utilizing the
    autoencoders and self-supervised learning methods to make efficient use of unlabeled
    fruit and vegetable data. Also, a novel semi-automated segmentation method may
    be employed to label the real-field farms to overcome the manual annotation problem
    (Hasan et al., 2022). • Hyperparameter Tuning: Most of the DL models trained on
    real-field collected images require a high number of hyperparameters for effective
    training. The number of convolution layers and filters for a particular problem
    remains the pertinent issue which is solved using the naïve hit & trial method.
    Thus, optimal parameter selection is still an open problem, which can be ameliorated
    using pre-trained architectures with transfer learning and multi-layer extreme
    learning mechanism (Park and Yang, 2019). Several performance parameters like
    input bias, learning rate, and output bias, which reduced the complexity of updating
    the layers’ weight, have shown remarkable breakthroughs for fruit disease classification
    (Vasumathi and Kamarasan, 2021). The transfer learning techniques might be utilized
    to extract optimal features to ensure multi-task learning like grading or maturity
    detection, fruit disease, and their severity level detection (da Costa et al.,
    2020). However, classifying diseases in fruits or vegetables with different backgrounds
    (e.g. farmland or grocery store) may further require extra fine-tuning to address
    such issues. Hyperparameter selection or tuning is still an iterative method that
    requires hit and hit-and-trial approach to finding robust models. Grid search
    optimizes the hyperparameters where model performance is validated using fold
    validation by searching all possible permutations of the hyperparameters, whereas
    random search optimizes the hyperparameters using random values within the valid
    range of each hyperparameter. In the future, Gradient-Based and Bayesian optimization
    methods may be explored for determining the optimal values of the hyperparameters
    used in the networks. • Complex Fruitage Data: Generally, the deep models are
    not able to produce significant results in detecting images containing occluded
    or tiny fruitage objects. The pooling layer of the deep models reduces the feature
    vector twice in each iteration, causing the model to forget the features of past
    layers. Thus, the deep model performance degrades as the fruitage data complexity
    increases, thus limiting the utilization of the pre-trained object detection deep
    models in real-world circumstances. RNNs and LSTM networks are designed to handle
    sequential and temporal data about the fruit defects to capture data dependencies
    and temporal trends (Vasumathi and Kamarasan, 2021, Dhiman et al., 2023, Khattak
    et al., 2021). These models can utilize time series data to monitor the health
    and disease outbreaks in the fruitage industry. The fruitage datasets have tiny
    regions, which play important roles in decoding the output label. Thus, attention-based
    networks need to be designed in coordination with the passage blocks to remember
    the important features of the successive layers, which give more attention to
    the region of interest. The SE (Squeeze and Excitation) module might be deployed
    for readjusting the aggregated feature maps via the attention technique for the
    best feature map representation (Han et al., 2021). Further work can be carried
    out to design models implementing transformer models with its core self-attention
    and multi-head attention blocks (Rahman et al., 2018). They assign different attention
    weights to the various fruit defects based on the severity, thus, enabling the
    classification model to concentrate on important long-range dependency information.
    Sliding window mechanism, patching, hierarchical representations, self-attention
    mechanism, and positional encoding help in identifying the tiny lesions in fruits
    & vegetables. The complex background of the real-time fruit and vegetable images
    may result in the low disease recognition accuracy which can be further improved
    by hybridized CNN-transformer models for multi-scale local and global feature
    extraction. • Model Complexity: The complexity of the deep learning models encompasses
    various factors, including the number of CNN layers, the number of neurons or
    activation units in each layer, and the overall architecture’s width and depth.
    Stabilizing model complexity is crucial in deep learning. The literature survey
    concluded that simple deep learning models suffer from the underfitting problem,
    while complex deep learning models may overfit the dataset. Vegetables and fruits
    are vulnerable to a wide variety of diseases. Thus, complex techniques are required
    to control defects while lowering the use of pesticides. Building models with
    the right complexity requires the best model selection, drop-out, early stopping,
    hyperparameter tuning, and regularization as per the problem domain. The convolutional
    neural network might be regularized with ridge loss to overcome the gradient penalty
    loss for better disease detection (da Costa et al., 2020). An EfficientNet deep
    learning model could scale the model in all dimensions by utilizing the compound
    coefficient ( ) while preserving the model complexity (Tan and Le, 2019). Pointwise
    convolutions having 1 × 1 kernel size preserve spatial dimensions while lowering
    the number of channels, thus minimizing computation time. Also, conditional convolutions
    reduce processing time by adapting the number of convolutional filters based on
    the properties of the fruitage dataset. Deep learning models that can efficiently
    incorporate information from several modalities like images, videos, and text
    might open up novel avenues for tasks such as multimodal learning and reasoning.
    • Model Transparency: The intrinsic complexity of the DL models often leads to
    the lack of transparency about the fruits, thus making it tough to understand
    the decisions made by the models. The agrarians fail to understand the reasons
    behind the ambiguous model’s prediction of a particular disease in fruits or vegetables.
    Thus, it is challenging to take preventive actions or confirm the disease classification
    accuracy without expert knowledge. It hinders the ability to identify the model
    bias, like overfitting to specify visual cues that might be caused by the background
    rather than fruit defective features. Also, the model’s trustworthiness is crucial
    for the adoption of smart techniques in agriculture (Albahri et al., 2023). The
    farmers may face skepticism in automated fruitage disease classification systems
    due to a lack of trust in the black-box deep models. The Explainable AI (XAI)
    algorithms integrated with DL methods have been used to overcome these issues.
    Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) (Hamilton et al., 2022),
    Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) (Chen et al., 2022), and t-SNE (Van der Maaten
    and Hinton, 2008) are few instances for the visualization of interpretable DL
    methods. The LIME visualization explains the predictions for each disease category
    by locally approximating it with an interpretable DL model, whereas SHAP visualization
    quantifies the importance of each lesion feature to the classification based on
    the Shapley values obtained from cooperative game theory. The dimension reduction
    technique (t-SNE) transforms the high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional
    space (two or three dimensions) by optimizing the K-L divergence between them.
    8.3. Internet-of-things research gaps and future directions in fruitage domain
    • Data Monitoring: IoT applications use different real-time sensors to generate
    huge fruitage datasets. Monitoring intelligent sensors simultaneously in arable
    farming is a challenging task. Significant research has been performed to implement
    different remote sensor systems in acquiring the disease symptoms (such as scabs,
    ring rot, anthracnose), physiological indicators (such as pigment and water content),
    and structural deformations caused by fruitage pests. It is clearly visible in
    the survey that fruitage disease classification is an important step for diagnosing
    nutrient deficiencies, projecting fruit & vegetable production, and providing
    a decision-making foundation for agricultural crop policy formulation. It may
    be addressed by deploying a multitemporal model for comparing fruits and vegetables
    at different phenological growth stages to measure multiple traits like pH, ripeness
    level, water stress, and nutrient level. Sensors onboard UAVs that utilize hyperspectral/multispectral/infrared
    imaging techniques may provide an excellent solution for fruitage image acquisition.
    Such non-destructive spectral technology may be further explored to detect multi-disease
    classification in the agriculture farmlands (Moriya et al., 2021). IoT device
    deployment indicates that the performance of the installed transceiver is overemphasized
    by environmental factors like wind and humidity where the wired node wants to
    interface. Digital temperature sensors like DHT22 and humidity sensors, namely
    AM2302, had been utilized to collect the in-situ information of the agriculture
    fields (Pawara et al., 2018). Different real-field attributes of vegetable or
    fruit species, namely, soil and air temperature, air moisture level, soil electric
    conductivity, wind direction, water level, leaf wetness, and solar radiation play
    crucial roles in disease detection (Khattab et al., 2019). IoT sensors (Biological
    air sensor DHT22 for air dampness and temperature, Gravity simple pH sensor, and
    Grove dampness sensor for soil dampness) can be further explored to acquire real-time
    fields information (Pavel et al., 2019). Various IoT components, like temperature
    sensors (LM35), moisture sensors (LM358), humidity sensors (DHT11), light intensity
    sensors (BH1750), and water flow sensors (YF-S201) are commonly used sensors to
    build a robust disease recognition system (Nagasubramanian et al., 2021). Also,
    soil NPK sensors can also to utilized to determine the real-time nutrient content
    of fruits. Designing energy-efficient IoT sensors by using low-energy microprocessors
    and power-saving modes may be considered particularly in remote areas. TinyML
    allows the ML models to run on low-power IoT devices without relying on powerful
    cloud servers and high computing hardware or software devices to address the high
    energy consumption issue. • Standardization or Interoperability: Since billions
    and trillions of heterogeneous smart devices are connected to the physical world.
    Thus, standard communication protocols are one of the prime concerns for the researchers
    developing intelligent IoT frameworks for fruitage disease monitoring. Different
    IoT sensors might have distinct data formats, varying data modalities, and different
    dataset acquisition frames, resulting in misalignment and misclassification of
    diseases. It is crucial to synchronize the fruitage data from different sensors
    to produce coherent data. Thus, an appropriate identity management mechanism is
    required for providing effective addressing to global devices, thus making all
    the connected nodes “similar” in terms of protocols and encodings. Some efforts
    have been carried out to transform the heterogeneity of the fruitage data into
    homogeneity formats for arable farming such as ISO 11783 (ISOBUS) standards designed
    by Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) (Fountas et al., 2015).
    Additionally, the usage of middleware applications like SmartFarmNet or FIWARE,
    HYDRA, and SMEPP can lessen the data heterogeneity problem in the fruitage industry
    to ensure standardization (Kour and Arora, 2020). Some reference models like Industrial
    Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA), Reference Architecture Model Industries
    (RAMI 4.0), and the European Research Cluster on IoT (IERC) are working in this
    direction to make IoT a global technology. Also, protected agriculture requires
    remote monitoring and standard IP (Ingress Protection) ratings for the proper
    functioning of the sensors in arable farming (Baranwal et al., 2020). International
    standards (IEC 60529) define the IP ratings for the life span of the IoT sensors.
    • Cyber security Challenges: With increasing network devices, the probability
    of digital attacks and vulnerability increases (Shafiq et al., 2020d). The real-time
    sensors and wireless network employed for fruitage disease classification are
    deployed in unsupervised and open farmland scenarios. Technically, the following
    open challenges need to be addressed: (1) trust mechanism; (2) communication and
    user data privacy and security; (3) services and application security. Such IoT
    management is susceptible to interference from outside sources and unauthorized
    users. Thus, multiple data privacy mechanisms such as encryption & decryption,
    identity authorization mechanism, and anonymity mechanism are required for protected
    agriculture (Shafiq et al., 2020a). Agriculture 4.0 has adopted cloud-based smart
    applications, opening up new potential for adversaries to oscillate cyberattacks.
    Typically, conventional end-to-end encryption and decryption techniques are used
    to secure the data. However, IoT devices require energy-efficient and least computational
    power encryption algorithms as the sensors constantly collect real-time fruitage
    data for a long time using battery power. Also, data integrity, authorization,
    and authentication mechanisms are the major concerns for secure communication
    between devices. The literature survey concluded that the real-time fruitage information
    has been stored on the PostgreSQL database and Neo4j database, which are vulnerable
    to SQL injection attacks (Zhu et al., 2023, Akhter and Sofi, 2021). On the same
    note, the database access management methods should be reinforced by restricting
    the database usage on the basis of the security level. Also, the fruitage images
    have been compressed and uncompressed using the DCT algorithm, hybrid measurement
    matrix method, and OMP method (Orthogonal matching pursuit) (Nandhini et al.,
    2015). • Resource Optimization: As trillions of nodes are connected to generate
    and store massive fruitage data using real-time sensors. Thus, efficient routing
    strategies are required to optimize the allocation of sensor nodes to the gateway
    nodes at low communication costs and energy consumption. The literature survey
    witnessed the Sunflower EarthWorm (S-EWA) method to optimize the routing path
    between the sensor nodes for data propagation in the rice agriculture farmlands
    (Vimala et al., 2021). The optimized IoT system must ensure load balancing, traffic
    management, and minimum Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. The IoT system
    consisting of Jetson Xavier Nx and TensorRT accelerator for edge computing has
    further increased the recognition and validation accuracy of the disease recognition
    model (Zhang et al., 2022). The Thinkspeak IoT cloud services have been addressed
    to store enormous fruitage data because of open source and data scalable features
    (Pawara et al., 2018, Microsoft, 2022). ThingSpeak also offers incorporation with
    IoT services, platforms, and applications using its RESTful API. Cutting-edge
    technologies like cloud-based services, fog-edge-based computing and federated
    learning algorithms can be utilized to store information in the cloud. Furthermore,
    the Thinkspeak cloud via SIM800 Quad-band GSM/GPRS modem with SMA (SubMiniature
    Version A) connector has been exploited to store the temperature and humidity
    data on the cloud. Despite this, there are several open challenges to be addressed;
    (1) data collection, (2) data decentralization, and (3) lack of decision support
    infrastructure. Non-destructive swarm robotics utilizes the self-organizing, decentralized
    algorithms that may be employed for disease detection in arable farming (Albiero
    et al., 2022). These techniques might be equipped with multi-sensors, including
    the hyperspectral, and NIR cameras for fruit & vegetable image acquisition, and
    effectively gather information about the disease categories of vegetables and
    fruits. 8.4. Fruitage dataset research gaps and future directions • Unavailability
    of real-time benchmark fruitage dataset: Despite the availability of extremely
    complicated models, fine-tuning the architectures on fruitage images under in-field
    scenarios is necessary for their proper deployment in a real-time environment.
    The literature survey acknowledged that the scarcity of fruitage diversity regarding
    image features, shape, size, disease, and multiple species would result in poor
    performance of the model deployment. Significant efforts may be required to foster
    collaboration and consensus among multiple research teams in the collection and
    sharing of fruitage datasets, which can enhance both the quantity and quality
    of these valuable fruitage datasets. Generally, most in-field datasets emphasize
    a single fruit or vegetable, leading to the future direction for developing benchmark
    datasets for multiple cultivars with in-field scenarios. Most of the recent studies
    witnessed the dataset containing single fruit or vegetable cultivars known as
    single-fruitage dataset (Sara et al., 2022, Kaufmane et al., 2022, Alencastre-Miranda
    et al., 2018). Still, a few research works also focussed on the multi-fruitage
    dataset to build the robust disease recognition system (Meshram and Patil, 2022,
    Medhi and Deb, 2022). The captured dataset size is very small, which makes the
    deep learning model hard to train (Rajbongshi et al., 2022, Rauf et al., 2019,
    Kumar et al., 2021). Furthermore, the banana and date palm images have been collected
    under natural light, respectively, to witness the real-field data acquisition
    (Medhi and Deb, 2022, Altaheri et al., 2019). Additionally, some research studies
    utilized non-public or internet images of infected fruits or vegetables; thus,
    result replication is a challenging task due to the inaccessibility of fruitage
    dataset (Zhu et al., 2023, Oraño et al., 2019). Thus, there is a need for a robust
    real-field dataset that contains mostly consumed fruits and vegetables from different
    cultivars with different growing stages (flowering to maturation). Also, it is
    recorded that computer vision-based video datasets are rarely available to train
    the models. In the future, developing video fruitage datasets may be a demanding
    asset for the researcher’s community working in the area. Moreover, the fruitage
    dataset developed from the satellite images could play a vital role in predicting
    the disease maps under different environmental conditions. • Diverse and complex
    background: Real-time fruitage disease detection is a challenging task due to
    environmental factors like cloudy weather, lightning conditions, and changeable
    backdrops. Moreover, identifying diseases with a moving camera, such as UAV or
    satellite imaging, is more difficult than static images due to shifting background
    conditions. Thus, robust foreground and background separation and segmentation
    techniques must be explored for better results. Also, most of the recent research
    has been concentrated on datasets collected under controllable laboratory circumstances,
    which becomes the foundation for future work. The fruitage images should be gathered
    in the real-field arable farmlands to enhance the generalization ability of the
    robust disease classification model. The survey witnessed that the fruitage image
    acquisition has been carried out using digital cameras, Raspberry Pi cameras,
    and thermal cameras under a controlled environment to enhance the disease recognition
    accuracy (Tariq et al., 2022, Meshram and Patil, 2022, Alencastre-Miranda et al.,
    2018). Thus, the resultant dataset contains processed images without complex backgrounds,
    fixed backgrounds, or white backgrounds. Thus, intelligent models find it hard
    to predict disease in fruits or vegetables during real-time scenarios. To overcome
    this challenge, novel methods may be developed for automatic background noise
    removal from the multiple fruit images (Oltean, 2021). Graph-based segmentation
    methods can be employed that utilize graph cut techniques to segregate the foreground
    images from the complex background. GAN-based dehazing methods may be further
    explored to mitigate the disease classification problem under extreme weather
    conditions. • Close-distance Fruitage images: The majority of the publicly accessible
    datasets contain mobile camera-captured images taken from a close distance. Also,
    disease-prone areas comprise a sizeable portion of an image, irrespective of size.
    However, for the real-time performance of the models, smart, innovative models
    are required, which are trained on datasets containing proximity images from the
    camera. Moreover, the datasets captured from mobile devices do not cover the image
    information from different angles, which may leave important feature information
    for disease classification. The literature survey has emphasized the in-situ fruitage
    dataset collection with an appropriate angle to exaggerate the detailed spatial
    information (Rajbongshi et al., 2022, Kumar et al., 2021). It is recommended to
    utilize digital twin, binocular stereo vision, and 3D depth sensors to create
    the virtual visualization of fruits and vegetables, thus enabling the detailed
    disease information (Tang et al., 2023, Shoji et al., 2022). The study also concludes
    that the UAV-captured datasets will be the future demands for developing robust
    agricultural applications. Spraying Agri-robots is the future dimension to identify
    diseases on the fruit or vegetables and then spray targeted pesticide treatment
    to affected species. Furthermore, these robots can be employed for other tasks,
    such as crop harvesting and lifting. They can be controlled using remote sensors
    via smartphones for continuous fruit disease monitoring. • Sample size symptoms
    (SSS) recognition: Diagnosing the symptoms early is still a challenge for the
    researchers due to minute symptoms. Tiny lesions in fruits & vegetables can cumulatively
    degrade their quality and shelf life, thus raising concerns about food safety.
    Therefore, models should be robust enough to catch the tiniest symptoms for effective
    classification. Deep reinforcement learning methods like Trust Region Policy Optimization
    (TRPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) may be deployed
    to identify the tiny infected regions present on the outer surface of the fruits
    and vegetables. Similarly, non-destructive techniques such as Computed Tomography
    (CT), and NIR spectroscopy may be employed for identifying the internal lesions
    in fruits & vegetables. Gas sensors are an indirect IoT approach in identifying
    internal fruit defects by finding the variation in gases emitted by fruits or
    vegetables as they ripen or develop defects (Alam et al., 2021). These can be
    integrated with spectroscopy techniques to develop Gas Chromatography and Mass
    Spectrometry (GC–MS) to determine the internal tiny defects in the fruits or vegetables.
    A few IoT instances, such as RFID tags, ultrasonic transducers, piezoelectric
    sensors, and acoustic sensors, may be deployed to further explore the attributes
    of the fruit in real-field farmlands (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2021). • Image Resolution
    Diversity: Fruitage image diversity plays a crucial role in enhancing both the
    spatial and spectral resolutions of a dataset. The literature survey witnessed
    that the RGB cameras are the most commonly used sensors, capable of capturing
    high spatial resolution images in the visible spectrum (Altaheri et al., 2019,
    Oltean, 2021, Gené-Mola et al., 2021). They excel in providing rich details related
    to color, and texture features, thus invaluable for multiple disease classification.
    On the contrary side, RGB images are highly susceptible to lighting conditions
    and can only capture information within the visible spectrum. Recently, hyperspectral,
    multispectral and thermal imagery have gained prominence attention in fruitage
    sensing due to their ability to reveal information in the invisible spectrum,
    which proves invaluable for early disease detection in the fruit or vegetables
    (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Steinbrener et al., 2019). Additionally, satellite-based
    Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images have shown notable presence
    in large-scale farmland mapping. Thus, future datasets should be curated by combining
    data from multiple camera sensors. This approach helps to offset the resolution
    limitations inherent in individual sensor types, ensuring a more comprehensive
    and informative dataset for disease identification applications. Spectral Disease
    Indices (SDI), Plant Disease Index (PDI), and Vegetation Indices (VI) are the
    important parameters used to increase the classification accuracy of disease identification
    and differentiation under real-world scenarios (Al-Saddik et al., 2017). 9. Summary
    and discussion This paper summarizes the current contributions and state-of-the-art
    development in machine learning, deep learning, and the Internet-of-Things, for
    fruit and vegetable disease identification, sorting, and grading. Fruit and vegetable
    safety, hygiene, and nutritional value are critical considerations in reducing
    food waste. The excellent quality of the fruitage must be monitored, and it must
    also be protected from deterioration and decay caused by climate variables such
    as humidity, temperature, and illumination. In this study, comparable fruit and
    vegetable disease classification tools using smart techniques have been discussed.
    It has covered ecological aspects such as temperature, moisture, alcohol web content,
    and light exposure for fruits and vegetables. Most of the smart technologies coupled
    with visualization methods achieve a classification accuracy of more than 90%
    in the disease classification domain for multiple cultivars of fruits and vegetables.
    Fig. 5 depicts the accuracy achieved using different intelligent models for the
    disease identification of fruits and vegetables. It is evident from the figure
    that fused technology has outperformed conventional methods to attain maximum
    accuracy. Concisely, SVM and clustering algorithms in the machine learning domain,
    pre-trained CNN using DTL and their variants in the deep learning domain, and
    UAV and microcontrollers (Arduino and Raspberry PI) in the IoT become the hotspot
    for fruit and vegetable disease detection and classification. Moreover, the consolidated
    report of the studied models has also been presented in Fig. 6 regarding classification
    accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity as the performance attributes.
    The -axis represents the contribution percentage (the number of studies in which
    the fruit is covered divided by the total number of studies) of a particular species,
    while the -axis denotes the percentage of studies in which a particular parameter
    has been considered for evaluation. For instance, as depicted in the figure, apple
    tissues have been used in 25.2% of the total considered studies. Whereas, 72.7%
    apple papers calculated the accuracy as the performance parameter. As shown in
    the figure, the apple is the most researched topic for disease classification
    in agriculture. At the same time, researchers have shown the least interest in
    fruits and vegetables like jackfruit, guava, potato, jute, pear, and strawberry
    in the miscellaneous section. It is clear from the figure that accuracy and Kappa’s
    coefficient are considered the most and least important evaluation criteria for
    disease classification, respectively. Some of the other performance measures for
    fruit and vegetable disease detection are False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative
    Rate (FNR), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), ROC curve, number of parameters,
    silhouette score, and segmentation accuracy. It is investigated from the study
    that several methods have used hand-crafted feature extraction approaches for
    extracting shape, color, size, and texture information from an image (Shafiq et
    al., 2020c). Recently, deep learning-based models have received significant attention
    from researchers for feature extraction due to their ability to extract features
    automatically without human interference, giving crucial information. It is important
    to note that the number of layers in the deep models varies depending on the dataset’s
    dimensions. For the high-dimensional dataset, a large number of layers and filters
    are required to extract the important features. During the image acquisition phase,
    several studies have collected high-resolution images using UAV, near-ground techniques,
    hyperspectral imaging, near-infrared imaging, multispectral imaging, RGB cameras,
    and other imaging techniques to obtain high disease classification accuracy. However,
    satellite technologies are restricted in their spatial/temporal resolutions and
    limited viewing capabilities in harsh weather conditions. Similarly, near-ground
    techniques have limited area coverage and need considerable effort to cover broad
    landscapes. Therefore, UAVs paired with sophisticated sensing technologies might
    be a cost-effective method for detecting fruit and vegetable diseases in small,
    medium, and large agricultural areas, enabling farmers to apply the correct treatment
    at the proper place, in the appropriate quantity, and at the right time. Download

    metrics for fruits and vegetables covered in SLR. Furthermore, the privacy of
    real-field data is one of the primary concerns for agrarians. A huge amount of
    data is required to train and test the models. Sometimes, farmers do not want
    to share the data due to privacy reasons, or the data source is heterogeneous.
    To overcome such issues, the federated learning concept has been introduced to
    ensure data privacy, partitioning, and system heterogeneity. Moreover, deep learning
    models require high computation resources and storage devices for effective disease
    prediction. Also, the majority of the farmers from developing nations do not have
    the advanced skills to become technology-friendly. Thus, providing cost-effective
    and user-friendly solutions to farmers is the future step for researchers in academia
    and industries. Li and Chao (2020) suggested that the regular convolution network
    performs poorly on the real-field data due to the forgetting issue, which can
    be mitigated using continual or incremental learning for effective disease classification.
    Moreover, regular neural network methods act as black-box machines focusing on
    the input and output without knowing the output interpretation. XAI algorithms
    may be integrated with deep learning models to enhance the comprehension and transparency
    of the disease classification models (Bhandari et al., 2023). Also, it is noted
    that the autonomous disease classification system requires a hardware and software
    prototype. The hardware module can be structured using IoT devices for real-time
    image acquisition, such as humidity, pressure, temperature, and nutrition index
    in fruits and vegetables. Similarly, the software framework can be integrated
    with deep learning algorithms for feature extraction and disease prediction. 10.
    Conclusion The primary objective of “Agri-Food 4.0” is not limited to growing
    fruitage crops. It gives way to a new “smart” context in the vegetative phase
    by introducing ICT technologies to monitor the crops and predict the loss. As
    a result, farms can shift away from the conventional supply-oriented, expensive,
    unidentified approach toward a valuation, information-driven process in which
    availability and demand are constantly matched. As a result, farms and food supply
    chains could develop into self-adaptive ecosystems where intelligent, self-reliant
    objects could operate, make decisions, and even adapt without human interaction.
    This study highlights the recent advancements in machine learning, deep learning,
    and IoT for fruitage disease recognition and classification, detecting internal
    and external lesions to fruits, and their level of maturity. Ninety-nine peer-reviewed
    articles from the last six years are covered in the study to unfold major research
    questions, challenges, and opportunities. The study presents a detailed assessment
    of work on mutually acceptable frameworks through a range of research objectives.
    Moreover, the study covers the technology-wise research, challenges, opportunities,
    gaps, and future directions for fruitage disease detection and monitoring. Moreover,
    the publicly available fruit and vegetable datasets, their limitations, and future
    opportunities are also detailed. The study finds that several high-performance
    design models are tested for early disease detection on publicly available datasets,
    primarily taken in controlled laboratory environmental scenarios. However, the
    in-field implementation of such systems is still limited due to high computational
    costs and scarcity of resources, especially in developing countries. It is also
    recorded that technical attributes (resolution, illumination), dataset collection
    scenarios (laboratory, in-field), and feature attributes (texture, energy, size)
    have a significant impact on spectral reflectance. Additional reflectance analysis
    based on crop vegetation indices is an additional future space during crop growth
    at all stages of the disease. It is noted that the fusion of different sensible
    techniques leads to an efficient disease classification framework, which may vary
    by author perception, working environment, and datasets. Generally, fusion methods
    involve image acquisition from multi-sensors, satellites, camera modules, UAVs,
    robotics, image pre-processing using computer vision techniques, and disease classification
    and prediction using DL and ML models. Besides, it is tough to deduce the superiority
    of one approach over the other. It is noted that every piece of cropland is crucial
    to maximize the yield and minimize the loss. This study may serve as a tool for
    the researchers working in the area to get consolidated in place information about
    recent advancements, limitations, and future opportunities in the field of the
    agri-fruit industry. Declaration of competing interest The authors certify that

  description: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a key component of Green IoT, as
    they play a critical role in many applications. However, a major challenge faced
    by WSNs is their limited energy capacity, which can impede their effectiveness.
    To address this issue, energy harvesting techniques are used to harness ambient
    energy and power the nodes, eliminating the need for frequent battery replacements
    or recharging. This study proposes a solar energy harvesting technique to prolong

    of Malaysia and its forecasted conditions. Through the use of NetSim simulations,
    the energy efficiency and reliability of the network are evaluated using solar
    energy harvesting. The recharge rate for energy harvesting in a wireless sensor
    network is calculated to be 2.34W per day using a 55x70mm solar photovoltaic panel
    based on Malaysia weather forecasts and sun hours. This proposed method is successfully
    executed using NetSim, which utilizes real device parameters for a WSN in a simulated

    can be used to monitor changes in plant available nutrients in soil. Introduction
    Precision supply of essential water and nutrients is important for crops because
    excess nutrients can reduce crop yields and residual nutrients can positively
    or negatively affect yields in the following year [53]. Importance of effectively
    managing soil nutrients and water to sustain and optimize agricultural productivity
    in changing environmental conditions is emerging due to imbalances in nutrients
    and water caused by recent climate changes [31]. Therefore, soil nutrient and
    water management are important to maintain the sustainability of agricultural
    land. Smart farms reduce costs and improve crop productivity by monitoring and
    controlling the agricultural environment through integration of automation technologies
    such as networks and mobile devices [37]. Automatic soil water management system
    using information and communications technology (ICT) helps in saving water by
    supplying desired amount of water required by the crops [1]. In addition, the
    ICT-based water management system contributes to the improvement of crop productivity
    and quality [16]. Especially, in outdoor smart farms, it is necessary to control
    the supply of nutrients according to crop growth while monitoring nutrients in
    real time using sensors [50]. Although there are various sensors for monitoring
    agricultural environment such as CO2, light intensity, temperature, humidity,
    and soil water content, sensors for monitoring nutrient availability in soil are
    still not fully developed [5]. Therefore, it is difficult to supply nutrients
    while monitoring soil nutrient levels, which is obstacle to precision agriculture
    in open field. Soil EC is affected by soil salinity, clay and water content, and
    adding nutrients to the soil increases the soil EC [17, 26]. Heiniger et al. [27]
    found that EC measurements of soil extracts could be used to predict soil nutrient
    content and are highly correlated with soil properties such as water content,
    cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soluble salts (R2 ranging from 0.51 to 0.75).
    In addition, nutrients such as N and K directly affect the EC of extracted soil
    solutions [40]. Therefore, nutrient content can be predicted by monitoring soil
    EC, but soil EC is highly influenced by soil water, soil texture, and organic
    matter [29]. In particular, the water content has significant effects on soil
    EC [22]. Increasing soil water content increased soil EC [14]. When the water
    content in soil was high, the soil EC increased as a result of the increased solubility
    of ions in soil [4]. Organic matter is important for plant growth along with nutrients
    in the soil because it is decomposed into smaller molecules and mineralized elements
    are absorbed by plants [41]. Organic matter can increase the soil EC due to the
    nutrients and salts included in organic matter [24]. However, the effect of soil
    organic matter on EC was not fully understood. To predict soil nutrients through
    soil EC monitoring using sensor, various soil characteristics including soil texture
    and organic matter affecting EC should be considered. In this study, we hypothesized
    that organic matter increases EC of the soil by releasing nutrients and affects
    EC by adsorption of ions. Conducting correlation analyses between EC and organic
    matter can offer insights into setting nutrient supply corresponding to EC values
    monitored by sensors for soils with different characteristics [46, 51]. Based
    on the relationship of soil organic matter and EC, the sensor EC values should
    be calibrated. Calibration of EC based on these correlations can enhance the accuracy
    of nutrient supply recommendations and improve the efficiency of soil management
    practices [39, 51]. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to monitor nutrients
    using EC sensors in soils with different clay and sand composition, water content
    and organic matter content and evaluate the effect of water content and organic
    matter on soil EC in different soils. Materials and methods Soil characterization
    Soils with different characteristics were collected from different agricultural
    lands in Korea, dried at room temperature, and sieved to a particle size of less
    than 2 mm using a stainless-steel sieve. The sand, silt and clay content of the
    soil was determined by Stoke’s law [23]. Soil pH and EC were measured using pH
    and EC meter after extracting 5 g of soil with 25 mL of deionized water for 30
    min. The Walkley–Black method was used to determine the amount of soil organic
    matter [52]. Two grams of soil and 20 mL of 1 M NH4CH3COOH solution at pH 7 were
    shaken for 30 min and filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filter. Filtered solution
    was acidified and elements were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical
    emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer, Avio 500). The soil CEC was calculated
    with Ca, Mg, K, and Na [47]. Ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) in the soil were
    measured using the indophenol-blue method and the vanadium (III) reduction method,
    respectively, after extracting 5 g soil with 25 mL of 2 M KCl solution [19, 20].
    For NH4+ analysis, 0.125 mL EDTA, 2 mL phenol/nitroprusside (PNP), and 1 mL NaOH/hypochlorite
    were mixed with 1 mL of the extract. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20
    min and absorbance of the solution was measured at 630 nm using a UV–VIS spectrometer
    (Orion AquaMate 7000, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) [20]. For NO3− analysis,
    20 µL of soil extract was mixed with 1 mL of the reagent prepared by dissolving
    0.4 g of VCl3 in 50 mL of 1 M HCl and mixing with 0.2 g of sulfanilamide and 0.01
    g of N-(1-Naphthyl)-ethylendiamine-dihydrochloride (NEDD) in 400 mL of de-ionized
    water. Absorbance of the solution was measured at 540 nm using a UV–VIS spectrometer
    after 18 h at 25 °C to determine soil NO3− concentration [19]. Table 1 shows the
    physicochemical properties of soils used. Table 1 Physicochemical properties of
    soil samples used for EC monitoring Full size table Soil EC and water content
    monitoring Air dried soil (1.5 L) was packed in a 2.2 L square container. For
    organic matter treatment, 40 g of compost manure were added to silty clay loam
    soil, 30 g of humic acid were added to loam soil, and 50 g of compost manure were
    added to sandy loam soil. Soils after adding organic matter were also characterized
    to evaluate effect of organic matter on sensor EC (Table 1). To monitor EC and
    water content, an EC sensor (Teros 12, METER Group, USA) was placed in soil to
    a depth of about 10 cm in an incubator at 20 °C. The Teros 12 sensor measures
    EC, volumetric water content, and temperature in soil at the same time. Water
    (900 mL) was added to the soil for saturation and the EC and water content were
    monitored until the soil water content evaporated to be less than 10% (v/v). Soil
    EC sensors were connected to ZL6 logger (METER Group, USA) and soil bulk EC (mS/cm),
    temperature (°C) and volumetric soil water content (m3/m3) were recorded every
    15 min. Soils with added organic matter (manure and humic acid) were also monitored
    for soil EC and water content in the same manner. Analysis of ion contents in
    soil pore water Rhizon sampler (Rhizosphere Research Products, Netherlands) was
    inserted into the soil to a depth of about 10 cm and pressure was applied to collect
    pore water in the soil at 25% water content. The pH and EC of the pore water were
    measured and element contents in the pore water were analyzed using ICP-OES after
    filtration using 0.45 μm syringe filter. Ammonium and NO3− contents of the pore
    water were also analyzed using the indophenol-blue method and the vanadium (III)
    reduction method, respectively. Soil samples were taken after monitoring EC, dried,
    and mixed with 1 M NH4CH3COOH solution (pH 7) at a soil to solution ratio of 1:10
    for 30 min. The solution was filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filter and exchangeable
    ion concentrations in the soil were analyzed using ICP-OES. Soluble NH4+ and NO3−
    in the soil before drying were extracted with de-ionized water and analyzed using
    a UV–vis spectrometer following the indophenol-blue method and the vanadium (III)
    reduction method, respectively. Statistical analysis Analyses were conducted in
    triplicate and presented as mean and standard deviation. The correlation among
    sensor EC, soil organic matter (SOM), EC calibration factor for water content,
    soil clay and sand contents, pH, and exchangeable elements was analyzed using
    Xlstat (Addinsoft). Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to evaluate
    relationship among the parameters including sensor EC values and SOM contents
    (Xlstat, Addinsoft). For PCA, soil sensor EC values were selected at water content
    of 30.9%, 22.5% and 17.0% v/v for silt clay loam, loam and sandy loam soils, respectively.
    Results and discussion Response of soil EC sensor in relation to soil water content
    Soil EC showed a linear correlation with water content at water content of 10–25%
    for loam and sandy loam soils and at water content of 10–40% for silty clay loam
    soil (Table 2). The water content range having linear relationship with EC was
    suitable water content for plant growth [11]. The linear correlation between soil
    water content and EC in the range of soil water content appropriate for plant
    growth indicates that soil EC can be used for nutrient monitoring regardless of
    soil moisture content by calibrating EC values for soil water content. Soil EC
    can be calibrated for desired water content because it is linearly proportional
    to water content. Other studies also reported that soil EC linearly increased
    with soil water content [14, 25, 54]. Sensor EC value decreased with decreasing
    water content in soil because the mobile fractions of ions decreased [18, 55].
    In addition, water containing ions is a conductor of electricity and water content
    was closely related to EC [33]. Sudduth et al. [48] also reported that EC could
    be explained by water content and bulk density of soil. However, at higher water
    content, the relationship between EC and water content was not linear, which was
    also reported by Rusydi [44]. When soil water is more than optimum water content,
    the relationship becomes nonlinear, wherein further increase of water content
    does not linearly raise EC due to saturation and mobility constraints [44]. Table
    2 Calibration factor of soil EC for soil water content without and with added
    organic matter Full size table Soil EC is related to soil texture, water content,
    organic matter, etc., and varies with soil properties [30]. Therefore, it is necessary
    to calculate the calibration factor considering the soil properties and apply
    it to calibrate the EC sensor value against soil water content. Sensor EC values
    were plotted against soil water contents and the slope of linear regression was
    defined as calibration factor. Higher calibration factor indicates that EC changes
    more with water content variation. Calibration factor derived from the slope of
    the linear relationship between soil EC and water content serves as a valuable
    metric [39]. This coefficient aids in predicting soil EC based on water content
    variations, which in turn can offer insights into nutrient contents and other
    essential soil properties [21]. Calibration factor for each soil was calculated
    in the range of available water content of each soil and the correlation coefficient
    was to be higher than 0.97 (Table 2). In comparison to the soil without organic
    matter, the calibration factor was higher when organic matter was added to the
    soil (Table 2). The increased calibration factor is because of adding organic
    matter to the soil and increases in exchangeable ions and nutrients (Table 3).
    Soil organic matter increased nutrient contents and finally increased soil EC
    [2, 28, 49]. When the ion contents of the soil are high, more dispersal occurs
    with the higher water content, which might be attributed to higher calibration
    factor with organic matter [42]. In addition, since sensitivity of the EC sensor
    increases as the water content increases, the calibration factor can be higher
    when organic matter and water are added to the soil [12]. Therefore, higher the
    soil nutrient content, the greater increase in soil EC by water content. Table
    3 Exchangeable ion contents in soil without and with added organic matter Full
    size table Changes in soil ion contents by addition of organic matter The concentration
    of exchangeable ions such as K, and Ca in the soil increased when organic matter
    was added in the soil because of dissolution of minerals containing K and exchangeable
    Ca by organic acids (Table 3). Initially manure compost was added as organic matter,
    but it increased EC and humic acid was added as organic matter for loam soil to
    avoid effect of salts released from added organic matter. However, both organic
    matters increased available nutrient concentrations increasing soil EC. Adding
    organic matter to the soil increased the content of N, C and S etc., which were
    included in manure compost and humic acid [3, 15, 38]. In addition, Bader et al.
    [7] reported that K concentration was significantly increased by the amount of
    organic matter. This is because some soil minerals that contain K are dissolved
    by organic acids (humic and fulvic) as a result of the decomposition of organic
    fertilizer [6]. Exchangeable Ca content was also related to soil organic carbon
    because Ca protects soil organic carbon from microbial degradation [45]. As a
    result, while monitoring soil EC with sensors, it is important to consider organic
    matter which influence the ion contents in the soil. The sensor EC value of sandy
    loam soil was highly correlated with the ion content in pore water, and the sensor
    EC value of loam soil was highly correlated with exchangeable ions (Fig. 1). Generally,
    loam soil has a higher adsorption capacity than sandy soil because it has a higher
    clay content than sandy loam [35]. Since sandy loam has a low water and ion holding
    capacity, the sensor EC value was highly correlated with ion content of the pore
    water (Fig. 1a, [10]). In addition, loam soil has a higher ion holding capacity
    than sandy loam, so the sensor EC value showed significant correlation with NO3−
    and Na which are soluble in water and with exchangeable cations that are relatively
    less soluble in water (Fig. 1b, [56]). Fig. 1 Correlation of sensor EC with soil
    properties and ion contents of sandy loam (a) and loam (b) (PW. pore water, W.
    water soluble ion, Ex. exchangeable ion) Full size image The pH of the pore water
    and the sensor EC value were negatively correlated (Fig. 1a). Luce et al. [36]
    explained that the negative correlation between soil EC and pH was associated
    with microbial mineralization and nitrification processes in the soil. Fig. 2
    Biplots of PC1 and PC2 for sensor EC monitoring values by soil characteristics
    and ion content and organic matter treatment (OM. organic matter added soil, PW.
    pore water, Ex. exchangeable ion) Full size image Relationship between sensor
    EC values and soil properties PCA was performed to evaluate the relationship between
    sensor EC values and soil properties with soil samples before and after adding
    organic matter. PCA is used to identify the variables that are related to associations
    among samples [13]. The PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4 accounted for 28.3%, 23.2%, 15.5%
    and 11.3% of the total variation, respectively (Table 4). The four PCs explained
    more than 78% of cumulative variance. The first PC showed positive correlations
    with sand content, pore water pH, and exchangeable Ca and P. The second PC was
    correlated with sensor EC, soil EC, CEC, pore water Ca, K, and P, and exchangeable
    Na, P and S, which were parameters contributing EC. The third PC was correlated
    with clay, CEC and exchangeable Mg, which were related to adsorption of cations.
    Table 4 Factor loadings based on correlations matrix and total variance explained
    by the principal components (OM.: added organic matter, PW.: pore water, Ex.:
    exchangeable ion) Full size table The sensor EC monitoring values showed a high
    correlation with the contents of NO3−, K, S and Ca in the pore water (Fig. 2).
    Since pore water exists between soil particles, ion content in pore water reflects
    plant available nutrients which increases EC [9, 43]. Nitrate is water soluble
    and increasing the mobility of ions increased the EC [8]. In addition, increased
    mobility of adsorbed K increased EC [34]. Since soil nutrients such as N and K
    are closely related to EC, which can be monitored using soil EC sensor. The close
    correlation between sensor EC and SOM was found because increased organic matter
    in the soil increased the ion contents and finally increased the soil EC (Fig.
    2). In particular, samples with additional organic matter were clearly separated
    from samples without added organic matter. Samples with added organic matter were
    distributed along soluble and exchangeable nutrients on PC1 and PC2 (Fig. 2).
    Soils with different texture were also well differentiated indicating that texture
    and organic matter affect available nutrients and sensor EC. Since the soil sensor
    EC values are related to the soluble ion contents in sandy loam and the exchangeable
    ion contents in loam soil, soil texture should be considered in the interpretation
    of sensor EC for the prediction of nutrient levels in soil. In addition, soil
    sensor EC values are highly correlated with N, K and SOM, which are important
    for plant growth. Therefore, when monitoring nutrient levels in soil using EC
    sensor, organic matter and soil texture need to be considered. If organic matter
    and water content are considered, the sensor EC can be used as an indicator of
    the nutrients available to plants in the soil. Conclusively, at optimal soil water
    content for plant growth, EC can be used to monitor changes in plant-available
    nutrients in the soil. Availability of data and materials The data that support

  description: India is primarily an agrarian country where more than 54% of the population
    is employed directly or indirectly in agriculture. Agriculture contributes 13.9%
    to the Economy of India. Irrigation in India is mainly through rain falls, canals
    and ground water. Farmers due lack of scientific intervention and less usage of
    technology in Irrigation flooding the land with water, is not only wasting precious
    water resources but also leads to erosion of the top soil which is essential for
    healthy crop growth. Moreover, considering the areas that are un-irrigated the
    water quantity from eart is decreasing as the water from earth is been removed
    at routine intervals of time. Additionally, the climatic condition of the soil
    also contributes to the crop growth. The proposed work attempts to address this
    issue of over and under irrigation of field by the introduction of smart irrigation
    method which depends upon the measured soil moisture using Volumetric Water Content
    (VWC) and soil temperature. This prevents unnecessary wastage of water and helps
    in the regulation of soil temperature. The soil moisture content in terms of VWC
    from sensor is validated against the traditional method of VWC measurement using
    Gravimetric Water Content and Bulk Density. The measured error is found to be
    within the range of +/- 1.5 %. Using the selected sensors and the controller an
    IoT application for Smart Irrigation System has been developed which provides
    the soil moisture and temperature parameters in a real-time basis, based on which
    the water pump is controlled remotely. Further a prototype model of the system
    is developed and deployed in the field for practical validation and evaluation.

  description: Accurate and near real-time volumetric soil water and volumetric ion
    content (VIC) measurements can both inform precise irrigation scheduling and aid
    in fertilizer management applications in cropping systems. To assist in the monitoring
    of these measurements, capacitance-based soil moisture probes are used in agricultural
    best management practice (BMP) programs. However, the ability of these sensors
    to detect nutrients in the soil sourced from fertilizers is not well understood.
    The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of a capacitance-based
    soil moisture probe in detecting Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium
    (K) movement in the soil. To achieve this, a laboratory-based setup was established
    using pure sand soil cores. Raw soil moisture and VIC probe readings from the
    cores were contrasted across multiple N, P, and K rates. The N treatments applied
    were rates of 0, 112, 168, and 224 kg/ha; for P, were 0, 3.76, and 37.6 kg/ha,
    and for K were 0, 1.02, 1.53, and 2.04 kg/ha. Each nutrient was evaluated separately
    using a randomized complete block design experiment with three replications for
    N and K, and 5 replications for P. The impact of each nutrient rate on the sensitivity
    of VIC readings was determined by evaluating differences in three points of the
    time series, including the observed maximum point, inflection point, and convergence
    value as well as the time of occurrence of those points over a 24-hour period.
    These points were assessed at depths 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 cm. The findings
    of this study highlight the capacitance-based soil moisture probes’ responsiveness
    to changes in all K rates at most depths. However, its sensitivity to changes
    in N and P rates is comparatively lower. The results obtained in this study can
    be used to develop fertilizer management protocols that utilize K movement as
    the baseline to indirectly assess N and P, while helping to inform those who currently
    use the probe which nutrients the probe may be detecting. The probes’ readings
    could be incorporated into decision support systems for irrigation and nutrient
    management and improve control systems for precision water and nutrient management.

  explanation: 'This study assessed the ability of a capacitance soil moisture probe
    to detect changes in nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) movement
    in a pure sand media. The capacitance soil moisture probe is widely used in automated
    irrigation management systems for measuring soil moisture and volumetric ion content
    (VIC) in real-time.


    The study was conducted by applying solutions containing varying concentrations
    of N, P, and K to sand cores and measuring the probe''s response to the changes
    in soil chemistry. The results showed that the probe was able to detect changes
    in VIC in response to changes in N, P, and K concentrations, indicating its potential
    for use in nutrient monitoring and management.


    However, it''s important to note that the study was conducted in a controlled
    laboratory setting, and the results may not directly translate to field conditions.
    Further research is needed to evaluate the probe''s performance in real-world
    scenarios and to develop practical applications for nutrient monitoring and management
    in agricultural systems.'
  extract_1: In this study, laboratory-based experiments were conducted to assess
    the changes caused in the VIC time series from SMS due to the presence of N, P,
    and K in a pure sand media.
  extract_2: The findings of this study highlight the capacitance-based soil moisture
    probes’ responsiveness to changes in all K rates at most depths. However, its
    sensitivity to changes in N and P rates is comparatively lower.

    The probes’ readings could be incorporated into decision support systems for irrigation
    and nutrient management and improve control systems for precision water and nutrient
    management. 1 Introduction Agricultural, urban, and industrial water resource
    management continue to play a significant role in eutrophication within freshwater
    systems, driven by factors such as population growth and intensification (Lu and
    Tian, 2017; Wurtsbaugh et al., 2019). It’s been shown that the management of irrigation
    and fertigation has major impacts on the nutrient leachate and runoff coming from
    agricultural production (Pérez-Martín and Benedito-Castillo, 2023). One approach
    to optimize agricultural production and minimize the environmental impacts involves
    high-quality diagnostic soil, plant, and water testing (Mylavarapu, 2010). However,
    a fraction (25%) of surveyed farmers in the USA and Australia conduct soil tests
    for monitoring nutrients (Lobry De Bruyn and Andrews, 2016). Due to these factors,
    the need for real-time soil nutrient monitoring is steadily increasing within
    agricultural water management. Such monitoring can contribute to the optimization
    of farmers’ fertilizer application rates and assist in implementing effective
    nutrient management practices (Burton et al., 2020), thus reducing agriculture’s
    impacts on water quality. To promote wider adoption of nutrient monitoring techniques,
    several advancements in precision agriculture have emerged to assess plant and
    soil nutrient content at the field level. Optical sensors, satellite-based remote
    sensing technologies, and drone-based approaches have been gaining ground (Hunt
    and Daughtry, 2018; Inoue, 2020; Sishodia et al., 2020). While these technologies
    are nondestructive, they are expensive and require skills and knowledge in data
    processing before the farmers can effectively use the collected data for decision-making.
    Currently, the use of remote sensing technology is mainly limited to researchers
    (Weber and McCann, 2015; Bramley and Ouzman, 2019). An alternative approach for
    continuous field-level data acquisition involves in-ground sensors. Capacitance
    soil moisture sensors (SMS) for instance, provide real-time readings of soil water
    (SM), volumetric ion content (VIC) or electrical conductivity (EC), and soil temperature
    (T). These sensors provide two outputs from dimensionless frequencies that within
    conjunction with one another, give readings of volumetric water content and VIC
    when separated by proprietary data model processes. (TriSCAN ® Agronomic User
    Manual Version 1.2a, 2003, Adelaide, Australia). The VIC data derived from SMS
    represents the dielectric constant, which is influenced by the presence of salts
    from fertilizers and irrigation water. If nutrient salts from fertilizers significantly
    impact the soil osmotic potential, the sensor can detect them (Or and Wraith,
    2002). The use of SMS for optimal irrigation scheduling has been adopted more
    by farmers than any other technology-based irrigation scheduling technique in
    the USA (Taghvaeian et al., 2020). If this most-adopted approach could also be
    utilized for nutrient management, the rate of adoption could be greatly increased.
    Based on the VIC-EC measuring capabilities of SMS’s and soil moisture probes (SMP),
    it’s hypothesized that a similar approach could potentially be employed for nutrient
    monitoring and management, in addition to irrigation scheduling using SMS VIC
    data, if relationships between nutrient movement across the soil profile and VIC
    readings are established. If this connection is successfully established, decision
    support systems could utilize this already commercially-available and adopted
    technology to quickly diffuse fertigation management strategies, decreasing agriculture’s
    contributions to eutrophication. It is known that decision support systems already
    utilize sensor outputs for the management of irrigation and fertigation practices
    to reduce environmental impacts (Zhai et al., 2020). But first, before implementation
    into systems as a nutrient-sustainable management strategy, it must be investigated
    which nutrients the technology could potentially be detecting. It’s hypothesize
    that in-ground SMS could be sensitive to nutrient movement in the soil. This hypothesis
    arises from three known principles. First, the nutrients’ influence on EC (Omonode
    and Vyn, 2006; Mirzakhaninafchi et al., 2017; Darmawan et al., 2023). Second,
    the established correlation between soil cations/anions and EC (Friedman, 2005),
    and third, the sensors’ capacity to detect soil VIC. Notably, fertilizers containing
    Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) are known to increase EC (Bhatt
    et al., 2019). The SMS’s VIC measurements have been found to be directly correlated
    to soil EC, with variation across soil types (Biswas et al., 2007). This correlation
    indicates the potential of SMS to detect the presence of N, P, and K in the soil
    due to fertilizer applications, inferred from VIC data. To the best of our knowledge,
    no published studies have examined the capability of these capacitance SMS to
    detect N, P, and K movements individually. In this study, laboratory-based experiments
    were conducted to assess the changes caused in the VIC time series from SMS due
    to the presence of N, P, and K in a pure sand media. While the SMS’s VIC sensing
    capabilities make direct nutrient detection unlikely, the ability to indirectly
    indicate high nutrient content in the soil holds value for those utilizing the
    sensors for management or those creating decision support systems in precision
    agriculture. Given that these SMS are readily available on the market and are
    being used by farmers in the USA, they could represent a feasible and rapid solution
    for implementing efficient in-field nutrient management plans. However, there
    is a need for them to be investigated to fully understand which nutrients are
    in fact being detected by the sensors. By harnessing real-time data, these systems
    could both maintain optimal agricultural water and nutrient management while minimizing
    environmental impacts from crop production. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Experiment
    location, design, and treatments The three N, P, and K experiments were conducted
    individually at the University of Florida’s Indian River Research and Education
    Center in Fort Pierce, FL, USA (27°25''33.9\"N 80°24''29.4\" W). The laboratory
    was kept at a constant temperature of around 21°C. While constant temperature
    cannot be expected in field settings, this study was designed to minimize any
    variation in the time series created from temperature variances, so the SMS signals
    were mostly influenced by each nutrient. Each experiment followed similar protocols
    and had a randomized complete block design where the SMSs data collection over
    a 24-hour time was considered the replication or block (Figure 1). Specifically,
    the N and K experiments encompassed three distinct rates and were replicated three
    times, while the P experiment tested two different rates of P and had five replications.
    Sequentially, the P experiment was conducted initially, followed by the N and
    K experiments. After concluding the P experiment, it was determined that the N
    and K experiments would benefit from more rates and fewer repetitions. This was
    determined due to literature pointing stronger to impacts of N and K on soil EC
    (Carneiro et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2021) while it pointed to smaller impacts
    of P on soil EC (Ding et al., 2020). As previous studies showed weaker P impact
    on soil EC but still impacting, it was determined to be beneficial to investigate
    2 application rates of P which were significantly different from each other with
    higher numbers of repetitions to determine if P would be detectable through the
    SMP. However, as previous studies successfully registered strong EC signals from
    N and K in soils, it was determined to be beneficial to further investigate how
    sensitive the SMSs could be to various application rates of N and K beyond simple
    detection. Despite the differences in number of repetitions and applications between
    the three separate experiments, each experiment had a randomized complete block
    design where the 24-hour time was considered the replication or block. A summary
    of the treatments and nutrient rates used in this study is outlined in Table 1.
    figure 1 Figure 1 Diagram of the randomized complete block design for N, P and
    K experiments. table 1 Table 1 N, P, and K rates per treatment. The N source used
    was powdered urea (42-0-0), and the N rate treatments were application rates selected
    based on local N fertilizer recommendations for sweetcorn (Hochmuth and Hanlon,
    1995). The low rate indicates split application at the six-leaf stage of the crop,
    the average rate is the preplant application rate, and the high rate represents
    the total accumulated N suggested for one crop season. For P a 1000 ppm orthophosphate
    standard solution was purchased from Fisher Scientific. This solution was selected
    as inorganic P is a bioavailable source of P (Thien and Myers, 1992) often found
    in fertilizers (Cade-Menun et al., 2017). P rates were determined based on soil
    P concentration of a local sweetcorn farm in South Florida, USA, where the high
    rate represented average P soil levels, and the low rate was one-tenth of this
    level. The K source was KCl 3M solution from Fisher Scientific, with treatments
    selected based on groundwater salinity concentrations. According to Her and Vassilaros
    (2022), the maximum groundwater salinity concentration reported was 9.12 dS/m
    along the South Florida coastal areas. Thus, in this study, this measurement was
    used as a baseline to convert K levels ranging from 5-10 dS/m reflecting groundwater
    levels (Her and Vassilaros, 2022) to the kg/ha measurements of 1.02, 1.53, 2.04
    kg/ha treatments. Each nutrient source was mixed with 500 ml reverse osmosis water,
    and to ensure consistency in metrics, units were transformed to nutrient rates
    per hectare of land. 2.2 Soil moisture probe and calibration A TriSCAN Sentek
    drill and drop (SMP) soil moisture probe (Sentek Drill and Drop SDI-12 Series
    III, 2015) was utilized for this experiment. The SMP is equipped with 6 individual
    SMSs distributed equally down the probe. Across the SMP, sensors are located at
    specific depths: 5 cm (sensor 1), 15 cm (sensor 2), 25 cm (sensor 3), 35 cm (sensor
    4), 45 cm (sensor 5), and 55 cm (sensor 6) from the surface. Each SMS provides
    readings of volumetric soil water content, soil temperature, and VIC at 15-minute
    intervals. The sensors generate two frequencies. The first frequency is converted
    through a normalization Equation 1 (Schelter et al., 2006). X−Xmin Xmax−Xmin (1)
    and calibrated to volumetric soil water content. The second frequency is proportional
    to soil water content and the presence of free ions in the soil pore water. Proprietary
    data modeling integrates changes in both signals, yielding nominal VIC. These
    VIC readings can also be correlated with EC (Sentek TriSCAN ® Agronomic User Manual
    Version 1.2a, 2003, Adelaide, Australia). When the SMP is inserted into soil,
    each sensor within the SMP begins transmitting the soil water content, soil temperature,
    and VIC data in real-time every 15 minutes, generating a time series that begins
    from the moment of installation. This data can be observed by the user on commercial
    displays developed by data providers for service. Multiple data providers service
    the SMP used in this study. To ensure uniform measurements across all sensors,
    the SMPs were calibrated according to Sentek Technologies’ soil moisture sensors
    calibration manual (Calibration Manual for Sentek Soil Moisture Sensors Version
    2.0, 2011). For each soil core, a single SMP was installed as shown in Figure
    2. Data from the SMPs were retrieved via two data providers currently being used
    within the state of Florida: BMP Logic (https://www.bmplogic.net/) and Pessl Instruments
    (http://metosusa.com/). The subsequent data analysis was performed on the raw
    data extracted from each platform. figure 2 Figure 2 Laboratory experimental setup
    pre-nutrient application. 2.3 Experimental protocol Soil cores were composed of
    60 cm tall riser-pipe cylinders with a 16 cm diameter. Each cylinder was cut through
    the middle lengthwise, and fitted together with hose clamps, with the aim of replication
    sampling (Figure 3). To prevent soil movement with leachate, the lower portion
    of the pipes were sealed using a water-permeable fabric mulch. The fabric mulch
    ground cover utilized in this study was manufactured by Lumite, Inc (http://www.lumiteinc.com/products/groundcover)
    and is comprised of a blend of woven fabrics and UV polypropylene that allows
    passage of water and nutrients at a rate of 720 L min/m2. figure 3 Figure 3 Sand
    core and extraction of soil samples for laboratory analysis based on the sensor
    depth. Horizontal colored lines represent the location of each soil moisture sensors
    across the core. The cores were filled with 15 kg of silica sand and evenly trapped
    along the sides in a uniform manner to prevent air gaps. To avoid variance in
    compaction, cores were only proceeded to be used if greater than 2.5 yet less
    than 5 cm of space was present at the top of the core. As each core held the same
    mass of sand and was equal in volume, anything outside of these parameters was
    determined to have a variance in compaction and was not used in the experiment.
    SMPs were installed in the center of each core following the manufacturer’s installation
    protocols (Sentek Drill and Drop SDI-12 Series III, 2015). Following SMP installation,
    the cores remained undisturbed for 1.5 hours to allow for temperature adjustment
    and soil settling. Subsequently, the 500ml solution containing either N, P, or
    K was applied. The solution was evenly poured onto the core’s surface using a
    custom-made strainer, ensuring uniform distribution across the top surface. After
    the solution had thoroughly passed through the strainer, the core remained undisturbed
    for 24 hours. At the end of the 24-hour period, the SMPs were carefully positioned
    horizontally to prevent further seepage. The core was then divided into six distinct
    10 cm sections (Figure 3), corresponding to the descending depths of sensors within
    the SMP. These soil sections were compositely, air-dried for P and K or stored
    in the refrigerator for N, before being sent for analysis. N and K soil samples
    were sent to Water’s Agricultural Laboratory (Camilla, GA) for extraction and
    analysis while P soil samples were sent to UF IFAS Everglades Research and Education
    Center’s soil lab for Mehlich III extraction and analysis. 2.4 Data analysis The
    time series obtained per treatment were evaluated by assessing three VIC points
    within the time series and their comparison by ANOVA. These points attained were
    identified as the maximum point (MP), inflection point (IP), and the convergence
    point (CV). The MP was evaluated in two ways: the MP value (MPv) and its time
    of occurrence (MPt), which together represent the highest VIC reading given by
    the SMS within the SMP at its given depth. The inflection point was also evaluated
    in two ways: the IP value (IPv) and its time of occurrence (IPt), which together
    represent the slope of drainage after the nutrient solution has passed down to
    deeper soil layers, or the soil is under its water-available field capacity conditions.
    The CV was only evaluated in value as it is the final normalized value taken after
    24 hours, making its time of occurrence equal in each repetition. The CV represents
    the ‘settling point’ of the solution. A visual representation of these points
    is displayed in Figure 4. Graphs were obtained from each repetition of each treatment;
    Figure 4 is a sample of the first repetition in the K experiment presented here
    as a visual guide. figure 4 Figure 4 Identification of signal dispersions in the
    time series from raw data (A) and normalized data (B) from the potassium trial
    at 5 cm depth. Circles represent the maximum points per treatment (MP), squares
    represent inflection points per treatment (IP), and triangles represent the convergence
    points per treatment (CV). As the purpose of this research is to evaluate these
    currently used SMP’s ability to detect nutrients in the soil, it was important
    that the elements of the VIC curve analyzed were elements that reflect the current
    time series management for irrigation scheduling by farmers. the University of
    Florida Electronic Data Information Source (EDIS) offers guidelines to interpret
    time series elements and values to assist growers in irrigation management (Zotarelli
    et al., 2019). The MP value in this study is equivalent to what a grower would
    identify as the irrigation event peak during an irrigation event. IP represents
    the major change in the time series slope (Phlips et al., 2021), which is similar
    to the practical method used by growers to identify soil field capacity, or the
    ‘slope of drainage’. CV represents the final value in the time series where there
    is no more downward movement of nutrients. This is the only value that can be
    directly compared to the laboratory analysis as it is static. Following the identification
    of the MPs, the raw time-series data Y=({ y 1 , y 2 , …, y n }) was normalized
    to a range of (0,1) for IP and CV identification. IPs were detected using the
    changepoint algorithm following the description from Killick and Eckley (2014),
    and adapted as follows in Equations 2–4: Let ( y 1:n ) represent the sequence
    of data points from the first ( y 1 ) to the last observation in the time series
    ( y n ). Under the null hypothesis ( H 0 ) , it is assumed that no changepoint
    exists in the time series. Let ( L 0 ) be the maximum log-likelihood under this
    hypothesis, which is defined as: L 0 =logp( y 1:n ∣ ∣ θ ˆ ) (2) Here, p(⋅) represents
    the probability density function associated with the distribution of the data,
    and θ ˆ =[ μ ˆ ,  σ ˆ  ] is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the mean
    and standard deviation that best fit the distribution of Y . Under the alternative
    hypothesis ( H a ) , a changepoint at ( τ 1 ) is assumed to exist. Let L( τ 1
    ) be the maximum log-likelihood under this hypothesis, which is defined as: L(
    τ 1 )=log p( y (1: τ 1 ) ∣ ∣ θ ˆ 1 )+log p( y ( τ 1 +1:n) ∣ ∣ θ ˆ 2 ) (3) The
    likelihood ratio test statistic λ is constructed using L 0 and L( τ 1 ) , and
    is defined as: λ=2[ max τ 1 L( τ 1 )− L 0 ] (4) Therefore, the test is performed
    by selecting a threshold (c) such that the null hypothesis is rejected if λ>c
    . If the null hypothesis is rejected the position τ 1 is estimated and considered
    as the detected changepoint Following the identification of the MP, IP, and CV
    values, the one-way ANOVA followed by the post hoc Tukey test was performed to
    identify differences among the treatments. By utilizing ANOVA, MPs IPs and CVs
    could be compared across application rates, and immediately determine if the MPs
    IPs and CVs changed in a significant matter with the application of N, P, or K.
    Significant changes in MP IP or CV would indicate the SMPs’ sensitivity to the
    presence of the nutrient, while the absence of significance would indicate a lack
    of SMPs’ sensitivity to the presence of the nutrient. The two-way ANOVA followed
    by post hoc Tukey was performed on the laboratory analysis results for the N,
    P, and K using both treatment and SMS depth as variables to understand the individual
    variable impact and their interactions. The remaining of this study will use the
    following nomenclature for clarity in the results. ‘Experiments’ will refer to
    the entire set of measurements taken from either N, P, or K. ‘Applications’ will
    refer to the nutrient rates applied, including the control, low, average, and
    high application rates. ‘Repetition’ refers to how many times the applications
    were repeated. For example: The 1st repetition of the low application in the N
    experiment would refer to the time series obtained from the first time the low
    nitrogen nutrient application was applied to a core. 3 Results and discussion
    3.1 Maximum point 3.1.1 Value of maximum point Among the three tested nutrients,
    only K has significant differences (Table 2). The analysis of MPv differences
    related to K was approached by comparing MPv across different treatments. When
    comparing MPv per depth and application rate, an increase in MPv was observed
    in direct correlation with each application rate except at 15 cm depth, where
    the highest K application yielded a lower MPv than the low and average applications
    (Figure 5). Results from the control treatment showed that the top five SMSs displayed
    similar MPv, ranging from 894-945 VIC units. However, the sixth SMS, situated
    at 55 cm depth, recorded a VIC measurement of 1079 units, which is higher than
    the readings of the top five sensors. This deviation might be attributed to a
    change in sensor sensitivity, due to increased soil water resulting from downward
    water movement within the soil core, In this context, higher water content leads
    to a higher VIC reading. table 2 Table 2 ANOVA maximum point value means for N,
    P, and K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). figure 5 Figure 5 Maximum
    Point Values (MPv) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0,
    1.02, 1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). The mean values displayed
    in Table 2 confirm that each K application rate resulted in a higher MPv than
    the control, as indicated by the Tukey letter groupings. However, while treatments
    were different from the control, they did not differ from each other in the 5-35
    cm depths. There is an increase in MPv in the average and high treatments compared
    to the low treatment at 45 cm, and increases in MPv across all applications at
    55 cm. A steady increase in MPv at those depths is observed as the concentration
    of K increases. Differences in VIC at the lower depths could be attributed to
    soil water influence. Soil water has an influence and positive correlation on
    the electrical conductivity (EC) of soils (Mojid et al., 2007). In a study conducted
    by Brevik et al. (2006), to understand the effect of soil water content changes
    on soil EC, it was shown that the electrical conductivity was greatly influenced
    by soil water. 3.1.2 Time of maximum point occurrence After evaluating the MPt,
    it was evident that, among the three tested nutrients, only K exhibited significant
    differences. When comparing MPt at each depth within individual application rates,
    an increase in MPt was observed in direct correlation with each increasing application
    rate. Figure 6 shows that each application rate at each depth showed an increase
    in MPt compared to the control application. While every application yielded higher
    MPt than the control, the greatest application of K did not always result in the
    greatest MPt reached. In Figure 6, at the 15 cm depth, the highest K application
    yielded a slightly lower MPt than the average application. Table 3 shows that
    the difference between these values are statistically similar. The 5, 25, and
    35 cm depths display a steady increase in MPt consistent with the increase in
    K application applied. figure 6 Figure 6 Maximum Point Time (MPt) averaged from
    each repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0, 1.02, 1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha)
    at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). table 3 Table 3 ANOVA Maximum Point Time (MPt)
    means for N, P, and K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). Table 3 shows
    that, from 15 cm though 45 cm depth, each K application yields a significantly
    higher MPt than the control. However, the increase in MPt at 5 cm depth is only
    significant for the high application rate if compared to the control. Furthermore,
    at 15 cm, the high and average application MPts are higher than the low application,
    showing the sensor ability to differentiate between application rates. In this
    study, the sensor VIC changes are used as an indication of their sensitiveness
    to K presence and movement in the soil. As the VIC sensor readings are potentially
    impacted by soil water, it is possible that the presence of any nutrient increasing
    electrical conductivity has the potential to delay the MPt. This delay of the
    MPt could potentially be a method of K detection in soil media. These results
    are in accordance to the findings of Thompson et al. (2007), where it was shown
    that ,in a sand column experiment, the soil water content increases approximately
    2-5% with 1 dS/m increase in the EC. Peddinti et al. (2020) used KCl to examine
    salinity effect on capacitance based sensor volumetric water content readings
    and observed similar results where the sensor’s sensitiveness to measuring volumetric
    water content is affected by soil solution salinity. Table 4 shows that K generally
    remained in the top 30 cm of the soil core. These laboratory results were in agreement
    with the results obtained for MPt (Table 3), as the two depths with distinction
    between treatments are at 5 and 15 cm sensor depth, below the 30 cm mark. It was
    observed that there was a stronger difference in MPt at the 15 cm sensor than
    the 5 cm sensor, which could be attributed to K settling in that layer. The passage
    of K and the settling of residual K could have provided greater signal delay at
    15 cm than at 5 cm. This phenomenon is observed for all K application rates. After
    25 cm, each treatment’s MPt occurred at or very near the end of the 24 hours’
    period. As there was only one water application for each repetition, this delay
    is likely the combined impact of water and K not reaching the depth until much
    later, as well as the possible overshadowing of the soil water signal over the
    lower application rates of K at those depths. table 4 Table 4 ANOVA results from
    N, P, and K laboratory samples mean at various depths and rates. Comparing the
    K results with those from N, there was not a MPt delay. This response could be
    attributed to the high mobility of N in water causing lesser accumulation of it
    at one depth, which therefore resulted in no impact on the MPt. NH4+ is highly
    soluble in water and do not easily bind with the soil particles moving quickly
    through the core. According to Casey et al. (2002) the mobility and availability
    of N is increased with an increase in soil moisture. The low cation exchange capacity
    (CEC) of the pure sand media used in this study might have enhanced N mobility,
    particularly in the NH4+ form (Matschonat and Vogt, 1996; Bigelow et al., 2001;
    Phillips, 2002). 3.2 Inflection point 3.2.1 Inflection point value Similar to
    MPv and MPt, significant differences in IPv were only present in the K experiment.
    When comparing IPv at each sensor depth within application rates, an increase
    was observed in direct correlation with each application (Figure 7). As is observed
    in Figure 7, each application at depths 5 and 15 yielded a higher IPv than the
    control application, in the general form of an upward trend. However, 5 and 15
    cm were the only depths in the experiment that yielded an IPv across each application
    rate. The 25 and 35 cm depths showed an increase in IPv in the low application,
    but no IPv occurred at the average or high application. The 45 and 55 cm depths
    only yielded an IPv within the control. figure 7 Figure 7 Inflection Point value
    (IPv) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0, 1.02, 1.52,
    and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). While Figure 7 exhibited general
    increasing trends in IPv across all applications at both the 5 and 15 cm depths,
    Table 5 shows that the 5 cm depth was the only depth at which IPv increased at
    a significant rate as K application rate increased. At the 5 cm depth, each application
    rate was different from each other in addition to the control and display the
    ability for IPv to distinguish between application rates of K applied. The absence
    of IPv below the 15 cm depth could be attributed to the nature of the experimental
    design in our study, where a single water/nutrient application was performed per
    repetition. Although results were not significant for N, and P application rates
    and depths, IPv were observed up to the 35 cm depth for N, and across all depths
    for P. Future experiments should consider longer repetitions and more frequent
    watering to identify the sensitivity of sensors below 30 cm depth to nutrient
    availability. table 5 Table 5 ANOVA inflection point value means for N, P, and
    K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). 3.2.2 Time of inflection point occurrence
    When comparing IPt at each depth within individual K application rates, there
    is a direct correlation between the increase in IPt and each application rate
    at depths 5 and 15 cm (Figure 8). At the 5 cm depth, IPt increases directly with
    the increased rate of K applications. At the 15 cm depth, there is an overall
    increase at application rate increases, with a slight decrease at the highest
    application rate. IPts only occur at the lowest application rates for 25 and 35
    cm depths, and only occur within the control application at the 45 and 55 cm depths.
    Table 6 shows that only the SMS at the 5 cm depth shows significant increases
    in IPt across the K application rates. Similarly, each application rate had a
    higher IPt compared to the control and was significantly different from each other.
    This indicates IPt’s potential to detect differences in K concentration within
    the soil at the 5 cm depth after 24 hours post-application. figure 8 Figure 8
    Inflection Point Time (IPts) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl)
    rate (0, 1.02, 1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). table 6 Table
    6 ANOVA inflection point time means for N, P, and K treatments at each sensor
    depth (5-55 cm). 3.3 Convergence value Table 7 shows no significant differences
    in the N and P experiments, while K yielded results indicating its detection through
    CV analysis. When comparing CVs across applications at each depth, there is a
    strong observable increase in CV as the K application rate increases within the
    5 to 35 cm range (Figure 9). Unlike the MP and IP analysis, in each of the instances
    the increased application rate yielded an increased mean value CV down to the
    35 cm depth. At the 45 and 55 cm depths, the CV maintains high both at the control
    and each K application treatment. table 7 Table 7 ANOVA convergence value means
    for N, P, and K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). figure 9 Figure 9 Convergence
    values (CVs) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0, 1.02,
    1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). A direct correlation between
    CVs and application rate of KCl applied is observable. From the surface down to
    35 cm, the statistical comparison of CV between treatments showed that the SMP
    successfully distinguished each treatment from the control (Table 7). CVs did
    not distinguish between treatments however, and were only capable of detecting
    the presence or absence of K. The laboratory results are consistent with the CV
    findings were it was confirmed the presence of K from the soil surface down to
    35 cm. A slight contrast found in the laboratory result was the identification
    that K was present down to the 40-50 cm depths, while difference in CV were not
    found across treatments at that level. Although there were not differences below
    the 35 cm depth, a pooling effect may have occurred due to the movement of water
    to the lower layers of the core. This might have influenced the VIC signals due
    to the presence of K in the solution. 3.4 Soil nutrient laboratory results Table
    4 suggests no significant difference in N rate throughout each sensor depth and
    each treatment, ranging from 0.05 – 0.103% TN. Laboratory analysis confirmed undetectable
    P concentrations for the control and low treatments. In the high treatment, P
    mostly remained in the top 20 cm of the soil core, with a smaller amount descending
    up to the 40 cm depth. K analysis suggests this nutrient was mobile, up to the
    60 cm depth for the average and high treatments. Despite its mobility, mean values
    suggest the highest concentrations of K were mostly found at 20 and 30 cm depth
    for average and high treatments, respectively. The treatment and the SMS depth
    interaction results indicated significance for P (p-value = 1.12E-11), whereas
    the N (p-value = 0.883) and K (p-value = 0.778) displayed no significant interaction
    effects. 4 Discussion 4.1 VIC sensor values as indicators of nutrient presence
    in the soil profile K’s presence in the soil and nutrient location can be determined
    by assessing MP, IP, and CV values from SMS readings. MPv was particularly successful
    at differentiating between the control and each application rate. In the topsoil
    layers, regardless of the application rate applied, MPv showed higher values than
    the control. IP was the most successful at distinguishing between application
    rates. Each application rate at the 5 cm mark had an increasing IPv and IPt as
    application rate increased. CV gave the strongest indication of whether K was
    present in the cores. While this method could not differentiate between application
    rates, CVs clearly increased in the presence of K at each rate. Related studies
    evaluating sensing conductance methods have found that sensor readings can be
    an indirect method to assess major nutrients in the soil (Eigenberg et al., 2002;
    Korsaeth, 2005). MP measurements could be a good indicator for the development
    of real-time precision nutrient management systems. As more studies on conductance-based
    sensor development are produced (Basterrechea et al., 2020; Rocher et al., 2020),
    more information would be available for the development of robust decision-support
    systems related to the potential nature, concentration, or location of K within
    a field, after in-field sensor calibration is completed. Progress in the incorporation
    of in-field sensors for the indirect assessment of nutrients through fertigation
    are underway (Avşar and Mowla, 2022) and under development. This, along with the
    findings from this study, can contribute to a more practical and data-based in-field
    nutrient management. While IP does not provide immediate results and is dependent
    on the CV, IP showed the best ability to distinguish between application rates
    and correlate them to K rates within the soil. MP from in-field SMPs and SMSs
    could be used as a real-time water saving parameter for nutrient management as
    this data is available, but underutilized. An increased or delayed MP during a
    fertigation event, when nutrients are applied through irrigation, would be an
    indicator of potentially increased K within the soil. This could determine how
    far down into the soil the K is moving and provide information to prevent nutrient
    leaching and environmental pollution in freshwater systems (Pathan et al., 2007).
    After such irrigation event occurs, as the soil begins to dry and IP and CV points
    are identified, IP could be used to quantify the concentration of K in the soil
    that may have been or was a risk of leaching, and CV used to finalize the resting
    place of the K after the event. This information would be useful in both identifying
    the movement of K in the soils during an irrigation event, as well as identifying
    the final location of K after the event. Furthermore, the nutrients in this experiment
    were studied separately but understanding the interactions between the nutrients,
    soil types and their combined effect of VIC is dynamic and should be studied to
    provide precise real time information to the end users. The N and P control treatments
    at 55 cm have higher MPv, MPt, IPv, and IPt (Tables 2, 3, 5, 6) than the other
    treatments, potentially indicating an effect of the fertilizer presence on the
    moisture movement or a water cumulation effect. This scenario was not observed
    in K due to its high solubility nature compared to N and P and using pure sand
    as a medium, allowing more rapid nutrient movement (Table 4). The soil medium
    can influence sensor conductivity. Generally, the impacts of soil-water osmotic
    potential alterations are not considered for soil-water movement unless the solutes
    are in substantial amounts (Or and Wraith, 2002). However, in this study, this
    might have influenced the SMS readings. Masrie et al. (2017) developed and tested
    an optical transducer sensor for the detection of N, P, and K in soil, and found
    that soil characteristics in the presence of nutrients influence the frequency
    wavelength for sensor detection. This study suggest that SMSs require voltage
    thresholds that variates based on the nutrient assessed. Laboratory results confirmed
    that P was primarily present in the top 20 cm of the cores, yet despite statistical
    analysis comparing MPv, MPt, IPv, IPt, and CVs no significant differences were
    observed. Our results-keeping in mind this study only tested one form of each
    element in a pure sand soil type-suggest that the SMP primarily detects K ions
    from the fertilizers applied and can be used as part of currently available irrigation
    scheduling decision support systems (DSS). Several methods of combining irrigation
    sensing technology with soil moisture prediction models (Kashyap and Kumar, 2021)
    and DSSs (Rinaldi and He, 2014) are available. Any variation in the MP, IP, or
    CV could indicate potential K presence in the soil. However, this signal variation
    could also originate from other ions in the soil with a sufficiently strong osmotic
    potential. Although the interactions between N, P, and K when combined has yet
    to be explored, such interactions could potentially enhance their VIC signals.
    5 Conclusion This study demonstrated that the SMPs’ VIC readings have the ability
    to detect K within the soil profile and provide an indication of its rate and
    location. The statistical analysis from MP, IP, and CV from 24-hour VIC readings
    has proven to be an effective method for K detection. While our study did not
    yield significant results for N and P, mean value comparison hints at the potential
    for detection, possibly through other indirect methods, or different forms of
    N and P that yield strong VIC in soil. The results from this study can serve as
    a foundation for implementing fertigation management programs, focusing on water
    and K movement in the soil, and indirectly managing N and P by maintaining water
    within the effective root zone depth for crops. Future work should investigate
    temperature differences related to in-field seasonal patterns. Utilizing IP as
    a way of differentiating nutrient concentrations showed great promise at the 10
    cm depth. Overall, integrating nutrient management strategies into existing agricultural
    technologies, such as the SMPs investigated in this study, is crucial to accelerating
    the adoption of precision agriculture technology in practical applications within
    the agricultural industry. Data availability statement The raw data supporting

  description: With the increasing demands on global agriculture, there is an imperative
    need to optimize crop yields and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Real-time
    monitoring and accurate predictions of soil health and crop yields have significant
    implications for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers. While existing soil analysis
    models offer certain predictive capabilities, their efficiency is often hindered
    by issues related to energy consumption, prediction delay, and accuracy levels.
    Contemporary soil models primarily fall short in addressing the multifaceted nature
    of soil attributes and their dynamic interactions. These models also struggle
    to provide real-time insights, frequently leading to delayed interventions, misallocated
    resources, and suboptimal yields. In this paper, we introduce an advanced, low-cost,
    and energy-aware multiparametric IoT-based soil analysis model designed to overcome
    the prevailing limitations. Our system harnesses the synergy of N, P, K, Humidity,
    and Temperature sensors, augmented with temporal datasets to offer a comprehensive
    view of the soil's current state. At the core of our analysis, an ensemble learning
    model combines the strengths of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, and
    1D CNN methods, streamlining accurate yield level predictions. To further refine
    the model's efficiency, a Q Learning approach is integrated, ensuring both energy
    conservation and heightened prediction accuracy. When deployed in various agronomic
    scenarios, the proposed model manifested a marked improvement in prediction metrics.
    Notably, we observed a 10.5% enhancement in precision, 9.4% in accuracy, 8.5%
    in recall, and 4.5% in AUC. Moreover, the model reduced the prediction delay by
    9.5% compared to its counterparts. These advancements underscore the potential
    of our model to revolutionize soil analysis techniques, paving the way for smarter,
    energy-efficient, and productive agricultural practices.

    Humidity sensorGraphene oxideQuick responseHuman body sensing 1. Introduction
    Humidity sensors are widely used in industry, agriculture, medical care, and household
    appliances [1], [2]. Over the years, various types of humidity sensors have been
    developed. To meet the needs of practical applications, these sensors are required
    to have a high sensitivity, wide humidity detection range, and fast response.
    High-speed humidity sensors are essential for some special fields, such as aerospace,
    respiratory monitoring, chemical reactions, precision instruments, which require
    dynamic real-time monitoring of humidity. The development of new sensing principles
    [3] and moisture-sensitive materials [4], [5], [6] have significantly improved
    the sensitivity and the detection range of humidity sensors. However, it remains
    a great challenge to shorten their response time and recovery time. The response
    time and recovery time of the most humidity sensors are difficult to be less than
    1 s at the same time [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. According to different humidity
    sensing signal conversion mechanisms, the humidity sensors can be mainly divided
    into resistance, capacitance, impedance, voltage, quartz crystal microbalance
    (QCM), and surface acoustic wave (SAW). Resistance humidity sensor with direct-current
    (DC) working mode is widely studied because of its simple processing circuit [13],
    [14], [15]. Up to now, many kinds of humidity sensing materials have been reported
    to fabricate humidity sensors, mainly including cellulose paper, carbon materials,
    polymers, two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene, oxides, and their composites.
    Duan et al. [11] selected the natural nanomaterials of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs)
    to prepare impedance-type humidity sensors. The response time was about 0.7 s,
    and the recovery time was about 57 s. The impedance variation of the HNTs humidity
    sensor is five orders of magnitude within the humidity range from 0 % to 91.5
    % RH at the optimum working frequency (100 Hz). Na et al. [12] synthesized Sm2O3
    nanoflowers with hierarchical structure. The unique hierarchical structure could
    provide more active sites, which is beneficial for the adsorption and desorption
    of water molecules. By compounding with KCl, the KCl/Sm2O3 composite demonstrated
    enhanced humidity sensitivity and rapid response on account of that the introduced
    K+ and Cl- could participate in the conduction process. The impedance-type humidity
    sensor based on KCl/Sm2O3 showed extremely high response value of 127,121 with
    a response time of 0.1 s and a recovery time of 21 s at 11 %−95 % RH. Zhao et
    al. [19] designed a hyaluronic acid (HA)-induced crumpling of Nb2CTx nanosheet
    to construct hydrogen bond conduction network, and applied it for fast humidity
    sensing based on primary battery. The Nb2CTx/HA primary battery-based humidity
    sensor (PBHS) exhibied outstanding response and recovery speed (15.1 s and 3.4
    s at 72.0 % RH), high response (0.7 V), and low hysteresis (3.6 % RH). However,
    the response time and recovery time of most humidity sensors are difficult to
    be less than 1 s at the same time [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23],
    [24]. Graphene oxide (GO) is a green, biocompatible, solution-processable, and
    mass producible nanomaterial [25]. GO contains abundant oxygen-containing functional
    groups, which are highly hydrophilic [26] and can efficiently capture water molecules.
    In addition, interactions between the oxygen-containing functional groups and
    water molecules will rapidly change the conductivity of GO [27]. Therefore, the
    GO is an excellent candidate for humidity sensitive materials. Wu [28] et al.
    developed a GO -based humidity sensor by dropping GO aqueous solution on micro
    interfinger electrode, which displays ultrahigh sensitivity (124/% RH), fast response
    time (3 s) and wide detection range (8–95 % RH) at room temperature. Ghosh [29]
    et al. prepared a fast-response humidity sensor by drop-casting GO on patterned
    gold electrodes, with the response time of 5 s and the recovery time of 6 s. Due
    to the large proton conduction of GO, the sensor response varied from ∼180 times
    (40 % RH) to ∼1200 times (88 % RH). Liu et al. [10] demonstrated a simple and
    cost-effective approach using laser induced graphene (LIG) on a polyimide film
    to prepare highly sensitive and fast-response flexible humidity sensors. The LIG
    humidity sensor exhibits a 28,231-fold increase in current when the relative humidity
    changes from 26.1 to 90.2 %,and it also shows ultrashort response/recovery times
    (0.5/7 s). Most of the GO-based humidity sensors show excellent sensing performance,
    and thedifference in device structure and GO material specifications arethe key
    factor affecting sensing performance. In this paper, GO is used as the humidity-sensitive
    material. The GO material and the device configuration have been synergisticallytailored
    toachieve fast response and recovery. Both the response and recovery time of the
    prepared sensor is less than 1 s in the 10 %–95 % RH range. In terms of moisture-sensitive
    material, highly oxidized, monolayer and large-size GO sheets were used as the
    moisture-sensitive material. The oxygen-containing groups increase with degree
    of oxidation of graphene. The increased oxygen-containing groups will provide
    more adsorption sites for water molecules. Compared with bilayer GO and multilayer
    GO, single-layer GO have the largest specific surface area, which is conducive
    to increasing the sensitivity per unit volume. The average size of the GO sheet
    is more than 40 μm, which is more than twice the electrode spacing (20 μm) of
    the sensor. This means that a single GO sheet is sufficient to connect two electrodes,
    which is beneficial to improve the carrier transport efficiency. In terms of device
    configuration, an ultra-thin GO film with a thickness of 300 nm was optimized
    by controlling the concentration and the volume of the drop-casting GO dispersion.
    Meanwhile, the electrode spacing of the sensor is designed to be only 20 μm. As
    a result, the volume of the effective moisture-sensitive film between the two
    electrodes is as small as 15.3 × 10-3 mm3. The smaller moisture-sensitive region
    can quickly reach the saturated adsorption of water molecules, which is the key
    to achieve fast response of the sensor. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of the
    sensor enabled it to effectively detect humidity changes caused by human breath
    and the proximity of human fingers. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Preparation of
    single-layer GO aqueous dispersions A single-layer GO slurry was purchased from
    Hangzhou Gaoxi Technology (China) at a concentration of 10 mg/g in water. The
    proportion of single-layer GO was greater than 99 %, and the average size of single-layer
    GO sheets was 40 µm. The GO slurry was ultrasonically dispersed in deionized water
    to obtain single-layer GO aqueous dispersion, the concentrations of which were
    adjusted by changing the volume ratio of the slurry and deionized water. Single-layer
    aqueous GO dispersions with concentrations of 0.8 mg/mL, 1.2 mg/mL, and 2.4 mg/mL
    were respectively prepared for subsequent drop-casting. 2.2. Device preparation
    Parallel gold electrodes approximately 100 nm thick and separated by a 20 μm channel
    were deposited on a quartz substrate using vacuum thermal evaporation with shadow
    masks. Single-layer GO dispersions with different concentrations were coated on
    electrodes by drop-casting. After 12 h of natural drying, conductive silver adhesive
    was used to connect a copper wire to each electrode. A schematic diagram of the
    device structure is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (55KB)

    humidity sensor. 2.3. Characterization of GO thin films The elemental composition
    and the oxygen-containing groups of the GO thin film were identified using an
    X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Britain) with monochromatic Al
    Kα X-ray radiation as the source type. Defects in the GO structure was characterized
    using a laser confocal Raman microscope (inVia Qontor, Renishaw, United Kingdom)
    with a laser wavelength of 532 nm and a laser power of 0.02 mW. The thickness
    and morphology of the thin films were examined using an atomic force microscope
    (MultiMode 8, Bruker, USA) and optical microscope (BX53M, Olympus, Japan), respectively.
    2.4. Humidity-sensing performance test system The humidity response tests were
    carried out at room temperature of 22C in a humidity range from 10 % RH to 95
    % RH. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the measurement system. The injection
    pump controlled the volume and speed of water feeding to the humidity generator.
    The humidity generator is equipped with a heater for the production of water vapor.
    In the humidity generator, the water vapor is fully mixed with nitrogen gas from
    a compressed nitrogen cylinder. By adjusting the injection pump rate and the compressed
    nitrogen flow, the humidity generator was able to output a stable gas with required
    humidity. The humidity value of the gas was calibrated using a commercial humidity
    sensor (AR847+, SMART SENSOR, China). The sensor was placed in an airtight test
    chamber, and was connected to a Keithley 2410 source meter (Tektronix, OR, USA)
    by copper wires to measure the resistance of the sensor as a function of humidity.
    A constant bias voltage of −1 V was applied to the sensor throughout the measurement
    process. The data was recorded using KickStart instrument control software (Tektronix,
    OR, USA). Download : Download high-res image (118KB) Download : Download full-size

    thin films Fig. 3(a) is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the GO sheets

    the white rectangular area in panel (b). 3.2. Raman spectra of the GO thin film
    Raman spectroscopy can be used to characterize graphene defects, which generally
    include marginal defects, sp3 defects, and vacancy defects [30], [31]. Raman spectra
    of the GO film (Fig. S2) exhibited prominent characteristic peaks at 1354 and
    1607 cm−1 corresponding to the D and G bands, respectively. The generation of
    D band involves the scattering information of incident photons by defects.Therefore,the
    D band intensity (ID) reflects the amount of disorder in the graphene. The G band
    is generated by the stretching motion of sp2 atom pairs in the carbon ring. The
    G band intensity (IG) is related to the highly ordered carbon network of the graphite
    plane [32]. The intensity ratio of ID/IG is a directly related to the number of
    graphene defects [33]. The ID/IG value of 1.014 indicates that the graphene contained
    a considerable number of lattice defects and was highly disordered [34]. Since
    the defects and the disorder mainly come from the oxidation reaction of graphene,
    the large ratio of ID to IG indirectly indicates the high degree of oxidation
    of graphene. 3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of GO thin films X-ray photoelectron
    spectra of the GO thin films is shown in Fig. 4. The main elements in the GO thin
    film are carbon and oxygen, containing 66.69 % at.% C1s and 28.12 at.% O1s,with
    a carbon-to-oxygen atom ratio of 2.37. This indicated that the GO had a high oxygen
    content. These oxygen elements all come from oxygen-containing groups produced
    by oxidation reaction of the graphene, further confirming the high degree of oxidation
    of graphene. Peak-fitting analysis enabled the determination of the types of oxygen-containing
    groups, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). The C1s spectrum of GO identified four
    functional groups: CH/CC (≈284.76 eV), OCO (≈286.72 eV), CO (≈288.02 eV), and
    OCO (≈288.94 eV). The O1s spectrum identified three functional groups: C–OH (≈530.9
    eV), OCOH (≈532.1 eV), and OCO (≈533.2 eV). Download : Download high-res image

    fit of O1s region. 3.4. Humidity sensing results 3.4.1. Calculation of key performance
    parameters The response and the response speed are important parameters to evaluate
    the performance of a humidity sensor. The response of the humidity sensor is defined
    as the ratio of the electrical value of the sensor at a specific RH to the reference
    RH [35]: (1) where R0 and RRH denote the sensor resistances at dry air (6 % RH)
    and other specific RH, respectively. The evaluation of the response speed includes
    two parameters: response time and recovery time. Defining ΔR as the change of
    the sensor resistance between a dry environment and a certain relative humidity
    environment, the response time and the recovery time are the time consumption
    between resistance of 0.1ΔR and 0.9ΔR measured at the rising and falling edges
    of the sensor response, respectively. 3.4.2. Effect of GO dispersion concentration
    on humidity-sensing performance To study the influence of the GO dispersion concentration
    on sensor performance, aqueous dispersions of single-layer GO with concentrations
    of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.4 mg/mL were prepared. An identical volume (8 µL) of each dispersion
    was dropped on the channel between two separated parallel electrodes. GO thin
    films were formed after 12 h of natural drying. The humidity-sensing performance
    was tested at 50 % RH, as shown in Fig. 5. For the sensor based on a 0.8 mg/mL
    GO dispersion, the response and recovery times were 0.32 s and 0.49 s, respectively,
    and the response was 110.1 %. Higher GO dispersion concentrations resulted in
    a higher response but longer sensor response time. For the sensor fabricated using
    1.2 mg/mL GO dispersion, the response and recovery time were 0.49 s and 0.65 s,
    respectively, and the response was 120.06 %. For the sensor fabricated using 2.4
    mg/mL dispersion, the response and recovery times were extended to 0.81 s and
    1.14 s, respectively, and the response increased to 124.44 %. A greater number
    of oxygen-containing groups in the GO thin film provides more adsorption sites
    for water molecules, so it takes longer to saturate the adsorption sites. However,
    adsorption of more water molecules increases the magnitude of ΔR, thus improving
    the sensor response. Fig. 5 shows that the sensor based on 1.2 mg/mL GO dispersion
    resulted in both a large response and fast speed. In view of the excellent humidity-sensing
    performance, the subsequent experiments were based on 1.2 mg/mL GO dispersion
    to prepare the sensor. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download : Download

    2.4 mg/mL, respectively. 3.4.3. Humidity sensing performance Fig. 6(a) shows the
    time-resolved dynamic response of the sensor based on GO dispersion of 1.2 mg/mL
    at 10 %–95 % RH. The resistance of the sensor increases with the increase of humidity.
    The performance of the sensors under different humidity conditions is summarized
    as shown in Fig. 6(b). Both the response and recovery time of the sensor is less
    than 1 s in the 10 %–95 % RH range. At 10 % RH, the sensor achieved the fastest
    response time of 0.33 s. The response value increases monotonously with the increase
    of RH. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6(c), the humidity sensor follows a polynomial
    fitting response in the full humidity range (10–95 % RH). To assess the long-term
    stability of the sensor, the resistance of the sensor at 50 % RH was tracked every
    15 days for two months. As shown in Fig. 6(d), there was no obvious change in
    resistance, indicating that the performance of the sensor is stable. Download

    response and recovery time of this sensor is a significant improvement over those
    of previously reported humidity sensors [36], achieving the fastest response among

    other gases in air on humidity sensing, we carried out humidity response experiments
    with high-purity nitrogen gas and synthetic air as carrier gas respectively. The
    humidity sensor showed similar response to humidity in synthetic air compared
    with high-purity nitrogen gas as carrier gas, and the results are shown in Fig.
    S3. 3.4.4. Humidity response mechanism The voltage-current (I-V) characteristics
    of the sensor, measured in voltage sweep mode, at different humidity levels are
    shown in Fig. 7. The characteristic curves show that the I-V characteristics were
    nonlinear regardless of the ambient humidity, indicating that the contact between
    the GO film and the gold electrode was not ohmic. This is because that GO possesses
    P-type conductive behavior due to the presence of C-O bonding. Oxygen plays a
    role in p-type doping of GO, because oxygen atoms tend to pull and hold electrons,
    leading to the formation of holes in the graphitic network [45], [46]. Thus, a
    Schottky contact is formed between the GO film and the gold electrode. Furthermore,
    the I–V characteristics showed that the sensor current decreased as the humidity
    increased, that is, the resistance of the sensor increases with the increase of
    humidity. The microscopic mechanism is as follows: The GO film has a large number
    of hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups, which can easily trap water molecules,
    and then these water molecules act as donors of electrons [47] to recombine with
    holes in the P-type GO film, resulting in a decrease of holes the concentration
    in the GO film. This ultimately manifested as an increase in the resistance of
    the sensor. Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download : Download full-size

    levels. 3.4.5. Humidity monitoring related to human activities Many human activities
    are accompanied by humidity changes. A rapid-response humidity sensor can monitor
    these changes and thus be used for dynamic monitoring of health. Fig. 8 presents
    the response of the sensor to humidity changes caused by human breath and finger
    proximity. As shown in Fig. 8(a), due to the evaporation of sweat the proximity
    offinger will cause slight increase of the ambient humidity near the sensor, leading
    to an increase in the sensor resistance. When the finger was subsequently moved
    away, the ambient humidity near the sensor decreased to the initial value, resulting
    in a decrease in the sensor resistance to its initial value. More strikingly,
    the sensor was sensitive enough to measure the distance between the finger and
    the sensor, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Changing the distance between the finger and
    the sensor yielded commensurate changes in the sensor resistance, that is, the
    smaller distances resulteed in the larger resistance changes. Therefore, this
    sensor could be used in intelligent human sensing systems. Fig. 8(c) shows the
    dynamic response of the sensor to changes in humidity caused by rapid breathing
    of the human body. The rate of fast breathing is about 36 times per minute. The
    response performance of the humidity sensor can satisfy the monitoring of human
    breathing state. Exhalation caused an increase in ambient humidity, resulting
    in an increase in sensor resistance. Conversely, inhalation decreased the ambient
    humidity, leading to a decrease in sensor resistance. Furthermore, the sensor
    could monitor and recognize the depth of breathing. As shown in Fig. 8(d), small
    resistance changes can be tracked in response to shallow breathing and vice versa.
    This sensor could therefore be used to monitor respiratory abnormalities. The
    above results show that our GO-based humidity sensor yields both fast response
    and high response and shows great application potential in respiration monitoring
    and non-contact human sensing. Download : Download high-res image (475KB) Download

    breathing. (d) Sensing of the depth of breathing. 4. Conclusions We fabricated
    a resistive humidity sensor based on ultra-thin GO films formed by drop-casting
    single-layer GO dispersion. The concentration of the GO dispersion had a large
    effect on the humidity-sensing performance. The higher dispersion concentrations
    will result in longer response and recovery time but higher response. The sensor
    based on GO dispersion of 1.2 mg/mL exhibited both fast response and high response
    in the 10 %−95 % RH range. To our knowledge, the response and recovery time of
    this sensor (<1 s) are the shortest compared to those of reported GO-based resistive
    humidity sensors. Moreover, the sensor was sensitive enough to accurately measureits
    distance from a human finger and the depth of human breathing. We believe that
    this work provides a new approach for the development of humidity sensors with
    rapid response and high response. CRediT authorship contribution statement Junyi

    a salient global issue with 828 million people worldwide experiencing hunger (1,
    2). Advanced high-throughput phenotyping techniques have revolutionized breeding
    efforts by swiftly collecting comprehensive phenotypic data from plant populations
    (3, 4). It allows for more effective and informed plant breeding decisions, thereby
    facilitating the rapid development of improved plant varieties (5–7). Existing
    methods for capturing phenotypic traits predominantly rely on imaging technologies
    (8), robotics (9), and drones (10). However, these approaches have substantial
    limitations in terms of providing customized, continuous, and high spatiotemporal
    resolution monitoring (11). In addition, the currently used devices that are mounted
    on plants are often rigid, heavy, and opaque, exhibiting mechanical and optical
    mismatch with plants (12–14). This discordance can lead to inaccuracies in measurement
    and potential harm to plants. Therefore, nondestructive, continuous, and long-term
    acquisition of phenotypic data are urgently needed for monitoring multiple traits
    for crop breeding. The recent efforts toward plant sensor development have aimed
    to meet this need and to address the mechanical mismatch issues. Advances in human
    wearable electronics (15–23) have prompted botanical applications (24, 25), enabling
    the monitoring of plant conditions through the capture of physical signals like
    growth, surface temperature, and humidity (26–30), chemical signals like volatile
    organic compounds and hormones (31, 32), as well as biopotential signals (33–35).
    The mechanical adhesion is achieved progressively, from using an adhesive tape
    on leaves (36), conformal wrapping of flexible sensors around stems (37), direct
    inkjet writing/printing (38, 39), and vapor polymer printing (40, 41) on leaves,
    to the recent employment of epidermal electronics that can be seamlessly and directly
    attached to leaves (42, 43). Despite these advancements, the existing plant epidermal
    electronics still present limitations in effective monitoring of dynamic plant
    growth over time due to limited stretchability and softness. Furthermore, an aspect
    that has often been overlooked is the consideration of optical transparency, which
    is a critical factor for developing sensors for plants with photosynthetic activities.
    Organic materials that can be made flexible and transparent are promising candidates
    for developing plant sensors. Meanwhile, organic materials also stand out for
    their low-cost, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, which are essential for
    not only plants but also sustainable world. The commercially available poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
    polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is one intrinsically flexible and transparent
    organic material, thus can serve the flexibility and optical transparency purpose
    with their good electrical conductance. However, it has been challenging to develop
    all-organic epidermal sensors due to the difficulties in micropatterning the flexible,
    conductive organic material on another thin soft polymer substrate (44–47). Here,
    we report an all-organic plant epidermal sensor, namely, plant e-skin, that is
    both mechanically and optically invisible for non-invasive plant physiology monitoring.
    The plant e-skin is realized by developing a scalable microfabrication process
    to enable the micropatterning of transparent PEDOT:PSS on a stretchable, transparent
    polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate (Fig. 1A). The successful development of
    this process marks a minimum feature size of 2-μm PEDOT:PSS pattern on a stretchable
    elastomer, paving the way for the development of high-density transparent epidermal
    sensors, displays, and other functional devices. With the transparent, ultrathin,
    and stretchable nature, the plant e-skin can be configured into strain and temperature
    sensors with tailored micropatterns, allowing continuous and real-time monitoring
    of plant growth and surface temperature when attached to leaf epidermis. Experimental
    tests of the strain sensors attached on the juvenile leaves of live Brassica rapa
    revealed distinct diurnal growth patterns with minimal growth during the day and
    predominant growth at night, as well as varying growth rates under different abiotic
    stress conditions. Application of the temperature sensor also captured surface
    temperature dynamics of the corresponding conditions, which would facilitate the
    timely intervention of heat stress. Toward broader practical impact, a virtual
    digital-twin plant is developed, allowing real-time visualization and analysis
    of leaf surface temperature (Fig. 1B). We envision that construction of the virtual
    digital-twin plant interface, aided by the plant e-skin, paves the way for efficient
    monitoring of plants and expedited decision-making in crop breeding as well as
    precision farming. Fig. 1. Fabrication and characteristics of the plant e-skin.

    of the plant e-skin To monitor plant physiological status in a noninvasive manner,
    biocompatibility, transparency, stretchability, and conformability are desired
    simultaneously. A scalable microfabrication process is developed to manufacture
    all-organic plant e-skins that meets all these requirements based on simple lithography
    and lift-off process (Fig. 1A). Detailed fabrication process can be found in fig.
    S1 and Materials and Methods. Table S1 is provided to illustrate the scalability
    of PEDOT:PSS-based transparent e-skin in previous literatures. The all-organic
    plant e-skin is essentially a micropatterned PEDOT:PSS conductive component on
    one PDMS layer and encapsulated by another layer of PDMS. PEDOT:PSS was chosen
    as the conductive component because of its exceptional transparency and conductivity.
    Its biocompatibility further extends its applications to biomedical engineering
    field. Specifically in relation to plants, the transparency and biocompatibility
    of PEDOT:PSS align well with the requirements of developing plant e-skins that
    can be attached to the plants without any observable adverse effects to plant
    health. While achieving a well-defined pattern of PEDOT:PSS on the stretchable
    elastomeric substrate poses a considerable technological challenge, we have succeeded
    to demonstrate the ability to create PEDOT:PSS patterns on PDMS substrate with
    the feature sizes ranging from 100 μm all the way down to 2 μm, as illustrated
    in Fig. 1C. Besides, the versatility of the proposed fabrication process is demonstrated
    by creating intricate patterns of PEDOT:PSS, such as the university logo with
    a lion (Fig. 1D) and alphabets (Fig. 1E), despite their complicated structures
    and varying resolutions. Figure 1F demonstrates the remarkable transparency of
    the as-fabricated e-skin, exhibiting transmittance exceeding 85% within the wavelength
    range of 400 to 700 nm, which aligns perfectly with that required for plant photosynthesis.
    The inserted image exemplifies the plant e-skin’s outstanding transparency, allowing
    for a clear view of the outside scene when affixed to a clean glass. The plant
    e-skin has a thickness of only 4.5 μm (fig. S5), consisting of a layer of PEDOT:PSS
    sandwiched between the PDMS substrate and encapsulation layer where the thickness
    of PEDOT:PSS thin film is 120 nm (fig. S6A). The dependence of transparency and
    conductivity on different PEDOT:PSS thickness are presented in fig. S6 (B and
    C, respectively). Owing to the high transparency together with the ultrathin thickness,
    our plant e-skin offers a superior advantage by enabling seamless attachment to
    a wide range of plant leaves. As shown in fig. S7, we successfully attached the
    plant e-skin to a B. rapa leaf. The midrib and vein of this leaf remain clearly
    visible through the attached sensor, affirming its excellent transparency and
    conformability. Moreover, the plant e-skin can be applied to different kinds of
    leaves with varying surface roughness, including (i) sweet potato, (ii) Zamioculcas
    zamiifolia, (iii) Peperomia argyreia, and (iv) Coleus scutellarioides (Fig. 1G).
    The plant e-skins demonstrate durability, where secure attachment is maintained
    even when the leaves undergo wilting (Fig. 1H and fig. S8). The shear adhesion
    forces between our e-skin and leaves are characterized in fig. S9, which all exceed
    0.2 N with varying leaves, or under various scenarios including wilting, fast
    water flow, and immersion in water. A detailed discussion on adhesion force is
    provided in the Supplementary Materials. Therefore, our all-organic plant e-skin
    has superior characteristics in transparency, stretchability, biocompatibility,
    and conformability. Furthermore, micropatterning PEDOT:PSS on the PDMS provides
    great insights to the plant e-skin for applications with denser integrations.
    Figure 1I compares our plant e-skin with the state-of-the-art plant electronics,
    showing that our plant e-skin is the first of its kind to fulfill all the necessary
    requirements for effective and noninvasive monitoring of plants. Figure 2 shows
    the morphology and performance characterization of our plant e-skin patterned
    into strain sensor and temperature sensor. Regarding the strain sensor, we mixed
    the base sensing material PEDOT:PSS with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 5% d-sorbitol
    as they are the commonly used additives to improve conductivity and stretchability
    of PEDOT:PSS. As shown in fig. S10, the sheet resistance is improved by two orders
    of magnitude after the addition of DMSO and d-sorbitol. The additive-processed
    PEDOT:PSS is defined as p-PEDOT:PSS. The p-PEDOT:PSS film is then sandwiched by
    a top and bottom PDMS thin film to further enhance its stretchability and stability.
    Figure 2A exhibits the schematic drawing of the strain sensor. The sensing part
    is formed by a zig-zag structure where four narrow PEDOT:PSS line resistors are
    connected in series. It is designed according to the common design guideline of
    strain gauges (48–51). Three images in Fig. 2B display the zoomed-in structure
    of the strain sensor, showing the accurate definition of PEDOT:PSS pattern. A
    typical relative resistance change-strain response of the strain sensor is shown
    in Fig. 2C. We have characterized the performance of the strain sensor from initial
    length to a strain of 100%. The resistance change is calculated as ∆ R / R 0 =
    ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 (1) where R0 is the initial resistance of the strain sensor
    and R is the real-time resistance under strain. It is observed that the values
    of resistance change increased with increasing strain level. Sensitivity of the
    strain sensor can be defined as ε Gauge factor ( GF ) = ∆ R / ( R 0 · ε ) (2)
    where ε is the applied strain. When the strain is lower than 60%, GF = 1.15 and
    it reaches 4.13 when the applied strain is higher than 60%. The observed increase
    in resistance under tensile strain is predominantly attributed to geometric alterations
    at small strain levels and the development of cracks in the PEDOT:PSS film at
    higher strain levels (52–54). A comprehensive elucidation of the strain sensing
    mechanism, accompanied by scanning electron microscopy images showcasing the phenomenon
    of crack propagation, is presented in text S1, along with fig. S2. When the e-skin
    strain sensor was held at specific strains for a period of time, the relative
    resistance changes remained stable without distinct drifts, affirming the stability
    of the sensing signals (Fig. 2D). To further verify the long-term stability of
    the e-skin strain sensor, we recorded its resistance for approximately 6 days
    as shown in Fig. 2E. The results demonstrate minimal fluctuations in resistance
    throughout the entire duration, confirming its effectiveness for prolonged monitoring
    of plant leaves. Fig. 2. Electrical performance of the plant e-skin functioning

    resistance change and temperature response of the temperature sensor. In addition
    to functioning as a strain sensor, our plant e-skin offers the convenience of
    easily transforming into a temperature sensor by modifying the device morphology
    and leveraging the thermoresistive effect in PEDOT:PSS. Prior investigations have
    affirmed that the conductivity characteristics of PEDOT:PSS thin films align with
    the variable range hopping model, demonstrating a discernible decrease in resistivity
    as temperature increases (55–57). A comprehensive elucidation of its temperature-dependent
    conductivity is provided in text S2. This e-skin temperature sensor is developed
    based on the pure PEDOT:PSS as the sensing layer and PDMS as the substrate and
    encapsulation layers as well. As shown in Fig. 2 (F and G), the sensing part of
    the temperature sensor is patterned into a meander shape to minimize the fluctuations
    caused by strain (15, 58). The performance of our temperature sensor is characterized
    by measuring the relative resistance change across a temperature range of 24°
    to 39°C. A negative linear relationship between relative resistance change and
    temperature is observed (Fig. 2H). This is attributed to the enhanced charge transport
    within the PEDOT:PSS percolation network at higher temperature, and the insulting
    PSS chains being more extended and aligned to facilitate stronger intermolecular
    interactions between conductive PEDOT particles. Temperature coefficient of resistance
    (TCR) is used to quantify the performance of our temperature sensor, which is
    defined as TCR = ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 ( T − T 0 ) (3) where R is the resistance under
    temperature T, and R0 is the resistance under temperature T0. As revealed from
    the slope in Fig. 2H, the TCR of our temperature sensor is approximately 0.5%/°C.
    On-leaf biocompatibility test and monitoring Biocompatibility is a critical prerequisite
    for plant sensors, particularly those designed to establish intimate contact with
    biological tissues. To assess the application potential of our plant e-skin for
    nondisruptive plant monitoring, we conducted extended on-plant monitoring tests.
    First, we examined their biocompatibility by attaching them to the leaves of Epipremnum
    aureum as shown in Fig. 3A. Throughout the 65-day experiment, no signs of leaf
    yellowing or withering were observed. Notably, not only did the three original
    small roots exhibit elongation but also new roots and leaves emerged (indicated
    by the yellow arrows). In addition, we conducted similar investigation in two
    other pots, each initially containing one or two leaves, as photographed in fig.
    S11. Both pots exhibited the development of new roots and leaves during the monitoring
    period. The observed growth of plants in all the pots strongly suggests that the
    plant e-skin used in the experiment displayed biocompatibility, with no adverse
    effects on plant rooting, sprouting, or overall growth. Photosynthesis is crucial
    for plants as it is the process through which they convert sunlight, water, and
    carbon dioxide into energy-rich sugars, providing the foundation for their growth,
    metabolism, and overall physiological functions. Despite the extensive efforts
    devoted to plant sensors with various functions, the potential long-term effects
    of on-leaf attachments on photosynthesis have received limited attention. Carbon-based
    flexible materials, though commonly used in flexible electronics and wearable
    sensors, may not be ideal candidates for plant sensors because of their inadequate
    optical transmittance in the visible light range. To demonstrate the necessity
    of visible optical transmittance for nondisruptive on-leaf monitoring, we attached
    the plant e-skin and a carbon-based black film on one leaf of B. rapa (oilseed
    sarson) for 14 days. After removing the two films, the region covered by the plant
    e-skin showed no obvious change, while the one underneath the black film exhibited
    discoloration, indicating the reduction of chlorophyll content in the applied
    area (fig. S12). This suggests that device blocking light transmission can significantly
    affect the biological composition of the monitored leaves, potentially causing
    damage to the overall plant health over extended monitoring periods. On top of
    light absorption, carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen release are also important
    aspects in photosynthesis. Stomata, which are the pores for gas exchange, are
    primarily distributed on the abaxial (bottom) side of leaves in dicotyledonous
    plant species (59). Optical images of stomatal distribution on both adaxial (top)
    and abaxial (bottom) surfaces of different kinds of leaves verify this phenomenon
    in fig. S13. Because our e-skin is attached on the top side of the leaves with
    few stomata, it would not impede normal gas exchange in photosynthesis. Meanwhile,
    both PEDOT:PSS film and PDMS are reported to be gas and vapor permeable (60–66).
    Thus, our e-skin shows negligible impact during photosynthesis. Besides, we also
    attached the plant e-skin and two adhesive tapes on the B. rapa leaf. The adhesive
    tapes are often used in many plant sensors to help adhesion on the leaves. We
    observed that the plant e-skin could be removed successfully without destroying
    the leaf. In contrast, the removal of the two adhesive tapes resulted in the detrimental
    rupture of the leaves (fig. S14). Thus, our plant e-skin exhibits mechanical invisibility
    to plants with noninvasive monitoring capability both during and after tests.
    Considering the need for frequent watering in plants, we conducted additional
    investigations to assess the waterproof capability of the plant e-skin, as shown
    in fig. S15 and movie S1. The results demonstrate that the plant e-skin maintains
    strong adhesion to the leaf surface even when substantial amount of water was
    poured over it. Fig. 3. On-leaf biocompatibility test and monitoring. (A) Biocompatibility
    test of the plant e-skin with plants. (B) Photograph of the plant e-skin as strain
    sensor attached on the B. rapa leaf. (C) Performance of the strain sensor to monitor
    the growth pattern of B. rapa leaf during a 3-day period. (D) Photograph of the
    plant e-skin as temperature sensor attached on the B. rapa leaf. (E) Performance
    of the temperature sensor to monitor the surface temperature of the B. rapa leaf
    during a 3-day period (first day: light on; the following 2 days: light on/off,
    16 hours/8 hours). After confirming the biocompatibility and operation in a noninvasive
    manner, the strain sensor and temperature sensor were applied to monitor the growth
    and temperature of the leaves. Monitoring the growth of leaves, especially in
    leafy vegetables like Brassica, poses distinct challenges compared to tracking
    the expansion of fruits or detecting elongation in larger crop stems. The fragility
    and small size of leaves make it difficult to monitor their growth. Although nondestructive
    imaging has been widely used, tracking the growth of a single leaf typically requires
    mechanical fixation to keep it within the camera’s focal plane. However, this
    fixation method unavoidably restricts the plant’s regular physiological processes,
    potentially affecting its overall development. Our plant e-skin strain sensor
    that is specifically designed to cater to the unique demands of monitoring the
    growth of delicate and petite leaves should be able to record the elongation of
    the leaves while ensuring minimal disruption to the plant natural processes. As
    photographed in Fig. 3B, the strain sensor was uniformly attached to the juvenile
    leaf of a B. rapa to monitor its growth. The experimental growth chamber was maintained
    at a photoperiod of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. Figure 3C depicts
    the recorded relative resistance change of the strain sensor during a 3-day period,
    where the increase of the relative resistance change reveals the extension of
    the monitored leaves, i.e., growth. Leaf growth exhibited noncontinuous patterns,
    aligning with known growth behaviors where plants use stored energy to grow and
    elongate during nighttime while absorbing light for photosynthesis during the
    day (67–69). The growth condition of the leaf was estimated by quantifying the
    total relative resistance change. It indicated that the region of the leaf covered
    by the plant e-skin grew to 1.5 times its original length over the course of 3
    days. Notably, because the stretching of strain sensor will exert a reactive force
    on the plant, we further investigated the influence of this force on plant growth
    and it turns out that such force does not hinder overall plant growth (fig. S16).
    The successful monitoring of this growth pattern of the leaf again reflects the
    secure attachment of the e-skin sensor to the leaf and the reliable performance
    of the strain sensor. Simultaneously, the e-skin temperature sensor was also attached
    to the leaf surface to monitor its temperature, as displayed in Fig. 3D. The B.
    rapa was cultivated within a temperature-controlled growth chamber, which was
    maintained at a constant temperature of 26°C. On the first day, the light was
    continuously switched on, while during the following 2 days, the light was set
    in a photoperiod regimen consisting of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness.
    The measured temperature data, as depicted in Fig. 3E, show that the temperature
    remained at stable 26°C when the light was constantly on. However, the temperature
    dropped significantly to a lower temperature of 19°C when light was switched off.
    Despite the chamber being regulated to a constant temperature, there were temperature
    variations on the surface of the plants. This phenomenon can be attributed to
    the heat emitted by the light when it is turned on, while no heat emission occurs
    during darkness. The temperature recording capability of the sensor, attached
    to the leaf surface, is thus confirmed. The distinctive role that this epidermal
    temperature sensor can fulfill is not achievable by commercially available temperature
    sensors, which lack the capability to monitor surface temperatures at a local
    scale. Consequently, this temperature sensor holds immense potential for acquiring
    the temperature on the leaf surface, thereby mitigating heat stress in leaves
    caused by excessive exposure to heat. It should be highly beneficial for precise
    cultivation of crops with high economic values. Growth and surface temperature
    monitoring of B. rapa under abiotic stress To demonstrate the practicality of
    our plant e-skin across distinct growing environment, we deployed the e-skin strain
    and temperature sensors on vegetative leaves of B. rapa, under both optimal environmental
    condition and abiotic stress condition, and monitored their respective growth
    metrics. Our investigation was centered on observing the growth patterns of plants
    in the presence of specific abiotic stressors, like combined heat and drought,
    which simulate real-world plant stressors typically encountered in farming environments.
    As schematically delineated in Fig. 4 (A and B), the ideal growth conditions for
    B. rapa were ensured by providing suitable temperature (26°C light/23°C dark)
    and sufficient water, whereas a separate group of plants was subjected to combined
    heat and drought stress by disrupting water supply and raising temperatures to
    8°C above control conditions (34°C light/31°C dark). Figure 4C illustrates the
    diurnal variation in surface temperature of leaves in the control group, which
    fluctuated between 26° and 22°C. In contrast, the leaf surface temperature for
    the group under abiotic stress, as illustrated in Fig. 4D, was recorded with fluctuations
    in higher temperatures of approximately 34°C during the day and 30°C at night.
    These observed temperature patterns align well with the preset parameters for
    both scenarios, thereby affirming temperature sensing capabilities of the newly
    developed epidermal sensors. Notably, the small variations between epidermal sensors
    and chamber’s temperature setting could be attributed to the uniformity of the
    temperature in the chambers. Strain sensors were attached to three juvenile leaves
    in both the control group (labeled as A, B, and C) and the abiotic stress group
    (labeled as a, b, and c). Figure 4E presents the growth patterns of the leaves
    in the control group, demonstrating that all three leaves exhibited discernible
    growth, as indicated by the increasing relative resistance changes. This growth
    was more pronounced during the night, followed by a plateau phase during the day,
    sharing a similar growth rhythm as mentioned before. However, the results depicted
    in Fig. 4F indicate that the group subjected to abiotic stress did not exhibit
    any significant change in resistance, implying a disruption in growth. Figure
    4 (G and H) illustrates the calculated relative resistance change of the applied
    strain sensors in the control group and the abiotic stress group, respectively.
    In the control group, the relative resistance change corresponds to approximately
    30, 35, and 55% growth strain for the three leaves, while the abiotic stress group
    recorded mere 5.5% strain across all three leaves. It is anticipated that the
    growth rates of the leaves exhibit variations across plants and leaves, accounting
    for different strain levels recorded for the three leaves in the control group.
    Nonetheless, under the impact of abiotic stress, the detrimental impact pervasively
    inhibited the growth across all the leaves. These results validate a pragmatic
    strategy to monitor the leaves if they are under certain abiotic stress in smart
    farming. The developed temperature sensors can record leaf surface temperatures,
    and the strain sensors can relay comprehensive information on plant growth status.
    The integration of both sensor types offers real-time data to agricultural practitioners,
    enabling prompt intervention to avert suboptimal plant growth. Furthermore, the
    developed sensors equip plant researchers with a more efficient, noninvasive approach
    to identify heat-resistant plant varieties and establish optimal growth temperatures.
    The pragmatic applications underscore considerable potential of our innovative
    sensors in both plant research and the broader context of smart agriculture. Fig.

    communication system has been developed as a smart farmer-farm interface to enrich
    the visualization of the plants’ status. Figure 5A depicts the information flow
    of the sensing signals. The described system, diagrammatically represented in
    Fig. 5A, uses sensors positioned on plant surfaces to record leaf surface temperatures.
    The collected data undergo conditioning by an electrical circuit, followed by
    processing and analog-digital conversion via an Arduino board. The generated digital
    output governs the behavior of a digital-twin plant in the virtual reality (VR)
    environment as displayed on the personal computer (PC), thereby allowing the leaf
    surface temperature in physical space to be mirrored by the color of the digital-twin
    leaf in the VR space. Figure 5B vividly demonstrates the instantaneous transference
    of real-space plant surface temperature to the VR counterpart. The objective is
    to simulate localized overheating scenario in precision agriculture, where the
    whole farming environment maintains a constant overall temperature. In this demonstration,
    four transparent e-skin temperature sensors are independently attached to four
    separate plants and connected to the communication system. The side view provides
    a clear identification of each plant’s location, denoted as ①, ②, ③, and ④. On
    the computer monitor, a VR space displays the corresponding leaf temperatures,
    initially recorded as 297.1, 297.3, 296.7, and 296.8 K under normal conditions.
    The top view focuses on two specific plants, ① and ②, situated in the upper shelf
    region where localized heating is mostly expected to occur. Temperature thresholds
    at 300 and 302 K are set to represent warm and overheating states, respectively,
    which are visualized by changing the digital-twin leaf color to yellow and red.
    Notably, the thresholds of 300 and 302 K are only chosen to emulate the warm and
    overheating state and do not represent the actual warm and overheating state of
    any specific plant. In practical applications, the threshold temperature can vary
    significantly from different types of plants and be set accordingly. In Fig. 5C,
    a mild, localized overheat was simulated by bringing a warm object (327 K) close
    to plant ①, causing only its temperature to increase, while the other three remain
    unaffected. This leads to a color shift in the corresponding digital-twin plant,
    transitioning it from green to yellow once the temperature reached 300 K. In Fig.
    5D, as a hot object (338 K) approaches plant ②, heat transmission resulted in
    a color shift of the digital-twin plant, from green to yellow and eventually to
    red, denoting the occurrence of an extreme heat stress in that specific area.
    Upon removal of the hot object, the temperature gradually decreases, as depicted
    by a color transition in the VR space from red to yellow and finally to green.
    The dynamic recording of the whole process can be found in movie S2. The digital-twin
    plant system thus demonstrates its practicality in translating the real-world
    plants into the VR space, visualizing distinct temperature states through intuitive
    color changes of the corresponding digital-twin plants. In addition to the proposed
    localized overheating monitoring, this digital-twin plant system can encompass
    plant growth surveillance by harnessing a strain sensor to gather leaf growth
    information. This innovative system potentially provides a visual platform for
    meticulous and timely monitoring in smart farming. Fig. 5. Application of the

    We have demonstrated an all-organic plant e-skin that can be conformably attached
    to and seamlessly integrated with plants to noninvasively monitor their physiological
    status. By developing a scalable microfabrication process using only organic PEDOT:PSS
    as conductive components and PDMS as substrates, we achieved biocompatibility,
    transparency, stretchability, and conformability simultaneously in our plant e-skin.
    Our reported 4.5-μm-thick plant e-skin with more than 85% transmittance across
    the visible spectrum are optically and mechanically invisible to plants, thus
    enabling long-term and real-time monitoring without any observable adverse effects
    to plant health. Leveraging these characteristics, we configured our plant e-skin
    into strain sensors and temperature sensors and achieved long-duration real-time
    plant growth and surface temperature monitoring. The on-plant monitoring results
    revealed the day/night leaf growth rhythms and the accompanying leaf surface temperature
    variations, demonstrating the capability of our plant e-skin to measure plant
    physiological signals for practical applications. It is worth noting that such
    capability of transducing real-time plant physiological signals is especially
    crucial for accelerating desirable phenotypes during precision breeding of new
    plant varieties. Furthermore, we constructed a digital-twin plant monitoring system
    as a farmer-farm interface to visualize the thermal status of leaf surface in
    real time. While the minimum feature size we achieved in the present study is
    2 μm, it is limited by the resolution of our lithography system. In principle,
    this minimum feature size can be reduced to submicrometer range for more dense
    integration. Apart from the demonstrated strain sensor and temperature sensor,
    other types of sensors can be expected by using the morphology and design flexibility
    offered by our scalable fabrication technique. We have preliminarily demonstrated
    the possibility of developing a flexible humidity sensor for monitoring the microenvironment
    of plants (fig. S17). In the future, the use of embedded conducting coils in the
    sensors is expected to enable wireless communication between plant e-skin and
    processors. Beyond plant growth monitoring applications, our demonstrated technology
    is also broadly applicable to epidermal electronics for human wearable and implantable
    devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials All the materials and chemicals used
    in this study are commercially available. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA; molecular weight
    = 89,000 to 98,000), PEDOT:PSS (1.3 wt % dispersion in H2O), d-sorbitol, and DMSO
    were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PDMS (SYLGARD 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit) was
    purchased from Dow Corning. Fabrication of plant e-skin The scalable fabrication
    process is schematically demonstrated in fig. S4. PVA aqueous solution (8 wt %
    in H2O) was initially spin-coated onto a clean and smooth wafer at 800 rpm for
    30 s, acting as a sacrificial layer. Then, PDMS, prepared as a mixture of the
    elastomer base and a curing agent at a weight ratio of 20:1, was spin-coated at
    8000 rpm for 4 min, creating the substrate layer for the epidermal electronics.
    A plasma treatment was carried out to render the PDMS surface hydrophilic [6 sccm
    (standard cubic centimeter per minute), 30 W, 30 s], facilitating the subsequent
    coating of the photoresist AZ-1512 at 800 rpm for 25 s. AZ-1512 was baked overnight
    at 65°C in the oven with temperature increasing and decreasing slowly to eliminate
    cracking of the AZ-1512 film caused by the thermal extension and cold contraction
    of the PDMS film under rapid and high temperature variation. Subsequently, a mask
    aligner (MA8, Micro Suss) was used to expose the micropatterns on the AZ-1512
    film, allowing the desired PDMS pattern exposed without covering AZ-1512 after
    development in the MF 319 for 40 s. Thereafter, with additional plasma treatment,
    the sensing material [p-PEDOT:PSS (mixture of PEDOT:PSS, 5 wt % DMSO and 5 wt
    % d-sorbitol) for strain sensor and PEDOT:PSS for temperature sensor] was spin-coated
    onto the wafer at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Next, the lift-off process was conducted
    to remove AZ-1512 in acetone, and the remaining region was the PEDOT:PSS-based
    pattern on the PDMS substrate. In such case, the sensing film was successfully
    micropatterned on the PDMS film. Detailed parameters of the feature size of both
    sensors are illustrated in fig. S18. The subsequent steps included encapsulating
    the sensing films and connection to the external wire, which are crucial to ensure
    a good and reliable recording of the sensory output. To partially seal the sensing
    part while leaving the connection pads exposed for external wire connection, nonadhesive
    parafilm was used to cover the connection pads before spin-coating of PDMS (8000
    rpm for 4 min) as the encapsulation layer on the sensing part. In addition, the
    parafilm was removed immediately after spin-coating to expose the connection pads
    again. Once the PDMS encapsulation layer was solidified, ultrathin copper wires
    were affixed to the two connection pads using Ag paste and liquid metal. Low-Young’s-modulus
    liquid metal was used to reinforce stability against potential cracks in the Ag
    paste or disruption to PEDOT:PSS films especially at the PEDOT:PSS-Ag paste junction
    induced by the Ag paste’s sharpness. Last, the connection pads together with the
    liquid metal and external wires were encapsulated manually with PDMS to obtain
    the final sensor. For further application, the epidermal sensors can be gently
    peeled off from the holding wafer and attached to the target objects such as the
    plant leaves. Sensor characterization The microstructure morphology of the PEDOT:PSS
    patterns on the PDMS film was characterized via the optical microscope (Nikon,
    Eclipse L200 L300). The optical transmission of the developed sensor was characterized
    by a universal measurement spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 7000 UV-Vis-NIR).
    The thickness of the developed sensor was measured by the surface profile (Bruker,
    DektakXT) and atomic force microscopy (Bruker Dimension Icon). Sheet resistance
    was measured by a four-probe measurement system (AiT, CMT-SR2000N). Photographs
    and videos were acquired by an iPhone 14 camera. The force gauge (Mecmesin, MultiTest
    2.5-i) was used to conduct stretching deformation for shear adhesion force and
    strain sensor characterization. The resistance of strain sensor under each strain
    level was measured by the programmable electrometer (Keithley, 6514), and an oscilloscope
    (Agilent, InfiniiVision, DSO-X3034A) was connected to the electrometer using a
    bayonet nut coupling (BNC) cable for real-time data acquisition. The temperature
    sensor was characterized using a hot plate to control its temperature, and the
    electrical resistance was recorded by a digital multimeter (Sanwa, CD800a). When
    connected to Arduino MEGA 2560 for real-time data acquisition, every temperature
    sensor was calibrated using the hot plate before applying on the plant leaves
    to obtain the relationship between sensory output and temperature. Cultivation
    of the host B. rapa plant and stress application The oilseed sarson seeds were
    sown in soil and grown under standard long-day conditions (16-hour light/8-hour
    dark period), 60% humidity and 26°C light/23°C dark. After about 3 weeks, six
    plants were selected for sensor attachment with three for the control group and
    three for the abiotic stress group. Plants in the control group were then placed
    in the chamber under standard growth conditions (16-hour light/8-hour dark period,
    60% humidity, 26°C light/23°C dark), and the other three were placed in another
    chamber where they were subjected to heat and drought stress (16-hour light/8-hour
    dark period, 60% humidity, 34°C light/31°C dark). Plants in the control group
    were watered well throughout the experiment, while the plants in the stress group
    did not receive water once the sensors were attached, to initiate drought condition.
    Demonstration of digital-twin plants in VR space Four epidermal temperature sensors
    were connected to the conditional circuit for conversion from the resistance change
    to voltage change as well as amplifying the voltage signals. The generated data
    were sent to a microcontroller (Arduino MEGA 2560) for data processing and communication
    with a laptop computer through a universal serial bus (USB) cable. The real-time
    signals received by the laptop computer were processed in Python, and the corresponding
    commands were sent to Unity 3D through Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
    Protocol (TCP/IP) communication for digital-twin plant control. Acknowledgments

  description: Frost events have resulted in huge economic losses in agriculture.
    Apple flower buds are susceptible to being damaged by cold weather in early spring,
    leading to reduced apple production. Applying heat is one of the most effective
    methods to prevent apple flower bud damage. However, growers generally determine
    when and how to apply heat in orchards based on their experiences and available
    labor force, leading to either insufficient heating or energy waste. In this study,
    a frost protection cyber-physical system (CPCPS) was developed to make heating
    decisions based on real-time ambient temperature and wind direction data. The
    CPCPS consisted of a real-time temperature sensing system, an angle auto-adjusted
    heater, and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to move the heating system. The results
    show that the CPCPS improved protection performance during the field tests. Compared
    to the non-CPCPS, the CPCPS increased the percentages of canopy protected time
    by 198.8 % and 111.9 % in two low-temperature field tests. The outcome of the
    study can be beneficial for enhancing protection performance of canopies in apple
    orchards.

  explanation: The purpose of the research was to develop a Frost protection canopy
    cyber-physical system (CPCPS) that can effectively enhance frost protection by
    utilizing real-time temperature sensing, wind direction, and UGV to control heater
    movement and heating angle to reduce frost damage. This research was significant
    because, compared to the non-CPCPS, the CPCPS greatly enhanced protection performance,
    leading to 198.8% and 111.9% increases in percentage of protected time in two
    low-temperature field tests. The angle-auto adjusted heating system could maintain
    the area protected against frost damage even under windy conditions, which increased
    the protection efficiency compared to the angle-fixed heating system.
  extract_1: '"Compared to the non-CPCPS (2.4 ℃ and 1.3 ℃ on April 8th and 25th),
    for the CPCPS was higher (3.9 ℃ and 2.6 ℃), respectively. for the CPCPS during
    the two tests (47.8 % and 33.9 %) was also larger than those for the non-CPCPS
    (16 %), which increased by 198.8 % and 111.9 %."'

    Highlights • A canopy protection cyber-physical system (CPCPS) was developed for
    smart management of frost damage. • The angle of heaters used to protect the orchard
    was auto-adjusted based on a real-time wind direction in the CPCPS. • A set of
    sensors were used to measure real-time air temperature in the canopy to determine
    heating schedules for the CPCPS. • The CPCPS increased the percentage of protected
    time by 198.8 % and 111.9 % in two field tests compared to the non-CPCPS. Abstract
    Frost events have resulted in huge economic losses in agriculture. Apple flower
    buds are susceptible to being damaged by cold weather in early spring, leading
    to reduced apple production. Applying heat is one of the most effective methods
    to prevent apple flower bud damage. However, growers generally determine when
    and how to apply heat in orchards based on their experiences and available labor
    force, leading to either insufficient heating or energy waste. In this study,
    a frost protection cyber-physical system (CPCPS) was developed to make heating
    decisions based on real-time ambient temperature and wind direction data. The
    CPCPS consisted of a real-time temperature sensing system, an angle auto-adjusted
    heater, and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to move the heating system. The results
    show that the CPCPS improved protection performance during the field tests. Compared
    to the non-CPCPS, the CPCPS increased the percentages of canopy protected time
    by 198.8 % and 111.9 % in two low-temperature field tests. The outcome of the
    study can be beneficial for enhancing protection performance of canopies in apple
    orchards. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Frost protectionCyber-physical

    caused devastating impacts on agriculture, threatening crop yield and quality
    (Field et al., 2012) resulting in major economic losses. For example, cold damage
    resulted in more than $ 2B of agricultural crop losses in the U.S. in 2007 and
    $ 3B losses in Europe in 2017 (Smith, 2018, Vitasse and Rebetez, 2018). Climate
    change may be responsible for exacerbating early flower development for many crops,
    such as wheat, apple, pear, and peach, making the blossoms more susceptible to
    damage (Eccel et al., 2009, Inouye, 2000, Barlow et al., 2015, Cittadini et al.,
    2006, Guo et al., 2019, Sugiura et al., 2007, Tsipouridis and Thomidis, 2005).
    Applying additional heat is one of the most effective methods to reduce economic
    losses for fruit growers. Much effort has been made to improve the heating performance.
    For example, Brooks et al. (1950) applied a combined use of wind machines and
    heaters in a citrus orchard and proved that the combination increased protection
    20–30 %. Alshami and Evans (2009) developed a pulse jet orchard heater system
    to effectively reduce buoyant heat losses in a grape vineyard. Hua et al. (2022a)
    developed a mobile heating model and found that additional 7 % of the volume of
    the canopy was protected for one movement. A heater pulled by an orchard tractor
    with a speed of 8 km/h was used in a pistachio orchard by Hokm et al. (2013),
    suggesting that approximately an area of 2.5 ha was protected by the tractor-based
    heater. Even though much effort has been made to reduce frost damage, two critical
    challenges deter growers from taking active protection actions and simply relying
    on crop insurance. One challenge is that growers determine when and how to apply
    heat in orchards based on their experiences and available labor force, leading
    to either insufficient heating or energy waste. The other challenge is that ambient
    wind is often treated as an uncontrollable factor when growers are implementing
    heating tasks in orchards, while it greatly affects heating performance. To overcome
    these challenges, the key is to monitor the environment and take actions according
    to the monitored data, e.g., use temperature sensors and wind sensors to perceive
    environmental changes and then make corresponding heating decisions. A Cyber-Physical
    System (CPS) is defined as a transformative technology for managing interconnected
    systems between their physical assets and computational capabilities (Baheti and
    Gill, 2011). It can be used to monitor real-time variations in complex environments
    when controlling mechanical mechanisms, and thus applicable CPSs can improve the
    efficiency and performance of mechanical systems. CPSs have attracted attention
    in irrigation management, pest management, crop yield management, and greenhouse
    stress management in agricultural research (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2019, Stark
    et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2021, Guo et al., 2018). CPSs
    have also been applied for crop frost protection. For example, a wireless sensor
    network was developed to monitor air temperature during frost/freeze protection
    events (Pierce and Elliott, 2008). Stombaugh et al. (1992) developed an automated
    pulsed irrigation system based on temperature sensors for frost protection of
    strawberries, which reduced half the typical amount of water used without compromising
    the level of crop protection. Jaradat and Mohd (2008) developed an intelligent
    smoke generator system based on a set of distributed wireless sensors in an open
    field environment, which maintained the soil surface temperature above 0 °C overnight.
    However, the advantage of CPS for smart frost protection has not been investigated,
    and the challenges in heating decisions based on personal experiences and unpredicted
    wind conditions have not been solved. This study focused on developing an intelligent
    canopy protection cyber-physical system (CPCPS). The primary goal of the CPCPS
    was to implement heating decisions based on real-time temperature and wind direction
    data. The objectives included (1) the development of a real-time temperature and
    wind direction sensing system, (2) the development of an angle auto-adjusted and
    mobile heating system, and (3) an experimental verification of the CPCPS in an
    apple orchard. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Design of CPCPS Fig. 1 shows the
    general structure of the CPCPS to address the temperature and wind direction data
    from the physical environment by using two data microprocessors, respectively.
    After the data were processed, two separate actions were sent to a LED lamp and
    a linear actuator. Subsequently, a UGV was controlled by a remote controller based
    on the LED flashing signal to move to an assigned place. A rotatable heater was
    automatically controlled to rotate to an assigned angle by the linear actuator.
    In the non-CPCPS, tested as a control group, only a fixed heater was used and
    the rest of the structure in the CPCPS was deactivated. Download : Download high-res

    heating system, the gas heater was assisted by a turntable and a linear actuator
    to rotate on the horizontal plane, which is further described in section 2.2.
    In the temperature sensing system, real-time temperatures were measured by digital
    thermometers, and the LED signal was emitted when temperature criteria were met,
    which is further described in section 2.3. The UGV system was used to transport
    the heating system to an unheated block according to the LED signal, which is
    further described in section 2.4. Download : Download high-res image (653KB) Download

    Angle auto-adjusted heating system The angle auto-adjusted heating system consisted
    of a wind direction sensor (RUCHDYHSDWZIY5U2, Cheresouse, IN, USA), an Arduino
    MEGA 2560 (Arduino, New York, USA), an L298N dual H-bridge motor driver (Makefabs,
    Shenzhen City, China), a linear actuator (L11TGF1000NB300-T-1, ECO LLC, Washington,
    DC, USA), a gas heater (Dyna-Glo RMC-FA150DGD, GHP Group Inc, Niles, IL, USA),
    a 15-pound propane tank (Blue Rhino Corporation, Winston-Salem, NC, USA), a 12VDC
    power source (Lead Acid Automotive Battery, EverStart Maxx, Cork, Ireland), a
    750 W power inverter (EverStart, Cork, Ireland), and an Arduino NANO (Arduino,
    New York, USA), as shown in Fig. 2. The wind direction sensor measured real-time
    wind direction data from 16 directions of with ± 3° accuracy each second. The
    wind direction sensor was modified by replacing an original TP8485E-SR IC Chips,
    i.e., an RS485 interface module inside the wind sensor with the Arduino NANO to
    output a digital signal of an average ambient wind direction every 30 s. The heater
    rated at 159,000 KJ·h−1 input was applied heat by burning propane during field
    tests. The 12VDC power source was used to provide power for the system. The gas
    heater fan was powered by a 110VAC power, which was converted from the 12VDC battery
    by the 750 W power inverter. Fig. 3 shows the basic structure of the rotatable
    gas heater. A 25 cm (D) turntable was used for rotation. The linear actuator was
    controlled based on wind direction, resulting in the heater rotation in the horizontal
    plane. T-slot framings were utilized to connect the heater and the UGV. Download

    for the angle auto-adjusted heating system. The Arduino NANO was connected to
    a reed tube relay inside the wind sensor which provided a digital signal output
    of the average wind direction to the Arduino MEGA 2560 by serial port communication.
    The Arduino MEGA 2560 then controlled the linear actuator to extend and retract
    by the L298N dual H-bridge motor driver. The programming code was developed in
    the Arduino IDE 2.0.3 (Arduino, Milan, Italy). Download : Download high-res image
    (411KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Control system for angle auto-adjusted
    heating system. A principle of the angle adjustment was to keep the heater facing
    upwind i.e., applying heat against the background wind direction. The principle
    was utilized to reduce heating loss from the orchard based on a numerical model
    developed by Hua et al. (2022b). Previous research simulated and found that an
    angle of 15° between the heater outlet surface and the tree row provided maximum
    energy utilization (Hua et al., 2023). The canopies were approximately arranged
    in 30° W of N in the experimental orchard, which was further described in section
    2.5. The rotation strategies are as follows: (1) If the ambient wind direction
    was 60° or 240° (Fig. 5 (a)), designating north as 0°, the heaters were assigned
    to face the tree row. Download : Download high-res image (299KB) Download : Download

    or 240° < wind direction < 360°, where north = 0°, east = 90°, south = 180°, and
    west = 270°. (2) If the ambient wind direction was between 60° and 240°, the heaters
    on the left- and right-hand sides were assigned to rotate 15° clockwise and counterclockwise,
    respectively (Fig. 5 (b)). (3) Otherwise, the heaters on the left- and right-hand
    sides were assigned to rotate 15° counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively
    (Fig. 5 (c)). 2.3. Real-time temperature sensing system Given that the heating
    system had the capacity to warm up a maximum area of 6 m, a real-time temperature
    system was developed and separately settled in two blocks with 6 digital thermometers
    (DS18B20 1-Wire Digital, Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA, USA) in each block. In
    addition to thermometers, the real-time temperature system consisted of an Arduino
    UNO R3 (Interaction Design Institute, Ivrea, Italy), an Adafruit data logging
    shield (Adafruit, New York, USA), two 5 mm LED lamps (450pcs, DiCUNO, Madison,
    WI, USA), and six 1.5 V AA batteries (Duracell, CT, USA), as shown in Fig. 2.
    The thermometers were connected with the Arduino UNO R3 to measure the air temperatures
    in canopies during field tests. The digital thermometers had ± 0.5 °C accuracy
    from −10 °C to + 85 °C. The Adafruit data logging shield was used for data logging
    on an SD card. The 5 mm LED lamps were used in the temperature sensing system
    and powered by six 1.5 V AA batteries. Fig. 6 shows the two groups of digital
    thermometers (A1-F1 and A2-F2) connecting to the Adafruit data logging shield
    by an ElectroCookie breadboard with six 4,700 Ohm resistors as voltage dividers.
    The pins on the Adafruit data logging shield were directly connected to the pins
    on the Arduino UNO R3. The LED lamps were also connected to the Adafruit data
    logging shield by a solderless breadboard and two 330 Ohm resistors. The digital
    thermometer measured one temperature data point every 13 s. The temperature sensing
    system was programmed to update output temperature data when the digital thermometer
    obtained a data point. The output temperature data were the average temperatures
    of the six thermometers in each group (A1-F1 and A2-F2): (1) where is the average
    temperature of the six digital thermometers A-F (℃). Download : Download high-res

    data logging shield by breadboards. The Arduino UNO R3 is covered by the Adafruit
    data logging shield, and thus not shown in the figure. An average temperature
    under a relatively stable state was used as a criterion to determine the timing
    of UGV moving from one block to another during the tests. Typically, after heat
    flows in canopies reached a relatively stable state, the average temperature of
    the heated canopy remained unchanged with continuous heating. Once the criterion
    was met during a test, the UGV was ready to move to an unheated block. Average
    temperature criteria of 10 ℃ and 20 ℃ at the stable state were used for a low-temperature
    condition field test (ambient temperature around −3 ℃) and a windy condition field
    test (ambient temperature around 4.5 ℃), as shown in Eqs. (2), (3): (2) (3) 2.4.
    Unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system The angle auto-adjusted heating system was
    transported by a ground vehicle converted from a Cub Cadet RZT-S Zero electric
    lawnmower with a 48-volt battery (Cub Cadet, Cleveland, OH, USA). The electrical
    and control components included a 2.4 Ghz receiver (6Ch V2, HobbyKing HongKong,
    China), a 2.4 GHz 8 channels remote controller with a “dead man” function (T8FB,
    Radiolink, Hongkong, China), two motor controllers (BAC1000, Accelerated Systems
    Inc (ASI), Waterloo, Canada), and a control box consisting of a custom microprocessor
    circuit called Cub Cadet motor shield (CCMS) and an Arduino MEGA 2560 (Pagan,
    2021) (Fig. 7). The CCMS received three analog pulse-width modulated (PWM) radio
    control (RC) signals, i.e., the steering signal, the throttle forward/reverse
    signal, and the dead man signal. The CCMS activated the onboard relay to provide
    48 VDC power to the two ASI motor controllers when the dead man signal was active.
    The CCMS then mixed the steering and throttle signals to provide individual digital
    commands to the ASI motor controllers for the left and right wheel motors. Download

    and an Arduino MEGA 2560. A section of tree canopy (17 m long) was divided into
    three blocks (Block 1, Block 2, and Waiting block) (Fig. 8). Block 1 and Block
    2 were 7 m in length, and Waiting block was 3 m in length. In Block 1 and Block
    2, two groups of the digital thermometers (A1 - F1 and A2 - F2) were placed in
    the middle of the tree row (y-axis) at a height of 1 m (z-axis) with a constant
    spacing of 1 m in the x-axis. F1 in Block 1 and A2 in Block 2 were spaced 2 m
    apart to ensure negligible heat flow effect between each area. The orchard track
    between the selected tree row and the neighboring tree row was roughly 2.6 m wide.
    The heaters on each side of the tree row were placed in the center line of the
    orchard track during the field tests. The red and green LED lamps in Fig. 6 were
    used to represent the temperature conditions in Block 1 and Block 2, respectively.
    The heater moving decisions are explained as follows: (1) When the red LED lamp
    at Block 1 flashed and the green LED lamp at Block 2 was off, representing the
    fulfilled temperature criterion at Block 1, the heaters should be moved to Block
    2 (x = 10.5 m). (2) When the red LED lamp at Block 1 was off and the green LED
    lamp at Block 2 flashed, representing the fulfilled temperature criterion at Block
    2, the heaters should be moved to Block 1 (x = 3.5 m). (3) When the red and green
    LED lamps at Block 1 and Block 2 flashed, representing the fulfilled temperature
    criteria at both Block 1 and Block 2, the heaters should be moved to Waiting block
    to save energy. (4) When the red and green LED lamps at Block 1 and Block 2 were
    off, representing that neither temperature criteria at Block 1 nor Block 2 were
    fulfilled, the heaters should stay at the current block and continue applying
    heat. Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size

    was divided into Block 1, Block 2, and Waiting block. The UGV shuttled among Block
    1, Block 2, and Waiting block based on the LED lamp signals. The Waiting block
    was used to save energy when the temperatures fulfilled the criteria in Block
    1 and Block 2. The letters from A to F represent thermometers. 2.5. Study site
    An apple orchard was selected as the study site, located at the Penn State Russell
    E. Larson Agricultural Research Center, Rock Springs, Pennsylvania (40.70°N, 77.95°W).
    The apple trees in this orchard were planted and trained in a central leader structure
    with trellis wire support in the 1980s. The orchard dimension was 70 m (L) × 20
    m (W), and the size of each tree row was roughly 70 m (L) × 1 m (W) × 2 m (H).
    The canopies were approximately arranged in 30° W of N. A canopy block of 17 m
    (L) in the orchard was selected for field tests, as shown in red in Fig. 9. In
    field tests, the two heaters were placed on each side of the tree row with a distance
    of 3.6 m between them. The right-hand side heater was equipped with the CPCPS,
    and the left-hand side heater was placed on a wagon and manually controlled according
    to the behavior of the heater on the right due to the limited number of UGVs.

    of protection performance To test the canopy protection performance, six field
    tests in the apple orchard were conducted on March 29th, April 8th, April 18th,
    and April 25th, 2023, respectively. The tests on March 29th and April 25th were
    conducted for evaluating the protection performances of the angle auto-adjusted
    heating system in low-temperature conditions; the tests on April 8th and 25th
    were conducted for evaluating the protection performances of the CPCPS in low-temperature
    conditions; the tests on April 18th were conducted for evaluating the protection
    performances of the angle auto-adjusted heating system and the CPCPS in a windy
    condition. The average ambient temperature, average wind speed, average wind direction,
    and maximum gust speed during the tests are shown in Table 1. Table 1. The field
    test schedules and the environment conditions during each test. Date Test Group

    Note: Ta = ambient temperature, Va = average wind speed,  = average wind direction,
    Vm = maximum gust speed. The angle auto-adjusted heating system is one of the
    most important parts of the CPCPS. To investigate the performance, a 5 min heating
    test of the angle auto-adjusted heating system and a 5 min heating test of the
    angle fixed heating system were conducted as the test group and control group,
    respectively. The heaters were placed along the tree row between thermometers
    C1 and D1 in Block 1 and toward the direction of thermometer D1 for the test of
    the angle fixed system. The rotatable heaters were placed along the tree row between
    thermometers C2 and D2 in Block 2 for the test of the angle auto-adjusted system.
    The heating angle was determined according to the principles of angle adjustment
    shown in Fig. 5. To investigate the overall protection performance of the CPCPS,
    a 10 min heating test enabling the CPCPS and a 10 min heating test disabling the
    CPCPS were carried out as the test group and control group, respectively. For
    the test of the non-CPCPS, the heaters were placed along the tree row between
    thermometers C1 and D1 in Block 1 and toward the direction of thermometers D1.
    For the test of the CPCPS, the heating angle was determined based on the principle
    of the angle adjustment shown in Fig. 5. The heating location either in Block
    1 or Block 2 was determined according to the principle of the UGV movement in
    Fig. 8. Between the two 10 min tests, a time interval of 10 min was used to ensure
    the heat provided by the gas heaters was completely dissipated so that the effect
    of the former test was negligible on the latter. All tests were conducted either
    in the early morning before sunrise or late evening after sunset without direct
    solar radiation so that the variations of ambient temperatures over time during
    field tests were negligible. Therefore, the comparisons of the protection performance
    between test groups and control groups were acceptable. Apple flower buds are
    damaged when the temperature is lower than a critical temperature for 30 min.
    The critical temperature of −2 ℃ was utilized in this study as suggested by Proebsting
    and Mills (1978). The percentage of protected time ( ) and the temperature increase
    ratio ( ) were used to evaluate the protection performance of the canopy for two
    conditions, i.e., cold-temperature condition and windy condition. The percentage
    of protected time ( ) was defined as the ratio of the protected time to total
    test time in low-temperature conditions, as shown in Eq. (4). The temperature
    increase ratio ( ) was defined as the ratio of the temperature increase to the
    initial ambient temperature in windy conditions, as shown in Eq. (5): (4) (5)
    where is the protected time (s), is the total test time (s), is the average temperature
    over time during the test (℃), is the initial ambient temperature (℃). 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Protection performance of angle auto-adjusted system in low-temperature
    condition The angle auto-adjusted heating system worked properly during the heating
    tests in the low-temperature conditions on March 29th and April 25th, 2023. Table
    2 shows the working procedures for the angle auto-adjusted heating system in Block
    2 and the angle fixed heating system in Block 1. On March 29th, a 5 min test started
    at 7:28:27 in Block 2. Two adjustments of the heating angle were observed at 7:29:33
    and 7:31:58 respectively due to the change of the ambient wind direction. Subsequently,
    a 5 min test of the angle fixed heating system, i.e., the control group, started
    at 7:33:34 in Block 1 with the heaters angled toward thermometer D1. On April
    25th, a 5 min test started at 6:52:40 in Block 2 and an adjustment of the heating
    angle occurred at 6:55:39. The 5 min control test started at 6:58:53 for the angle
    fixed heating test. Table 2. Working procedures of the angle auto-adjusted heating

    angle fixed heating system in Block 1 and the angle auto-adjusted heating system
    in Block 2 on March 29th and April 25th. On March 29th, thermometers D1 and E1
    in the angle fixed heating test measured obvious increases in temperature, up
    to 57.5 and 4.7 ℃, as shown in Fig. 10 (a). For thermometers B1 and C1, which
    were in the opposite direction of the heat flow, the temperatures remained below
    the critical level (-2 ℃). In the test of the angle auto-adjusted heating system
    in Block 2, the temperatures measured by thermometers D2 and E2 increased to 23.2
    ℃ and 3.0 ℃ at 7:29:33 and then decreased to 6.0 ℃ and −2.2 ℃ at 7:31:58. After
    the second change of the heating angle at 7:31:58, the temperatures for thermometers
    D2 and E2 increased again to 22.0 ℃ and 1.8 ℃, as shown in Fig. 10 (b). On the
    contrary, the temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and C2 remained unchanged
    at the first 70 s, then increased to 5.6 ℃ and 48.3 ℃ before the second change
    of the heating angle, and finally decreased to 1.8 ℃ and 46.3 ℃ at the end of
    the test, as shown in Fig. 10 (b). Fig. 10 (c) shows that the temperatures for
    thermometers D1 and E1 increased to 53.1 ℃ and 7.8 ℃, but the temperatures for
    thermometers B1 and C1 remained below the critical level during the test of the
    angle fixed heating on April 25th. For the test of the angle auto-adjusted heating
    (Fig. 10 (d)), the temperatures for thermometers D2 and E2 first increased and
    then decreased, resulting in the temperature peaks of 43.2 ℃ and 7.5 ℃, respectively.
    For thermometers B2 and C2, the temperatures remained at the ambient level before
    6:55:39 and went up to 5.0 ℃ and 36.7 ℃ at the end of the test. The thermometers
    A1, A2, F1, and F2 remained at the ambient temperature level (-3.6 ℃) during the
    tests, indicating that the distances between these points and heaters were farther
    away than the heat flow reached. Download : Download high-res image (480KB) Download

    heating system in Block 1 on April 25th; (d) test of angle auto-adjusted heating
    system in Block 2 on April 25th. Thermometers of A1, A2, F1, and F2 during the
    tests remained at the ambient temperature level and thus are not shown in the
    figure. Table 3 shows the comparisons of the average temperature between the angle
    fixed heating system and the angle auto-adjusted heating system. The spatial difference
    of the average temperature for each thermometer greatly varied between the two
    heating systems. In the angle fixed heating system, the heat mainly focused on
    the location of thermometer D1, leading to the dramatically high of 45.9 ℃ and
    40.9 ℃ on March 29th and April 25th, respectively. In contrast, for thermometers
    B1, C1, and E1 ranged from −3.3 ℃ to −2.8 ℃ on March 29th, and from −2.5 ℃to 5.9
    ℃ on April 25th. In the angle auto-adjusted heating system, thermometer C2 measured
    the highest of 29.5 ℃ on March 29th and thermometer D2 measured the highest of
    32.6 ℃ on April 25th. The highest measured in the angle auto-adjusted heating
    tests on March 29th and April 25th were lower than those measured in the angle
    fixed heating tests. However, the overall showed a different result. The overall
    was 11.1 ℃ and 12.7 ℃ for the angle auto-adjusted heating system on March 29th
    and April 25th, which were higher than those for the angle fixed heating system
    (  = 10.6 ℃ and 10.4 ℃). Table 3. Comparisons of average temperature and percentage
    of protected time between angle fixed heating system and angle auto-adjusted heating

    Table 3 also shows the comparisons of the percentage of protected time between
    the angle fixed heating system and the angle auto-adjusted heating system. In
    the angle fixed heating tests, for thermometers D1 and E1 were as high as 96.2
    % because they were located in the heated area, but for thermometers B1 and C1
    were 0. In the angle auto-adjusted heating tests on March 29th, remained at high
    levels for thermometers D2 and E2 (96.2 % and 84.6 %). More importantly, compared
    to  = 0 in the angle fixed heating tests, for thermometers B2 and C2 greatly increased
    to 69.2 % and 76.9 %. Increases in for thermometers B2 and C2 were also observed
    in the angle auto-adjusted heating test on April 25th, up to 46.2 %. The overall
    average for the angle auto-adjusted heating system were 81.7 % and 71.2 % on March
    29th and April 25th, which were 69.9 % and 48.0 % higher than those for the angle
    fixed heating system (  = 48.1 %). In summary, the angle auto-adjusted heating
    system greatly enhanced the protection performance during the heating tests in
    low-temperature conditions. 3.2. Protection performance of CPCPS in low-temperature
    condition In addition to the angle auto-adjusted heating system, the real-time
    temperature sensing system and the UGV system in the CPCPS also worked properly
    in the low-temperature conditions on April 8th and 25th. Table 4 shows the working
    procedures for the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS, including start time, time of heating
    angle adjustment, time of UGV movement, and end time. On April 8th, the test of
    the CPCPS started at 7:21:00 in Block 1. Three angle adjustments occurred at 7:22:55,
    7:24:27, and 7:27:20. The heating systems were moved at 7:25:34 and 7:28:58. After
    10 min of heat dissipation, the test of the non-CPCPS started in Block 1 at 7:41:00,
    lasting for 10 min. On April 25th, the test of the non-CPCPS and the test of the
    CPCPS started at 6:11:30 and 6:31:11, respectively. An adjustment of the heating
    angle and a movement of the heating systems were observed at 6:34:15 and 6:35:18
    during the test of the CPCPS, respectively. Table 4. Working procedures of the

    Fig. 11 shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations for the CPCPS and
    the non-CPCPS on April 8th. For the CPCPS test, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    B1 and C1 remained at the ambient level for the first 2 min and increased at 7:22:55
    due to the first heating angle change, as shown in Fig. 11 (a), resulting in the
    temperature peaks (4.0 and 29.5 ℃) at 7:24:27 before the second heating angle
    changed. The temperatures measured by thermometers D1 and E1 first increased to
    54.0 ℃ and 7.7 ℃ at 7:22:55, and then decreased to 29.3 ℃ and 1.0 ℃ at 7:24:27.
    After the second change of the heating angle, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    D1 and E1 increased again, up to 40.3 ℃ and 6.3 ℃. At 7:25:34, the measured average
    temperature of thermometers A1-F1 in Block 1 met the criteria in Eq. (2), which
    triggered the UGV movement. Consequent temperature drops in thermometers B1, C1,
    D1, and E1 occurred due to the movement of the heating systems to Block 2. At
    7:25:40, the UGV arrived at the location between thermometers C2 and D2 in Block
    2 in the center line of the orchard track. The heating angle was toward thermometer
    D2 and thus the temperatures measured by thermometers D2 and E2 greatly increased
    to 42.2 ℃ and 4.5 ℃, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). At 7:27:20, the third change of
    the heating angle occurred, leading to temperature decreases in thermometers D2
    and E2. However, the temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and C2 increased
    to 6.2 ℃ and 42.0 ℃ at 7:28:58. At that moment, the measured average temperature
    of thermometers A2-F2 in Block 2 met the criteria in Eq. (2), which triggered
    the UGV movement again. Subsequently, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    B2, C2, D2, and E2 gradually decreased. At 7:29:04, the heating system moved back
    to Block 1, resulting in temperature increases in thermometers B1 and C1, up to
    7.8 ℃ and 54.1 ℃ at the end of the 10 min test. In the test of the non-CPCPS on
    April 8th (Fig. 11 (c)), thermometer D1 monitored a dramatic temperature increase
    and after around 2 min remained at a high-temperature level of around 55 ℃ with
    a slight temperature fluctuation caused by the occasional gust of wind in the
    orchard. Thermometer E1 also monitored a temperature increase (around 5 ℃) until
    the end of the test. However, no temperature increases were monitored by the other
    10 thermometers (A1-C1, F1, and A2-F2). Download : Download high-res image (396KB)

    variations on April 8th. (a)-(c) Test of CPCPS; (c) test of non-CPCPS. The temperatures
    for the thermometers that remained at the ambient level during the tests are not
    shown in the figure. The temperature variations for thermometers F1 and A2 are
    not shown in the figure because thermometers F1 and A2 in CPCPS only had a slight
    and transient temperature increase (around 2–3 ℃) due to the simultaneous moving
    and heating of heaters. Fig. 12 shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations
    for the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS on April 25th. For the CPCPS test, the temperatures
    measured by thermometers D1 and E1 increased to 38.6 ℃ and 4.6 ℃ at 6:34:15 and
    then gradually decreased due to the first heating angle change, as shown in Fig.
    12 (a). Thermometers B1 and C1 monitored temperature increases from 6:34:15 to
    6:35:18, and temperature decreases after 6:35:18 due to the UGV movement to Block
    2. The peak temperatures for thermometers B1 and C1 before the UGV movement were
    20.4 ℃ and 3.5 ℃, respectively. The temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and
    C2 increased after the heating systems moved to Block 2 at 6:35:24 and eventually
    reached 47.5 ℃ and 5.0 ℃, as shown in Fig. 12 (b). The ambient wind direction
    remained unchanged from 6:35:24 to 6:41:11 in Block 2, so the temperatures of
    thermometers D2 and E2 remained at the ambient level until the end of the test.
    For the non-CPCPS test (Fig. 12 (c)), the temperature measured by thermometers
    D1 and E1 reached an approximate steady state at 5 min. Compared to the temperature
    data of thermometers D1 in the non-CPCPS test on April 8th (Fig. 11 (c)), the
    temperature data monitored on April 25th (Fig. 12 (c)) reached a stable state
    more slowly. The canopy on was denser on April 25th than on April 8th due to growing
    leaves and flowers, leading to less active convection heat transfer in the later
    date. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download full-size

    and (b) Test of CPCPS; (c) test of non-CPCPS. The temperatures for the thermometers
    that remained at the ambient level during the tests are not shown in the figure.
    The protection performances, i.e., the average sensor temperature and the percentage
    of protected time , were greatly improved with the CPCPS, as shown in Table 5.
    For example, compared to for the non-CPCPS (2.4 ℃ and 1.3 ℃ on April 8th and 25th),
    for the CPCPS was higher (3.9 ℃ and 2.6 ℃), respectively. for the CPCPS during
    the two tests (47.8 % and 33.9 %) was also larger than those for the non-CPCPS
    (16 %), which increased by 198.8 % and 111.9 %. The temperatures measured by most
    of the thermometers in the non-CPCPS tests were lower than the critical level
    because the rotation and the mobility were not activated. Correspondingly, at
    most of the locations in non-CPCPS was 0, leading to insufficient protection performance.
    However, for the CPCPS tests, the rotatable and mobile heaters applied heat to
    more areas, which greatly enhanced the heating performance. Table 5. Comparison

    %), and were higher on April 8th (3.9 ℃ and 47.8 %) even though the ambient temperature
    on April 8th and 25th was similar. Except for the less active convective heat
    transfer on the later date, another reason is that the heating angle change and
    the heating system moving were less frequent on April 25th, leading to more thermometers
    remaining at the ambient temperature, such as A1, F1, A2, and D2 - F2. In contrast,
    other than thermometers A1 and F2 on April 8th, for the other thermometers were
    all higher than the critical level. Therefore, most of (thermometers B1-E2) were
    high on April 8th, ranging from 46.9 % to 97.9 %, as shown in Table 5. 3.3. Protection
    performance of angle auto-adjusted system and CPCPS in windy condition The angle
    auto-adjusted heating system and the CPCPS worked properly in a windy condition
    during the field tests on April 18th, 2023. Table 6 shows the working procedures
    for the angle fixed heating system, the angle auto-adjusted heating system, the
    CPCPS, and the non-CPCPS. The 5 min tests for the angle fixed heating system and
    the angle auto-adjusted heating system started at 8:04:17 and 8:14:56. Two adjustments
    of the heating angle were observed at 8:16:19 and 8:18:21 respectively due to
    the changes of the ambient wind direction. The 10 min tests for the non-CPCPS
    and the CPCPS started at 8:29:58 and 8:50:41. Two heating angle adjustments and
    a movement of the heaters occurred in the test of the CPCPS at 8:55:10, 8:56:22,
    and 8:57:20, respectively. Table 6. Working procedures of the angle auto-adjusted

    shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations during the field tests of
    the angle fixed heating and the angle auto-adjusted heating systems in the windy
    condition. During the test of the fixed heating system, the temperature measured
    by thermometer D1 greatly increased to 72.1 ℃ at 8:06:21 and obvious fluctuations
    in temperature were then monitored ranging from 61.2 ℃ to 75.2 ℃, as shown in
    Fig. 13 (a). The temperature fluctuations can be explained by the strong wind
    in the orchard that carried some heat away. Thermometer E1 measured much lower
    temperatures than thermometer D1 but a similar fluctuation in temperature was
    observed between them since the two thermometers were in the same direction of
    the heat being applied. During the test of the angle auto-adjusted heating system,
    the temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and C2 first increased to 20.5 ℃
    and 62.3 ℃ at 8:16:19, then decreased to 7.9 ℃ and 28.0 ℃ at 8:18:21, and eventually
    increased to 22.7 ℃ and 63.6 ℃ at 8:19:49 due to the two changes of wind direction,
    as shown in Fig. 13 (b). For thermometer D2, the measured temperature slightly
    increased to 10.2 ℃ at 8:16:19, which seemed to be due to the heat flow brought
    from the location of thermometer C2 in the windy condition. Subsequently, the
    temperatures measured by thermometers D2 and E2 dramatically increased to 71.8
    ℃ and 25.6 ℃, and then decreased to 31.2 ℃ and 8.8 ℃ due to the auto-adjusted
    heating angle based on the ambient wind direction. Download : Download high-res

    2. Thermometers that remained at the ambient temperature level (4.5 ℃) are not
    shown in the figure. Fig. 14 shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations
    for the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS in the windy condition on April 18th. In the CPCPS
    test, the temperatures measured by thermometers B1 and C1 increased from 4.5 ℃
    to 14.8 ℃ and 64.0 ℃, and remained at these levels until the first change of the
    heating angle at 8:55:10. Thermometer D1 first monitored a slight increase (10.4
    ℃) before 8:55:10 due to the heat flow from the location of thermometer C1 caused
    by ambient wind and then an obvious increase (48.0 ℃) after 8:55:10 due to the
    change of heating angle. After the UGV movement to Block 2, the temperatures measured
    by thermometers B1, C1, D1, and E1 in Block 1 gradually decreased to the ambient
    temperature level. In contrast, thermometers B2, C2, D2, and E2 in Block 2 subsequently
    measured temperature increases. For example, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    D2 and E2 increased to 30.4 ℃ and 13.5 ℃ before the second change of the heating
    angle at 8:57:20. For thermometers B2 and C2, their temperatures first increased
    by around 3.5 ℃ because the heaters were operating while moving. The temperatures
    for thermometers B2 and C2 increased to 20.1 ℃ and 63.2 ℃ at the end of the test.
    In the non-CPCPS test, thermometers D1 and E1 monitored temperature increases
    to 69.5 ℃ and 21.3 ℃ in the first 4 min and then fluctuated around 60 ℃ and 15
    ℃. Meanwhile, thermometer C1 also measured a slight temperature increase, which
    was attributed to a gust of wind in the orchard, resulting in heat flow from the
    location of thermometer D1 to the location of thermometer C1. Download : Download

    that remained the ambient temperature level during the tests are not shown in
    the figure. Table 7 shows the average temperature and the temperature increase
    ratio in the angle fixed heating system and the angle auto-adjusted heating system.
    The measured results indicate that the angle auto-adjusted heating system had
    an overall higher (23.6 ℃) than the angle fixed heating system (20.2 ℃), and the
    overall average in the angle auto-adjusted heating system (425.0 %) was higher
    than that in the angle fixed heating system (348.9 %). In the angle fixed heating
    system, thermometer D1 had a maximum (55.2 ℃), leading to an extremely high of
    1126.6 %, but for the other thermometers were relatively low. For example, for
    thermometers B1 and C1 only increased by 6.7 % and 4.4 %. for all the thermometers
    in the angle auto-adjusted heating system were high, ranging from 11.7 ℃ to 39.7
    ℃, leading to high (148.9–782.2 %). Therefore, compared to the angle fixed heating
    system, for the angle auto-adjusted heating system increased by 21.8 %. Table

    Note: for the average temperature that was lower than the initial temperature
    (4.5 ℃), the temperature increase ratio was assigned to 0. Table 7 shows and in
    the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS. for the CPCPS was higher (11.5 ℃) than for the non-CPCPS
    (10.2 ℃). Even though a dramatically large was measured by thermometer D1 (56.7
    ℃), the temperature remained at ambient in most locations in the non-CPCPS, resulting
    in more locations with no temperature increase. In the CPCPS, ranged from 31.1
    % to 811.1 % except for thermometers A1, F1, A2, and F2. The overall average for
    the CPCPS (155.4 %) was thus larger than that for the non-CPCPS (125.6 %). Compared
    to the non-CPCPS, for the CPCPS increased by 23.7 %. In summary, the angle fixed
    heating system and the CPCPS had the capacity for improving protection performance
    in windy conditions. 3.4. The implication and future work A canopy protection
    cyber-physical system (CPCPS) for smart management of frost damage was developed
    based on a UGV system, an angle auto-adjusted heating system, and a temperature
    sensing system. The designed system is beneficial to minimizing labor and maximizing
    frost protection efficiency. The total cost of equipment used in this study was
    approximately $5,000, mainly including a UGV for $4500, a heater for $200, and
    microcomputers for $100. Even though the UGV is a large initial investment, the
    total cost can be substantially cheaper compared to human labor costs for frost
    protection in the long-term. These components of the framework can be modified
    as needed and the current CPCPS can be improved in a few aspects in future studies
    to further enhance the heating performance. First, the CPCPS performed well under
    the average wind velocities from 0.1 m/s to 3.1 m/s during the tests, but occasional
    strong gusts reduced the heating performance. Therefore, future studies can focus
    on the stability of heating performance under occasional strong gusts. Second,
    the UGV was manually controlled by a remote controller. Improvements can be made
    for fully autonomous management, such as using autonomous UGVs and real-time communication
    between temperature sensors and UGVs. Specifically, after temperature data measured
    by real-time temperature sensors are processed, navigation decisions are automatically
    made for UGV-based heater movements according to GPS coordination. Third, the
    run time for the UGV of Cub Cadet RZT-S Zero typically can up to 1.5–2 h and the
    utilization of solar panels on top of UGV would increase the run time by simultaneously
    charging the battery. 4. Conclusions A CPCPS that relied on open software sources
    and easily accessible hardware was proposed and evaluated in an experimental apple
    orchard. The combination of real-time temperature sensors, wind direction sensor,
    gas heaters, and a UGV system offers insight into smart frost management. The
    following major conclusions can be drawn from the study: 1. Compared to the angle
    fixed heating system, the percentage of protected time for the angle auto-adjusted
    heating system increased by 69.9 % and 48.0 % during the two low-temperature field
    tests. 2. Compared to the non-CPCPS, the CPCPS effectively enhanced the protection
    performance during the two low-temperature field tests, resulting in the percentage
    of protected time increasing by 198.8 % and 111.9 %, respectively. 3. The angle
    fixed heating system and the CPCPS also worked properly during the windy field
    test. Compared to the angle fixed heating system and the non-CPCPS, the average
    temperature increase ratio increased by 21.8 % and 23.7 % for the angle auto-adjusted
    heating system and the CPCPS, respectively. The results suggest that the CPCPS
    is beneficial for frost management by improving the protection performance of
    apple canopies. In the future, the integration of autonomous UGVs may further
    improve the level of mechanization and automation of the CPCPS. CRediT authorship

    Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction India is the world''s largest producer of sugar,
    fruits, and jute and also the largest manufacturer of 25% overall production.
    The extremely familiar types of disease attacks on plants’ leaves are alternative
    of viruses and fungoid diseases. As for proper growth of plants and crops, the
    geographical conditions are required 15–20 °C for spraying time, and 20–26 °C
    for maturing and picking with rainfall around 75–100 cm. The growing rate of population
    and advanced conditions of climate also cause harm to plant diseases. Now, the
    main cultivation in India is groundnut, cotton, fish, species, livestock, etc.
    For this, various methods of cultivation have been used like livestock farming,
    arable farming, nomadic farming, sustainable farming, and mixed farming. Livestock
    farming is best for employment and waste which gets activated by animals is used
    as natural manure for the maintenance of soil fertility as agriculture enables
    a large number of quantities of grains and other foodstuffs, and arable farming
    is used for the production of crops that include various types of crops from the
    growth of plants it also produces an extensive range of yearly crops the annual
    crops means total life cycle of the crops from germination to grain production
    enclosed by 12 months. Nomadic farming is a type of primary sustainable farming,
    nomadic live in arid and semiarid parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in Africa
    nomadic herd cattle, goats, sheep, camels, and other animals managed by nomadic
    including horses, mux-oxen, yaks; mixed farming is used to involve growing crops
    and raise of livestock. Thus, pesticides take an essential role in the production
    of food and the pesticide industry had done contribution in 2018 of over 6.75
    billion and the Indian industry cultivated 9%, the investment is evaluated at
    16.7 million. Although there are various types of pesticides used in farming like
    rodenticides larvicides, overuse of fertilizers and pesticides affects soil organisms
    that are similar to humans overworked with antibiotics. For example, plants may
    depend on different types of microorganisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into
    nitrates, which plants can use. As per the Indian government, 40% land about 150
    billion corrupted. As in agricultural generation, 25% of land gets degraded and
    the soil carbon, nitrous oxide exists the atmosphere. Once there, they can infect
    plants and animals ranging from favorable microorganisms, insects, fish, and birds.
    The detection can be done by using plants leaf, temperature, gas sensor, humidity,
    and soil moisture readings will be received from the sensors. Now, in the advanced
    period of agriculture epoch of Industry 4.0 faces many objections, and IoT with
    automation is used for the fulfillment of “Automatic disease detection to monitor
    the plant health for various plants leaf using image processing techniques and
    TensorFlow algorithm.” 1.1 Literature Review The apple leaf disease affects the
    yields of apples; they show a detecting process in real time and a deep learning
    approach on CNN detection of leaves of brown spots, gray spots, and mosaics [1].
    In this paper, they have discussed and used the technology of bacteria foraging
    algorithm, image segmentation, and neural network. The image processing is done
    for processing of leaf images by using methods like soft computing and conventional
    method [2]. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus on growth and development of blast
    resistance is used and examined all rice types which were sensitive root colonization
    by AM fungus [3]. This paper shows plant detection of disease in real time that
    is affected using a convolutional neural network for appropriate fertilizers spread
    on the damaged portion of plants. For improving the accuracy of the system, they
    have used a TensorFlow framework; the accuracy is increased by up to 95%. The
    remaining area infected by diseases is calculated by k-means algorithm [3]. In
    this paper, they show the detection of diseases that affect various plants by
    using image processing techniques. As commonly we know farmers spray pesticides
    on the plants but also affect humans directly and indirectly through health issues
    or any other [4]. This paper uses the technology of ML and processing of image
    to allow the viral disease from the snaps of leaf, and this method identifies
    the injury of potato leaf disease. Their segmentation approaches the utilization
    by using multiclass SVM [5]. The algorithm has used deep learning network for
    detection of tobacco plants in photos captured by using unmanned aerial vehicles.
    This algorithm has three stages the primary stage with morphological and watershed
    segmentation, the second is convolutional neural network is assembled and train
    with tobacco plant region and the third part is post-processing are performed
    to discard the non-tobacco plant [6]. This paper uses forest in identifying plant
    disease between healthy and disease plants for extracting the features of the
    image. This is used by using the trained dataset to detect the virus by using
    ML technology [7]. They have used a data augmentation technique that has been
    used to do the deviation of the leaf photos in dataset. As they have also used
    the CNN model for image classification, the accuracy is 98.56% [8]. This paper
    shows about image detector and the resource-constrained using a convolutional
    network implemented in a low-cost, platform to perform the types of plant infection
    [9]. In this paper, they discussed current trends and challenges for plant leaf
    disease using deep learning method using a k-means clustering algorithm [10].
    This paper shows the present surveys on current techniques and prediction models
    for the validation and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases based on image processing
    and the IoT for the verification and various types of tomato plant diseases [7].
    They show leaf diseases that can be effectively used to detect the leaves of plants
    but the unhealthy plants that we get are unbalanced that’s why it is difficult
    to detect the diseases from the unhealthy plant''s dataset for solving this they
    have used double GAN to generate higher-resolution pictures of unhealthy plants
    leaf using samples [11]. 2 Methodology First of all, the robot system will start
    activating and it will move into the farm for taking photos; it will check the
    height of plants; if it''s too low, then the mechanism will spray the fertilizers
    for the proper growth of plants; if the height is proper, then it will again go
    for taking photos for detection of insects on plants; if any parasitic detected,
    then it will spray pesticides on the affected portion of plants and send alert
    message to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Flowchart for prototype device Full size
    image Algorithm Used for Plants Disease Detection: TensorFlow: It is a library
    of Python language used for rapid arithmetic calculations, and it can also create
    models of hierarchical learning exactly. This model detects leaf spot diseases
    and also predicts healthy leaves. The TensorFlow algorithm also uses a neural
    network for training the image classification model. The TensorFlow should be
    run on single central processing unit as well as on graphic processing unit and
    mobile devices. The used dataset is used in training and testing of dataset 1000
    from that 700 images of plants are used for training and remaining 300 images
    are uses for testing. The dataset is identified across the model for the procedure
    of building to escape overfitting. The tested dataset is independent for the training
    set. The test dataset is used to identify the performance of model or accuracy
    of model, and the images of plants classify leaves based on the below parts: Healthful
    part: In this case, the plants’ leaves are healthy and show no symptoms of bacteria
    or infections of any kind (change in color, of leaves, etc.) Bacteria part: In
    this, the bacterial spots are identified, and therefore, the system gives alert
    message to farmer. Viral part: In this case, the color of leaves gets changed
    due to DNA virus that’s why it changes the color. Late Blight part: In this part,
    the harmful plants infection especially affects rice. 2.1 Block Diagram Figure
    2 shows systematic diagram for the observation of farms as the Esp32 module is
    used to collect all data from sensors like LDR. Various sensors are used in the
    farm like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and gas sensor. As temperature
    sensor is useful while growing the crops which needs wet and dry climatic conditions,
    the temperature sensor measures the presence of heat energy of the soil and also
    determines whether it is good for plants growth. If the temperature rises high
    in the farm, then it causes erosion to the cultivation of yields. If temperature
    is too low on the farm, then it decreases the plant''s enzymes and it causes to
    stunt growth or may cause it to die. The humidity sensor is used for controlling
    and monitoring [12] the humidity as well as the air temperature of the farm. As
    if humidity arises high, then plants get to die and crops get fail. If it arises
    low, then the growth of plants takes more time for the growth and smaller leaves
    get to drop off and the quality of plants is not so good. The moisture sensor
    is used for the capacity of water level of soil and also for good irrigation management
    which gives better crops and increases the profit of the farmer as well as the
    land; if the moisture level is too low in the farm, then plants may not mature
    and they may die. So for the betterment of crops and plants, normally 21–40% of
    moisture level is required. The gas sensor is used on the farm for how much amount
    of gas is present in the farm and environment or if anyone tries to spread petroleum
    in the farm at that time this sensor senses it and gives an alert message to the
    farmer; due to this, our farm can be saved due to unwanted gas spread. The DC
    motor is used in the farm as it plays a necessary part in the farm for scanning
    plants vertically and horizontally for the detection and monitoring of the plant''s
    health if the disease gets detected the LCD will display all the desired conditions.
    And servomotor is used for spraying the pesticides on the affected portion of
    the plant this mechanism is inserted in the robot if any insect is detected, then
    the mechanism will start and spray the pesticides. The water pump is used if the
    moisture of the soil gets low, then water pump will start by triggering the relay.
    If moisture level is too high, then off the water pump. Thus, all the data will
    be sent to on new technology of Blynk cloud to show the data in real time and
    a power supply is provided to all the sensors for proper working and giving the
    results. As in greenhouse automation [13], they used the old Blynk technology
    for controlling the greenhouse system including soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of observing farmland Full size image 3 Design
    Implementation The working implementation consists of various parts, processing
    which is defined below: A. Collection of Dataset The analysis depends on the detection
    of affected leaf; [14] I have collected a dataset from an agricultural institution.
    This dataset has images of various disease-affected plants [15] . I organized
    to collect pictures of various types of infection indication. They are apple black
    dots, grape spot, maize gray dots, tomato mosaic virus, and peach bacterial spot
    [16]. One of the most frequent diseases is in apple plants which may be increased
    by fungi. Podosphaera leucotricha is the black spot as its name shows with black
    spots seen on the surface of the leaves. Grape leaf spot shows about fungus Phomopsis
    viticola, and maximal is determined the most critical disease of grapes [17].
    Gray spot on corn results on top side. Yellow spots are viewed on another side
    of white disease wrapping the inner part of a leaf. Tomato mosaic virus is mostly
    known as plant pathogenic [18]. The number of images collected from diseases is
    shown in the table (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Fig. 3 Table on plants diseases Full size
    image Fig. 4 Various leaves [19] affected by unwanted pesticides Full size image
    Fig. 5 Boxplot on the affected area of the plants (leaf) Full size image 4 Future
    Scope It is used in the animal shed for monitoring domestic animals. It will help
    the farmers to do work in any season and conditions [20, 21] . It reduces the
    time consumed in spraying the pesticides [22]. It works very effectively, and
    it will reduce the danger to farmers [23] from different breathing and physical
    problems. This model is used for the detection of various types of plants disease
    [24]. This system is used for multiple types of plants health and disease. 5 Conclusion
    The agriculture field needs automation in large amounts to make the human work
    easy, [25] and the agriculture [26] hanging robot [27] has been designed for monitoring
    the farm weather (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and also plants health;
    thus, system will go detection of insects [28] if any found the system will spray
    pesticides only on the affected portion of plants. By using this technology, there
    will be less time consumed and I can protect the farm as well as plants from unwanted
    pesticides. This proposed model is designed for the detection and quality of leaves
    by using different types of sensors like temperature, humidity, gas sensor, and
    soil moisture sensor. The purpose device is used whether the device is healthy
    or diseased. 6 Software Testing See Figs. 6, 7, and 8. Fig. 6 Monitoring the farm
    by using Blynk cloud Full size image Fig. 7 Blynk app results in real time Full
    size image Fig. 8 Visuino results for temperature and humidity Full size image
    7 Hardware Testing Figure 9 shows the output results of the farm on LCD as ESP32
    is the controller module of IoT as to help the farmers and send the data on cloud.
    In this project, I have used various sensors like DHT11, gas sensor also soil
    moisture; apart from these, I have also used water pumps for the proper nourishment
    of crops health. Although these all sensors have been used for monitoring, the
    farm and sensors give values on LCD in real-time mode [29, 30] . Thus, the proposed
    system also gives suggestion to the farmers for the betterment of farm and how
    to get rid of plants diseases by applying the appropriate amount of fertilizers
    and pesticides. Fig. 9 Output results of the farm on LCD Full size image References

  description: This paper gives the idea of solving some of the problems faced by
    farmers. The population rate of the world is growing rapidly and will double in
    the coming decades and the need of food is also increasing simultaneously. To
    meet this rapid growth in demand for food, automation in agriculture is the best
    solution. The aim of this paper is to design and develop an automated system to
    monitor the various conditions of soil and moisture on the crops, and the proper
    supply of water, which affects the crops [5]. Such a system will contain sensors,
    a pump and a device called a humidifier, and various advanced techniques like
    IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The technical field is racing
    to provide more optimum solutions. The incorporation of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide enough
    scope to predicrocess, analyze situations and improve activities in a real-time
    situation. Green House is one of the best solutions as the crops can be grown
    in a controlled climate without the natural environmental conditions. In the last
    few decades there has been a huge advancement in technology for agriculture, with
    the help of technology we can help farmers for increasing their rate of yielding.
    With this, we can overcome the major problems of farmers. This small processor-based
    unit can be used to control anything from a fan, air- conditioner, humidifier,
    and watering system from 4 relay outputs. A temperature and humidity range can
    be set to control relay outputs. The main focus of this paper is to implement
    the Internet of Things (IoT) in the monitoring of humidity, soil condition, temperature,
    supply of water to the field, level of water, environmental condition, etc. The
    IoT-based Smart agriculture System being planned via this paper is integrated
    with different Sensors.

    by farmers. The population rate of the world is growing rapidly and will double
    in the coming decades and the need of food is also increasing simultaneously.
    To meet this rapid growth in demand for food, automation in agriculture is the
    best solution. The aim of this paper is to design and develop an automated system
    to monitor the various conditions of soil and moisture on the crops, and the proper
    supply of water, which affects the crops [5]. Such a system will contain sensors,
    a pump and a device called a humidifier, and various advanced techniques like
    IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The technical field is racing
    to provide more optimum solutions. The incorporation of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide enough
    scope to predicrocess, analyze situations and improve activities in a real-time
    situation. Green House is one of the best solutions as the crops can be grown
    in a controlled climate without the natural environmental conditions. In the last
    few decades there has been a huge advancement in technology for agriculture, with
    the help of technology we can help farmers for increasing their rate of yielding.
    With this, we can overcome the major problems of farmers. This small processor-based
    unit can be used to control anything from a fan, air-conditioner, humidifier,
    and watering system from 4 relay outputs. A temperature and humidity range can
    be set to control relay outputs. The main focus of this paper is to implement
    the Internet of Things (IoT) in the monitoring of humidity, soil condition, temperature,
    supply of water to the field, level of water, environmental condition, etc. The
    IoT-based Smart agriculture System being planned via this paper is integrated
    with different Sensors. Topics Sensors, Pedology, Internet of things, Artificial

  explanation: 'Wireless soil moisture sensing has several environmental benefits,
    including: reduced water waste from overwatering, reduced chemical runoff from
    excess irrigation, and increased crop yield and quality. These benefits are primarily
    due to moisture sensors allowing for accurate and on-demand irrigation based on
    real-time soil moisture data.'

    Most crops require the right amount of water at the right time. Water stress or
    excessive irrigation can lead to quality issues. Considering apple as an example,
    water stress can attribute to bitter pits (black dots), reduced fruit size, reduced
    sugar content, and low crop yield [7]. On the other hand, excessive watering can
    cause soil-borne diseases and rots, contribute to poor fruit quality, and can

    Based on Sensor Networks Chapter © 2016 Introduction Agricultural practice has
    significantly transformed over the last two decades from being labor intensive
    to a high-tech industry driven by automation and smart farming [1]. A notable
    example is the application of soil moisture sensing for on demand irrigation [2].
    By measuring soil moisture and other parameters in real time such as weather condition,
    nutrient level in soil, and crop health, farmers can optimize their irrigation
    systems. Real-time soil moisture sensing for on demand irrigation can result in
    over 30% reduction in water consumption [3, 4]. In addition to water saving, there
    are many additional benefits including improved crop yield and quality as well
    as lower run off, soil erosion, and nutrient loss. Efficient irrigation is essential
    to sustainable farming, especially when water resource is variable and scarce
    [2]. On-demand irrigation can also deliver benefits beyond water saving. Agricultural
    run-off from excessive irrigation is a major source of water pollution, especially
    in large-scale crop operation [5]. For example, agriculture run-off from sugarcane
    farms along Queensland’s coastline in Australia is a major contributing factor
    to degrading and poor health of the Great Barrier Reef [6] in recent years. Accordingly,
    the Australian Marine Conservation Society has identified run-off reduction as
    an effective pollution prevention method among a suit of measures to restore the
    Great Barrier Reef. Accurate and on demand irrigation improves crop yield and
    quality. Most crops require the right amount of water at the right time. Water
    stress or excessive irrigation can lead to quality issues. Considering apple as
    an example, water stress can attribute to bitter pits (black dots), reduced fruit
    size, reduced sugar content, and low crop yield [7]. On the other hand, excessive
    watering can cause soil-borne diseases and rots, contribute to poor fruit quality,
    and can prevent the trees from absorbing necessary minerals. Inadequate or excessive
    irrigation can also increase crop susceptibility to disease and reduce its capacity
    to recover from extreme weather. Real-time soil moisture sensing has been successfully
    integrated with irrigation systems, but only for perennial crops [7, 8]. These
    are crops that can grow back after harvesting; thus, they do not need to be replanted
    each year. There is no or limited need for soil tilling; thus, the ground is not
    severely disturbed. There is also designated track for farm machinery and equipment
    to avoid damage to the crop. Thus, it is economical and convenient to deploy a
    wired soil moisture sensing network. On-demand irrigation can deliver even more
    benefit to annual crops since they tend to require more water with larger variation
    during their life cycle. However, a wired soil moisture sensing network is not
    suitable for annual crop as the frequent tillage is required and there is no designated
    track for farm equipment. Wiring and underground moisture sensors are likely be
    damaged when tilling. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development
    of wireless soil moisture sensing for smart agriculture [9]. Major challenges
    to commercial realization of wireless soil moisture sensing are equipment cost
    and more importantly the ability to wirelessly power the sensors and data transmission
    equipment. The former is achievable through volume production and further optimization.
    The latter will soon be feasible with significant progress in wireless power transfer
    (WPT). WPT is the process of transmitting electrical energy from a power source
    to an electrical load at a distance away across an air gap or soil. WPT has been
    used known for a long time. Nikola Tesla pioneered the transmission of electrical
    energy without wires in 1899 with the Tesla coil experiment. Since Tesla’s pioneering
    work, multiple WPT technologies have been developed and undergone substantial
    advancement. This review aims to guide future research for developing and deploying
    wireless soil moisture sensing for on-demand irrigation. Common methods for soil
    moisture sensing were reviewed to select those that are suitable for wireless
    sensing in terms of power consumption and integration. Technologies for wireless
    charging or power supply are also critically analyzed and discussed. Information
    and data corroborated from this review will guide future research and commercialization
    efforts. Moisture Sensing Technologies A range of techniques that can be used
    to measure soil moisture content have been developed, such as ground-penetrating
    radar, near-infrared reflectance, tensiometers, and dielectric methods. They rely
    on the measurement of specific physical or chemical properties of soil for calculating
    the moisture content. Figure 1 summarizes methods that have been used or are potentially
    suitable for in situ real-time soil moisture measurement. Thus, this review focuses
    specifically on measurement techniques in Fig. 1 and their potential for wireless
    soil moisture sensing applications. Fig. 1 Methods for in situ real-time soil
    moisture measurement Full size image Tensiometer A tensiometer is a device to
    measure the potential of soil to absorb water in pressure, which can then be used
    to determine soil moisture content. A typical tensiometer consists of a water-filled
    tube for insertion into the soil. There is a porous cup at the end of the tube
    to release water into the soil (Fig. 2). As the water potential inside the cup
    equals that of the outside soil, the surface tension (in negative pressure) can
    be registered on the pressure gauge. The registered pressure value reflects the
    potential of soil to absorb water—the higher the reading, the drier the soil,
    and the lower soil moisture content. The pressure gauge can be electronically
    monitored for real-time measurement of soil moisture content [10]. Tensiometers
    are widely used by farmers as handheld devices to determine watering schedule.
    They have a narrow range and are most useful when the soil is not too dry or wet.
    While reading from the pressure gauge can be digitized for data transmission,
    tensiometers are not usually used for remote soil moisture sensing because of
    the need to add water to the device and poor battery life. In addition, tensiometers
    use absorbing material or water to measure the granular pressure, and these substances
    must be dried to perform another measurement in the same location. Therefore,
    it will take a long time until another accurate measurement can be made and cannot
    be used for in situ monitoring. Most of the low-price tensiometers in the market
    also have long measurement time, which is not ideal for continuous monitoring.

    probe; c thermal pulse method; d TD method; e impedance method; f SWR method;
    g FDR method; h capacitance method; i resistance method Full size image Neutron
    Probe and Gamma-Ray Method Neutron thermalization can be used to measure soil
    moisture content. In this method, low-level radiation in the form of neutrons
    is emitted to the soil. These neutrons then collide with the hydrogen atoms in
    water and deaccelerate, forming a slow neutron cloud, which can be detected by
    a neutron probe (Fig. 2b). With a similar approach, soil moisture content can
    also be measured by a gamma ray. Energy loss from a gramma ray due to scattering
    and absorption in soil can be correlated to the moisture content. Both neutron
    and gamma-ray probes offer accurate measurement of soil moisture content with
    no hysteresis. There have been studies successfully developing the neutron probe
    as a wireless device for remote sensing [11]. However, neutron and gamma-ray probes
    are expensive and strictly regulated due to the radioactive source used to emit
    the neutrons. Thus, this technique is not suitable for most commercial operations
    where highly accurate soil moisture content measurement is not required and the
    ability to comply with radioactive material usage is limited. Thermal Pulse Method
    When the moisture content changes, the heat conductivity profile of the soil also
    changes. Thus, soil moisture content can be obtained by measuring the transient
    change of temperature in the soil. A thermal moisture sensor can be simple; it
    includes a heating element to generate heat pulses and a sensing probe that observes
    the change in the soil temperature caused by the heat pulse (Fig. 2c). Thermal
    moisture sensors offer a cost-effective, compact-size solution for in situ monitoring.
    In addition, thermal moisture sensors are not dependent on the soil salinity,
    resulting in much more reliable results within their sensitivity zone with proper
    calibration. However, the energy consumption per measurement of the thermal sensor
    is significant at about 59.4 Ws [12] and low response time [13]. Dielectric Method
    The soil matrix contains three key components, namely, water, air, and soil itself
    with very different dielectric constants (80, 1, and 4, respectively). Thus, changes
    in soil moisture content can be determined by measuring changes in soil dielectric
    constant. There are several techniques to measure the soil dielectric constant;
    they are time domain (TD), frequency domain reflectometry (FDR), capacitive, impedance,
    and standing wave ratio (SWR) methods. Devices using these techniques are collectively
    called dielectric soil moisture sensors. They are reliable, cost-effective, accurate,
    and easy to be integrated into a remote soil moisture monitoring network. Time
    Domain Method Time domain (TD) sensor consists of a parallel metallic sensor probe
    with the length \\(L\\), connected to a coaxial cable with a signal generator
    and an oscillator as in Fig. 2d. An electromagnetic signal is generated and travels
    along the coaxial cable to the sensor probe and the travel time of the wave in
    the probe will be measured. Depending on how this parameter is being captured,
    time domain sensors are divided into two types: time domain transmission (TDT)
    and time domain reflectometry (TDR). TDT method measures the travel time from
    one end to another end of the probe while TDR method measures the time difference
    between incident wave and reflected wave at the connector of the probe. It is
    proportional to the length of sensor probe \\(L\\) and the soil dielectric constant.
    The main advantage of the TD method is a very short response time with high reliability
    since it is less dependent on the soil matrix. TD sensor size can be reduced to
    3 cm in length while maintaining the fast response time and high reliability [14].
    Moreover, the sensor might fail in a high salinity soil profile, where the reflected
    wave will be attenuated. Impedance Method Working on the same principle of capturing
    the reflecting phenomenon that happened due to impedance mismatch like the TD
    method, impedance spectroscopy captures the reflection and transmission coefficients
    of the incident wave (Fig. 2e). The soil is usually put in a well-constructed
    fixture with defined properties so it can be easily de-embedded from the measured
    result. The whole fixture then got analyzed by a Vector Network Analyzer, capturing
    the scattering parameter including \\({S}_{11}\\) as reflection coefficients and
    \\({S}_{12}\\) as transmission coefficients [15]. By evaluating the system in
    impedance spectroscopy, conductivity profile of the soil is also derived, and
    the nutrient state (such as nitrate level) can also be estimated. However, this
    system is not suitable for integration on such embedded soil moisture sensor.
    The impedance method requires complicated computational and calibration process,
    a high-speed microprocessor, and a data logger. Therefore, this method is mostly
    used in the laboratory and are not ideal for field measurement. Standing Wave
    Ratio Method Standing wave ratio (SWR) method measures the reflection coefficient
    and impedance indirectly from the standing wave formed due to reflection happened
    on the transmission line as illustrated in Fig. 2f [16, 17]. The signal on both
    ends of the coaxial line is captured then passes through an amplifier for ease
    of reading. Then, an equivalent impedance of the load (which includes the soil
    as a whole) can be calculated. It is directly influenced by the change of the
    soil permittivity which means that obtaining the soil moisture content is feasible.
    The SWR method has a fast response time and a simple structure. However, since
    signal is already deviated after passing the amplifier, the SWR method is inferior
    compared to other dielectric-based methods in term of accuracy [18]. Frequency
    Domain Reflectometry Method Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR)–based sensor
    measures the change in resonant frequency of a circuit consisting of a capacitance
    embedded in the soil as described in Fig. 2g. The capacitor C is buried into the
    soil so that the soil acts as the medium between two plates of capacitor. Cautious
    installation is required to avoid air gap between the capacitor electrode and
    the soil medium. This air gap might affect the capacitor value if it is not carefully
    taken care of. This capacitor is then connected to an oscillator to form a tuning
    circuit. The equivalent resonant frequency is then captured by a high-frequency
    detector circuit. This resonant frequency is dependent on the capacitor value,
    which is proportional to the dielectric constant of the soil trapped between electrodes.
    The FDR-based sensor is extremely sensitive to the soil texture [19, 20], requiring
    specific calibration. Compared to TD, FDR offers high accuracy [21] with lower
    price. Capacitance Method Moisture sensors based on the capacitance method can
    be developed at a very low cost (Table 2). The capacitance method determines the
    soil moisture content through an output DC voltage signal. It includes a capacitor,
    which is embedded into the soil with careful installation to avoid the airgap
    as mentioned in FDR method, connected to an external resistor (Fig. 2h). Then,
    a square wave voltage is applied across the circuit, resulting in a deformation
    in output signal. The amplitude and deformation of this output depend on the value
    of the capacitor; therefore, the soil moisture content can be easily obtained
    by measuring the root-mean-square voltage of this signal. The capacitance method
    has lower accuracy compared to most other dielectric methods. However, the capacitance
    method is more energy efficient and simple for onboard integration. It can be
    printed directly onto a small circuit board about 9.8 × 2.3 cm (SEN0193 from DFRobot)
    for soil moisture measurement. Resistance Method The change in soil moisture content
    leads to the change in the conductivity profile of the soil overall; taking advantage
    of such property, resistance sensor measures the soil resistance between two electrodes
    (Fig. 2i). It usually consists of a pair of electrodes embedded into the soil
    or into granular matrix to improve accuracy. This is connected to another resistor
    with an input analogue voltage source to form a voltage divider circuit. The soil
    moisture content is obtained from the measured output voltage of the resistance
    of the sensor. Providing a measurement at an incredibly low price, this method,
    however, has the least precision above all. Moreover, corrosion is inevitable
    since a constant DC voltage is applied across the electrodes, causing them to
    produce electrolyte. Resistance sensor is mainly used in simple irrigation system
    for its convenience connecting to off-the-shelf hardware, such as Arduino board
    [22], where it only requires the relative indication of soil moisture content.
    Requirements of In Situ Wireless Soil Moisture Sensing In a network for soil moisture
    sensing, in addition to efficiently measure and collect data, there are several
    other aspects for consideration. This section will discuss the compatibility of
    each type of sensor with network construction regarding the complexity, accuracy,
    price, and power efficiency. Of all methods described above, dielectric sensor
    provides a suitable level of accuracy and sufficient response time for real-time
    monitoring of soil moisture (Table 1). As described in “Dielectric Method” section,
    there are several variances of the dielectric moisture sensor family including
    the TD, impedance, SWR, FDR, and capacitive sensors. They complement each other
    in performance depending on the soil matrix and actual application. For example,
    compared to other methods, the TD method is characterized by relatively high accuracy
    [23] and suitable to be deployed in agricultural crop; however, its utilization
    in other circumstance such as extreme saline soil is questionable [24]. On the
    other hand, the FDR sensor can be used in highly saline soil but requires soil
    specific calibration [19, 20]. Compared to TD and FDR sensors, capacitance sensor
    has lower accuracy, but it is low cost, compact, and can be suitable for real-time
    moisture monitoring where a moderate level of accuracy can be tolerated. Table
    1 Soil moisture sensing methodologies resumes for on-demand irrigation purpose
    Full size table It is desirable for underground moisture sensors to be wirelessly
    connected in a network to reduce cost and avoid damage during tilling. Therefore,
    a low power consumption is essential. In addition, because many sensors are deployed
    in the network, the cost of individual sensor must also be low. Table 2 summarizes
    the power consumption and cost of key dielectric methods for soil moisture sensing.
    Most of the available dielectric-based sensors have moderate energy consumption;
    therefore, they are very compatible in a wireless moisture sensor network. The
    TD and FDR methods are highly accurate (error of < 3%) but can be expensive. Capacitance-based
    sensors have the lowest cost. Thus, capacitance sensor appears to be most suitable
    for a large soil moisture monitoring network. Table 2 Commercial dielectric-based

    manual and technical specification of the manufacturers) Full size table Power
    Supply Solution for Wireless Underground Moisture Sensing In current on-demand
    irrigation systems, moisture sensors are buried underground, and the measured
    information is transmitted via wire to an above ground data hub. However, the
    data hub and wiring can be damaged during soil tilling; thus, this approach is
    only suitable for perennial crops. On the other hand, wireless underground moisture
    sensor can be used for any crops because no wiring is required. Each underground
    system sensor consists of a moisture sensor, memory, central processing unit,
    wireless transceiver, antennas, and a power supply. There are two main challenges
    including power supply and cost in wireless underground sensor. In this section,
    potential solutions for power supply at a low cost are reviewed and discussed.
    Underground sensors use batteries or must be wirelessly powered. Retrieving these
    sensors for battery replacement is impractical since they are buried underground.
    Extending the underground wireless sensor’s lifetime is challenging. Current practice
    involves wire connection of these sensors to above ground power supply units,
    such as battery or photovoltaic array (Fig. 3a). The current practice is not suitable
    in many agriculture applications as these units obstruct agricultural activities
    and are vulnerable to the weather. Therefore, a self-powered solution based on
    wireless power transfer (WPT) technology is a potential solution to maintain lifetime
    of underground sensor. As an alternative, the energy transmitter for recharging
    can be attached to a mobile robot (Fig. 3b) or an unmanned aerial vehicle [33••].
    The receiver of the WPT system can be enclosed in the device (Fig. 3b), which
    is more durable and robust compared to above-ground power supply units. The WPT
    solution is more flexible. By contrast, the photovoltaic charging is weather dependent,
    might be impractical under dense tree canopy, and requires regular servicing and
    attention. In most cases, energy consumption by the sensor per measurement is
    less than 300 mW (Table 2). Energy consumption by the microcontroller and data
    transmission is negligible at < 10 mW.s per data package as the system is only
    powered for less than a second to complete the transmission event [34]. Fig. 3
    Power supply solution for wireless underground sensing devices. a Photovoltaic
    charging, b WPT Full size image Current WPT technologies may already be viable
    for underground wireless sensor nodes. Robinson et al. [35•] utilized soil as
    a conductive medium to deliver the current between the electrodes of the transmitter
    and the receiver. Although the power is transferred in multiple directions over
    several meters, the excessive optimal depth of the deeper electrode pair (76.2
    and 106.68 m) results in a bulky design. A 13.56-MHz WPT system using inductive
    coupling to power a receiver located at 20 cm underground is designed in [33••].
    This system can supply 8.61 kJ in 30 min with 33.5% efficiency for fast charging
    the supercapacitor module. However, the lack of misalignment solution in [33••]
    leads in a drop of WPT efficiency in terms of coupling coefficient, which lengthens
    the charging time to roughly 100 min when the precise location of the sensor is
    unknown. Arimi et al. [36•] presented a metamaterial absorber performing both
    sensing and RF energy harvesting tasks. Two rectifiers working at 625 and 500
    MHz, which are the absorption frequencies at the minimum and maximum soil moisture
    content (5 and 25%), are added to supply power for transmitters to send the alert
    signal when the soil moisture content is outside of the acceptable range. Although
    the proposed design can utilize the electromagnetic power available in the environment,
    it can only send data when the soil moisture content is at fixed values (5 and
    25%). Annual crop has a shallow root zone of 30 to 120 cm depth. There remain
    some technical challenges such as low and variable energy transfer efficiency
    especially through soil and rock of different water content and large distance.
    Although operating at high frequency is an effective method to increase the transfer
    distance while maintaining the same transmitter and receiver size of WPT [37],
    the attenuation is greater at higher frequencies [38]. When the electromagnetic
    wave propagates from air to a depth of 30 cm underground and the soil moisture
    content is 5%, pathloss is 81 dB at the frequency of 915 MHz (typical frequency
    of far-field WPT), while it is significantly lower (35 dB) at frequency of 6.78
    MHz (typical frequency of near-field WPT). The trade-off between transfer distance
    and frequency must be considered to enhance the performance of the WPT system.
    Besides, the soil profile also has a big impact on the WPT systems. More specifically,
    the change in the medium such as moisture content or salinity content is varied
    due to weather conditions and the plant nutrient plan. The rise in soil water
    content will lead to an increase of the medium permittivity and therefore resulting
    very high pathloss [38]. The excessive ion content also makes the soil profile
    conductive, resulting in the attenuation of the signal overall. Pathloss is considerably
    higher (95 dB at 915 MHz and 42 dB at 6.78 MHz) when the soil moisture content
    is saturated (60%). Therefore, this worst-case scenario needs to be considered
    to prevent failed performance of the system. Multiple WPT approaches have been
    applied to charge underground sensors. Each approach has its own benefits and
    drawbacks. In the following paragraphs, two basic types of WPT, radiative and
    non-radiative power transfer, are discussed to point out the most suitable for
    powering underground sensor networks. Radiative Wireless Power Transfer In radiative
    WPT or far-field WPT, the receiving antenna is in the far-field region of the
    transmitting antenna. The RF power is received by the receiving antenna and then
    converted to DC power by a rectifier circuit to supply the load. The WPT can be
    omnidirectional or directional depending on the radiation pattern of the transmitting
    antenna [39]. Omnidirectional transmitting antenna allows receivers to receive
    power from any position and orientation; it is the key factor causing the extremely
    low efficiency of the omnidirectional radiation pattern type WPT system. The efficiency
    is only around 1.5% at the distance of 30 cm [40]. It is further decreased if
    the power is transferred through the ground due to high-frequency pathloss (81
    dB at the frequency of 915 MHz when the depth is 30 cm and soil moisture content
    is 5%). Moreover, the transmitted power is limited to avoid adverse effects on
    the human body. As a result, this method cannot supply adequate power for underground
    wireless sensor nodes and may only be suitable for in the air WPT applications
    where the required power is in the milliwatt range. Another type is directional
    WPT with higher efficiency in the desired direction (compared with omnidirectional
    WPT) because the radiated power is focused in only one direction. Based on the
    operating frequency, directional WPT can be divided into microwave power transfer
    (MPT) and laser power transfer (LPT). In MPT, the DC power is converted to RF
    power and fed to the transmitting antenna, and then radiated toward the receiver.
    At the receiving side, the RF power collected by the receiving antenna is rectified
    and supplied to the load. In several works [41,42,43], the rectifier circuit is
    integrated with the receiving antenna, which is called “rectenna.” Although the
    efficiency of MPT is higher than that of omnidirectional radiative WPT, it is
    typically less than 10% [44,45,46]. The efficiency is governed by five factors:
    DC-RF efficiency, transmitting antenna efficiency, transmission efficiency, receiving
    antenna efficiency, and RF-DC efficiency (Fig. 4a). Each of these elements must
    be improved to increase overall efficiency. In the transmitting section, phased
    array antenna is widely used for directional radiation, where the phase and amplitude
    of the RF power fed to each element of the antenna array are determined to broadcast
    the microwave beam in the desired direction [44, 45]. Considering the receiving
    side, the optimal number of rectenna arrays is calculated to obtain the maximum
    beam collecting efficiency in [41]. Rectifier circuit and rectenna is also interested
    in recent years. The 5.8-GHz rectifier circuit with lateral GaN Schottky diode
    proposed in [46] can achieve 71% RF-DC efficiency. Dong et al. [42] presented
    a high-efficiency rectifying surface using sub-wavelength resonant elements with
    the highest RF-DC efficiency of 66.5% at 55-cm transfer distance. Fig. 4 Diagram
    of WPT techniques. a Microwave power transfer; b laser power transfer; c inductive
    power transfer; d magnetic resonant coupling; e capacitive power transfer Full
    size image LPT is an emerging WPT technology in which electric energy is converted
    into a laser beam. A high-intensity laser beam is produced by laser diodes on
    the transmitting side and then guided toward the receiver by a beam director.
    On the receiving side, a photovoltaic array fabricated from appropriate photovoltaic
    cells, which are selected depending on the beam intensity and the laser wavelength,
    transforms energy in the form of laser into electric energy and provides it to
    the load (Fig. 4b). LPT, compared to MPT, has a higher efficient atmospheric propagation
    window and could transmit considerable amounts of power to a tiny receiver [47].
    However, it can be seen from [48,49,50] that the overall efficiency of LPT systems
    is only around 10%. As shown in Table 3, unidirectional radiative WPT technologies
    are able to transfer power up to several hundred watts over a distance up to kilometers
    with the efficiency around 10% in the air. Despite the further decrease in efficiency
    caused by significant pathloss at high frequency (95 dB at 915 Hz and 30-cm transfer
    distance when the soil moisture content is saturated), MPT might supply adequate
    power for underground sensors with an extremely poor efficiency, while it is impracticable
    for LPT due to the terahertz-range operation. In practice, the efficiency is significantly
    lower due to the reflection and scattering of electromagnetic waves in heterogeneous
    transmitting medium caused by the presence of plants, especially in dense fields.
    In addition, MPT and LPT are not suitable for simple, low-cost agricultural systems
    because of their total cost and complicated components such as the RF power generator
    in MPT system or laser power supply, beam director, and PV array in LPT system.
    Table 3 Power transfer performance by current WPT technologies (na: not available)
    Full size table Non-radiative Wireless Power Transfer Non-radiative WPT is used
    to transfer power over a short distance in the frequency range of kilohertz to
    several megahertz with very high efficiency compared to the radiative technique.
    It can be divided into three groups based on the kind of coupling technique used:
    inductive power transfer (IPT), magnetic resonant coupling (MRC), and capacitive
    power transfer (CPT). In IPT, the power is transmitted from the Tx coil to the
    Rx coil via magnetic field (Fig. 4c). The DC power is converted to AC power at
    high frequency by the inverter circuit and delivered to the Tx coil. At the receiving
    side, the Rx coil gets AC voltage at the same frequency. A rectifier circuit then
    converts this AC voltage back to DC voltage before supplying to the load. In order
    to compensate the reactive power, compensation networks comprising lumped inductors
    and capacitors are added at two sides. The IPT system functions similarly to an
    air-core transformer; the leakage inductance is very large. Consequently, the
    efficient transfer distance is typically smaller than the coil diameter [51].
    Park et al. [52] attempted to transfer power over several meters using IPT at
    20 kHz. The coils are 3 m in core length and 1 m in winding length. When the Rx
    coil is 3 m away from the Tx coil, the efficiency is only 29%. However, at short
    transfer distance, IPT system could achieve a relatively high efficiency, which
    is up to more than 90% [53]. IPT can transfer power up to several kilowatts over
    several meters (Table 3). Moreover, due to the lower operating frequency compared
    to radiative WPT, the pathloss is significantly smaller (42 dB at 6.78 MHz compared
    to 95 dB at 915 MHz over 30-cm transfer distance when the soil moisture content
    is saturated). Therefore, IPT can supply enough power for sensors buried at the
    depth of 30–120 cm. Although the effective operating range of IPT is typically
    smaller than the coil diameter, its simplicity and capacity to deliver adequate
    power to Rx located at a few tens of centimeters away from Tx [33••] make it suitable
    for charging WUSN. To overcome the drawback of short efficient transfer distance,
    a special type of IPT called MRC has been developed. In MRC, the intermediate
    coils are utilized to extend the transfer distance (Fig. 4d). These coils are
    tuned to the same resonant frequency by external or parasitic capacitors to form
    resonant tanks, so that the magnetic field is significantly improved. In 2007,
    Kurs et al. [54] pioneered the idea of MRC when using 4-coil system to brighten
    a 60-W light bulb. The system could achieve 40% efficiency over a 2-m transfer
    distance, which is eight times greater than the coil radius. Duong et al. [55]
    regulated the coupling factors between the resonant coil and load coil or source
    coil to achieve the matching condition. The experiment showed that efficiencies
    are developed to 46.2 and 29.3% at distances of 60 and 100 cm, respectively. Moreover,
    a new method but with similar approach to resonate the coil in the WPT system
    was presented in [56]. They utilized three coils to resonate frequency of the
    system: Tx, Rx, and an intermediate coil. It is applied to transfer 150 W at 250
    kHz with 85% efficiency. Similar to IPT, MRC benefits in lower loss compared to
    radiative WPT. Despite the ability of transmitting power up to several kilowatts
    over a distance several times greater than the coil diameter with higher efficiency
    compared to IPT, the increase in the number of coils could lead to the complexity
    and high-cost MRC system. Another type of non-radiative WPT is CPT. In contrast
    to IPT and MRC, which transmit power through magnetic fields, CPT uses electric
    fields to transfer the power from the Tx plates to the Rx plates as can be seen
    from Fig. 4e. Since the two plates of the coupled capacitor are close together,
    the electric field is directed from the positive plate to the negative plate.
    Therefore, CPT has lower electromagnetic interference (EMI) and heat loss caused
    by eddy current. However, due to the loose coupling, CPT can only be utilized
    in applications with very short charging distance, even only a few millimeters.
    Li et al. [57] employed the electric field resonance method, which combines inductive
    coupling and capacitive coupling. The system is similar to a 4-coil WPT system;
    however, the inductive coupling between two resonators is replaced by capacitive
    coupling. A 91% DC–DC efficiency can be achieved over a 17-mm transfer distance.
    Liu et al. [58] presented a matrix-type transmitter to maintain a steady output
    voltage when the position of the receiver varies. However, the efficiency is only
    54% under the maximum coupling when the transfer distance is 0.5 mm. Despite the
    low cost, simple implementation, and low-EMI characteristic, the extremely short
    transfer distance and the requirement of exact alignment between Tx and Rx are
    the primary obstacles to applying CPT for WUSN. Power Based on Wireless Charging
    Methods WPT technologies vary widely in terms of working distance, power transfer
    efficiency, and power density (Table 3). Although WPT has reached technical maturity,
    most research works in the literature employ a resistor as a load instead of an
    actual battery. Therefore, the charging time is not usually explicitly reported.
    Directional radiative WPT benefits in far-distance transmitting, while omnidirectional
    radiative WPT does not require the exact position and direction of the receiver
    (Table 4). Generally, these far-field methods show several limitations: clear
    space between transmitter and receiver, extremely poor efficiency, and the complex
    implementation. Therefore, far-field WPT could not be applied for charging underground
    devices. Table 4 Summary of wireless power transfer and its ability to use in
    WUSN Full size table CPT is unsuitable for underground sensors due to the millimeter-range
    transfer distance and the requirement of alignment between transmitter and receiver.
    MRC is a potential candidate for underground wireless charging. The lower operating
    frequency compared to radiative WPT could reduce the loss caused by reflection
    and absorption when the electromagnetic waves propagate through different media
    (air–soil) or through the soil. The ability to transfer power over a large distance
    that reaches several times the coil size with high efficiency is the greatest
    advantage of MRC. However, the complexity due to the increase in the number of
    coils might result in a bulky and high-cost system. IPT appears to be the most
    suitable option for WPT in a wireless soil moisture sensing network. Although
    IPT has a shorter power transfer range than that of MRC, the system is simple
    and can be used for agricultural applications. IPT could provide sufficient energy
    to power sensors when only a few watts are needed, and efficiency is not the main
    priority. In addition, compared to other WPT technologies, IPT has been developed
    and commercialized for a long time in many applications. In conclusion, IPT is
    the most qualified candidate to supply power for underground sensors in an agricultural
    system. However, this approach presents several challenges. Pathloss is significantly
    higher when the electromagnetic waves propagate over the soil, which is a conducting
    and heterogeneous medium, or through different media (air–soil). This leads to
    a substantial decrease in the efficiency of the WPT system. Besides, the absence
    of precise position information of receivers cause misalignment, which might result
    in unstable output power [59, 60]. Therefore, these issues need to be resolved
    when applying IPT to supply power for wireless sensors embedded in the soil. Future
    Outlook As discussed above, there are two major aspects that need to be considered
    for the development of wireless soil moisture sensors: sensing method and self-powered
    solution. In the process of constructing the sensing network with real-time measurement,
    a low-power-consumption device with acceptable accuracy is favorable; therefore,
    technology such as capacitive sensor is preferred over others. Nevertheless, there
    are a few aspects for further research and development. Capacitive sensor requires
    meticulous installation since insufficient contact surface of the plates will
    lead to dramatic change in measured result. Consequently, careful calibration
    is needed to minimize the effect of improper contact between the soil and the
    capacitor. Moreover, the output signal of the sensor is usually small and poor
    in resolution; thus, a quality post-processing algorithm is recommended to improve
    the precision of measurement. WPT-based IPT has been identified as the most suitable
    option for powering underground wireless sensors. However, there are two remaining
    challenges. First, due to the attenuation of the electromagnetic wave when it
    travels from air to soil, the impact of soil on the system’s performance must
    be comprehensively analyzed to determine the optimal operating parameters. Second,
    existing localization technologies struggle to pinpoint the location of underground
    sensor nodes with centimeter-range accuracy. This may affect the system’s performance
    because of the misalignment between transmitter and receiver. Therefore, further
    research work on misalignment solutions is highly recommended. Conclusions In
    this work, current soil moisture sensing and wireless power transfer technologies
    were reviewed and evaluated. The evaluation focused on the compatibility of the
    methodologies for a wireless underground sensor network to support on-demand irrigation
    for water saving and pollution prevention. Information and data corroborated from
    this study show that capacitive sensor for soil moisture sensing and inductive
    power transfer for wireless charging can be combined for constructing a rechargeable
    underground wireless sensor network. The combination of capacitive sensing and
    inductive power transfer can meet all requirements for an underground wireless
    soil moisture sensing network including affordability, measurement reliability,
    power consumption, ease of wireless charging, and power transfer capability and
    efficiency. This combination is also effective for eliminating waste caused by
    dead sensor nodes and reducing cost while still ensuring adequate accuracy. This
    review also suggests several critical improvements and further research to enhance
    the performance of the proposed wireless soil moisture sensing network. Data Availability

    resistance with 0.99 % change rate after 10,000 cyclic bending tests, enabling
    on-site and non-destructive testing. These plant wearables can be used as a non-invasive,

    sensorHumidity SensorPlant Flexible ElectronicsPlant phenotype; 1. Introduction
    Microclimate plays an intrinsic role in the healthy growth of plants(Holopainen
    and Gershenzon, 2010, Lee et al., 2021). When confronted with abiotic stress,
    plants employ slow and subtle signals in microclimate that are visually imperceptible
    to seek assistance(Chakraborty and Newton, 2011, Li et al., 2021, Zhou et al.,
    2018). Consequently, real-time online monitoring of changes in plant microclimate
    holds significant relevance in aiding plants to cope with stress and facilitating
    early diagnosis of plant diseases(Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010, Kolár and Machácková,
    2005, Mahlein, 2016, Martinelli et al., 2015). However, gaining a comprehensive
    understanding of the mechanisms and interactions between plants and their environment
    has long been challenging for researchers(Bahuguna and Jagadish, 2015). Traditional
    methods used in crop monitoring include rigid temperature and humidity sensors,
    portable soil moisture sensors, and meteorological instruments(Zhao et al., 2019).
    Whereas the rigid configurations of these sensors prevent close integration with
    fragile plants, leading to significant errors and hysteresis in the measurement
    results(Nassar et al., 2018). In addition, the high cost of commercial sensors
    greatly hinders their promotion and application in large fields, and achieving
    accurate control of local microclimates is impossible. Therefore, there is an
    urgent need for low-cost sensing devices that allow for portable and flexible
    in-situ microenvironment monitoring. Flexible plant sensors, characterized by
    their exceptional flexibility, lightweightness, and biocompatibility, enable in-situ,
    fixed-point, and continuous target detection(Yin et al., 2021). Owing to their
    excellent biological safety and mechanical compatibility, flexible sensors can
    fulfill this requirement by being affixed to leaves or positioned in close proximity
    for extended periods without impeding the natural growth of the plant (Westhoff
    et al., 2009). There are many studies have demonstrated the value of flexible
    sensors in plant physiology(Lew et al., 2020, Li et al., 2021, Li et al., 2019,
    Luo et al., 2021, Tang et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2019), crop stress detection
    (Genze et al., 2022), and microclimate parameters monitoring etc (Allen and Pereira,
    2009, Hackenberger et al., 2018, Li et al., 2021, Lu et al., 2020, Nassar et al.,
    2018, Tang et al., 2017). For example, novel plant electronic tattoos have proven
    to be powerful tools for capturing the loss of water content and plant electrical
    signals of objects(Qu et al., 2023); multifunctional integration circuits on substrate
    film have also proven to be reliable tools for monitoring temperature, humidity,
    and illumination in microclimate(Lu et al., 2020); there are even flexible electronics
    that enable active control of plant growth(Li et al., 2022, Qu et al., 2021).
    Consequently, flexible plant sensors are emerging as a promising tool for advancing
    research in intelligent agriculture. In this study, we developed a fabrication
    method for an ultra-thin and lightweight flexible circuit with semi-embedded silver
    and produced various sensors on demand for monitoring plant microclimate. The
    unique semi-embedded construction enhances the flexibility and durability of the
    plant sensors, enabling them to withstand up to 10,000 bending cycles. The temperature
    and humidity sensors produced by this method have excellent operating stability,
    repeatability, and sensitivity and successfully realize on-site continuous monitoring
    of leaf surface temperature and humidity over long periods. In addition, we have
    successfully fabricated semi-embedded flexible printed circuit films (E-FPCF).
    By connecting the micro-chip to various heterogeneous sensing elements, parallel,
    multiple, and continuous monitoring of plant surface temperature and humidity
    is possible. The real-time display and storage of microclimate data can be done
    through a mobile application. This technology provides a comprehensive crop information
    base for plant physiology research and modern agricultural production. By providing
    innovative tools to capture subtle changes in the plant environment, this research
    offers vital techniques to improve our understanding of plant growth mechanisms
    and their interactions with the environment. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Preparation
    of inks Five different dispersants with varying compositions were prepared. We
    take preparation of the 3 wt% hexanol (HA, Aladdin, 99.8 % GC)- polyvinyl pyrrolidone
    solution (PVP, Macklin, Mw. 130,0000, K88-96) dispersant (denoted as HA-PVP) as
    an example. Specifically, 4.5 g of PVP powers was dispersed in 145.5 g of HA solution
    and stirred until the dispersed sample solution became colorless and transparent.
    For the remaining four dispersants, HA was replaced proportionally with methyl
    propanol (PM) (Aladdin, 99.8 % GC) or decanol (CA) (McLean, 99.8 % GC). Then,
    5 g of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) powder (Shanghai Maoguo Nanotechnology Co.,
    Ltd.) with a diameter of 20 nm was dispersant in 2.5 g of the previously prepared
    HA-PVP dispersant solution, using an ultrasonic homogenizer (Sonifer 450D, Bransom,
    1968R,) equipped with a 1/8″-inch flat tip for 20 min at 150 w power. The sample
    solution tube was immersed in a bath of cold water to prevent overheating. 2.2.
    Preparation of semi-embedded flexible films with AgNP-based circuits The design
    circuit patterns were prepared onto immaculate glass plates via screen printing
    (300 mesh). The printed patterns were then coated with Polyimide (PI, Dongguan
    Zhanyang Polymer Material Co.) solution through spin equipment (with operation
    parameters of 2200 rpm for 20 s, Beijing Sedex Electronics Co. KW-4A). The cured
    PI film was achieved by heating in a vacuum oven at 200 °C, −0.88 MPa, for 3 h.
    Subsequently, the glass plate with cured PI film was submerged in deionized water
    for over 10 min to enable the complete detachment of PI film and the transferred
    semi-embedded AgNP circuit from the plate. Then, semi-embedded circuits were placed
    on a heating pad with PI tape, with the exposed side facing upwards. The heating
    pad was then elevated to a temperature of 250 °C and heated in the fume hood for
    24 h. 2.3. Preparation of semi-embedded flexible sensors 2.3.1. Preparation of
    semi-embedded resistive temperature sensors The semi-embedded resistance temperature
    sensor (ERTS) was produced following the procedure outlined in section 2.2, employing
    a 300 μm line width and line spacing. A serpentine electrode pattern was opted
    for the ERTS to provide a broader range of variation and a more sensitive response.
    The ERTS has a total width of 10.84 mm and a length of 17.4 mm. The two circular
    interfaces of the ERTS were respectively connected to 0.1 mm diameter enameled
    wires using commercially available conductive silver paste (Suzhou Beiteli Polymer
    Material Co. SF-1600). Note that the Adhesive A and Adhesive B were stored separately
    before use and mixed evenly in a 3:1 ratio when use it to ensure good adhesion,
    fluidity, and wetness. Cured silver paste at 80 °C for 2 h to provide a good connection
    between the electrode interfaces and the wires. Finally, the sensor was encapsulated
    using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via the tilt leveling method. PDMS is hydrophobic,
    leading to more robust chemical stability for the overall sensor and consolidating
    the conductive silver adhesive soldering. 2.3.2. Preparation of semi-embedded
    capacitive humidity sensors The semi-embedded capacitive humidity sensor (ECHS)
    was prepared by depositing graphene oxide (GO) humidity-sensitive films on a PI
    substrate with an Ag interdigital electrode (IDE). The Ag IDE has 10.3 mm in length,
    0.3 mm in finger width, 0.2 mm in spacing, and 21 in fork number, respectively.
    The GO-sensitive film of uniform thickness was prepared by the drop-casting method,
    and the total film coverage area was 72.33 mm2. Before depositing, the original
    10 mg/mL monolayer GO aqueous dispersion (Hangzhou Gaoyan Technology Co., LTD.)
    was diluted to 1 mg/mL. GO has a carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 7:3, an average radial
    size of 40–50 μm, and a thickness of about 1 nm. 2.3.3. Preparation of semi-embedded
    integrated sensing systems To align the solder joints of the E-FPCF with the exposed
    stencil, the E-FPCF is secured to the clear acrylic circuit board using adhesive
    tape. Then, silver paste was applied to the edges of the stencil to cover the
    E-FPCF evenly. Note that the curing time for the silver paste is 2 h at 80 °C.
    Before installation, it is recommended to clean the chip pins with alcohol to
    ensure that dust particles do not affect the conductivity of the silver paste
    and the final welding strength. After mounting the chip with the visual assembly
    machine (Zhejiang Huaji Zhengbang Automation Technology Co., ZB3245TS-1.1), it
    needs to be heated up again to 80 °C on a heating table or in a dryer to complete
    the soldering between the chip and the E-FPCF. The silica gel (Caster P-2577,
    Fuzhou Huasheng Tongchuang Technology Co.) packages the flexible circuit. Finally,
    the E-FPCF can be cut into sizes of 35 mm × 35 mm. 2.4. Plant microclimate monitoring
    2.4.1. Model crops Plant growth conditions must be strictly controlled in this
    work. The model plants were parameterized according to the required growth conditions
    and certified as pest-free. Considerations should be maintained throughout the
    test: all plants must receive identical light and temperature conditions as the
    growth chamber; all plants should be watered the day before the experiment, and
    the soil should be kept moist throughout the research, avoiding moisture on the
    leaves. Maize (Zea mays L.): The maize variety selected for this experiment was
    ND101. The seedlings were grown in an artificial climate chamber at the Key Laboratory
    of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, China Agricultural University. The ambient
    temperature was 26 ± 1 °C, and the ambient humidity was 47 ± 2 %RH. Both ambient
    temperature and humidity were controlled. Golden brick (Philodendron con-go):
    All golden brick plants were grown at 18–23 °C with 50 mL of water daily, and
    10 g of black soil fertilizer was applied weekly. Gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii Bolus):
    Gerbera is a perennial herb of Datura''s genus in the Asteraceae family. Gerbera
    plants used in the experiment were purchased from Beijing Chaolai Chun Flower
    Market. All green plants were grown at 18–23 °C with 50 mL water daily. Alumroot
    (Heuchera micrantha): Alumroot is a compact, mound-forming perennial boasting
    decorative evergreen rosettes of round, scalloped, reddish leaves. Alumroot plants
    used in the experiment were purchased from Beijing Chaolai Chun Flower Market.
    All green plants were grown at 18–23 °C with 100 mL water weekly. 2.4.2. ERTS
    for temperature changes measuring in plants A four-wire method (Keysight 34,420A
    desktop digital multimeter) was used to measure changes in ERTS resistance, and
    stored data was recorded on a computer in real-time (Keysight BenchVue Software).
    Using the linear relationship between temperature and resistance, the temperature
    change curve caused by the sensor is plotted. 2.4.3. ECHS for humidity changes
    measuring in plants The ECHS was mounted on the leaf, and the GO humidity-sensitive
    film was next to the abaxial side of the leaf. The capacitance was measured using
    a precision LCR meter (Keysight E4980A). The changes in capacitance were recorded
    in real-time by computer software (Keysight UVE) and finally converted into a
    humidity change that was continuously tested on the leaf surface for 15 days.
    2.4.4. Semi-embedded integrated sensor for temperature and humidity measuring
    Medical-grade polyurethane tape affixed the semi-embedded integrated sensor (EIS)
    to the blades. The Sensirion SHT35 (Shenzhen Sensitech Technology Co.), which
    belongs to EISs, has the capability to record temperature and humidity data and
    subsequently send it remotely to a mobile phone application. The test was carried
    out at the South Greenhouse located on the West Campus of China Agricultural University.
    The test subject was maize during the pollen dispersal stage. The EISs were positioned
    at 60 cm, 127 cm, and 185 cm from the root at varying heights. The EIS was consistently
    placed on three leaves with the same orientation. Data can be transmitted remotely
    via antennas to application software developed for mobile phones, which can be
    stored in real time. The test commenced at 15:00 and concluded the following day.
    The changes in temperature and humidity at different parts of the blade were monitored
    in real-time for 24 consecutive hours. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Design and
    fabrication of the semi-embedded circuits A low-cost fabrication process for semi-embedded
    circuits is developed for flexible sensor systems. Fig. 1a illustrates the step-by-step
    preparation of the semi-embedded circuits, which have been discussed in the experimental
    section. The homogeneous conductive inks of AgNP are first prepared by ultrasonic
    dispersion technology and screen-printed onto a smooth and clean glass substrate
    to achieve the designed conductive patterns. Following low-temperature sintering,
    the majority of the dispersant in the ink diffuses into the air, resulting in
    a tightly interconnected network structure among the silver particles, significantly
    enhancing the circuit conductivity. The PI solution is spin-coated onto the serpentine
    track as a substrate. Lastly, the conductive paths, along with the PI layer, are
    detached from the glass plate and subjected to a 24-hour heating process at 250
    °C in a fume hood. The critical step here was to achieve the release of semi-embedded
    flexible circuits on glass plates. Innovatively, we found that the PI film could
    be easily removed from the glass plate when the glass plate was immersed in water
    for a while. Our initial assessment is that this may be due to the smooth and
    hydrophobic surface of the glass plate to which the PI solution did not adhere
    after curing, accompanied by the fact that PI has a certain degree of water absorption
    and swelling properties. In contrast to conventional direct printing, our transfer
    printing method integrated with the PI film curing process effectively enables
    the interconnected-particle embedded into the substrate, which could enhance their
    bonding and withstand repeated bending. Fig. 1b shows a detailed depiction of
    the semi-embedded flexible sensor and the serpentine conductive track based on
    AgNPs. The semi-embedded sensor is flexible, supple, and compact, weighing only
    23 mg, meeting the criteria for plant wearable sensors. Furthermore, the E-FPCF
    with a complex patterns conductive silver layer, whose thickness is about 7 μm,
    was made (Fig. 1c). Therefore, based on the semi-embedded circuits preparation
    process developed in this study, assisted by automatic screen printing, large-area
    substrate plate making, film coating, and other technologies, it is expected to
    achieve large-scale production of large-area, complex-patterned embedded flexible
    sensing circuit films. The application of the ERTS to detect the humidity of Philodendron
    tatei ''Congo, as shown in Fig. 1d, demonstrates the credible capability of our
    strategy to fabricate precise, outstanding, and convenient semi-embedded flexible
    sensors. Download : Download high-res image (304KB) Download : Download full-size

    humidity sensors. 3.2. Characterizations of semi-embedded flexible circuits The
    flexible circuit conductivity is crucial as it serves as a critical component
    of the sensors. Fig. 2a illustrates the mechanism and structure of inks. The ultrasonic
    dispersion and high-temperature sintering significantly improved the conductivity
    of the AgNP-based circuits. After ultrasonic dispersion, the ink exhibits a smooth
    and viscous consistency, making it suitable for direct utilization in screen printing.
    It is worth noting that even after prolonged periods of static storage, the ink
    does not show any signs of layering or sedimentation, thus confirming its uniformity,

    top pictures are cross-section, and the bottom images are top view. (g) Changes
    in sensor resistance by bending 0°-180°and cyclically straightening for 10,000
    cycles. The type of dispersants affects the binding between AgNPs, the encapsulation
    of nanoparticles, and the steric effect of the polymer, which further acts on
    the circuit conductivity (Huang et al., 2016). We compared the change in electrical
    resistance of inks prepared with different dispersants before and after sintering
    to highlight the effect of dispersants on the electrical conductivity of inks.
    PVP was dissolved in three other solutions: PM, HA, and CA, with the mass fraction
    of PVP in each solution being 3 % and 5 % (a total of 6 types of dispersants).
    In addition, the 3 % PVP-PM ink was eliminated due to particle settling before
    printing, and the data for this ink was not included in the resistance drop analysis.
    From the results in Fig. 2c, it is clear that the inks with 3 wt% PVP-HA as the
    dispersant have the lowest and relatively stable resistance before and after circuit
    sintering. Therefore, this particular dispersant component was selected for ink
    preparation and subsequent test analysis. Silver nanoparticles of varying sizes
    display distinct surface energies. Spherical nanoparticles possess elevated surface
    energy, leading to a significant decrease in the sintering temperature of the
    crystals (Shmigel et al., 2015). Three inks containing particles of varying sizes
    (15, 20, and 50 nm) were subjected to sintering, showing a decreasing trend in
    electrode resistance with increasing particle size (Fig. 2d). After sintering,
    the serpentine electrode displayed resistances of about 8.3 Ω, 8 Ω, and 7 Ω for
    the 15 nm, 20 nm, and 50 nm inks, respectively. We conclude that sintering alters
    the interconnections between metal particles due to cracks and pores on the electrode
    surface. In the case of slightly larger silver particles, a temperature of 250
    °C furnishes the necessary impetus for sintering and promotes the formation of
    an expanded network of conductive pathways, even with a reduced specific surface
    area. Additionally, increasing the amount of silver powder in the ink resulted
    in reduced flowability but increased conductivity. After sintering, the serpentine
    electrode printed with 33 wt% ink shows a resistance of approximately 65 Ω, representing
    an almost nine-fold increase compared to the 66 wt% ink (Fig. 2e). In contrast
    to the conventional “sandwich” structure commonly employed in prior flexible sensing
    devices (Zhao et al., 2019), we utilized an embedding transfer technology to integrate
    the AgNP-based circuits into the flexible substrate directly. This approach effectively
    prevents the circuits from detaching, particularly when exposed to significant
    deformations like bending and twisting, thereby minimizing the potential for harm.
    To thoroughly analyze the adhesion between the circuits and flexible PI substrate,
    we carried out characterization of the structure of the semi-embedded electrode
    with the scanning electron microscope. Fig. 2f illustrates the cross-sectional
    and surface features of the semi-embedded electrode. The electron microscopy confirmed
    the effective embedding of the conductive layer and substrate, resulting in the
    formation of a flexible wearable device with a total thickness of 25 μm. Furthermore,
    it is observed that upon the printing and drying of ink onto the glass substrate,
    granular protrusions arise on the surface. This occurrence corresponds with incomplete
    volatilization of the dispersant, resulting in conductive particles within the
    ink acquiring a spherical shape and accumulating. As the dispersant continues
    to evaporate, pores appear on the surface of the ink, which may be caused by the
    lower leveling of the ink and the faster evaporation of the solvent. The images
    in Fig. 2f show that the porosity of the electrodes after sintering is significantly
    reduced, small cracks are filled, the edges of large gaps are softer, and the
    ink layer as a whole shows a direction toward more densification. Last, we performed
    a series of 10,000 consecutive bending tests at 180° to assess the wear resistance
    of the semi-embedded electrodes. As data in Fig. 2g confirmed, the electrode''s
    resistance remained stable between 306 and 308 mΩ throughout the bending tests,
    with a resistance change of only 0.99 % relative to initial resistance, demonstrating
    that the resistance variation caused by bending is negligible in terms of temperature
    response. 3.3. Semi-embedded flexible temperature sensor The temperature influences
    the kinetic energy of the free electrons within the silver nanoparticles (Monachon
    et al., 2016). As the temperature increases, so does the energy requirement for
    the directed motion of free electrons, thus raising the resistance (Jasemi et
    al., 2019). Therefore, we presented the design of a semi-embedded temperature
    sensor based on this mechanism. The flexible temperature sensor was fabricated
    following the semi-embedded method, as described earlier. The two-dimensional
    serpentine structure is designed to optimize the conductive layer within a confined
    region, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the sensor. We measured the resistance
    responses of the serpentine sensor for 15 consecutive temperature cycles. The
    output resistance (red solid line) varies systematically between 12.15 Ω and 13.9
    Ω as the temperature (black dotted line) fluctuates between −10 °C and 40 °C,
    which exhibited excellent reproducibility, as shown in Fig. 3a. To precisely determine
    the correlation between temperature and resistance, we conducted resistance measurements
    of the sensor at −10 °C, 0 °C, 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C, recording the resistance
    output at each temperature gradient across the last 14 cycles (Fig. 3b). The repeatability
    error for tests was just 0.043 %, proving the stability and reliability of the
    sensor in long-term use under varying conditions. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the
    sensor exhibited minimal hysteresis during the temperature fluctuations, and its
    sensitivity reached 0.03462 Ω/°C. Additionally, we plotted the resistance–temperature
    response curve of the temperature sensor, which makes the sensor more accessible
    to use for practical testing. Download : Download high-res image (799KB) Download

    Temperature response of ERTS on fluffy leaves. To mitigate the impact of device
    errors on the accuracy and work range of the flexible sensor, we conducted a calibration
    of the flexible sensor by testing it alongside a K-type thermocouple under identical
    working conditions. Throughout the calibration process, the chamber parameters
    were adjusted to range from −30 to 80 °C, and nine cycles were executed. The test
    results from both devices exhibit a high degree of overlap, proving evidence of
    the flexible sensor''s accurate temperature monitoring capabilities (Fig. 3d).
    It is important to note that a notable deviation exists between the temperature
    measurement data of the flexible sensor and the thermocouple when the test temperature
    exceeds 60 °C. This discrepancy may arise from alterations in the internal structure
    of the flexible sensor when the temperature surpasses 60 °C, thereby modifying
    the resistance temperature coefficient. Consequently, the operational range of
    the sensor was ultimately established as −30 to 60 °C. Despite the typically overlooked
    nature of humidity in temperature sensor studies, it is, in fact, a crucial parameter
    that exerts a significant impact on temperature sensor output. To demonstrate
    the effects of humidity on the ERTS, we placed the detector at a constant temperature
    of 25 °C. We exposed it to three cycles of humidity reduction from 90 %RH to 30
    %RH, followed by increased humidity back to 90 %RH. The ERTS demonstrates high
    sensitivity to changes in temperature, with a sensitivity of 0.03462 Ω/°C, compared
    to its sensitivity to changes in moisture, which is significantly lower at only
    0.00233 Ω/%RH (Fig. 3e). The tests above have proven that the AgNP-based flexible
    temperature sensor offers outstanding temperature response and can detect temperature
    changes in various situations. Heat or cold stress can have an impact on the regular
    growth of the plant and even cause it to die. (Yamori et al., 2022). Thus, monitoring
    the temperature close to the plant is paramount to detect and forecast its health
    status. In this study, we have chosen Philodendron tatei Congo, an evergreen indoor
    plant, as the research subject (Fig. 3f). At 2:00 pm, which corresponds to the
    moment when sunlight contacts the leaf surface directly, the temperature of the
    leaves'' adaxial side increased quickly from 20 °C to 37 °C. Roughly one and a
    half hours later, the temperature decreased to approximately 20 °C, compensating
    for the reduction in light intensity. It is worth mentioning that the sensor showed
    sensitivity to irrigation''s impact on temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3g.
    Additionally, to further explore the universal use of the ERTS for plant surface
    temperature detection, we specifically focused on their ability to adhere to complex
    surfaces. We selected the Bolus (Gerbera jamesonii) with fuzzy leaves as the research
    subjects and consistently monitored the temperature on the abaxial side of the
    leaves (Fig. 3h). As shown in Fig. 3i, the temperature of the underside of the
    blade varies by approximately 3 °C per day. The blade heated up due to sunlight,
    with warming occurring at the same time as exposure to sunlight. Throughout the
    testing period, the leaf surface temperature continued to rise, likely due to
    increased ambient plant temperature (verified on the same day by ambient temperature
    measurements) rather than a fault in the sensor. 3.4. Semi-embedded flexible humidity
    sensor As depicted in Fig. 4a, the IDE was selected motivated by its extensive
    applicability and simplistic structural design (Cui et al., 2023, Lu et al., 2021).
    Additionally, this interdigital structure exhibits significantly larger capacitance
    and heightened sensitivity than other more superficial structures. A custom-made
    screen-printed board was utilized to fabricate the ECHS illustrated in Fig. 4b,
    following the previously described preparation method. Download : Download high-res

    researchers who had used PI film for humidity sensing, we employed GO further
    to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of the sensor (Oren et al., 2017, Yu
    et al., 2014). The large surface of GO resulting from the nanostructure effectively
    increases the contact area with water molecules, thus enabling the binding of
    adsorption–desorption with water molecules (Chen and Lu, 2005). Furthermore, the
    abundant active sites, including defects, vacancies, and hydrophilic groups on
    GO''s surfaces, are able to capture water molecules, contributing to the desired
    humidity perception (Lu et al., 2022). Here, we applied a GO film to the semi-embedded
    electrodes through drop-casting and analyzed the surface microstructure of the
    resulting humidity sensor. As depicted in Fig. 4c, the GO film, which covered
    the sensor uniformly and consistently, provided structural foundations for accurate
    detection. The sensitivity of the ECHS is not solely determined by the electrode''s
    geometry but also depends on the GO concentration and the frequency of the electric
    field. According to the experimental results shown in Fig. 4d, the capacitance
    value decreased with increasing frequency when the electrode size and GO concentration
    were kept constant. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the effect of frequency
    on the movement of water molecules in the humidity sensing film, resulting in
    a delayed response. Choosing a lower frequency widened the range of capacitance
    variation and increased sensitivity to humidity. However, theoretical reasoning
    and empirical observations showed that capacitors with lower capacities responded
    poorly at lower frequencies but performed better at higher frequencies. Consequently,
    frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 k Hz, and 10 k Hz were again chosen for the humidity
    response test of the sensor. The test results revealed that the ECHS exhibited
    an irregular response to humidity at 100 Hz. In contrast, the sensor showed reliable
    responses at 1 kHz and 10 kHz, and the humidity response range at 10 kHz was narrower
    than that at 1 kHz. In light of these findings, the sensor will undergo a performance
    qualification assessment at 1 kHz. The humidity response curve of the ECHS (as
    shown in Fig. 4e) underwent six test cycles. The fitting line equation equals
    and the adjusted R2 equals 0.98404. Therefore, there is a relationship of between
    the input quantity (relative humidity, RH) and the output quantity (capacitance),
    with a non-linear error of only 2.48 % covering the range of 40 % to 90 % RH.
    For the hysteresis test, the three humidity cycles were carried on, with the gray
    curve representing the change in sensor capacitance as humidity increases and
    the yellow curve representing the change as humidity decreases (Fig. 4f). It is
    evident that there is a discrepancy between the capacitance values as the humidity
    drops and rises. We attributed this phenomenon to the intrinsic properties of
    the ECHS. On the one hand, as the humidity decreases, GO and water molecules remain
    partially adsorbed, forming intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding
    and van der Waals forces. This keeps capacitance relatively high. On the other
    hand, it is plausible that the humidity conditions in the chamber did not reach
    the set value, which may have contributed to the non-coincidence of the round-trip
    curve. Despite often being overlooked in humidity sensor studies, temperature
    is a crucial factor that can significantly affect sensor performance. To further
    investigate the operational stability, we studied the influence of temperature
    on the ECHS. The test chamber was set at 0 %RH, while the temperature was varied
    from −10℃ to 40℃ and then decreased back to −10℃, with a temperature gradient
    of 5℃. Fig. 4g illustrates the temperature response variations of the sensor.
    Throughout the 10 cycles of temperature, the sensor exhibited outstanding repeatability.
    Within the range of −10℃ to 40℃, the response of capacitance did not show a monotonic
    linear correlation with temperature. The capacitance values remained fluctuating
    within the scope of 7 pF to 18.5 pF, which means the temperature variations result
    in a variation of only 0.22 %RH in a testing environment of 90 %RH. Considering
    that the temperature does not suddenly rise or fall by 50 °C in practice, the
    sensor can be regarded as insensitive to temperature changes. With the ECHS, we
    continuously monitor humidity fluctuations on the surface of fruits and plants.
    The plant chosen for testing in this experiment was the alum root (Heuchera micrantha),
    and the humidity-sensitive film of the sensor was in contact with the abaxial
    epidermis. Over 15 consecutive days, we monitored changes in humidity on the surface
    of the leaves (Fig. 4h). No additional water was supplied during the first eight
    days. During the first three days, the soil was sufficiently moist, and the RH
    on the abaxial side of the leaves ranged from a high of 63 % to a low of 20 %,
    which was very close to the RH of the surrounding air. As the soil gradually dried
    out, the RH of the leaves decreased from the fourth day onwards, transpiration
    was significantly lower than at the beginning, and the leaves began to wilt. After
    external supplementation on day 8, leaf transpiration increased on day 9, with
    RH rising from 20 %RH to 45 %RH, and again on day 13, with RH ranging from 40
    % to 65 %. All these proved the reliability and repeatability of the sensor during
    long-term use. Furthermore, the ECHS was employed to monitor surface humidity
    changes in papaya (Chaenomeles sinensis) during the decay, thus simulating respiratory
    changes in the fruit during storage (Fig. 4i). The RH on the papaya surface remained
    above 90 %RH throughout the first 3 days under sealed conditions. After unsealing,
    the RH on the papaya surface began to decrease; on the sixth day, the RH dropped
    to 60 %RH. Subsequently, there were fluctuations in the RH, which could be attributed
    to the respiratory climacteric of papaya, which occurred when there was a sudden
    increase in the respiration rate of papaya, leading to a rapid senescence stage.
    This experiment confirmed the applicability of flexible humidity sensors in providing
    data support for monitoring fruit ripening and understanding the ripening and
    senescence process. 3.5. Flexible integrated sensor based on semi-embedded circuit
    As a critical component of a flexible integrated sensor, E-FPCF was fabricated
    through flexible transfer technology outlined in Section 3.1. The electronic components
    were assembled on the E-FPCF via conductive silver paste using the surface mounting
    technique. In order to satisfy the needs of intricate agricultural applications,
    we employed commercially available Bluetooth modules and sensing elements to detect
    ambient temperature and humidity, allowing real-time data display on mobile devices.
    The Bluetooth chip features a 2.4G Hz transceiver that ensures optimum sensitivity
    and transmission rate for low-energy data transmission, enabling prolonged functionality
    even when powered by a low-capacity battery. The sensing part incorporated the
    temperature and humidity sensor (Sensirion SHT35) to accurately measure the microclimate
    parameters around the leaf surface, which offers a humidity measurement accuracy
    of ± 1.5 %RH and a temperature measurement accuracy of ± 0.1 °C. Furthermore,
    the small form factor of the Sensirion SHT35 at 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm × 0.9 mm makes
    it ideal for accommodating the flexible requirements of the integrated circuit.

    (h) Biosafety of flexible integrated sensing systems. (For interpretation of the
    references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
    version of this article.) To meet the standards for the outdoor use of plant sensors,
    the device''s packaging needs to retain the circuitry''s flexibility and ensure
    that the EIS is both solderable and waterproof. Therefore, the thickness of the
    encapsulation layer is strictly restricted to 5 mm. A commercially available organic
    silicone, which displays exceptional electrical insulation and chemical stability
    and has moisture-proof, anti-static, and anti-oxidation properties, was selected
    as the packaging material. The encapsulated integrated device is visually depicted
    in Fig. 5b. Conformability to the object serves as a vital indicator for assessing
    the flexibility of the integrated circuit. Hence, the bending performance of the
    EIS was evaluated subsequent to the completion of packaging. As demonstrated in
    Fig. 5c, the EIS was subjected to a bending test. This was achieved by firmly
    fastening the EIS to glass tubes with diameters ranging from 35 mm to 70 mm. Remarkably,
    the packaged EIS maintained its ability to record temperature and humidity readings
    even when exposed to varied bending conditions for up to 2 h. Fig. 5d displays
    the temperature and humidity change on the plant leaf surface. These changes were
    monitored continuously for 24 h with the flexible EIS in a controlled indoor environment
    during a test on a gold diamond plant. Significant temperature and humidity fluctuations
    occurred between 12:00 and 15:00 due to direct sunlight on the plants. The graph
    reveals an abrupt decline in humidity as the temperature surged, which gradually
    recovered when the temperature reduced. We conducted tests in a complex and realistic
    climatic environment to evaluate the practical application of the semi-embedded
    temperature and humidity sensor. Specifically, we examined the sensor''s performance
    on maize during the pollen dispersal stage in a greenhouse. As depicted in Fig.
    5f, the flexible EIS adhered effectively to the leaf surface even when the leaves
    had fuzz. The EIS was placed on three maize leaves at different heights: 60 cm
    (U), 127 cm (M), and 185 cm (L) from the root base. An external rechargeable battery
    was planted on the maize stalk to power the EIS. The data collected by the sensors
    could be transmitted over long distances via an antenna and stored in real-time
    on a cell phone application (Fig. 5g). Temperature and humidity changes in different
    leaf parts were monitored in real time for 24 h. As depicted in Fig. 5e, the trends
    of temperature and RH detected by the three EISs were consistent at different
    heights. From 15:00 to 20:00, the temperature fluctuated between 20 and 25 °C,
    and the RH fluctuated between 20 % and 50 %RH. We hypothesized this was due to
    transpiration and good ventilation, which results in low RH on plant surfaces.
    From 21:00 to about 4:30 the following day, the temperature dropped significantly
    to 15℃, while the RH increased to 70 ∼ 80 %RH. The increase in RH can be attributed
    to the shutdown of the greenhouse ventilation system, as well as the decrease
    in ambient temperature, which reduced the saturated water vapor pressure in the
    air and indirectly led to an increase in RH. After 5:00, the opening of the greenhouse
    supplemental light and the subsequent direct sunlight caused a rapid increase
    in leaf temperature, accompanied by a decrease in RH. Extensive maize irrigation
    occurred until 10:00, which probably contributed to reducing temperature and humidity
    by improving air exchange in the greenhouse. At the end of the test, the sensor
    was removed and left no trace on the leaves (Fig. 5h). During the continuous test,
    water mist appeared at specific positions on the E-FPCF, but there was no significant
    accumulation of coalescing water droplets. This is probably due to the high gas
    exchange effect of the waterproof and breathable polyurethane tape, which allows
    for a non-destructive and non-marking inspection of the plants. For future applications,
    it is recommended that the EIS be fixed locally to the blade, leaving some area
    for adequate gas exchange. 4. Conclusions We present a novel technique for the
    fabrication of semi-embedded flexible sensors. This method results in an ultra-thin
    flexible temperature sensor, which exhibits excellent high repeatability and stability.
    This sensor can accurately detect temperature variations ranging from −30 °C to
    60 °C, making it suitable for continuously monitoring temperature changes on the
    surface of furry plants. In parallel, we have applied the same methodology to
    develop flexible humidity sensors with excellent operating performance. The humidity
    sensors demonstrate a noteworthy increase in capacitance with a low hysteresis
    coefficient. This feature enables the tracking of plant leaf surface transpiration.
    In the final, we have developed a leaf-friendly, flexible, multifunctional integrated
    sensor system. This integrated system allows for long-term monitoring of plant
    microclimate and can record remote data output through a visual interface. Additionally,
    users can access cloud recording via their mobile phones. The flexible conductive
    substrate of the integrated sensor has a thickness of about 25 μm and can be equipped
    with miniature electronic components for functionalization. It''s worth noting
    that one of the biggest challenges facing the application of semi-embedded flexible
    sensors to plants is the rapid growth of plants, which can cause mismatching.
    By selecting proper substrate materials with good stretchability and low elastic
    modulus, such as PDMS and Eco-flex, the flexibility of the sensor is expected
    to be significantly improved. Future challenges include improving the flexibility
    and stretchability of the sensor, optimizing the programming for stable data output,
    and extending the functionality of the sensor to include biological stress monitoring.
    Long-term monitoring of plant growth is crucial, which imposes greater demands
    on the elasticity and durability of the sensors. Waterproofing is also essential
    to broaden the practical application of the sensors. Besides, it is advisable
    to use degradable and self-healing materials in sensor preparation to prevent
    secondary contamination and promote secondary recycling in agricultural production.
    Blending flexible AgNP-based sensors with other highly conductive materials to
    fill cracks and gaps is also a promising strategy to enhance their performance
    further. In conclusion, this research provides a valuable tool and guidance for
    exploring plant physiological information and improving agricultural cultivation.

  description: The objective of this study is to examine how IoT-enabled intelligent
    irrigation systems can be used in rice agriculture. The study uses sensors to
    gather environmental data in real time, such as temperature, water level, humidity,
    and humidity sensors. Machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks
    (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and random forests
    (RF), are then used to process the data in order to predict future water demand.
    Experimental findings The efficacy of the system indicates, where ANN demonstrates
    the greatest accuracy of 95.6%, followed closely by SVM of 93.2%, DT of 88.7%,
    and RF of 86.5% These performance indicators indicate the robustness and accuracy
    of the model in forecasting environmental conditions for irrigation highlighting
    the positive. The effectiveness of each model is further demonstrated by confusion
    matrices, which provide instances of true positives, false positives, true negatives,
    and false negatives. Achieving a successful integration of IoT and machine learning
    ensures a proactive response to changing field conditions and lowers the risk
    of resource misuse through precise adjustments to the water supply. The results
    emphasise the potential of technology-driven solutions to increase precision agriculture,
    leading to sustainable practices that optimise yields while conserving resources.
    The study offers vital insights for agricultural stakeholders, opening the road
    for flexible and adaptable solutions that solve the problems of contemporary rice
    production in the face of altering climates and global food.

    of irrigation practices of farmer's using an IoT-based sensor technology was considered.
    In the tomato field, a demonstration of automation irrigation was conducted. Overirrigation
    was observed using the IoT-based sensor station in some fields that have sandy
    soil and use a drip irrigation system. In the blueberry demonstration field, the
    total yield per plant (p = 0.025) and 50-berry weights (p = 0.013) were found
    to be higher with the recommended irrigation management than the farmer's existing
    field. In the tomato demonstration field, there were no statistical differences
    in the number of marketable tomatoes (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756)
    between the farmer's existing method and the recommended irrigation strategy.
    However, 30% less water was applied to the recommended irrigation strategy plot.
    Thus, the result showed that the IoT-based sensor irrigation strategy can save
    up to 30% on irrigation while maintaining the same yields and quality of the product.

    for centuries and plays a significant role in developing economies worldwide.
    Irrigation is the process of supplying water to the crops using an artificial
    means to provide moisture, which helps in the growth and produces higher yields
    in crops. It is particularly important in regions with low precipitation and limited
    water resources. Irrigation also significantly impacts local rural economies by
    affecting the production of crops, creating jobs, increasing carbon sequestration,
    and boosting economic growth. Climate change poses a threat to agriculture. Erratic
    and unpredictable precipitation patterns, rising global average temperatures,
    and water scarcity can compromise food security (Rosa, 2022). Crop health is affected
    by rainfall trends, such as wetter springs, and drier summers with temperature
    anomalies, such as cold or heat waves (Alam et al., 2021). These flooding and
    drought events, without precision irrigation, can decrease the yield and quality
    of the product. In addition to these precipitation changes, average global temperatures
    are expected to increase by around 2°C each year until the year 2100. Higher temperatures
    lead to alterations in evapotranspiration (ET) and weed growth, affect pollination,
    and decrease photosynthesis rate, source-sink relationship, and crop duration,
    all of which can affect plant health and productivity (Malhi et al., 2021). Precision
    irrigation management practices have the potential to increase water use efficiency
    while minimizing the effects of climate change on farms. Irrigation scheduling
    is a well-established strategy to manage crop water needs throughout the growing
    season. This method involves monitoring the water requirements of crops and determining
    whether the existing soil moisture and any additional water from precipitation
    and irrigation can fulfill them. Irrigation scheduling also considers economic
    and environmental variables. Every day, farmers face the challenge of making decisions
    that balance the cost of applying water (labor and energy) against the goal of
    achieving a high yield, enhanced crop quality, and the efficient use of water
    resources. Several types of irrigation scheduling have been demonstrated in the
    past, including ET-, soil moisture-, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based irrigation
    scheduling (Aguilar et al., 2015; Goap et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Alibabaei
    et al., 2021; Dong, 2023; Kelley et al., 2023). ET-based irrigation scheduling
    is a method of irrigating a crop using daily reference ET, particular crop coefficient
    (Kc) value, and the amount of precipitation. Kc is determined by crop types and
    crop growth stage. This method has been shown to save water by up to 61% compared
    to the conventional irrigation application method (Simić et al., 2023). Soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling utilizes soil moisture sensors to estimate
    soil moisture content in the root zone to ensure optimal moisture levels for crops
    and avoid overirrigation. Typically, soil moisture sensors are installed at multiple
    depths in the root zone to understand the soil moisture levels at different depths
    comprehensively. The changes in soil moisture at different depths help to estimate
    the root growth. Many types of soil moisture sensors are available, including
    tensiometers, capacitance sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, and
    frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors. A tensiometer is a soil water tension
    measuring tool comprised of a porous ceramic cup with a water-filled tube working
    on the capillary action principle, which measures the soil matric potential expressing
    soil water energy. Capacitance sensors measure soil dielectric constants that
    differ for different moisture regimes, which provide real-time data for precise
    irrigation management (Smajstrla and Harrison, 2023). TDR is an approach that
    works on the principles of sending an electromagnetic pulse to the soil, and the
    travel time of the pulse is directly related to the soil moisture content, and
    it provides continuous soil moisture data across different depths, which helps
    in understanding efficient irrigation management (He et al., 2021). In addition
    to these sensors, FDR is another technique based on electromagnetic wave reflections
    that send high-frequency waves to the soil for measuring dielectric properties,
    which determines the soil moisture for precision irrigation management (Choi et
    al., 2016). Previously, this soil moisture sensor-based irrigation scheduling
    helped to save water by up to 60% compared to conventional irrigation methods
    (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005; Grabow et al., 2013; Millán et al., 2019). A study
    conducted by Boltana et al. (2023) showed that the soil moisture sensor-based
    method saved 18% of irrigation water compared to the ET-based method in tomato
    fields (Boltana et al., 2023). Moreover, the sensor-based irrigation method increased
    water use efficiency in soybean and potato fields by 49% and 16%, respectively
    (Wood et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2023). The AI-based irrigation scheduling analyzes
    multiple input data, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, plant canopy temperature, crop type, crop growth stage, and
    yield data, to develop AI logarithms. Machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement
    learning techniques are typically used for developing algorithms. These algorithms
    provide predictive analytics about optimum irrigation volume, time and frequency
    of irrigation, and yield data. These data can be used for the long-term planning
    of water usage based on weather forecasts and provide predictive measures for
    proactive interventions. This AI-based irrigation scheduling has been shown to
    improve the efficiency of water use for irrigation by up to 50% (Mohammad et al.,
    2013; Zia et al., 2021) and save the usage of water by 59% (Jamroen et al., 2020)
    compared to the industry standard method. Of those methods discussed, weather-
    and soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling are the most common methods, as
    they are relatively cheap, more practical, and easier to use. While the weather-based
    irrigation scheduling method uses reference ET and Kc to determine when and how
    much to irrigate, the soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling method utilizes
    actual in-field soil moisture data using sensors to estimate the current soil
    water available and determine the irrigation decision. Soil moisture sensors can
    also be used for monitoring the spatial variation of soil moisture within the
    fields, thus allowing precise irrigation management. Recently, soil moisture sensor
    adoption in agriculture in the United States is only 12% (as of 2020) (Kukal et
    al., 2020). To increase this adoption rate, systems should be more cost-effective
    and easier to use (Dong, 2023). Furthermore, farmers need to be more educated
    on how they work to increase the trust in using them. The cost, difficulty to
    use, and trust are the major challenges for adopting the technology by farmers.
    Therefore, affordable and easy-to-use technology is needed to increase the its
    adoption. In addition, the demonstration of the technology in agricultural fields
    to show the potential use in improving the efficiency of irrigation water use
    is needed. In this study, we propose to develop an affordable and easy-to-use
    sensor monitoring system for farmers to improve irrigation management. We implement
    a low-cost sensor monitoring system (LOCOMOS) to measure soil moisture at multiple
    depths and use the data to provide irrigation recommendations. This article focuses
    on case studies using LOCOMOS in corn, blueberry, and tomato fields. 2 Methodology
    LOCOMOS, which was developed by Michigan State University Irrigation Lab, was
    used in this study. LOCOMOS is an IoT-based sensor monitoring system that measures
    in-field soil and environmental conditions. The collected data were sent to the
    IoT cloud web server, from which irrigation recommendations were provided. 2.1
    An IoT-based sensor monitoring system A LOCOMOS system can continuously measure
    soil moisture levels at multiple depths, leaf wetness duration, air temperature,
    relative humidity, and precipitation. The data were then sent to a LOCOMOS IoT
    website (https://www.locomos1.com) to display the recommended irrigation timing
    and amount, the location of the sensor system, the raw sensor data, and the switch
    to turn irrigation on and off. The dashboard on the LOCOMOS IoT website was updated
    every 15 min, allowing the user to observe and make timely farm management decisions.
    An SD card module was utilized for storing and backing up the sensor data locally.
    LOCOMOS is powered by a 12V 7A battery, a 12V solar panel, and a solar battery
    charging controller. Email and Text message alert systems were set up through
    the IoT website. For example, a user could receive an email and text message when
    the soil water available level is at 50% for growing corn. SoilWatch 10, the soil
    moisture sensors, manufactured by Pino-Tech (Stargard, Poland), were utilized
    for measuring soil moisture levels. SoilWatch 10 is a relatively cheaper sensor
    and has provided reliable soil moisture measurement. PHYTOS 31 Leaf Wetness Sensor,
    manufactured by METER Group (Pullmen, WA, USA), was utilized to record the duration
    of leaf wetness. An SHT30 temperature and humidity sensor, manufactured by Sensirion
    (Chicago, IL, USA), was utilized for measuring the air temperature and relative
    humidity. The accuracy tolerance for air temperature and relative humidity were
    ± 0.3°C and ± 3%, respectively. A rain gauge, manufactured by Davis Instruments
    (Hayward, CA, USA), was utilized for measuring the precipitation. The rain gauge
    measured every 0.02 cm increment. Hunter ICV valves with DC latching solenoids
    were connected to the microcontroller to turn the valve on and off. Figure 1 shows
    a block diagram of the LOCOMOS system. figure 1 Figure 1. A block diagram for
    the LOCOMOS system. The LOCOMOS smartphone application (LOCOMOS APP) is an easy-to-use
    app designed for farmers to manage irrigation for their crops. The LOCOMOS APP
    connects to the LOCOMOS IoT server to visualize the sensor data on the app. Each
    user will be verified using a digital ocean server (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows
    the pages of the LOCOMOS APP. To access the app, existing users can log in using
    their registered email ID and password. New users can sign up using their email
    ID and a unique invitation code, which is provided by the server. Once logged
    in, a list of sensor devices will be displayed. Each device contains its GPS coordinates
    and provides real-time available soil water (%) and maximum recommended irrigation
    amount. In addition, the LOCOMOS APP gathers ET and precipitation information
    from the Michigan State University Enviroweather Network. Users can either push
    the “Use My Location” button or select the closest weather station to their field
    to observe the ET and precipitation data. In addition, the map page allows users
    to visualize the precise locations of all deployed sensors on a map. This bird''s-eye
    view offers a comprehensive overview of users'' farmlands, making it easier to
    identify the location of each sensor. figure 2 Figure 2. An overview of the LOCOMOS

    irrigation amount, (E) Weather information from MSU Enviroweather, and (F) LOCOMOS
    devices on the map. 2.2 Soil moisture sensor calibration The calibration of soil
    moisture sensors to specific soil types was critical as the accuracy could be
    varied. A laboratory experiment was conducted to calibrate the SoilWatch 10 soil
    moisture sensors and evaluate their performances in two soil types. The soil types,
    including sand and loamy sand, were used in this laboratory experiment. Two 144-L
    size polypropylene containers (80 × 41 × 35 cm) were used. The volumetric water
    content (VWC) analysis was performed six times using a 61-cm3 size soil ring during
    this laboratory experiment. Detailed information on the procedure of the sensor
    calibration can be found in Smajstrla et al.''s study (Smajstrla and Harrison,
    2023). 2.3 Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation model The soil
    moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation was estimated using the field
    capacity of soil and current soil moisture content using soil moisture sensors.
    The irrigation recommendation was calculated by finding the difference between
    the field capacity of the soil and the current soil moisture content. This recommendation
    was the maximum amount of irrigation that could be applied without water being
    lost through deep percolation beyond the root zone. The equation of soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation recommendation is shown in Equation (1). An assumption
    was made that the volumetric soil water content for its representative soil layer
    is uniform and has the same moisture level. I R = ( F C L a y e r i -  θ v L a
    y e r i ) * D L a y e r i     ( 1 ) where IR is the maximum irrigation recommendation
    (cm), FCLayeri is the field capacity of the layer i soil depth (cm/cm), DLayeri
    is the representative layer i soil depth (cm), and θvLayeri is the volumetric
    soil water content of the layer i soil depth (cm3/cm3). 2.4 Statistical analysis
    The performance of the soil moisture sensors was evaluated using root mean squared
    error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), and mean bias error (MBE). RMSE measures
    the difference between sensor values and soil sample values and is defined in
    Equation (2). The index of agreement was proposed by Willmott (1981), as defined
    in Equation (3). MBE is defined in Equation (4). R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( M i
    - P i ) 2     ( 2 ) I A = 1 - ∑ i = 1 N ( M i - P i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 N ( | P i - M
    ¯ | + | M i - M ¯ | ) 2     ( 3 ) M B E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( P i − M i )     ( 4
    ) where N is the sample size, M is the measured (soil sampling) value, P is the
    predicted (sensor measurement) value, and is the average measured value. The units
    for RMSE and MBE are VWC (cm3/cm3), and IA is dimensionless. A range of IA lies
    between 0 and 1, and a value of 0 indicates no agreement between the measured
    and predicted values. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the observed
    and predicted values. The higher value of IA indicates better agreement between
    observed and predicted values. Hignett and Evett (2008) revealed that the sensor
    measurement accuracy for most agricultural applications needs to be <0.02 cm3/cm3.
    Varble and Chávez (2011) and Dong et al. (2020) reported that the criteria for
    MBE and RMSE were ±0.02 cm3/cm3 and <0.035 cm3/cm3, respectively. Therefore, this
    study evaluated the sensor performance using the following criteria: MBE ± 0.02
    cm3/cm3 and RMSE < 0.035 cm3/cm3. 2.5 LOCOMOS field demonstration—Irrigation practice
    evaluation Once the sensors were calibrated and evaluated, LOCOMOS was deployed
    in irrigated fields in Michigan farmlands to evaluate the existing farmer''s irrigation
    practices. Irrigated corn and blueberry fields were evaluated. The demonstration
    irrigated corn field was located in Manchester, Michigan, USA. A commercial corn
    was cultivated in this field and was irrigated with 20–28 cm of water and 224
    kg/ha of nitrogen was applied. The commercial corn fields were irrigated using
    a center pivot irrigation system. The second demonstration field was located in
    West Olive, Michigan, USA. The field size was approximately 20 acres, and blueberries
    were cultivated in it. These blueberry fields were irrigated using a surface double-drip
    line system. Soil samples were collected to test the soil texture. The physical
    properties of the soils at different depths are shown in Table 1. The soils in
    these fields were mostly sandy soil, such as loamy sand and sandy loam, which
    were the common soil types in irrigated fields in Michigan. Figure 4 shows installed
    LOCOMOS in the irrigated corn and blueberry fields in Michigan, USA. Corn roots
    typically grow up to 90 cm in this demonstration field. Thus, the soil moisture
    sensors were installed at 15, 60, and 90 cm in the irrigated corn field. In the
    irrigated blueberry field, the sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm.
    All data loggers were programmed to record soil moisture measurements every 30
    min. The soil samples were collected three times during this monitoring period.
    These samples were analyzed for texture and volumetric water content. The VWC
    from the soil samples was utilized for testing the accuracy of the sensors. table

    2.6 LOCOMOS field demonstration—automation irrigation Automation irrigation using
    LOCOMOS was demonstrated in a tomato field in Hart, Michigan, USA. The 9V DC solenoid
    valves with Hunter''s ICV valves were utilized to control irrigation. Fresh tomatoes
    were cultivated in this field, and plastic mulch was used to maintain the soil
    moisture and keep the weeds out. Figure 5 shows the experimental setup for this
    tomato field. This tomato field is irrigated with a surface single drip line system.
    Two irrigation strategies, namely, the farmer''s existing irrigation management
    and automation irrigation trigger, were evaluated. The farmer''s existing irrigation
    management included 1 h of irrigation per day in June and twice in 1 h of irrigation
    per day in July and August. The automation irrigation trigger method was based
    on the soil moisture sensor data and used Equation (1). Four replications with
    randomized plot designs were utilized for the comparison. The team has collected
    the number of marketable tomatoes and their weights to compare the effectiveness
    of the treatments. Eight plants per replication were considered. Statistic software
    R v4.3.1 was utilized for running a one-way ANOVA. figure 5 Figure 5. Automation
    irrigation demonstration in Hart, MI, USA. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Soil moisture
    sensor calibration The calibration of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensor was
    conducted for sand and loamy sand. Soil temperature during this laboratory experiment
    was kept constant at 22 ± 1°C. The soil moisture sensors were powered at 3.3 V,
    and analog raw counts were used for the calibration. Figure 6 shows the comparison
    of measured VWC and raw count. Based on the curve fitting, Equation (5) was developed.
    The calibration of SoilWatch 10 was based on a wide range of VWC from 0.04 to
    0.4 cm3/cm3. The calibration of the sensor provided confidence in using it for
    field demonstration. VWC  = 2 E - 13 ( R C ) 3 - 4 E - 9 ( R C ) 2 + 4 E - 5 (
    R C ) - 0 . 0677     ( 5 ) where VWC is the volumetric water content (cm3/cm3)
    and RC is the analog raw counts that outputs from the sensor. figure 6 Figure
    6. The calibration curve for SoilWatch 10. 3.2 The performance evaluation of the
    soil moisture sensor The performance of the soil moisture sensor in the sand and
    loamy sand was evaluated. Figures 7, 8 show the comparison of sensors with measured
    VWC using a gravimetric method for sand and loamy sand, respectively. Table 2
    shows the result of the statistical analysis. The MBE values for the soil moisture
    sensor showed that this sensor overestimated VWC by an average of 0.01 cm3/cm3
    in the sand and underestimated it by an average of 0.02 cm3/cm3 in the loamy sand.
    The performance of the soil moisture sensor for sand and loamy sand satisfied
    both MBE and RMSE criteria. The MBE values of the calibrated SoilWatch 10 were
    similar to Campbell Scientific''s CS 616 TDR sensors. The MBE of CS 616 for sand
    and loamy sand were 0.01 and 0.03 cm3/cm3, respectively (Dong et al., 2020). The
    calibrated SoilWatch 10 provided reliable performance in measuring moisture content
    in sand and loamy sand. This confirmed the satisfaction of the calibration process.

    for sand. figure 8 Figure 8. A comparison of the SoilWatch 10 with the soil sampling
    method for loamy sand. table 2 Table 2. A statistical analysis to compare measured
    values to sensor values. 3.3 Demonstration in an irrigated corn field Figure 9
    shows the collected soil moisture sensor data, precipitation, and irrigation.
    Appropriate irrigation should maintain the soil moisture level in the root zone
    at an optimal level and ensure the water does not flow below the root zone to
    save freshwater and energy, reducing nutrient leaching and maximizing return on
    investment. The corn roots in this demonstration field grew up to 90 cm; thus,
    the goal of irrigation management was to moisten only the top 90 cm of soil. During
    the growing season, five events affected increasing soil moisture levels at a
    depth of 90 cm, which means that the water has reached and passed through the
    90 cm depth. In events #1, #3, and #5, soil moisture at a depth of 90 cm increased
    due to continuous and heavy rainfalls. In events #2 and #3, the soil moisture
    level at 90 cm depth was increased due to the combination of rainfall and irrigation.
    The corn farmer in Michigan typically applied irrigation each time between 2.50–3.20
    cm. When heavy rainfall is forecasted, the farmer could reduce the irrigation
    application volume to capture the rainfall within the root zone and minimize the
    potential leaching of water and nutrients below the root zone. In addition, the
    installation of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensors within the root zone and
    right below the root zone helps to evaluate whether the farmer is applying irrigation
    adequately or excessively. These sensor data are helpful in making better-informed
    decisions on when and how much to irrigate. figure 9 Figure 9. The volumetric
    water content at 15, 45, and 90 cm soil depths at an irrigated corn demonstration
    field. 3.4 Demonstration in an irrigated blueberry field In the irrigated blueberry
    field, soil moisture sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm depths. The
    flow rate of the drip emitter was 41 cm/h and was applied for 60 min during each
    application. During this monitoring period, there were no rainfalls. Figure 10
    shows the soil moisture changes from the farmer''s irrigation management practice.
    Proper irrigation for blueberries on this farm should ensure that water does not
    flow below the root zone, which is the top 45 cm of soil depth. Figure 10 indicates
    that the farmer''s existing irrigation management practice provided an adequate
    amount of water to the blueberry root system. However, the overirrigation events
    were observed because of the spike in the soil moisture sensor at both 45 and
    60 cm depths. Thus, it was recommended to reduce the irrigation time from 60 min
    to 40 min. The farmer tested his part of the field to demonstrate the reduced
    and recommended irrigation management practice. Figure 11 shows the soil moisture
    monitoring at the reduced and recommended irrigation plots. The reduced irrigation
    increased the soil moisture levels of the depth up to 30 cm, which is the effective
    water uptake root zone for blueberries grown in sandy soil. Thus, the reduced
    and recommended amount was adequate; however, when the blueberry was at the significant
    growth stage (at first blue fruit) and higher ET, more frequent (three times a
    day) irrigation was suggested, if needed. The soil type in this blueberry field
    is loamy sand. A smaller amount and more frequent application might be needed
    for the fields that have sandy soil. For finer texture soils, irrigating once
    a day with large volume application might be adequate as they have a large water
    holding capacity. figure 10 Figure 10. Soil moisture monitoring at the existing
    blueberry farmer''s irrigation practice at the blue fruit stage. figure 11 Figure
    11. Soil moisture monitoring of adjusted irrigation practice at the blue fruit
    stage. The total yield/plant and 50-berry weights were collected from this demonstration
    field for both the farmer''s existing irrigation method and the reduced/recommended
    irrigation management. The yield per plant for the farmer''s irrigation method
    and the recommended irrigation management were 552 and 722 g, respectively. There
    were statistical differences between the treatments (p = 0.025). 50-berry weights
    for the farmer''s irrigation method and the recommended irrigation management
    were 87.7 and 93.7 g, respectively. There were statistical differences between
    the treatments (p = 0.013). A potential cause of higher yield in the recommended
    irrigation management could be due to proper irrigation application that reduced
    nutrient leaching below the root zone in the sandy soil. An IoT-based irrigation
    management can help save water while maintaining the same blueberry quality and
    yields as the farmer''s typical irrigation management. 3.5 Irrigation automation
    in a tomato field Figure 12 shows the number of tomatoes that are marketable and
    their total weight from each treatment. The figure shows that there were no statistical
    differences among the treatments in the numbers of marketable tomatoes from the
    2022 growing season (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756). Thus, the production
    and quality of tomatoes were similar from all treatments, but the amount of applied
    irrigation was different. The sensor-based irrigation strategy applied a 30% lower
    amount than the farmer''s irrigation scheduling method, which indicates that the
    farmer could improve their irrigation water use efficiency using the sensor technology.
    An IoT-based automation irrigation management using a soil moisture sensor''s
    recommendation can help to save water by 30% while maintaining the same marketable
    yields and quality of tomatoes as the farmer''s typical irrigation management.
    In addition to conserving water, saving energy by pumping less water reduces farm
    energy costs. Moreover, low energy usage contributes to reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions from agriculture. The primary benefit of an automatic irrigation system
    is that it can save farmers'' time and labor costs in operating the irrigation
    system. figure 12 Figure 12. The total number of marketable tomatoes (A) and the
    total weight of marketable tomatoes from each replication (B). T1 is the farmer''s
    typical irrigation management. T2 is an IoT soil moisture sensor-based irrigation
    recommendation. 4 Conclusion Based on the field demonstration, the IoT-based sensor
    technology has proven to improve irrigation water use efficiency by evaluating
    the farmer''s existing irrigation practices and providing recommendations if needed.
    Providing real-time in-field soil moisture sensor data is helpful in making day-to-day
    irrigation management decisions, especially under unpredictable precipitation
    patterns. Minimizing overirrigation can reduce the risk of nutrients leaching
    below the root zone, ultimately protecting groundwater quality. In future studies,
    more on-farm demonstrations are needed to increase technology adoption. In addition,
    a continuation of extension outreach activities to promote making irrigation management
    decisions based on scientific data is needed. Besides irrigation management, this
    IoT sensor technology can be utilized to help other management practices such
    as nutrient, pesticide, insecticide, frost protection, and plant health monitoring
    (heat and water stress). Therefore, continued efforts to explore the application
    of IoT-based sensor technology in agriculture to combat the effect of climate
    change are needed. LOCOMOS utilizes cellular networks to communicate; however,
    cellular reception may be poor in some rural areas. Other communication network
    systems, such as radio, NB-IoT, and Sigfox, should be explored to overcome the
    signal issues. Moreover, the effectiveness of IoT-based technology should also
    be evaluated in other crop types. The usability of the LOCOMOS technology, including
    the installation technique, software interface, data accessibility, and alert
    systems, needs to be improved to make the technology easy to adopt for farmers.
    Additionally, other potential applications of the LOCOMOS platform, such as wind
    speed for spray drift reduction, soil moisture sensors for irrigation management,
    leaf surface temperature measurement for plant heat stress, and carbon dioxide
    measurement for greenhouse gas emission, should be considered in the future. Concerns
    about agricultural water use have been and will continue to grow due to the effect
    of climate change on agriculture. Because water is a limited resource, technologies
    that improve irrigation water use efficiency will play a significant role in increasing
    agricultural water sustainability. Data availability statement The datasets presented

  description: The paper “IOT WEATHER DATA ACQUISITION AND AUTOMATION SYSTEM” deals
    with presenting a smart device in terms of real-time accumulation of data and
    automation. The core intention is to make life easier and hassle-free. From agriculture
    drones to the defense, real-time data is feeding in every sector of industry to
    make everything automated, more susceptible, and sustainable. Data can be further
    studied to bring out meaningful insights from them. Right on the track, the prototype
    is capable of visualization of data through the internet on many platforms in
    the form of GUI (Graphical User Interface). This prototype uses some sensors like
    DHT11, MQ135, BMP280, Soil moisture, and Flame sensor. 38% Humidity, 32.3 Temperature
    reading provide by the DHT11 during the test. BMP280 sensor shows their readings
    in graphical format. 9% moisture present in the soil, noted during the test through
    the soil moisture sensor. 8% of Hard Particles are present in the atmosphere and
    the Lux value was 89.167 noted during the test with the help of MQ135 and Light
    Intensity sensor. A flame sensor also used in the prototype gives the warning.
    When it senses the flame, and it increases the safety. All data are represented
    through interactive graphs and plots that are easy to interpret. In addition,
    this data is stored in the cloud platform. Which are further fetched into platforms
    like MATLAB, Simulink, and excel sheets for further analysis. Simply connecting
    to the internet, can get their data from anywhere in the world through the API

    of industry to make everything automated, more susceptible, and sustainable. Data
    can be further studied to bring out meaningful insights from them. Right on the
    track, the prototype is capable of visualization of data through the internet
    on many platforms in the form of GUI (Graphical User Interface). This prototype
    uses some sensors like DHT11, MQ135, BMP280, Soil moisture, and Flame sensor.
    38% Humidity, 32.3 Temperature reading provide by the DHT11 during the test. BMP280
    sensor shows their readings in graphical format. 9% moisture present in the soil,
    noted during the test through the soil moisture sensor. 8% of Hard Particles are
    present in the atmosphere and the Lux value was 89.167 noted during the test with
    the help of MQ135 and Light Intensity sensor. A flame sensor also used in the
    prototype gives the warning. When it senses the flame, and it increases the safety.
    All data are represented through interactive graphs and plots that are easy to
    interpret. In addition, this data is stored in the cloud platform. Which are further
    fetched into platforms like MATLAB, Simulink, and excel sheets for further analysis.
    Simply connecting to the internet, can get their data from anywhere in the world
    through the API ports and are supported in many channels like Thing Speak and

  description: Recognition of the importance of soil moisture information to the optimisation
    of water-limited dryland cereal production has led to Australian growers being
    encouraged to make use of soil moisture sensors. However, irrespective of the
    merits of different sensing technologies, only a small soil volume is sensed,
    raising questions as to the utility of such sensors in broadacre cropping, especially
    given spatial variability in soil water holding capacity. Here, using data collected
    from contrasting sites in South Australia and Western Australia over two seasons,
    during which either wheat or barley were grown, we describe a method for extrapolating
    soil moisture information away from the location of a probe using freely-available
    NDVI time series and weather data as covariates. Relationships between soil moisture
    probe data, cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP) and seasonal
    growing degree days (GDD) were significant (P < 0.0001). In turn, these could
    be used to predict soil moisture status for any location within a field on any
    date following crop emergence. However, differences in ΣNDVI between different
    within-field zones did not fully explain differences in the soil moisture from
    multiple sensors located in these zones, resulting in different calibrations being
    required for each sensor or zone and a relatively low accuracy of prediction of
    measured soil moisture (R2adj ~ 0.4–0.7) which may not be sufficient to support
    targeted agronomic decision-making. The results also suggest that at any location
    within a field, the range of variation in soil moisture status down the soil profile
    on any given date will present as greater than the spatial variation in soil moisture
    across the field on that date. Accordingly, we conclude that, in dryland cereal
    cropping, the major value in soil moisture sensors arises from an enhanced ability
    to compare seasons and to relate similarities and differences between seasons
    as a guide to decision-making.

    to the optimisation of water-limited dryland cereal production has led to Australian
    growers being encouraged to make use of soil moisture sensors. However, irrespective
    of the merits of different sensing technologies, only a small soil volume is sensed,
    raising questions as to the utility of such sensors in broadacre cropping, especially
    given spatial variability in soil water holding capacity. Here, using data collected
    from contrasting sites in South Australia and Western Australia over two seasons,
    during which either wheat or barley were grown, we describe a method for extrapolating
    soil moisture information away from the location of a probe using freely-available
    NDVI time series and weather data as covariates. Relationships between soil moisture
    probe data, cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP) and seasonal
    growing degree days (GDD) were significant (P < 0.0001). In turn, these could
    be used to predict soil moisture status for any location within a field on any
    date following crop emergence. However, differences in ΣNDVI between different
    within-field zones did not fully explain differences in the soil moisture from
    multiple sensors located in these zones, resulting in different calibrations being
    required for each sensor or zone and a relatively low accuracy of prediction of
    measured soil moisture (R2adj ~ 0.4–0.7) which may not be sufficient to support
    targeted agronomic decision-making. The results also suggest that at any location
    within a field, the range of variation in soil moisture status down the soil profile
    on any given date will present as greater than the spatial variation in soil moisture
    across the field on that date. Accordingly, we conclude that, in dryland cereal
    cropping, the major value in soil moisture sensors arises from an enhanced ability
    to compare seasons and to relate similarities and differences between seasons
    as a guide to decision-making. Introduction Climate variability and its impact
    on farmer attitudes to risk are key drivers of both profitability and yield gaps
    in Australia’s broadacre dryland cereal cropping systems (Hochman & Horan, 2018;
    Monjardino et al., 2013, 2015; Zhang et al., 2019). This is due primarily to the
    importance of soil moisture to agronomic performance (Kirkegaard et al., 2014)
    and its impact on farmer investment in nitrogen (N; note that, in contrast to
    places like the European Union, farm businesses in Australia do not receive any
    government subsidies). In effect, the N management problem faced by Australian
    farmers boils down to one of: ‘given prevailing and expected seasonal conditions,
    will I have enough soil water available to produce a crop of desired commercial
    yield, and to therefore justify investment in sufficient N to produce it ?’ Because
    soils and their ability to supply a crop with water may be highly spatially variable
    (Rab et al., 2009), fertilizer management based on soil-specific management zones
    and underpinned by Precision Agriculture (PA) technologies, is one response to
    the uncertainty associated with these questions (Monjardino et al., 2013). However,
    the rate of adoption of sensing technologies aimed at supporting targeted, variable-rate,
    N management is low (Bramley & Ouzman, 2019). A possible reason for this is that
    the development of such sensors as aids to N management (e.g. Raun et al., 2005)
    has generally failed to recognise the complex multivariate nature of the drivers
    of crop response to N and its profitability (Colaço & Bramley, 2018). For example,
    Colaço and Bramley (2019) have highlighted the need to incorporate consideration
    of site and seasonal variation, and their consequences for soil moisture status,
    into the calibration and use of sensors to assist with N management. Indeed, where
    the optimisation of N management is a key goal, the need to factor soil moisture
    status into the decision-making process is critical (Lawes et al., 2019). The
    importance of soil moisture as a primary determinant of yield potential is a major
    reason why cereal growers in Australia’s dryland wheatbelt have been encouraged
    to purchase soil moisture sensors, such as are commonly used to underpin irrigation
    management in winegrape (Nordestgaard, 2019) and other horticultural systems (Montagu
    & Stirzaker, 2008). However, no matter how well these are calibrated, the utility
    of such sensors is arguably constrained by the fact that they sense moisture status
    in a small volume of soil. As a result, their interpretation in the context of
    soil spatial variability at the field and farm scale is potentially problematic
    and somewhat reliant on the development of ‘rules of thumb’, especially given
    the low intensity of field-based characterisation of plant available water capacity
    (PAWC; Dalgleish et al., 2012; see also https://www.apsim.info/apsim-model/apsoil/).
    Accordingly, fewer than a quarter of Australian broadacre dryland cereal growers
    have adopted such sensors, with their use strongly skewed towards the eastern
    states of Australia and otherwise more focussed in higher rainfall areas (Bramley
    & Ouzman, 2019). Furthermore, of the approximately 500 dryland farmer clients
    of one provider of soil sensing services, around 70% have just a single sensor
    on their farm (L. Wilksch, Agbyte—pers. comm.) which is likely to be around 2,500
    ha in area (Bramley & Ouzman, 2019). Methods of extrapolating soil moisture probe
    data away from the location of the probe are therefore of considerable interest,
    as is the question of how useful being able to do this is in the context of supporting
    PA, including targeted on-farm decision-making such as variable rate N application.
    Our objective in the present work was to develop a method for extrapolating soil
    moisture probe data to other parts of a field and so enable it to be interpreted
    throughout the field. The method relies on a combination of freely available satellite
    and weather data, along with a simple understanding of crop phenology and which,
    as such, should be readily implementable. We also consider the utility of the
    information generated by this method in light of the results obtained when it
    is implemented at two contrasting sites in the Australian grainbelt. Methods and
    materials Sites Development and initial testing of the methodology (see below)
    was done using data collected in 2019 and 2020 from a 64 ha field located near
    Tarlee in the mid-north of South Australia, where annual rainfall is in the 425–525
    mm range. As reported by Colaço et al. (2023), the growing season rainfall at
    this site was 218 mm in 2019 and 352 mm in 2020, whilst the mean yields achieved
    were 3.5 t/ha wheat in 2019 and 7.5 t/ha barley in 2020. Several years of yield
    maps and an electromagnetic soil survey (Fig. 1a) promoted the delineation of
    three zones (Taylor et al., 2007) within the field (Fig. 1b). The soils in zone
    1 are deep (> 1 m) black cracking vertosols (ASRIS, 2011). Those in zone 2 are
    a mix of a shallower variant of these black soils and the red vertosols that are
    common in the district, often with calcrete layers in the subsoil, the occurrence
    of which ranges in depth from around 40–80 cm. The soils in zone 3 are much shallower
    (generally < 80 cm) red calcarosols with more loamy textures, again with calcrete
    in the subsoil, often occurring as shallow as 35 cm. Notwithstanding the different
    soils in each zone, the average soil clay content in the top 30 cm derived from
    21 soil sample locations (Fig. 1a; Colaço et al., 2023) was 38.8%. A soil moisture
    capacitance probe (EnviroPro EP100G-L-12, Entelechy Pty Ltd, Golden Grove, SA
    5125, Australia) was installed in each zone. The locations of these were conditioned
    by the need for them to be located within ~ 15 m of the fence line to enable access
    to power and avoid interference with farm machinery, but they were otherwise located
    to reflect the different zones (Fig. 1b). Note that these probes measure soil
    moisture within a field of influence of 55 mm from the wall of the probe. As such,
    they are specified to assess soil moisture status in a total soil volume of 19.2
    L. A soil moisture characterisation (Burk & Dalgliesh, 2013) was undertaken at
    a location close to (within ~ 15 m) each probe for estimation of plant available
    water capacity (PAWC), and samples were also collected close to the position of
    the probe in ad hoc time series for probe calibration. As part of other work on
    N decision making (Colaço et al., 2023), samples were also collected from the
    21 locations distributed across the field (Fig. 1a) close to growth stage GS31
    (Zadoks, 1974). In all cases, gravimetric soil moisture content was determined
    using oven drying at 105 °C for not less than 48 h. Other aspects of soil characterisation
    (estimation of bulk density and PAWC, etc.) were as described by Burk and Dalgleish
    (2013). Fig. 1 The 64 ha field near Tarlee in the mid-North region of South Australia

    zones. c–f Cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI) at either approximately GS31 or in late September
    in each of 2019 and 2020 Full size image Further testing of the methodology described
    below made use of a contrasting 358 ha field located near Kalannie in Western
    Australia. Here, the soils are predominantly Kandosols (ASRIS, 2011), non-calcareous,
    and with no marked texture contrast down the profile, with a mean clay content
    in the top 30 cm of 11.7%, with some Chromosols (ASRIS, 2011) also present. The
    latter have a marked texture contrast with 10.0% clay in the top 10 cm and 37.3%
    at 30 cm; overall, the mean clay content in the top 30 cm in this field was 17.2%
    (Colaço et al., 2023). Growing season rainfall at this site was 194 mm in 2019
    and 162 mm in 2020, with mean yields of wheat achieved of 2.2 and 2.5 t/ha in
    2019 and 2020 respectively (Colaço et al., 2023). Data and rationale The method
    developed here relies on the ability to predict biomass from a time series of
    NDVI (Perry et al., 2022a, 2022b) coupled with the basic dependence of cereal
    crop phenology on temperature and water availability (Flohr et al., 2017). In
    particular, it is enabled by the observation that, during a cropping season, cumulative
    NDVI (ΣNDVI) obtained from the time series closely matches crop biomass accumulation
    (Perry et al., 2022a, 2022b). Since soil moisture status is a strong driver of
    crop biomass, the objective here was to see whether ΣNDVI could be used as a spatio-temporal
    covariate to enable extrapolation of soil moisture probe data away from the probe
    to other locations within a field during the growing season. In brief, for both
    sites, publicly available Level-2A orthorectified and atmospherically corrected
    surface reflectance imagery obtained from the Sentinel-2A and B multispectral
    instrument was downloaded using the Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017)
    for dates covering the growing season in 2019 and 2020. Note that such imagery
    can be obtained at no cost, making it an attractive basis for the approach used
    here. Following removal of images that were affected by cloud cover and/or cloud
    shadows, the retained images were fitted, on a per pixel basis (each pixel is
    10 m × 10 m), with a smooth function to describe the NDVI time series during the
    growing season (Perry et al., 2022a, 2022b). Since NDVI is reflective of the amount
    of photosynthetically active biomass, it has values of approximately zero at sowing,
    rises slowly following crop emergence and then more steeply during the main period
    of vegetative growth, before reaching a plateau mid-season and then declining
    as the crop matures (Fig. 2a). As described by Perry et al., (2022a, 2022b), from
    the function fitted to the useable NDVI time series, daily values of NDVI were
    estimated for each pixel and from these, ΣNDVI calculated, again on a daily time
    step. As seen in Fig. 2b, and consistent with the foregoing, ΣNDVI increases slowly
    before rising more steeply and reaching a maximum immediately prior to senescence.
    The output from this process is the ability to generate maps of ΣNDVI for any
    day in the growing season, as shown in Fig. 1c–f; here, we have focussed on a
    date corresponding to GS31 (Zadoks, 1974) when a grower might be considering a
    mid-season N application, and a date in late September when a grower might be
    considering whether there is sufficient soil moisture to finish a crop, or whether
    it might be better to cut the crop for hay. Fig. 2 Change in a NDVI and b cumulative
    NDVI (ΣNDVI) with days after sowing for the location corresponding to the soil
    moisture probe located in zone 1 (Fig. 1) in 2020 Full size image Daily temperature,
    rainfall and evaporation data were downloaded from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM;
    http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). For the South Australian site, which is
    approximately halfway between Clare (BOM station 23021) and Roseworthy (21131),
    data for the weather stations at these locations were accessed and mean values
    calculated. These Clare-Roseworthy means were assumed to provide a representative
    reflection of seasonal conditions at this SA site. For the site in Western Australian,
    BOM station 10070 (Kalannie) was used. Again, these data are available at no cost.
    Crop phenology is highly temperature-driven and accordingly, the aforementioned
    daily temperature data were used to calculate the season growing degree days (GDD;
    base of 0 °C) with time-zero defined by the date of sowing. Since GDD provides
    a cumulative measure of temperature, and given the use of ΣNDVI in this work as
    a biomass predictor, rather than relying solely on daily rainfall to reflect the
    water impact on crop growth, we instead focussed on net precipitation (NP; i.e.
    daily rainfall—daily evaporation) and, to be consistent with the cumulative nature
    of GDD, calculated cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP). Soil moisture data were
    downloaded from the probes on a daily time step with all dates converted to a
    ‘days after sowing’ (DAS) basis. Three probes were used at the South Australian
    site (Fig. 1) with the Western Australian site equipped with a single probe. Statistical
    analysis and mapping From the above, and on a daily time step, we had a dataset
    comprising the following: For each study field as a whole, daily temperature,
    rainfall, GDD, NP, ΣNP, and on a per pixel basis within these fields, ΣNDVI; at
    each soil probe location, in addition to the aforementioned data, we also had
    the soil moisture probe data to a depth of 1 m in increments of 10 cm. Note that
    for the purposes of our analysis, the daily weather indices were assumed to be
    spatially invariant throughout the field. We also acknowledge the difference in
    area between a single pixel in the NDVI Imagery and the much smaller area around
    which the probe was sensing soil moisture status (within 55m of the probe wall).
    Whilst this is certainly a source of error in our approach, we do not believe
    it has a material impact on the utility or otherwise of these data of differing
    areal support, as may be inferred from the results presented below. Relationships
    between the soil moisture and other data were explored using normal and stepwise
    multiple linear regression in JMP (v. 16.0, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA),
    which was also used for other statistical analysis. For the prediction of soil
    moisture probe data, our working model was: $$\\Theta_{{{\\text{v}},p,d,t}} =
    a_{d} + b_{d} .\\Sigma {\\text{NDVI}}_{p,t} + c_{d} .\\Sigma {\\text{NP}}_{t}
    + e_{d} .{\\text{GDD}}_{t}$$ (1) where Θv,p,d,t is the volumetric soil moisture
    content (%) recorded by probe p (p = 1…3), at depth d (d = 0…100 cm in increments
    of 10 cm), on t days after sowing; ΣNDVIp,t is the value of ΣNDVI in the pixel
    that is co-incident with the location of probe p, on day t after sowing; ΣNPt
    and GDDt are the values of ΣNP and GDD on day t; and a, b, c and e are parameters
    which are specific for each depth increment (d). Subsequently, following crop
    emergence (i.e. once there is a measurable NDVI), for each soil depth increment
    of interest (d), on any day (t), and at any location (xy) in the field, we sought
    to predict Θv as: $$\\Theta_{{{\\text{v}},{\\text{xy}},d,t}} = a_{d} + b_{d} .\\Sigma
    {\\text{NDVI}}_{xy,t} + c_{d} .\\Sigma {\\text{NP}}_{t} + e_{d} .{\\text{GDD}}_{t}$$
    (2) where, for any depth (d), the parameters a, b, c and e take the values obtained
    from Eq. (1). At the WA site, where we only had access to one soil moisture probe,
    Eq. (2) was applied across the entire field. However, at the SA site, where three
    probes were available (Fig. 1), Eq. 1 was generated separately for each probe
    and consequently, it was also possible to apply three discrete versions of Eq.
    (2), one specific to each probe. This also meant that at the SA site, we could
    also constrain the locations (xy) for which Eq. 2 was applied to a zone-specific
    basis and explore the merits of averaging the predictions of Θv,xy,d,t generated
    by the 3 probes for the entire field. The results of exploration of Eqs. (1) and
    (2) were used, along with raw soil moisture data (see below), as inputs to map
    display and analysis which was done using the ArcGIS software suite (v. 10.8.2;
    ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). For the SA site, evaluation of the utility of soil moisture
    predictions derived from Eq. (2) was done using samples collected from the 21
    locations shown in Fig. 1a on 7 August 2019 and 28 July 2020 as part of other
    work reported by Colaço et al. (2023); these were the only dates during the growing
    season for which we had actual soil moisture measurements. Values of ΣNDVIxy,t,
    ΣNPt and GDDt pertinent to these dates were used to generate estimates of soil
    moisture content (Eq. 2) and these were regressed against measured soil moisture
    using simple linear regression. A similar approach was used for the WA site where
    soil moisture was measured in samples collected on 20 August 2019 and 14 August
    2020. Results For the SA site (Fig. 1), ΣNDVI, ΣNP and GDD were all significant
    predictors (P < 0.0001) of soil moisture probe data logged by the probe in zone
    1 at a depth of 20 cm across the two seasons (2019–2020) when either normal or
    stepwise multiple linear regression was used (R2adj = 0.87; Fig. 3); that is,
    Eq. (1) was found to be useful. When Eq. (1) was run on a per season basis, the
    result improved markedly in 2019 (R2adj = 0.99), compared to 2020 (R2adj = 0.82),
    most likely due to the effect of aberrant mid-season rainfall events in 2020 (Fig.
    3). When the analysis was repeated for all depth increments, R2 for the predictions
    ranged from 0.78–0.99 in 2019, 0.62–0.83 in 2020 and 0.59–0.85 for both years
    combined (P < 0.0001 in all cases). In other words, the time series of ΣNDVI along
    with ΣNP and GDD could faithfully reproduce the time series of soil moisture status
    logged by the probe. Similar results were obtained for the probes located in zones
    2 and 3 (Fig. 1b) and for the WA site (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the parameters ad,
    bd, cd and ed derived for each probe location could be used, along with the ΣNDVI
    imagery, to implement Eq. (2) and so extrapolate predicted soil moisture status
    across the entire field in depth increments of 10 cm—that is, for every pixel
    (xy) in the ΣNDVI imagery, on any date (t), using data from any of the probes
    (p) as input (Figs. 5, 6). Fig. 3 Prediction of soil moisture probe data at 20

    a normal and b stepwise multiple linear regression over both seasons and c, d

    Note that a logger error meant that some data were missing in the period from
    approximately 45–70 days after sowing Full size image Fig. 5 Prediction of within-field
    soil moisture variation at GS31 in 2019 (22 July; 68 days after sowing) in a 64
    ha field in the mid-North of South Australia using cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative
    net precipitation (ΣNP) and season growing degree days (GDD) and data logged by
    soil moisture probes (green triangles) located in each of three zones (Fig. 1).
    Predictions are shown in 10 cm increments down the profile (0–100 cm) Full size
    image Fig. 6 Prediction of within-field soil moisture variation on 14 September
    2019 (130 days after sowing) in a 358 ha field near Kalannie in Western Australia
    using cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP) and season growing
    degree days (GDD) and data logged by a soil moisture probe located close to the
    edge of the field. Predictions are shown in 10 cm increments down the profile
    (0–100 cm) Full size image Figures 5, 6 suggest that when within-field variation
    in soil moisture is predicted using a single probe, variation in the estimated
    soil moisture content down the profile is greater than the within-field spatial
    variation in soil moisture content at any individual depth. At the SA site, this
    is despite the fact that soil characterisation highlighted the differences between
    the soils at the three probe locations. Thus, PAWC to a depth of 50 cm (below
    which no roots were observed during the study) was estimated at 60.2 and 77.4
    mm in zones 1 and 2. In zone 3, it was only possible to determine PAWC (30.5 mm)
    to a depth of 40 cm due to interference from calcrete and calcareous stones; PAWC
    to the same 40 cm depth in zones 1 and 2 was measured at 58.5 and 72.2 mm. Given
    the existence of the three zones at the SA site (Fig. 1) and these measured differences
    in PAWC, it is of no surprise that the predictions of soil moisture status over
    the entire field based on individual zone-based probes also differed (Fig. 5)
    a result which, even assuming that all probes were equally well installed and
    calibrated to the soil conditions at each probe location, may present a dilemma
    for farmers purchasing such sensors. Note also that, as part of the soil characterisations,
    we found that the calibration of probe data against measured soil moisture was
    strongest at shallower depths (not shown). Given the difficulties presented by
    the shallow and stony nature of soil in zone 3, along with the observation that
    probe calibration against measured soil water over the season (not shown) was
    better at shallower depths, calibration of predicted (extrapolated) soil moisture
    determined using Eq. (2) against measurements made at 21 locations (Fig. 1a) was
    confined to samples taken from the top 30 cm only. Figure 7 shows the derivation
    of ‘average’ and ‘zone-based’ maps for the SA site at GS31 in 2019. To calculate
    these, each probe-specific implementation of Eq. (2) for the whole field (Fig.
    5) was adjusted using calibrations generated for each probe based on the volumetric
    water content of samples collected at each probe site during the season in 10
    cm depth increments, and an average map was calculated across the three probes.
    The zone-based maps were derived from the same calibration-adjusted maps but using
    the selection of just those portions of each probe-specific map delimited by the
    zones (i.e. values of xy; Eq. 2) identified in Fig. 1b. One consequence of the
    zone-based approach is an apparent over-emphasis of between-zone soil differences
    by ‘hard boundaries’ between zones (Fig. 7). These are much less evident in the
    maps of ΣNDVI (Fig. 1c-f) which, nevertheless, do reflect any effects of between-zone
    differences on the crop. Nonetheless, the ‘average’ and ‘zone-based’ maps (Fig.
    7) were used as the basis for evaluation of Eq. (2) by comparison with actual
    measurements of soil moisture made at 21 locations throughout the field (Fig.
    1a) on 7 August 2019 and 28 July 2020. Note that, whereas hitherto, all soil moisture
    data used here (probe data and for probe calibration) were expressed on a volumetric
    basis, at the 21 sampling points (Fig. 1a), at which bulk density was not determined,
    soil moisture was determined on a gravimetric basis only. However, at each soil
    moisture probe location, a strong linear relationship was evident between volumetric
    and gravimetric soil moisture. Fig. 7 Average and zone-based soil moisture maps
    at GS 31 (22 July; 68 days after sowing) in 2019 at the SA site derived from probe-specific
    maps (Fig. 5) following adjustment based on the calibration for individual probes
    against actual soil moisture for each depth at each probe location (green triangles)
    Full size image In spite of between-zone soil differences being reflected in both
    NDVI and ΣNDVI (Fig. 1c-f), at our SA site, values of R2adj for regressions of
    observed against predicted soil moisture suggest that zone-based prediction (c.f.
    Figure 7) of mid-season soil moisture was markedly better than predictions based
    on single probes (Fig. 8). They were also better than the average prediction from
    three zone-based probes (not shown). Furthermore, if a single probe-based implementation
    of Eq. (2) was used for the prediction over the whole field (i.e. all xy), it
    made no difference which one of the three available probes was used. This last
    result makes sense given that on any date, the same ΣNDVI image and values of
    ΣNP and GDD are used as input, such that a simple linear transformation reflects
    the effect of between-probe differences in the actual prediction. Similarly, given
    the close linear relationship between gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture
    at any depth, there was no difference in the accuracy of prediction between gravimetric
    or volumetric soil moisture. Fig. 8 Calibration of measures of gravimetric soil
    moisture against predictions of volumetric soil moisture at a–c the SA and d WA
    sites derived from soil moisture sensor data at either a–c 20 cm or d 30 cm depth,
    cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP) and season growing
    degree days (GDD). a August 7, 2019, top 10 cm predicted from the sensor in zone
    1; b July 28, 2020, top 30 cm predicted from the sensor in zone 2; c both dates
    (2019, red; 2020 blue), top 10 cm using zone-based predictions derived from the
    sensors in each of zones 1–3 (Figs. 1b and 7); d 20 August, 2019, top 30 cm. In
    a, b and d, the predictions derived from sensor calibrations developed for the
    year of measurement only (c.f. Figure 3c–d). In c the prediction derived from
    calibrations developed over both years of the study combined Full size image There
    was no substantive difference in the accuracy of prediction of actual gravimetric
    soil moisture using relationships derived from either one (Fig. 3c) or two years
    of probe data (Fig. 3a, b). At the SA site, R2adj for zone-based prediction of
    soil moisture at the 21 locations in 2019 (Fig. 1a) was marginally better when
    the two-year prediction was used rather than that specific to 2019 (0.75 compared
    to 0.73 for the 0–10 cm depth; P < 0.0001 in both cases); in 2020, the season
    specific prediction was marginally better (R2adj of 0.54 and 0.56; P < 0.0001).
    Over the two years together (7 August 2019 and 28 July 2020; Fig. 8c) the two-year
    prediction was slightly better (R2adj of 0.69, P < 0.0001) than when season-specific
    predictions were used (R2adj of 0.67, P < 0.0001). However, as indicated by Fig.
    8a,b, when only a single probe was available, the accuracy of soil moisture prediction
    was generally not sufficient (R2adj of approx. 0.4) to regard the extrapolation
    method (i.e. Eq. 2) as a satisfactory alternative to direct measurement if accurate
    estimates of soil moisture status are required. In other words, in variable fields,
    multiple, zone-based probes are required. Notwithstanding the lower range of soil
    moisture variation in the typically drier, sandy, topsoils at the WA site (Fig.
    6), and that only one probe was available, the results obtained there were similar.
    However, presumably due to the lower water holding capacity at the WA site and
    the effect of evaporative demand on sandy topsoil moisture contents, a better
    prediction was obtained using probe data from 30 cm depth at this site (Fig. 8d)
    than at shallower depths (not shown), as used for the SA site (Fig. 8a–c). Discussion
    Our objective here was to see whether we could extrapolate soil moisture probe
    data away from the location of a probe, and so make it useful for dryland cereal
    growers as input to targeted (i.e. site-specific) management at the within-field
    scale. It is clear from Figs. 5 and 6 that, in general (i.e. for any probe or
    any date), variation in the estimated soil moisture content down the profile is
    considerably greater than the within-field spatial variation in soil moisture
    content at any individual depth—when within-field variation in soil moisture is
    predicted using a single probe. At a site such as our Western Australian site
    (Fig. 6), which does not exhibit marked soil variation either spatially or down
    the profile, it might therefore be concluded that being able to extrapolate soil
    moisture away from the location of a probe to other parts of a paddock may not
    inspire a targeted decision—at either GS31 or late in September—because for any
    depth, the magnitude of spatial variation in soil moisture is only a few %. The
    same conclusion might be drawn at the South Australian site (Fig. 5) if only a
    single probe were available—as is the case in most instances of soil moisture
    sensors being used by Australian dryland cereal growers. However, as both Figs.
    7 and 8 illustrate, in our SA field in which marked soil variation is apparent
    and expressed in the existence of management zones, the use of a single soil moisture
    probe may be misleading in similarly suggesting that soil moisture variation down
    the profile is greater than its spatial variation at field scale, with the latter
    more appropriately highlighted by the use of zone-based probes. We suspect that
    for reasons of cost, along with the effort required for sensor calibration against
    site conditions, data management and analysis, dryland broadacre cereal growers
    are unlikely to want to pursue zone-based use of soil moisture sensors, especially
    given the accuracy of prediction illustrated here (Fig. 8). In other words, they
    are unlikely to perceive the value of the information provided by multiple probes
    as sufficient to warrant investment in them (Bramley & Ouzman, 2019). This may
    especially be the case at drier sandier sites, such as our WA field (Fig. 6, 8d).
    In general, therefore, and notwithstanding that our method provides a means of
    extrapolating away from the location of a probe, we conclude that the primary
    value in using soil moisture sensing in most dryland cereal cropping situations
    is likely to be in comparing seasons, and in understanding differences between
    them, rather than informing a targeted decision in-season. Thus, such sensors
    assist growers in assessing how similar this year is to last year or the year
    before in terms of water availability to a crop and so enable such similarities
    or contrasts to be factored into agronomic decision-making, such as in relation
    to mid-season N management, or the ability to finish a crop. Likewise, as demonstrated
    by Colaço and Bramley (2019), they may provide critical information to enable
    value to be accrued from other sensing technologies which are otherwise hamstrung
    by their present univariate approach to agronomic decision support. Indeed, and
    in respect of N management, the over-simplification of the myriad of agronomic
    and business factors which impact on an N decision in mechanistic crop models
    is arguably a major reason why data-driven approaches to decision making using
    machine learning have recently been shown to outperform such mechanistic approaches
    (Colaço et al., 2021, 2023) and thereby deliver benefits to growers from both
    profit enhancement and error reduction perspectives (Colaço et al., 2023). Recent
    research (He et al., ) has pursued an inverse modelling approach, first attempted
    by Florin et al. (2011), for the estimation of PAWC using crop yield data, derived
    either from yield monitors or simulated using APSIM (Holzworth et al., 2015).
    This work has demonstrated that PAWC can be reliably predicted using such an approach
    and might therefore inform targeted management in broadacre cropping systems.
    Of course, it contrasts from the present study by focussing on spatial variation
    in the ‘size of the bucket’ (i.e. PAWC) rather than ‘how full the bucket is’.
    In our calibration of extrapolated against measured soil water status at the SA
    site, inclusion of a surrogate measure of PAWC provided by electromagnetic soil
    survey as a covariate did not improve prediction of soil water status, in spite
    of the results of a preliminary analysis (not shown) which suggested that the
    ECa data used as a part of the initial zone delineation (Fig. 1a), were correlated
    to PAWC. However, the integration of the present approach with that of Florin
    et al. (2011) and He et al. (2021, 2022) would enable understanding of spatial
    variation in not only the size of the bucket, but also how full the bucket is.
    Such information could indeed inform targeted agronomic decision making and is
    therefore worthy of further research. In the absence of soil modification, PAWC
    is a static variable; soil moisture status is dynamic. Two obvious significant
    limitations of the present method therefore are that it only works during the
    season (i.e. when there is measurable NDVI), and that in the absence of improved
    weather forecasting, or even an ability to predict NDVI, its utility remains limited
    by lack of knowledge as to how the season might evolve. This first of these limitations
    means that the method cannot be used to inform a sowing decision, which is a key
    area of interest for growers. Whilst the second limitation can be partially overcome
    by continual updating of ΣNDVI and weather data, the ability to predict a dry
    finish, which may render a targeted mid-season decision worthless, remains elusive.
    It is for these kinds of reasons that alternative approaches to so-called ‘now-casting’
    (Wimalathunge & Bishop, 2023) are the subject of much current effort. That of
    Wimalathunge and Bishop (2019) draws on the integration of water balance modelling
    with soil and weather information. It is currently limited by the resolution of
    available soil information (Han et al., 2022), and to support targeted decision-making,
    is likely reliant on farmers paying for bespoke digital soil maps of their farms
    at high spatial resolution (Wimalathunge & Bishop, 2023). The cost of these therefore
    makes the approach of He et al. (2021, 2022), perhaps combined with the present
    approach, an attractive one. Whilst the utility of ‘now-casting’ is likely to
    remain somewhat constrained by inability to predict the future, understanding
    how much soil water is available in real time, is clearly valuable for risk management
    (Monjardino et al., 2015). Overall, the integration of the present approach with
    those of He et al. (2021, 2022) and Wimalathunge and Bishop (2019, 2023), as multivariate
    input to a machine learning-based, data-driven tool (Colaço et al., 2021, 2023;
    Lawes et al., 2019; Richetti et al., 2023) may offer the best way forward. Finally,
    we note that both the development and evaluation of our method was confined to
    fields in which wheat or barley was grown. Whilst the performance of other crops
    such as canola, lentils or lupins is also known to be reflected by NDVI, additional
    work will be required to evaluate the method for these crops if there is interest
    in using it when such crops are being grown. Similarly, exploration of the method
    for use in irrigated systems across a range of cereal and horticultural crops
    may well be of value. Conclusions Using cumulative NDVI, season growing degree
    days and cumulative net precipitation as covariates, extrapolation of soil moisture
    probe data to any location within a field on any day within a growing season is
    possible. However, the utility of being able to do this is of questionable value
    to farmers interested in targeted variable rate management, both in fields with
    limited soil variation, and also in those with well defined soil zones, but which
    do not have a probe in each zone. Accordingly, the main benefit of soil moisture
    sensors to dryland cereal growers is likely confined to better understanding seasonal
    variation in soil moisture and its implications for differential management between
    different cropping seasons. However, greater value from such technology may accrue
    through integration with other approaches to better understanding field scale
    variation in soil moisture. Data availability Since this work was conducted on
    private farms, the data are not being made publicly available. However, the authors
    will consider reasonable requests for access to the data, subject also to the
    permission of the collaborating farmers. References ASRIS (2011). Australian Soil

  description: Irrigation system is widely used in agriculture sector and has significant
    impacts to the growth of the plantation or crops. Traditional method of irrigation
    system always counter problems such as time consuming, human labour cost, inefficient
    of water usage and monitoring challenging throughout the process. Thus to address
    the issues, this paper proposed the development of smart irrigation system that
    embedded various types of sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) platform used for
    monitoring plant growth. In this work, there are three module have been developed
    which are hardware, software and integration module of the proposed system. In
    hardware module, Raspberry Pi is used to calculate and process the data based
    on the sensors parameters. Different types of sensors have been employed such
    as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, ultrasonic and vision sensors. In this
    framework, the reading of soil moisture sensor was obtained from the base station.
    The Raspberry Pi will receive the information and starts to pump the water from
    the tank until the condition of soil moisture content is normal (i.e. reach the
    threshold value). In addition, the DHT22 sensor will act as the monitoring system
    in terms of temperature and humidity data. While, the ultrasonic sensor will send
    the information to the microprocessor and calculate the water level. Furthermore,
    the webcam vision is used for monitoring the plant growth during the day and night.
    While, the dripping process runs in real-time application to the plant. The microcontroller
    ESP8266 used to control the state of ON or OFF light bulb depending on the value
    of LDR sensor. Based on the results and monitoring process, the proposed smart
    irrigation system able to works in promising environment with real time data in
    which it has been monitored through the IoT platform.

  key_findings: The developed smart irrigation system was able to monitor various
    plant growth parameters in real-time, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and plant health. The system's use of sensors allowed for the precise control
    of water distribution, optimizing water usage and improving plant growth.
  limitations: The study focuses on a specific smart irrigation system rather than
    addressing the deployment of heterogeneous networks of IoT sensors in general.
    It does not provide a comprehensive analysis of different types of sensors or
    network configurations for data collection.
  main_objective: To propose and develop a smart irrigation system using various sensors
    and an IoT platform to monitor plant growth and optimize water usage.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper has medium relevance to the point of discussion
    regarding the deployment of heterogeneous networks of IoT sensors for data collection
    in automated irrigation systems. The study focuses on developing a smart irrigation
    system that includes a variety of sensors to monitor soil moisture and other parameters,
    although it does not specifically address the deployment of a heterogeneous network
    as mentioned in the outline. However, the system's use of sensors to collect real-time
    data on soil moisture is in line with the intent of the point.

  description: Efficient irrigation is essential for sustainable food production and
    regional water security. Temperature measurements provide information about crop
    water status, which allows the estimation of water needs and precise irrigation
    scheduling. This paper proposes a technology for agricultural irrigation management
    that combines cost-effective implementation with the ability to map crop canopy
    temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on a center pivot.
    The technology integrates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability options,
    IoT capabilities, and web data availability, enabling precise plant water stress
    quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content. It facilitates
    real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion, with canopy
    temperature sensors providing accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C without additional
    calibration. Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) and
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models were trained to predict irrigation
    prescriptions, achieving Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE < 4.18 mm) and correlation
    coefficient (r^2 > 0.82). This technology will allow the definition of real-time
    and site-specific prescriptions for variable-rate irrigation systems using infrared
    temperature sensors. Future work includes exploring LoRaWAN technologies, implementing
    a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), improving spatial resolution
    with data fusion algorithms, refining irrigation prescription models, reducing
    sensor costs and developing models considering soil and crop effects.

  explanation: 'This study is developing an integrated system for remote sensing of
    crop canopy temperature using wireless sensor networks to map the spatial distribution
    of crop water status in real-time and prescribe irrigation application rates accordingly.
    The approach employs a heterogeneous network of infrared thermometers (IRT) to
    accurately measure canopy temperature in °C, which can be used for automated irrigation
    decisions based on crop water stress. The specific points of the paper this response
    format focuses on are:

  extract_1: Efficient irrigation is essential for sustainable food production and
    regional water security [1]. For this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has
    achieved significant progress in water management and crop production using technological
    advances in software and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable
    management of water resources, which involves the application of water to the
    crop to meet specific plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components

    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are
    half of the major and minor axis of the ellipse and is the height of the IRT sensor
    with respect to the soil. Download : Download high-res image (373KB) Download

    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the

    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    allowed the definition of , (Span1 distance) and (Span2 distance) coordinates,
    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).
    (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number,
    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

  description: The fundamental principle of the paper is that the soil moisture sensor
    obtains the moisture content level of the soil sample. The water pump is automatically
    activated if the moisture content is insufficient, which causes water to flow
    into the soil. The water pump is immediately turned off when the moisture content
    is high enough. Smart home, smart city, smart transportation, and smart farming
    are just a few of the new intelligent ideas that internet of things (IoT) includes.
    The goal of this method is to increase productivity and decrease manual labour
    among farmers. In this paper, we present a system for monitoring and regulating
    water flow that employs a soil moisture sensor to keep track of soil moisture
    content as well as the land’s water level to keep track of and regulate the amount
    of water supplied to the plant. The device also includes an automated led lighting

  description: 'This article is an introduction to the "Advances in Irrigation" Special
    Collection in this issue of Transactions ASABE and the next issue of Applied Engineering
    in Agriculture, consisting of 14 articles selected from 88 papers and presentations
    at the ASABE 5th Decennial National Irrigation Symposium, which was held in December
    2010 in Phoenix, Arizona. This symposium followed the objectives of the previous
    four decennial events to provide a forum to assess the progress of research endeavors
    to advance the effectiveness of irrigation practices during the past ten years,
    leading to further research priorities in light of future challenges. The articles
    in this Special Collection address a wide range of topics grouped into broad categories:
    microirrigation, center-pivot irrigation, crop water use for improved irrigation
    management, and smart irrigation controllers for landscape irrigation. While these
    articles are not inclusive of all irrigation work since the last decennial symposium,
    they provide an example of work considered important by researchers, funding agencies,
    and other stakeholders. Many aspects of irrigation have changed since the first
    symposium in 1970. Although microirrigation is a small proportion of irrigated
    acreage, it will continue to increase in highly technical commercial food and
    fiber production as well as in subsistence farming. Center-pivot irrigation systems
    have been an important tool to deliver water more efficiently in diverse settings.
    Advanced telemetry and control systems, developed during the past ten years, are
    now common options for center pivots, but challenges remain in integrating these
    hardware developments into crop management practices. Possibilities are emerging
    for adding monitoring devices to center pivots to match crop water needs with
    water delivery. Energy balance models continue to be refined as tools to estimate
    crop water use from both ground-based and satellite-based data. Evapotranspiration
    estimates are evolving from single-location weather stations to whole-field or
    regional scopes. Finally, smart irrigation controllers have coupled evapotranspiration
    estimation or soil water sensing with automated irrigation system water delivery.
    These controllers can increase the precision of irrigation to match crop or landscape
    water needs. Irrigation will continue to be an important practice for producing
    the world''s food. The irrigation research and education professions will need
    to respond to food production challenges with even more refined irrigation systems
    and water management in the next ten years. However, research investment in irrigation
    continues to decline while important issues exist, such as maintaining agricultural
    profitability with declining water supplies, integrating sensor-based information
    for real-time autonomous or semi-autonomous management, competition for limited
    water supplies between agriculture and other sectors, increasing energy cost,
    environmental impacts of irrigation, and use of alternative (i.e., lower quality)
    water sources for irrigation. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological

  description: Over the past decade, there has been sustained research in the Internet
    of Things (IoT), significantly contributing to health, retail, transport, logistics,
    security, and agriculture. Device-enabling platforms have an incredibly strategic
    advantage of enabling related IoT growth. This technology is largely handled through
    cloud computing, where the raw generated data from IoT sensors are stored and
    computed for decision making, irrespective of the application areas. The adoption
    of IoT in agriculture faces numerous challenges such as latency, energy, bandwidth,
    and storage cost. These issues will affect sustainable agricultural activities
    such as live decision making, prediction, monitoring, and controlling of farming
    activities. These issues can be addressed by integrating edge computing technology
    with IoT-enabled monitoring devices. The edge computing framework needs to be
    designed for the rapid identification of methods for deployment in the field.
    The edge computing agricultural framework will act as middleware between the cloud
    and IoT sensors; it would serve as a medium to fulfill the demands of a real-time
    monitoring system. In the proposed framework, an edge server is designed to predict
    the rainfall locally using the microcomputer Raspberry Pi through the analysis
    of the local environmental and weather parameters. The system is constructed with
    two edge nodes, where one handles the monitoring of the live data such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, humidity, and wind. The other node
    takes care of artificial irrigation according to the local and global weather
    data controlled by the edge server. The edge server stores live data locally and
    sends the average daily analysis data to the ThingSpeak server. Data stored in
    the edge and cloud can be used in the future to increase plant growth, leading
    to increased yield. The proposed framework helps in accurate watering considering
    the local environmental conditions, leading to the sequential evolution of plants
    until the vegetables are fully grown and available for harvest. In this way, an
    edge-based framework for an agricultural system can be used to fill the gaps in
    precision agriculture.

  data_sources: Real-time data collected from a heterogeneous network of IoT sensors
  description: This study proposes an IoT-based smart irrigation management system
    that can optimize water-resource utilization in a smart agricultural system. The
    system uses unsupervised learning-based clustering to predict the irrigation needs
    of a field based on the ground parameters sensed by automated monitoring devices.
    These parameters include soil moisture, light intensity, temperature, and humidity.
    The system extracts feature such as the maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation
    of four soil moisture sensors from the primary dataset of plants. Then, it applies
    lag features to enhance the accuracy of the classification model. The system uploads
    the dataset of 108 features to the Orange GUI and performs k-means clustering
    to assign cluster labels to the data as meta-attributes in a new dataset. The
    study evaluates the system using a month’s worth of data and demonstrates its
    functionality and effectiveness. The system employs machine learning techniques
    such as Random Forest, Neural Network, and kNN, which achieve 100%, 99.9%, and
    99.8% accuracy respectively.

    IEEE Conference Location: New Delhi, India SECTION I. Introduction Soil moisture
    is one of the most fundamental considerations in agriculture because plants rely
    on water available in the soil. Soil moisture indicates the water content in the
    soil, which makes it a critical parameter for decision making in smart irrigation
    systems that leverage sensor data [1]. For measuring soil moisture, time domain
    reflectometry (TDR) [2] is currently considered as one of the most accurate continuous
    monitoring methods. However, the cost of the measurement equipment is $3000 or
    more. Since a high sampling rate is required to obtain detailed characteristics
    of the reflected signal, it is difficult to reduce cost. Alternatively, capacitive
    soil moisture sensors are relatively inexpensive compared to TDR [3], and they
    can be used for soil moisture sensing by correlating the volumetric water content
    (VWC) of the soil and the capacitance of sensor electrodes covered by the soil.
    For instance, the METER Group (previously known as Decagon Devices) commercialized
    capacitive soil moisture sensors that are reasonably accurate and widely used
    in research areas [4]. However, they are still too expensive for farmers to deploy
    on a large scale. Although a prototype of the capacitive-touch-IC-based soil moisture
    sensor has been established [5], it has several issues with regard to size, practical
    operability, and extensibility’ i.e., it has fixed measurement depths and the
    probe cannot be easily exchanged when damaged. In this study, a cost-efficient
    soil monitoring device and network with a small package and detachable sensor
    probe was developed (Fig. 1). This device collects soil moisture data at multiple
    depths and uploads these data to a cloud using a wireless sensor network. By leveraging
    common IC and printed electronics, the cost of the proposed device is reduced
    to 1,000USdollars,whileover 3.000 US dollars will be required with market-available
    sensors and loggers for the same functionality. Fig. 1. Detachable sensor probe
    design incorporates extensibility and quick repairs when the electrodes are damaged.
    Show All SECTION II. Soil Moisture Sensor Design A. Capacitive Sensing Using Constant
    DC Current Source One key idea to fabricate a low-cost soil moisture sensor is
    leveraging the capacitive sensing module for touch sensors in soil moisture sensing.
    Previously, soil moisture was measured at a high frequency, i.e., 70 MHz, for
    high accuracy [6]; this measurement required a high-frequency capacitance measurement
    circuit, which is expensive. On the other hand, capacitive sensing techniques
    are commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and other touch-enabled devices. Owing
    to the rapid growth of the touch interface, the capacitive touch ICs have become
    commodities and relatively inexpensive components. Even if the measurement frequency
    of the capacitive touch IC (50 kHz-3 MHz) is not as high as the desired frequency
    for soil moisture sensing, it is applicable to practical measurements. Thus, capacitive
    touch ICs can be used for affordable soil moisture sensing with reasonable accuracy.
    The sensor measures capacitance with a constant DC current. In this approach,
    the charge time measurement unit (CTMU, Microchip PIC24) works as a constant DC
    current source. It supplies current ( I C ) for a short time (T) to sensor electrodes
    that work as capacitors, and the microcontroller (MCU) measures the corresponding
    voltage ( V T ) . The capacitance of the sensor electrodes C T can then be calculated
    by C T = I C T V T (1) View Source Fig. 2. Sensor electrodes design for 10 and
    20 cm depths. Show All B. Thin Film Sensor Probe A low-cost soil moisture sensor
    was fabricated by printed electronics. Traditional fabrication tools for printed
    circuit boards (PCB) are usually small, and it is costly to produce a large PCB.
    As the proposed sensor is intended to measure depths from 10–20 cm with a single
    probe, the probe length is around 40 cm, including the margin and the above-ground
    part. This is not the desired length for most PCB fabrication processes, and thus,
    it would not be suitable for mass production. Further, printed electronics enable
    roll-to-roll fabrication, which is cost efficient in fabricating large electrical
    circuits on flexible substrates. With this, the sensor electrodes for the soil
    moisture sensor is designed to exploit the potential of printed electronics. As
    shown in Fig. 1, the sensor probe is designed to be easily exchangeable. Since
    the electrodes can be possibly damaged by stone or other soil components, the
    sensor electrodes should be easily exchangeable. During the experimental deployments,
    some of the sensor probes were damaged. However, they could be used again with
    the proposed design. Moreover, when users want to change measurement depths, it
    is easy to exchange the sensor probe with another one. C. Design of Sensor Electrodes
    Capacitance-based soil moisture sensing is employed, and therefore, sensor electrodes
    should be sufficiently large because smaller values of capacitance (e.g., around
    picofarads) are difficult to measure precisely. As far as the measurement frequency
    is not high (<100 MHz) , the size of the electrodes decides the maximum capacitance
    that occurs under a fully wet condition, i.e., in water. On the other hand, the
    electrode pattern affects the minimum capacitance that occurs under a fully dried
    condition, i.e., in the air. Detailed patterns, such as in interdigital capacitors,
    contribute mostly to the minimum capacitance; however, for the maximum capacitance,
    the value does not deviate largely from a capacitor with two plates [7]. Hence,
    regardless of the electrode pattern, electrode size is more important in designing
    sensor electrodes. As shown in Fig. 2, the electrode height and width of the sensor
    probe is 25 mm and 35 mm, respectively. The probe was made by attaching the fabricated
    film with resist coating (50μm PET substrate and 12μm copper) to the 5 mm PET
    board and cutting the outlines. Fig. 3. Calibration results and polynomial approximate
    curves. Show All SECTION III. Sensor Calibration For calibration, the sensor probe
    was inserted into a package filled by a soil sample, which is Andisol from a greenhouse
    in Mashiki, Kumamoto, Japan. The package and sensor were then weighed, and the
    soil weight was continuously monitored every 10 min. Soil moisture measurement
    using the developed sensor was also carried out every 10 min. The setup was placed
    in a dry chamber and the temperature was maintained at 50 °C. Then, water was
    added to the soil until the soil was saturated. After five days, the soil moisture
    level was constant, and it was considered a dried condition ( (VWC=0%) . Using
    the obtained weights of the dry soil and the sensor, the amount of water in the
    soil can be calculated from the current weight since the most of weight change
    is caused by the evaporation of water. As the soil volume was fixed by the package
    size, the VWC can be calculated from the amount of water in the soil sample. Fig.
    3 shows a calibration result. The sensor cannot respond to low VWC (<8%) because
    the capacitance of electrodes remains constant at 60.3 pF under the moisture level.
    Note that the capacitance is the same as when the probe is left in the air. On
    the other hand, the soil sample was saturated at around 60%, and the sensor value
    was mostly identical to when the sensor electrode is in water. Thus, the measurable
    range of soil moisture in VWC is around 8-60%. Fig. 3 shows the estimated equations,
    where y is the VWC (m3m−3), and x (pF) is the measured capacitance. The 95% confidence
    intervals for each derived equation were 2.91% and 2.55 % for 10 cm and 20 cm
    depth, respectively. Moreover, the sensor was tested with soil samples collected
    in an experimental farm field in Hyderabad, India, where experimental deployments
    have been running. The soil in Hyderabad shrinks in volume when dried up; thus,
    the calibration process mentioned above is not applicable as it would cause an
    air gap between the sensor electrodes and the soil during the drying process.
    Then, the sensor would no longer correctly respond to soil moisture changes. Instead
    of the drying process, three (3) soil samples with different VWCs (13.6%, 24.0%,
    and 39.1%) were prepared, and the capacitance was measured for each soil sample.
    The result is not significantly different from the test result with the sample
    collected in Kumamoto, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, applying the calibration
    curve created from the calibration experiment is acceptable. Fig. 4. Sensor deployment
    setups in the experimental field at prof. Jayashankar telangana state agricultural
    university, hyderabad, india Show All SECTION IV. Experimental Deployments A.
    Experiment Settings The developed sensors were deployed in real situations where
    farmers want to optimize irrigation to conserve water. Plots with different irrigation
    strategies were prepared in an experimental field in Hyderabad. Note that the
    target crop used was maize. Iterative experiments were planned in the maize field
    for both the rainy and dry season. The deployment was started on August 9, 2017,
    and it finished in late October, which is the rainy season. A total of 12 sensor
    nodes and a gateway were prepared for deployment. In this experiment, 2 different
    irrigation levels, (i) 11 - rain-fed and (ii) 12 - 0.8 IW/CPE were prepared. Note
    that IW/CPE means irrigated water per cumulative pan evaporation. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the plot setup with eight ridges that have an interval of 60 cm and sowing interval
    of 20 cm. Ridge irrigation, wherein water is supplied through the water channel
    between the ridges, is applied manually. The sensor probes were inserted on the
    top of the ridge, and the measurement depth was set at 10 and 20 cm from the top
    of the ridge. B. Comparison on Plots Fig. 5 presents the soil moisture data collected
    by the deployed sensors, and the precipitation data and occurrence of rain and
    thunderstorm provided by Weather Underground (https://www.wunderground.com/).
    The expected soil moisture differences according to the plot settings were observed.
    In plot I1, the soil moisture level is initially low. The soil retained sufficient
    water and did not dry up at 20 cm depth in plot I2 but the soil at the 10 cm depth
    dried up around 9/6 and 9/14. As it was the rainy season, soil moisture changes
    due to precipitation were clearly seen in plot I2. However, the water supply from
    the rain seemed to be quickly absorbed by the dry soil in I1. Once enough water
    was supplied by thunderstorms around 9/27, plot I1 started responding to precipitation.
    Note that in case no precipitation amount was recorded despite having rain and
    thunderstorm, then there was a hit-or-miss circumstance. Thus, actual precipitation
    amount would be different from the representative data. Therefore, it is necessary
    to deploy a precipitation sensor in the real field for a more detailed analysis
    of the water supplied by precipitation. Since it was confirmed that the sensor
    was able to detect irrigation level differences and soil moisture changes, comparison
    with crop growth data, which will be obtained through remote sensing, should be
    done and the appropriate amount of water to be irrigated should be investigated.
    Fig. 5. Comparison on three plots having different irrigation levels. Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusion A cost-effective soil moisture monitoring device was developed
    to optimize irrigation activities. Cost reduction was achieved by leveraging a
    capacitive touch sensing module of the MCU and fabricating easily exchangeable
    sensor electrodes with printed electronics. Through experimental deployments,
    the sensors reasonably captured soil moisture changes and irrigation level differences
    in a practical environment in India. It was also confirmed that the monitoring
    network has sufficient performance to monitor soil conditions. For future studies,
    crop growth and soil moisture in the dry season-where water supply by precipitation
    is rarely expected-will be evaluated. The result will then be applied to irrigation
    strategies. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by SICORP Collaborative Hub

    25-30 years, so it is important to improve the agriculture. The farmers today

    paper is to include an integrated irrigation network, and also to measure the
    quantity of the three major macronutrients, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and
    potassium (K), in the soil, thereby saving the farmer's time, money, and strength.
    Comparing the solution to a color diagram determines the amount of N, P and K
    in the soil sample. It will describe the high, medium and low levels of N, P and

    a smart system that will sense and analyze the NPK rate of soil and will detect
    the moisture rate of that land, then based on these values, automatic irrigation
    will happen. As a master of system ATtiny Microcontroller used here to make the

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bangladesh SECTION I. Introduction The Rainfall
    and Climate change have been erratic over the past few decades. Where 80% of water
    is used in agriculture for irrigation purposes[1], this percentage can rise due
    to increased population growth and demand for food. And one of the world''s biggest
    challenges is water shortage[2]. The hour''s need is to make efficient utilization
    of available human resources, water, and fertilizers, which can lead to cost optimization
    of the annual crop production. That''s why the efficient use of water is essential.
    These days, in the field of agriculture, farmers are facing various problems,
    for example, soil fruitfulness and in watering their plants. Because they don''t
    have an appropriate plan to make an agribusiness advancement, particularly for
    the availability of power. Regardless of whether it is accessible, they need a
    huge time to water by hand or to pump water and hold up until the field is watered
    effectively, which forces them to quit doing forth different attempts which are
    essential for them as well. Accordingly, they lose valuable time and other activities.
    That''s why automatic irrigation is very important for efficient farming and best
    production. Knowing the specific supplement found in the farm soil and the pH
    is the initial step of any healthy crop production program, and that is the reason
    soil testing is significant for Agriculture. By testing soil, the farmers can
    know about the land and can take necessary steps to improve the production. Knowing
    the specific deficiency that the land is experiencing will result in zero wastage
    of such farm inputs. Soil testing results in limited over fertilisation. Farmworkers
    can effectively prevent land depletion, and they can lead to feeding the world''s
    increasing population by fertile soils. This paper plans to structure and execute
    such an inventive innovation for farming application. Irrigation happens here
    only where soil testing needs water and the soil content can be analyzed and calculated
    by Mobile App and the App will recommend necessary nutrient by data analysis of
    Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. Already many creative applications are available.
    But most of the case used Arduino Uno or Mega as master device or microcontroller
    unit (MCU) and used Liquid Crystal Display as monitoring device, that is costly.
    To make the device more cost-effective, we used here ATtiny MCU as a master device,
    which is comparatively lower cost then Arduino. As monitoring device, we used
    an Android Application, which will make the device more cost-effective. SECTION
    II. Literature Review The automated irrigation control system was built to promote
    the automated supply of sufficient water in all agricultural seasons from a reservoir
    to field or domestic crops. The approach used is to measure the level of soil
    moisture continuously to determine whether irrigation is necessary and how much
    water is needed in the soil. [3] Automatic plant watering system is known as one
    of the automatic systems most widely used. The unit uses microcontroller and other
    components as well as sensor technologies. It detects the level of soil moisture,
    and if necessary, irrigates the vine. The aim of this research is to demonstrate
    how anyone can easily render automatic plant watering device of their own and
    inexpensive. [4] [9] This paper describes a low-cost Automatic Irrigation System
    based on Arduino using a Soil Moisture Sensor. Depending on the conditions of
    the soil, the soil moisture sensor gives its production. This machine involves
    an Arduino-UNO that contains an ADC converter inside it.[5] [8] The Indian economy
    is predominantly farm-based. To obtain high yield from soil, some important soil
    parameters such as ph, moisture, humidity and temperature are measured. The method
    is based on soil sampling of chemical processes.[6] Proposed irrigation device
    with pic (16F887) microcontroller to senses soil moisture content. Once soil moisture
    level exceeds a given threshold level, it was automatically programmed for on
    and off the motor[7]. Many farmers can''t afford to test soil moisture by means
    of high-cost instruments. In this paper, they proposed a method for developing
    soil moisture sensor to estimate the amount of moisture in soil. This sensor is
    checked with many soil samples and is capable of satisfying significant accuracy
    [9]. This paper primarily applies water-saving irrigation automated form and composition
    control method to the city landscape. This also offers information on the structure
    and role of the water-saving irrigation display and controller[10]. The design
    proposed is an automated system which helps the farmers in the irrigation cycle.
    It keeps notifying the farmer that an on-board LCD and messages that are sent
    on the cellular number of the farmer. The plant is conveniently accessible by
    the country''s farmers.[11] An optical transducer is developed for the calculation
    and detection of soil concentration of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) , and Potassium
    (K). For improve soil fertility, it is important to determine how many extra contents
    of these nutrients need to be added to the soil. [12] SECTION III. System Model
    Fig. 1. System architecture of the system Show All The total system is divided
    into two portions. First one is the hardware portion, and the second one is the
    software portion. The Bluetooth network will do the interconnection between the
    hardware and the software portion. ATtiny84 Microcontroller will be used here
    as the master device for Hardware portion. The Soil Hygrometer is used for the
    quantification of soil moisture content. The consistency of the soil is often
    checked by sensors pH/ NPK and so on. Thus, using the color sensor, which ends
    up being an economically efficient, reliable and more unaffected technique, is
    accomplished in the proposed work. The sensors provide the ATtiny with voltage
    input which is based on the measured value. Then ATtiny analyzes the NPK and humidity
    data inputs and takes the Water pump decision turning on or off and will control
    the flow of water depending on the current soil moisture content. At the same
    time, the input data will be sent to the Bluetooth connected mobile application.
    The application will analyze the data and can display the Soil Moisture rate,
    NPK rate and the motor state and the app will suggest the fertilizer based on
    the present situation of land if it needs. Fig. 2. Flow chart of the proposed
    system Show All SECTION IV. Design Methodology The system design is divided into
    two sections: the Hardware section and the Software section. A. Hardware Section
    1) FC-28 Soil Hygrometer (Moisture) Sensor Soil moisture is very significant for
    irrigation and garden plants. A simple breakout for estimating soil moisture is
    the FC28 Soil Moisture Sensor. The sensor for soil moisture is relatively easy
    to use. Sensor for soil moisture has two conductive plates that serve as a detector
    and together reflect a variable resistor. The more water the soil contains, the
    stronger would be the conductivity between both the probs, resulting in lower
    resistance, as well as a higher Signal performance. This module likewise incorporates
    a potentiometer that will fix the threshold value, and the comparator-LM393 can
    evaluate the value. A soil moisture sensor is shown in Fig. 3.[13] Fig. 3. Soil
    moisture sensor Show All 2) NPK Sensor The primary source of nutrients needs for
    plants growth is Soil. The three primary nutrients required for plant growth are
    nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), as well as the three known as
    NPK. Many fertilizers used in agriculture are dependent on the soil''s NPK content.
    Which is why it''s really important to learn about NPK material in the Soil. The
    main objective of this paper is an efficient, cost-effective system. So that,
    Colourimetric methods is used to detect the NPK contents. As the sensor element,
    Color sensor TCS230 is used. This sensor senses the color of the solution for
    sample soil. ATtiny Microcontroller conducts sensor calibration with respect to
    NPK material. Colourimetry is used to calculate the compounds that reside in the
    soil, such as nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P) and potas-sium(K) can be used to determine
    how much nutrient the soil needs. The Colorimetric determination of phosphorus
    has been checked to track the processes of transfer from the soil to other water
    sources. Studies also use Colorimetry in the measurement of ammonium nitrogen
    in the soils and plants. In the measurement of potassium chloride, Colorimetry
    is used and commonly used in soils as an organic nitrogen extractant. A TCS230
    color sensor is shown in Fig. 4.[14] Fig. 4. Color sensor tcs230 Show All Soil
    pH is determined by the soil sample color. The equivalent pH to NPK content was
    done using standards Color Chart from BDH Soil Indicator as shown in the Fig.
    5.[15] Fig. 5. Color chart BDH soil indicator Show All The color ranges of the
    soil solution are classified using an Arduino code which runs on the output of
    the color sensor. So the color range of the soil solution is defined by the color
    sensor, which determines the soil pH. The relative NPK material of the soil is
    estimated by pH to the table of conversion of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
    where the value is given as medium, moderate and minor. Further filtering was
    performed to improve the accuracy of very low, medium, moderate and very small
    volumes between the midranges. Conversion chart with pH to NPK is shown in Fig.
    6.[16] Fig. 6. Conversion chart with ph to npk Show All 3) Attiny The ATtiny84
    is a microcontroller with an Arduino-like dash but with much less I / O pins,
    a compact form factor and a compact memory. Attiny Microcontroller uses Arduino
    software to write and burn the code. We used the Arduino UNO and Arduino IDE to
    burn the code into Attiny84. Attiny84 was used as Master Operator here. 4) Relay
    Relais are switches that electromechanically or electronically open and shut the
    circuits. Relay is used for operating water pumps here. 5) HC-05 Bluetooth Module
    This is a Bluetooth module used for remote communications. The HC-05 module may
    be of full-duplex or two-way remote use. Can be used with this HC-05 in a master-slave
    arrangement. Bluetooth serial modules require all serial compatible devices if
    they connect with each other. HC-05 is used as a master-slave contact medium for
    many devices. Fig. 7. Hardware schematic diagram of the proposed system Show All
    B. Software Section The data from the hardware portion is sent to the Android
    Application or software portion by the Bluetooth network. Then the App will analyze
    the data and will display some features. The features are Soil Moisture Rate,
    Soil NPK Rate, Soil pH, Fertilizer needs, Water Pump States. The App is implemented
    by using MIT App Inventor and its a simple and shallow size Android App. SECTION
    V. Results and Analysis A. Soil Moisture Detection The volumetric percentage of
    soil sample water content is measured, And raw sensor data collected are reported
    and displayed in TABLE I. The soil weight is equivalent to 400 g, and the soil
    weights 10 ml of water. SoilMoisture(%)=((W1−W2)/W1)∗100 (1) View Source W1= Weight
    of sample soil after water is applied W2= Weight of sample soil before water is
    applied Fig. 8. Moisture sensor output graph Show All Table I Soil moisture sensor
    calibration The function of the sensor corresponds to its data table. Operations
    range between 10–80 percent moisture content where the graph is nearly linear.
    It is linearized piece by piece, and translated into functional code using map
    function. If the device is shut down and thus the automatic irrigation works well
    to the percent volumetric moisture content can be seen on the Smartphone Application
    and the water pump is started to turn on since the level of water is well below
    35 percent, because most crops require a minimum water content of 30–40 percent
    and the volumetric moisture contents data had been in pa. B. NPK Detection The
    color sensor panel reflects the colors contained in the RGB Setup that has values
    from 0 to 255. For a specified amount of pHs TABLE 11 shows the RGB range. The
    respective NPK content is derived from the pH collection as shown in TABLE II.
    The research is conducted with a sample collected from the soil. The sample is
    thoroughly mixed in a small transparent box with 200 ml of water, and allowed
    to settle. Instead the water is diluted to remove the dissolved hard particulate
    soil at the bottom. The soil solution box is installed with ATtiny, Bluetooth
    Module, Soil Hygrometer, in front of the integrated TCS230 color sensor. The first
    test of identity with the NPK is achieved by turning the switch ON. The concentration
    of minerals in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium is shown on the Mobile
    Phone App when the solution color is detected. The amount of NPK for the soil
    sample obtained and the App will analyze the collected data and will recommend
    fertilizer if it will need and the App will show the motor state as it is ON/OFF.

    All SECTION VI. Future Scope and Conclusion Next to the control panel is the NPK
    sensor successfully designed and installed. It helps to minimize the time of human
    observation and the processing of the soil by the laboratory. This process utilizes
    a color sensor to detect color of the soil solution with which to determine the
    pH and NPK details. The conductivity-type, Moisture detector is used for irrigation
    optimization. For monitoring the water pump, calculated volumetric percentage
    of the water content has been used to determine when to be off and rely on plant
    form and water demand. Small farms are easy to mount and need very little money.
    Considering the educational and financial past of the average Bengali farmer,
    NPK model user interface and percent volumetric water quality were made. Not only
    does it save time, but also chooses to use the type of fertilizer which is often
    helpful for small farmers as, at low initial cost, the system is automatic. We
    need more tests before we demonstrate efficiency, durability and reliability.
    Through making few small changes and improvements, this paper model template can
    be made modular, customizable and user friendly; It is possible because the MCU
    here used another one analog input and a digital pin still unused. Authors Figures

    Review on Advances in IoT-Based Technologies for Smart Agricultural System Chapter
    © 2022 1 Introduction India’s population is continuously increasing and, after
    some years, food problem will be very serious. Therefore, agricultural development
    is very neccessary. Today, water scarcity and lack of rain is the main cause of
    worries of the farmers. The main objective is to have an automatic irrigation
    system that consume less time, money and power of the farmer. There are many convectional
    techniques. The old irrigation techniques need manual hardwork. But, with the
    help of an automatic crop monitoring and irrigation system, human efforts will
    be minimized [1]. Earlier, Indian farmers used techniques that are based on manual
    observations that resulted in either more watering or more use of pesticides that
    directly harm the productivity of crop and fertility of the lands [2]. Here, a
    system is proposed that would have smart monitoring and automatic irrigation control.
    The system is connected with the cloud with the help of sensing devices and the
    sensed data is then monitored via mobile application. Along with crop monitoring,
    an urgent need is there for a good irrigation system. The lack of rain and unpredictability
    in the environment generate an_urgent_need for proper utilization of water. Therefore,
    sensors are used to check the moisture in the soil and temperature of the surrounding
    in order to check the water level. According to the level, the motor is switched
    on or off. With the help of technology, it will increase the production and reduce
    the man power. It will create a system that is low in cost and efficient in finding
    the sensored data that will help the user to turn the motor on and off. One of
    the efficient irrigation method is the drip irrigation system where the water
    is allowed to drip slowly to the roots of the plants. Here, we are using a Smart
    Drip Irrigation and Monitoring System that basically works in two conditions,
    the first is under Irrigation and the second is over irrigation. It monitors the
    field. It can be operated in two modes: i. Power Supply Mode: Power Supply Mode
    comes into use when there is bad weather condition and the battery does not have
    the stored energy. ii. Solar Energy Mode: Solar Energy Mode uses solar panel for
    the working of the system. The energy consumed by the solar panel is stored in
    a rechargeable battery that could be further utilized. The working modes are available
    that can be switched according to the needs. “Solar Energy mode is applicable
    for conserving electricity by reducing the usage of grid power and conserves water
    by reducing water losses. It is the best utilization of solar power. But, if there
    is no solar energy available then power supply mode is turned on. This System
    not only presents an Automated Irrigation System but comforts the user with extraordinary
    features also. The user is provided with an user interface i.e. an android application
    that can be easily operated on mobile phones. It helps in providing data visualization,
    data understanding, and the predictive analysis. It also facilitates farmers to
    look forward to advanced data in the future. This system works using wi-fi module
    that transmits the data to the cloud and notifies the user regarding field condition.
    Due to this alert, the user can improve the condition of field by taking some
    improvement measures. 2 Related Works The related work explains the use of the

    Agriculture IoT first-rate agriculture products are designed to assist show crop
    fields victimization sensors and via automating irrigation systems. As a result,
    farmers and associated producers will, without a doubt, show the sphere conditions
    from everywhere with none hassle. Take a glance at the several uses of IoT in
    agriculture via technique that of varied IoT solutions: 3.1 Drones in Agriculture
    Drones are uncrewed ethereal vehicles (otherwise called UAVs), which are utilized
    for reconnaissance in different enterprises. Till now, they were principally utilized
    by organizations working in modern areas like mining and development, armed force,
    and specialists. Presently, drone innovation is progressively accessible for use
    in different areas of farming too. However the innovation is as yet early in India,
    many organizations are attempting so it is effectively accessible to Indian ranchers
    and fit to be utilized to increment proficiency in farming creation. A ton of
    robot based horticultural undertakings are going through in India. Think about
    the accompanying genuine situations: On 26th January 2022, the Government of India
    has likewise delivered a certificate plot for rural robots, which can now convey
    a payload that does exclude synthetic compounds or different fluids utilized in
    showering drones. Such fluids might be showered by adhering to material guidelines
    and guidelines. On 23rd January 2022, to advance the utilization of robots for
    rural purposes and diminish the work trouble on the ranchers, the public authority
    of India has as of late offered, a 100% endowment or 10 lakhs, whichever is less,
    up to March 2023 to the Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institutes, ICAR Institutes,
    Krishi Vigyan Kendras and State Agriculture Universities. Moreover, a possibility
    asset of Rs. 6000/ha will likewise be set in the mood for recruiting Drones from
    Custom Hiring Centers (CHC). The endowment and the possibility subsidizes will
    help the ranchers access and embrace this broad innovation at a reasonable cost.
    On sixteenth November 2020, the Indian government conceded the International Crops
    Research Institute (ICRISAT), for utilization of robots for farming examination
    exercises. With this move, the public authority desires to energize maturing scientists
    and business visionaries to check out at financial plan well disposed drone answers
    for more than 6.6 lakh Indian towns. However the use will be contingent, yet it
    is a progressive step. Golden Dubey, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation,
    stressed that robots are ready to assume a major part in horticulture, particularly
    in regions including accuracy farming, improvement in crop yield, and beetle control.
    3.1.1 Benefits of Using Drones in Agriculture The utilization of robot innovation
    in agribusiness is digging in for the long haul. As indicated by ongoing examination,
    the worldwide robot market inside farming would develop at 35.9% CAGR and reach
    $5.7 billion by 2025. The utilization of robot innovation in agribusiness is digging
    in for the long haul. This arising innovation can assist with decreasing time
    and increment the efficiencies of the ranchers. The utilization of robots in the
    agrarian area is simply expected to ascend as the business develops, thus it is
    great to know how to sensibly utilize this innovation. 3.1.2 Soil and Field Examination
    For effective field arranging, horticultural robots can be utilized for soil and
    field examination. They can be utilized to mount sensors to assess dampness content
    in the dirt, landscape conditions, soil conditions, soil disintegration, supplements
    content, and fruitfulness of the dirt. 3.1.3 Crop Observing Crop observation is
    the management of yield progress from the time seeds are planted to the ideal
    opportunity for gather. This incorporates giving manures with flawless timing,
    checking for bug assault, and observing the impact of weather patterns. Crop observation
    is the main way that a rancher can guarantee an ideal gather, particularly while
    managing occasional yields. Any mistakes at this stage can bring about crop disappointment.
    Crop reconnaissance helps in understanding and making arrangements for the following
    cultivating season. Robots can help in powerful yield observation by reviewing
    the field with infrared cameras and in light of their constant data, ranchers
    can go to dynamic lengths to work on the state of plants in the field. 3.1.4 Estate
    Robots can help in establishing trees and yields, which was finished by ranchers
    previously. This innovation won’t just save work yet in addition will help in
    saving fills. 3.1.5 Animals the Board Robots can be utilized to screen and oversee
    tremendous domesticated animals as their sensors have high-goal infrared cameras,
    which can identify a debilitated creature and quickly make moves in like manner.
    Thus, the effect of robots on accuracy dairy cultivating is soon to turn into
    another ordinary effect. 3.1.6 Crop Showering Agri-robots can be utilized to splash
    synthetics as they have repositories, which can be loaded up with composts and
    pesticides for showering on crops in almost no time, when contrasted with conventional
    techniques. Subsequently, drone innovation can introduce another period for accuracy
    horticulture. 3.1.7 Actually Take a Look at Crop Wellbeing Cultivating is a huge
    scope action that happens over sections of land. Consistent overviews are important
    to screen the strength of the dirt and the yield that has been planted. Physically,
    this might require days, and, surprisingly, then, there is space for human mistake.
    Robots can do similar work surprisingly fast. With infrared planning, robots can
    accumulate data about both the strength of the dirt and the harvest. 3.1.8 Stay
    Away from Abuse of Synthetic Substances Robots can end up being particularly powerful
    in decreasing the abuse of pesticides, insect poisons, and different synthetics.
    These synthetics without a doubt help to safeguard the yield. Be that as it may,
    their abuse can end up being negative. Robots can distinguish minute indications
    of bug assaults, and give exact information with respect to the degree and scope
    of the assault. This can assist ranchers with working out the necessary measure
    of synthetics to be utilized that would just safeguard the harvests as opposed
    to hurting them. 3.1.9 Plan for Climate Misfires Weather patterns can end up being
    a rancher’s dearest companion and most horrendously terrible foe. Since these
    can’t be precisely anticipated, it turns out to be very hard to get ready for
    any change in designs. Robots can be utilized to recognize impending atmospheric
    conditions. Storm drones are now being utilized to improve expectations. Also,
    this data can be utilized by ranchers to be more ready. Early notification of
    tempests or absence of downpour can be utilized to design the harvest to be established
    that would be most ideal to the season, and how to deal with established crops
    at a later stage. 3.1.10 Screen Development In any event, when everything is working
    out as expected, crops should be studied and observed to guarantee that the perfect
    proportion of yield will be accessible at the hour of collect. It is likewise
    significant for future preparation, whether it is tied in with deciding the right
    cost for the open market, or reaping repeating crops. Robots can give exact information
    about each phase of yield development, and report any varieties before they become
    an emergency. Multispectral pictures can likewise give exact data about inconspicuous
    contrasts among solid and undesirable harvests that might be missed by the unaided
    eye. For instance, focus on harvests will mirror less close infrared light when
    contrasted with solid yields. This distinction can''t be recognized by the natural
    eye generally. Yet, robots can give this data in the beginning phases. 3.1.11
    Geofencing The warm cameras introduced over robots can without much of a stretch
    distinguish creatures or people. In this way, robots can monitor the fields from
    outside harm brought about by creatures, particularly around evening time. For
    security purpose, the robots are worked via prepared drone pilots. 3.2 Remote
    Sensing in Agriculture Remote sensing in agriculture refers to the acquisition
    of data from agricultural material or product while not touching them. It becomes
    a really valuable tool in monitoring, evaluation and management of agricultural
    resources. The development has several applications that admire geology, surveying,
    forestry, photography and many additional ones. However, the sphere of agriculture
    has more uses for remote sensing than most sectors. The foremost common tool that
    you will use for remote sensing is craft or a satellite. Besides, the recent advancements
    in technology have led to the event of refined drones with high-end cameras and
    sensors. The drone will travel at a high speed whereas necessary information is
    obtained from the farms. Furthermore, drones can take shut the aerial footage
    that shows elaborate information on the plants. For instance, a drone can go terribly
    low to require an attempt while planes cannot. However, that doesn’t render those
    tools useless within the agricultural sector. For example, satellites and aircrafts
    can collect additional information over a good space which might be terribly helpful
    in Agriculture. A decent example is once finding out the patterns of weather.
    3.2.1 Applications of Remote Sensing in Agriculture There are few applications
    of remote sensing: i. Assessment of crop progress or harm Remote sensing technology
    is generally utilized in Agriculture to access progress or damage. It helps to
    asses, particularly within large farms. All data is saved in storage that researchers
    and farmers use to check the crops. ii. Crop identification has been created straightforward
    by the remote sensing technology. As an example crops beneath observation may
    show mysterious characteristics. Information is collected from such instances
    and sent to the laboratory for more studies. Within the lab, new aspects are studied
    to induce correct results. One example of such a side is finding out crop culture.
    iii. Crop yield estimation and modelling consultants and farmers can simply predict
    the number of yield which will be created by sure resources. Furthermore, they
    will predict the amount of your time to be taken when alternative resources to
    be used. Remote sensing data permits farmers to model and develop higher strategies
    which will probably improve the yield. iv. Pests and sicknesss infestation identification
    Remote sensing has contended a significant role once it involves the management
    of pests in agriculture. It helps with the identification of disease and pests
    thus returning up with the proper mechanisms. Information collected over time
    is compared to match diseases victimization the symptoms. v. Soil wet estimation
    measurement for detecting soil moisture couldn’t be easier than using remote sensing
    techniques. It works by exchanging data with the soil moisture thus determining
    the quantity. Information drawn from such activities is analyzed to see the proper
    crops to grow. vi. Crop production prognostication: Farmers can predict their
    production comeback over an calculable space in an exceedingly given season. regardless
    of what the season is, they will simply acquire data of their projected returns.
    Besides, consultants are ready to predict the standard that yields will turn out
    beneath any conditions. vii. Planting and harvesting date identification in the
    past harvesting, and date estimation was done by guesswork. However, with remote
    sensing, there''s enough data to predict the exact harvest data. Due to the prognosticative
    feature of this technology farmers can prepare on time. It is able to do that
    by finding out weather patterns and considering alternative factors admiring soil.
    viii. Soil mapping is incredibly necessary once it involves the assembly of high
    yields during this field. Higher soil mapping results in high-quality yields.
    Remote sensing provides important information that may be accustomed to match
    crops with the simplest soils. ix. Irrigation management-Since remote sensing
    provides details of the soil moisture, farmers manage irrigation with ease. With
    this information, one may also establish elements that haven’t received proper
    amounts of water. x. Drought monitoring involves measuring changes in temperature,
    precipitation, and surface and groundwater supplies, among other factors. Draught
    patterns aren’t excluded and thus the information is analyzed and transmitted
    to farmers for awareness. Rain patterns are monitored in such a simple way that
    you just can tell the distinction between two rainfalls. xi. Crop condition assessment
    of the health of every crop is simple to hold out victimization remote sensing.
    If any crop is stressed, remote sensors collect information and send it to the
    personnel in charge. Consultants use this data to see the standard of the crops.
    xii. Crop area estimating the farmland on that crops are planted manually may
    be a terribly arduous task. However, with remote sensing techniques, one can simply
    puzzle out such details at intervals in a brief time. xiii. Land mapping may be
    utilized in many various ways in Agriculture. Remote sensing collects information
    that helps to map lands for agricultural functions. For instance, it can be for
    landscaping or crop growth. As a result if different soils are helpful for various
    purposes then the land mapping is incredibly necessary. xiv. Preciseness farming:
    Remote sensing has helped with the development of precision farming over the years.
    Preciseness farming is very important because it produces healthy crops. Furthermore,
    the crops grow at intervals in the given period thus optimum harvests are realized.
    xv. Temperature change: Watching temperature change can have an effect on agriculture
    in each a positive or negative way. However, farmers can capitalize victimization
    remote sensing techniques. They track climatical changes and use them to their
    advantage. For instance, they plant crops that may perform well betting on the
    climate. Furthermore, they will devise ways to build some drought resistant crops.
    Consultants observe the climate to determine crops which will perform higher within
    the affected areas. 3.3 Computer Imaging in Agriculture Computer imaging entails
    the employment of detector cameras installed at exclusive corners of the farm
    or drones prepared with cameras to offer photographs that bear virtual photo manner.
    Digital photo processing is the primary theory of processing Associate in Nursing
    enter photo victimization compter algorithms. Farming can be one in all of the
    oldest trades in the world, despite the fact that growing technology are turning
    agriculture right into an exact science. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
    andComputer Vision programs are presently used to choose under discipline situations,
    soil moisture, set up crop disease, are expecting climate and crop yields. Computer
    Vision in agriculture helps farmers to shape better understanding of selections
    and accumulate big quantities of data that wasn’t accessible even multiple years
    ago. Satellite imaging additionally as UAV pictures assist to examine considerable
    tracts of landand enhance farming practices. Let’s take a look abut the maximum
    current technology make farming extra productive, good value and less hard work
    in depth. Growing Crop Yields by making use of AI andComputer Vision fashions
    farmers can display crop boom in close to-actual time. 4 Proposed Automated System
    Model for Agricuture There are five major components in proposed System Model
    (shown in Fig. 1); Fig. 1 Proposed block diagram of system model Full size image
    Micro Controller chip Sensor Relay Wifi Actuator 4.1 Proposed System Block Diagram
    The sensors are collecting the data from the environment which is processed by
    a micro controller. The processed data is then put on cloud through wifi. Now,
    this data can be accessed from anywhere via android app. There is a relay that
    works as the switch for operating the motor. With the help of the relay, turning
    on and off of the motor takes place. Hardware Used: (a) Sensor: The first hardware
    that comes into use is the Sensor. Sensor is the key part of the project. It senses
    the data. The sensed data is then put on cloud so that it could be accessed via
    any device from anywhere. Device could be a mobile phone, laptop or any machine
    with internet.Sensor can also be grouped inorder to monitor a device thoroughly.
    A soil moisture sensor (shown in Fig. 2) is a device used to measure the amount
    of water present in soil. The sensor works by measuring the electrical resistance
    between two or more electrodes that are inserted into the soil. The resistance
    of the soil is directly related to the moisture content, so by measuring the resistance,
    the sensor can determine the moisture level of the soil. Soil moisture sensors
    are commonly used in agriculture and horticulture to ensure that plants receive
    the proper amount of water. By monitoring soil moisture levels, farmers and gardeners
    can avoid overwatering or underwatering their plants, which can lead to poor growth,
    disease, and other problems. There are various types of soil moisture sensors
    available, including capacitance-based sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    sensors, and gypsum block sensors. Each type of sensor has its own advantages
    and disadvantages, depending on factors such as the soil type, the application,
    and the desired level of accuracy. Fig. 2 Soil moisture sensor Full size image
    (b) Micro Controller Chip: A micro controller is a small computer on a single
    IC. It contains one or two CPUs along with memory and programmable i/p o/p peripherals.
    A microcontroller chip, also known as a microcontroller unit (MCU), is a small
    computer on a single integrated circuit (IC) that contains a processor core, memory,
    and input/output (I/O) peripherals. Microcontrollers are commonly used in embedded
    systems to control devices or processes. Microcontroller chips are designed for
    low-power and low-cost applications, making them suitable for a wide range of
    applications, including automotive, medical, industrial, consumer electronics,
    and more. They typically have a limited amount of memory and processing power
    compared to general-purpose computers, but they are optimized for real-time processing
    and control tasks. There are many different microcontroller architectures available,
    with the most popular being based on the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit instruction
    sets. Some common microcontroller manufacturers include Atmel, Microchip, Texas
    Instruments, and STMicroelectronics. Arduino Uno (shown in Fig. 3) is an open-source
    microcontroller board based on the Atmel AVR microcontroller. It is a popular
    platform for creating electronic projects and prototypes due to its ease of use
    and wide availability of sensors, actuators, and other components. The board has
    digital input/output pins, analog inputs, and can be programmed using the Arduino
    software. It is often used in a variety of applications such as robotics, home
    automation, and Internet of Things (IoT) projects. Fig. 3 Arduino uno Full size
    image (c) Relay: A relay (shown in Fig. 4) is a switch that is electromagnetically
    operated. A switch is meant for telling the actual stage of the device. It shows
    whether the device is in on mode or off mode. Fig. 4 Relay Full size image (d)
    Actuators: Actuators (shown in Fig. 5) is a component of a machine that is responsible
    for moving and controlling a mechanism. Fig. 5 Actuator Full size image 5 Work
    Flow of System Model The Proposed workflow (shown in Fig. 6) is divided into two
    parts: Fig. 6 Proposed workflow methodology of system model Full size image Field
    quality analysis Irrigation System 5.1 Field Quality Analysis In Fig. 7, we have
    discussed the field quality analysis. In this, the System starts and the crop
    is selected. For selecting the crop, the data is compared. The actual data is
    compared from the ideal data that is stored in the database. If ideal value is
    equal to the actual value then success alert is received, otherwise Quality mismatch
    alert is generated and the system is stopped. Fig. 7 Proposed flow chart for field
    quality analysis Full size image 5.2 Irrigation System In the second part, irrigation
    of the field (shown in Fig. 8) is done. The system starts and the sensor value
    is fetched from the database. Then this value is compared, and if irrigation is
    required then motor will be on. Otherwise, it will be checked if motor is on or
    off. If on, the switch off the motor and if already off then delay will be generated
    so as to recheck the motor. Fig. 8 Proposed flow chart for irrigation system Full
    size image 5.3 System Design The system model (shown in Fig. 9) is framed in such
    a way that the energy consumed by the solar panel is stored in the battery and
    this rechargeable battery is capable of being used with solar energy and extra
    battery power. The Arduino uno is operated via a rechargeable battery and the
    data that is sensed by sensor is stored in the database and is put on cloud and
    accessed by the user via mobile application. Fig. 9 System design of proposed
    sysem model Full size image This is the system design that comprises of the following
    parts: Battery It is a device that has two electrochemical cells that give power
    to other devices. Here, it is a rechargeable battery that can be used for charging
    other devices and can also store the power. Solar Panel It is a device that takes
    sunlight as an input and generates electricity. A 6V solarpanel is used to charge
    a 3.4 V battery. This takes light energy to convert into electrical energy. NodeMCU
    1.0 NodeMCU 1.0 is the open source platform that is used as software and hardware
    for the easy use. Here, it is used as the software for reading inputs through
    sensors and serve it as output such as turning on the led, activating a motor
    etc. Sensors The first hardware that comes into use is the Sensor. The Sensor
    is the key part of the project. It senses the data. The sensed data is then put
    on cloud so that it could be accessed via any device from anywhere. Device could
    be a mobile phone, laptop or any machine with internet.Sensor can also be grouped
    inorder to monitor a device thoroughly. 5.4 Irrigation System This is the second
    section of the system where water level of the field is determined using the soil
    moisture sensor. Irrigation is done according to the amount of water required
    by the crop fields. And depending on that, the motor is turned off or on. The
    data is collected via the sensor that tells the actual value of moisture present
    in the soil which in turn operates the motor. Due to automatic Irrigation System,unnecessary
    use of water does not take place.It helps in providing the required amount of
    water to the fields at the correct time. 6 Hardware Setup for Proposed System
    Model Hardware setup (shown in Fig. 10) involves NodeMcu, DH11 Sensor, Soil moisture
    Sensor, relay and water motor. The sensors are connected to the board and relay
    lower terminal is connected to the board and No and COM are connected to motor
    wire. There are two samples: (i) Dry soil (ii) Wet soil. The board is powered
    by USB cable and motor is charged through electricity. Two soil samples are taken
    to measure the soil moisture through soil moisture sensor. Fig. 10 Hardware setup
    for proposed system model Full size image 7 Android Mobile Application for Monitoring
    the Work Flow The sensored data is shown in the mobile application (shown in Fig.
    11). All the values regarding field can easily be monitored via application. User
    can easily monitor the motor on/off via app only. If the value shown is 1 then
    the motor is on. And if the value shown is 0 then the motor is off. Fig. 11 Home
    screen of mobile application Full size image This Home page involves the Information
    about Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity and Irrigation System. The major adavantages
    of this anroid mobile application are: The sensed data will be depicted. This
    data is refreshed after every 10 s. It will help the user to have real time information.
    8 Getting Alerts for Motor On/Off via Mobile Application User could get the alerts
    about the functioning of motor via android application. This feature of app can
    help in reducing the wastage of water. Motor off: This is the condition where
    the column of irrigation system is occupied by value ‘0’. It shows that the motor
    is off, which will help the user to have real time information aboutthe water
    supply. Motor on: This is the condition where the column of irrigation system
    is occupied by value ‘1’. It shows that the motor is on, which will help the user
    to have real time information about the water supply. Crop Data: Crop Data (shown
    in Fig. 12) consists of data of crops that is taken as sample input in the system.
    User can grow through this data for the sake of knowledge. Fig. 12 Crop data Full

    Step 9: Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit. Step 10: Provide delay of 1000
    ms. Step 11: Go to step 7. Step 12: End. 9 Conclusion The main focus is to study
    theField Monitoring and Automation in Agricuture using IoTto aid the user in having
    a good idea of the crop field and have good control over the irrigation system.
    This system is responsible for monitoring the fields parameter such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidty, etc. which lets the user go through a good quality check
    of crop fields. It also involves controlling of irrigation. Earlier, systems were
    developed that either worked as the Automatic Irrigation System or Field Monitoring
    System. They were operated using battery. They were not affordable and stopped
    working in case of power cut. Solar Energy Monitoring Systems were also developed
    that analysed the renewable energy usage. It only monitored the solar energy usage
    and provided the analysis for further expension. But,“Field Monitoring And Automatic
    Irrigation system using IoT” serves as both Automatic Irrigation System and Field
    Monitoring System where it is operated in the power supply mode and solar power
    mode. Using solar energy makes the system afforadable. And, it solves the problem
    of regular power cut that usually happens in villages. It helps in monitoring
    the crop field paramaters which determine the quality of the field. After knowing
    the parameter values, the user can put efforts in lacking quality of the field
    so as to make the crop field appropriate for growth. Monitoring of fields is done
    on a regular basis. Along with monitoring, there is an automatic irrigation system
    that helps in providing appropriate amount of water to the fields. Automatic on/off
    of motor is taking place according to the field conditions. When there is enough
    water in the fields then motor will be in switched off state otherwise it will
    be on. The automatic irrigation of fields helps in reducing unneccassary use of
    water and it supports the farmers in good irrigation of crop fields. Field Monitoring
    and Automatic Irrigation system using IoT is easily accessible via mobile application.
    It could be easily used by the user. It depicts all the data that is sensed by
    the sensor. The major advantage of developing a mobile app is that the user can
    access the field information and data from anywhere, just via a mobile application
    downloaded on his phone. The Mobile app comprises of the crop data that will aid
    the user in getting knowledge about the crops. This information helps in having
    more cultivative and productive fields. SMS alerts are sent to the user incase
    crop field quality is mismatched. Notification alerts let the user get real time
    information about the crop fields. References Vineela, T., NagaHarini, J., Kiranmai,

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Modern agricultural systems
    depend on limited soil data to inform the deployment of resources. Inefficient
    use of critical resources, such as fertilizer and water, caused by insufficient
    data, may lead to increased costs. Internet of Things (IoT)-based precision agriculture
    systems offer a potential solution by enabling high spatial resolution monitoring
    of soil conditions that can lead to more judicious use of resources and better
    crop yield [1]. The scalability of precision agriculture systems depends on inexpensive,
    biodegradable sensors, integrated into passive, wireless, and chipless sensing
    nodes. The 902–928 MHz industrial, scientific, medical (ISM) band offers good
    penetration of radio frequency (RF) signals in soil while still enabling relatively
    small antennas, making it ideal for this application [2]. Typical paper substrates,
    while biodegradable, are not well suited for sensor fabrication. These substrates
    are composed of networks of microscale cellulose fibers and have surfaces with
    large roughness and high porosity, thus making it challenging to fabricate structures
    with high fidelity and repeatability. Electrical structures printed on rough paper
    substrates have inferior electrical properties compared to structures printed
    on smooth polymer substrates, such as polyimide and polyethylene terephthalate
    (PET) sheets, that are typically used in flexible electronics [3], [4], [5]. Because
    of this, specialty papers have been developed with additional polymer fillers
    and coatings that considerably improve surface properties. While these are commonly
    used in paper-based electronics applications, the incorporation of non-biodegradable
    polymers makes them incompatible with precision agriculture systems [4], [6].
    Natural clay and mineral-based fillers, typically used to improve paper opacity
    and brightness, do not improve surface properties sufficiently for sensor manufacturing
    [7]. Recently, there has been interest in using nanocellulose-based materials
    for moisture sensing. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), a specific form of nanocellulose,
    are of particular interest because of their excellent mechanical properties. When
    formed into sheets, CNFs have high specific stiffness and strength [8], [9]. The
    dielectric constant of nanocellulose films increases with increasing moisture
    content. This property has been leveraged in recent work to develop humidity sensors
    based on neat nanocellulose films [10], [11], [12]. However, the limited mechanical
    stability of such nanocellulose films when cycled under varying humidity conditions
    makes them unsuitable for precision agriculture applications. For nanocellulose
    to be used in such applications, it must be combined with other materials to ensure
    mechanical stability. Previous work on RF passive wireless moisture sensors rely
    on complicated circuitry for self-powering [13], [14] or readout [15]. These sensor
    nodes, therefore, must include integrated circuits (ICs) that increase complexity.
    Chipless sensor nodes are cheaper, smaller, simpler to package, and degrade more
    quickly than sensor nodes that include ICs. For capacitive soil moisture sensors
    to be integrated into a chipless passive wireless sensing system, sensor self-resonance
    must be well above the desired operating frequency, here the 902–928 MHz ISM band.
    While previous work has characterized electrical structures on cellulose-based
    substrates [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], most of this work focuses on operation
    under standard lab conditions and does not examine changes in electrical properties
    with moisture. There has also been no work to assess the suitability of nanocellulose-based
    substrates for operation at RF. Additionally, previous characterization of the
    electrical properties of paper has been limited to low-frequency studies of dielectric
    properties [21], [22]. We developed a fully biodegradable nanocellulose infiltrated
    cardstock composite that can be used as a substrate for moisture sensors. This
    composite, which includes both nano- and micro-cellulose fibers, has the required
    electrical properties and mechanical robustness for precision agriculture applications.
    Combined with a screen-printing process, we demonstrate the ability to print high-quality
    electrical structures with small feature sizes on this moisture responsive cellulose-based
    substrate. We present a capacitive moisture sensor fabricated on this substrate,
    suitable for direct operation and integration into chipless passive wireless sensing
    systems operating in the 902–928 MHz ISM band. We expand upon previous work [23]
    by including electromagnetic modeling of the sensors and investigate multiple
    sensor sizes. We characterize the electrical properties of the sensor under different
    humidity conditions and quantify the substrate’s moisture uptake and release over
    time. Additionally, we characterize the sensor’s behavior in soil at multiple
    moisture levels. SECTION II. Fabrication Methods A. CNF Composite Fabrication
    CNF-composites were fabricated via infiltration of a CNF solution into standard
    8.5 ′′ × 11 ′′ cardstock paper (Neenah) with an approximate thickness of 200μm
    . The CNF solution was prepared by combining a 1 wt% TEMPO-oxidized CNF gel [24]
    (obtained from USDA Forest Products Laboratory) with deionized water in a 1:1
    ratio to form a 0.5% CNF solution. To prepare the composite, a sheet of cardstock
    is wet evenly and clamped down in an acrylic stencil. CNF solution is coated on
    the surface of the cardstock and allowed to partially infuse for approximately
    1.5 h before a second coating is applied. After partial infiltration of the second
    layer, the sample is heat pressed at 60 °C for 20 min to form the surface layer
    and then oven dried at 60 °C for 12 h to remove any remaining moisture. It has
    been shown that nanocellulose films biodegrade in a manner similar to traditional
    pulp-based microcellulose papers and that the incorporation of nanocellulose with
    other paper based materials does not affect the degradation rate [25]. Additionally,
    previous work has demonstrated that the functionalization of CNFs, such as the
    TEMPO-oxidized CNFs used in this work, does not affect the biodegradability of
    nanocellulose [26]. As such, the fabricated CNF-composite is completely biodegradable.

    1, were designed using a finite element-based electromagnetic solver (ANSYS HFSS).
    The number of fingers and their length was selected to obtain a self-resonance
    above the frequency band of interest. The larger capacitor [Fig. 1(b)] has fourteen
    five-millimeter-long, 100μm wide fingers, with a 250μm spacing between each finger,
    while the smaller capacitor has shorter 2.1 mm fingers. The active area of the
    small sensor is 11 mm2 while that of the large sensor is 25 mm2. The capacitive
    structures were fabricated via screen printing using a manual screen printing
    setup (NovaCentrix) and custom screens (SEFAR). Fig. 1. (a) Sensor schematic.

    images of the capacitors printed on polyimide, cardstock, and CNF-cardstock composite.
    The traces printed on polyimide and CNF-cardstock substrates are qualitatively
    superior to the structures printed on cardstock. The traces on the cardstock have
    higher non-uniformity and edge roughness due to the porosity and roughness of
    the surface. The high porosity leads to uneven ink infiltration, while the microscale
    fibers create a non-planar surface. Both of these contribute to poor trace quality
    and variation in the thickness of the traces. Fig. 2. SEM images of screen-printed
    capacitors on (a) polyimide, (b) cardstock, and (c) CNF-cardstock composite. The
    images in the right column are higher magnification images of the structures in
    the left column. Show All Surface profilometry was used to evaluate the roughness
    of the substrates as well as the quality of the printed traces, as is shown in
    Fig. 3. The root mean square (rms) roughness was calculated for each substrate,
    with the CNF-composite and polyimide exhibiting rms roughnesses of 0.52 and 0.47μm
    respectively while the rms roughness of the cardstock was nearly an order of magnitude
    larger at 3.5μm . This difference in the surface roughness is expected since the
    surface of the cardstock is comprised of microscale cellulose fibers. The surface
    roughness of each substrate directly correlated to the quality and consistency
    of the structures printed on them. Traces printed on the CNF-composite and polyimide,
    both low roughness substrates, had average trace heights and standard deviations
    of 13 ± 2.6 and 14 ±1.1μm , respectively while the cardstock structures exhibited
    greater variability with an average height and standard deviation of 15.1 ±6.1μm
    . Fig. 3. Surface profilometry measurements of (a) three sensor substrates and
    (b) sensor traces on the three different substrates [23]. Show All SECTION III.
    Sensor Design and Modeling Nominal sensor capacitances were selected to be 0.5
    and 1 pF, respectively. As sensor trace thickness ( ≈13μm ) is negligible compared
    to the substrate thickness ( ≈210μm ), the following closed-form approximation
    of interdigitated electrode capacitance [27] allows for the selection of initial
    sensor dimensions C=Lq 4 πa ϵ ∑ n=1 ∞ 1 2n−1 J 2 0 ( (2n−1)πG 2a ) (1) View Source
    where J 0 represents the zeroth Bessel function, a=G+W , q=N(G+W)−G , N is the
    total number of fingers constituting the capacitor. L , G , and W are capacitor
    dimensions defined in Fig. 1(a). From there, a relatively large number of fingers
    ( N=144 ) is selected to keep L small and limit the series resistance of the structures.
    A spacing, G , larger than the substrate thickness is selected to guarantee field
    lines travel through the moisture responsive substrate. Fig. 4 shows the equivalent
    circuit model of the capacitive sensor, where R s is the equivalent series resistance
    caused by loss in the sensor fingers, L s is the equivalent inductance of the
    sensor caused by the flow of current through the sensor fingers, and C is the
    capacitance of the sensor. From this equivalent circuit, the self-resonant frequency
    f 0 of the sensor is defined as f 0 = 1 2π L s C − − − − √ . (2) View Source At
    f 0 , the impedance of L s and C are complex conjugates and sum to zero. Above
    this frequency, the inductance dominates the sensor impedance and the sensor no
    longer behaves as a capacitor. The sensor quality ( Q ) factor describes the amount
    of energy stored by the capacitor with respect to the amount of energy dissipated
    by thermal loss Q= 1 2πfC R s . (3) View Source Fig. 4. Equivalent circuit model
    of the capacitive sensor. Show All To allow probing of the sensors at RF using
    ground-signal-ground (GSG) probes, two ground planes are added to the structure,
    one on each side of the sensor [see Fig. 1(a)]. Sensors were simulated in HFSS
    with cardstock as a substrate ( ϵ r ≈2.5 [13]) and with air surrounding the structures
    over a frequency range of 100 MHz–4 GHz. Capacitance values for both sensors are
    simulated using a range of spacings G . Preliminary sensor dimensions obtained
    from (1) are then used to build a sensor model in HFSS. The resulting self-resonant
    frequency, f 0 , and Q -factor at 915 MHz of multiple sensor dimensions are presented
    in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Self-resonant frequency (full line) and sensor Q -factor at
    915 MHz (dashed) as a function of electrode spacing G for large and small capacitance
    sensors. Show All As the spacing, G , between electrodes increases, electrode
    length L must also increase to achieve the same capacitance. This increases sensor
    resistive losses, which decreases sensor Q . Increased electrode length also increases
    their inductance, which decreases the self-resonant frequency. Smaller sensor
    capacitances have larger Q -factors at 915 MHz as well as a larger self-resonant
    frequency than the larger capacitance sensors. As soil can have relative dielectric
    constants as large as 30 [28], a self-resonant frequency in air that is much larger
    than the operating frequency is necessary. Therefore, a spacing of G=250μm is
    selected, as it is larger than the substrate thickness and large enough for accurate
    and repeatable fabrication through screen-printing. SECTION IV. Sensor Response
    A. Experimental Method Sensor humidity response at RF was measured in a custom
    humidity chamber/RF probe station setup. A vacuum microprobe station chamber (MMR
    Technologies) was modified to allow for the introduction of humid air using a
    cool mist humidifier fit with tubing on one side of the chamber, while a fan was
    installed on the opposite side of the chamber to evacuate excess humid air from
    the chamber. Both the humidifier and fan were controlled to reach and maintain
    the desired relative humidity (RH) using a humidity controller (Inkbird IHC-200).
    In addition to the humidity sensor integrated to the controller, real time humidity
    levels in the chamber were monitored using a separate humidity sensor (Waveshare
    BME 280). The sensors were placed on a glass slide and measured using GSG RF probes
    with a 550μm pitch within the humidity chamber, while probe position was controlled
    from outside the chamber. Sensor electrical response was measured using a Keysight
    P9374A vector network analyzer (VNA). The VNA was calibrated using a short-open-load
    (SOLT)-through method on a standardized calibration set. B. Time Response The
    moisture absorption and desorption properties of the CNF-composite structures
    were measured by placing samples stored at 32% RH into the humidity chamber at
    90% RH. The scattering ( S ) parameters of the devices were recorded until stable
    values were reached. At this point, the humidity chamber lid was removed and the
    sensors were exposed to ambient conditions. Once again, the S -parameters of the
    sensors were recorded until capacitance values stabilized. Collected S -parameters
    were transformed into Y -parameters and the equivalent capacitance of the devices
    at 915 MHz was calculated, using the following equation: C eq = Im[ Y 21 ] 2πf
    (4) View Source where Im[ Y 21 ] is the imaginary part of the Y textsubscript
    21 admittance parameter of the sensor, f is the frequency of interest (here f=915
    MHz and C eq is the equivalent capacitance of the sensor at the specified frequency.
    The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 6. For both sensor sizes, moisture
    uptake is initially quite large and causes the capacitance to increase dramatically
    before slowly tapering off to its steady-state value. Sensor moisture desorption
    follows the same trend: rapid large decrease in sensor capacitance, followed by
    a slow tapering to its steady-state value. The small difference in initial and
    final sensor capacitance can in part be attributed to the difference in the RH
    between the initial storing conditions (RH ≈32% ) and final ambient conditions
    (RH ≈40% ). Fig. 6. Change in sensor equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz as RH is
    increased to 90% and brought back down to ambient conditions. Sensor moisture
    absorption and desorption over time is fit to a time constant ( τ ) (a) large
    sensor, τ up =8 min τ down =5 min and (b) small sensor, τ up =6 min τ down =4
    min. Show All The increase in RH from 32% to 90% and the decrease from 90% to
    ambient ( ≈40% ) can both be considered as a step function stimulus of a time
    invariant system [29]. As such, the sensor’s response (i.e., its moisture absorption/desorption)
    can be fit to C=ΔC(1− e t/τ )+ C 0 and a system time constant, τ , extracted.
    The sensor with the larger capacitance and area [Fig. 6(a)] has τ≈8 min, while
    the smaller sensor uptakes moisture slightly faster, with a time constant of τ≈6
    min. Both sensors release moisture at a slightly faster rate with τ≈5 min and
    τ≈4 min for the large and small sensor respectively. These values align well with
    CNF-cardstock composite moisture diffusion results [30]. Note, the oscillations
    present in Fig. 6(a) are due to overshoots in RH caused by the humidity controller.
    Because groundwater evaporation and flow typically occurs over a 12 h cycle, data
    from current sensing techniques show that sampling rates of up to 2 h is sufficient
    to capture soil moisture fluctuations [31]. As such, the response rates of our
    sensors are more than sufficient to capture the temporal response of soil moisture.
    C. Humidity Response CNF-composite sensors stored in 32% RH were placed in the
    humidity chamber set at 40% RH and their S -parameters were recorded. Following
    this, every 30 min the humidity of the chamber was increased by 10% up to a final
    RH of 90%. The experiment was repeated with the same structures printed on polyimide.
    For the polyimide measurements, the humidity of the chamber was increased every
    10 min, as the measurements stabilized faster. An increase in equivalent capacitance
    at 915 MHz is calculated over the duration of the experiment and illustrated in
    Fig. 7. The self-resonant frequency of all sensors remained well above 928 MHz
    even at the largest RH, where it was 2.94 and 1.752 GHz for small and large polyimide
    structures and 3.03 and 1.6 GHz for small and large CNF-composite sensors. At
    peak RH, the small moisture sensor had a normalized increase in capacitance, ΔC/
    C 0 , of 0.28 while the large moisture sensor had a 0.75 normalized increase in
    capacitance, 2.7 times larger. Fig. 7. Change in sensor capacitance over time
    with increasing RH. (a) Large sensor: C 0 =1.49 pF for polyimide and C 0 =1.22
    pF for CNF-composite and (b) small sensor: C 0 =0.55 pF for polyimide and C 0
    =0.44 pF for CNF-composite. Show All SECTION V. Sensor Measurements in Soil A.
    Experimental Method Sensor response in soil was measured on a Cascade Microsystems
    probe station. A custom 3-D printed soil holder was designed. This holder allowed
    for soil to be placed below and above the sensor’s active area respectively, while
    allowing the 550μm GSG probes to land on sensor leads without touching the soil.
    Once again, electrical response was measured using a Keysight P9374A VNA calibrated
    using a SOLT method. Loamy sand soil with a composition of 85% sand, 9.8% silt,
    4.2% clay and 4.1% organic matter, similar to soil found in midwestern agricultural
    (e.g., corn, soybean) fields, was dried in an oven at 110 °C overnight to remove
    all moisture. Water was subsequently added to the soil to obtain desired moisture
    contents θ g (defined as θ g = m h 2 O / m drysoil ) of 15% and 25%. The upper
    bound of tested soil moisture content was fixed at 25%, which is near the moisture
    saturation limit for loamy sand soil [32]. Any additional water caused soil and/or
    water to seep out of its holder onto the probes. When measured in soil moisture
    conditions, sensors were probed after 18 min of exposure to soil, to allow the
    CNF-composite substrate time to absorb moisture (see Fig. 6). To evaluate the
    sensor’s ability to respond to soil moisture over multiple wetting and drying
    cycles, a large and a small CNF sensor were measured in dry soil and 15% soil
    moisture. These samples were then dried at 150 °C for 1 h to evaporate any moisture
    present in the sensor and the experiment was repeated. To evaluate the ability
    of the sensor to dry in soil, wet soil was placed on a sensor and allowed to dry
    in ambient conditions. B. Sensor Simulation Validation Sensors measured under
    ambient conditions (RH ≈35% ) in the soil holder were compared to simulated versions
    of these sensors. Fig. 8 shows the admittance in dB of the simulated and fabricated
    sensors. Good agreement between simulated and measured sensor admittance is observed
    at lower frequencies, while the self-resonant frequency of the measured sensors
    is slightly larger than that of the simulated structures. Traces in the HFSS model
    are 100μm wide and 10μm thick with a rectangular cross section. From Fig. 3, actual
    trace widths are wider (between 110 and 125μm ). Peak trace height is ≈14μm and
    has a more triangular cross section. This increase in trace width and thickness
    during the manufacturing process could decrease trace inductance which would in
    turn increase sensor self-resonant frequency, explaining the minor discrepancies
    between simulation and measurement. Fig. 8. Simulated (dashed) and measured (line)
    admittance of sensor screen-printed on CNF-composite substrate. Show All C. Results
    1) Soil Wetting: Fig. 9 shows the results of the soil moisture experiment. Fig.
    9(a) shows the phase of the admittance of both sensors for different soil moisture
    levels. The sensor self-resonance occurs when the sign of the phase switches from
    negative to positive. As such, the small sensor’s self-resonance remains above
    928 MHz for all soil moisture conditions (1.19-3.25 GHz), while the self-resonance
    of the larger moisture sensor, at 830 MHz, falls below the 902–928 MHz frequency
    band when soil moisture reaches 25%. The measured amplitude of the moisture sensor’s
    susceptance, the imaginary part of the admittance, is plotted over a 300–930 MHz
    frequency range with each of the corresponding capacitance’s labeled [Fig. 9(b)].
    Fig. 9(c) shows the equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz for the CNF-composite sensor
    as well as for the same structure printed on polyimide at different soil moisture
    conditions. When the sensor goes from being measured in air ( ϵ r =1 ) to being
    measured in dry soil ( ϵ r ≈2.2 [33]), the capacitances of both the structures
    on polyimide and the CNF-composite increases by a factor of 1.2, as both substrates
    are unresponsive to this change in medium. Once water is added to the soil, the
    CNF-composite substrate absorbs moisture, further increasing its capacitance compared
    to the polyimide structure. As such, from dry soil to 15% soil moisture, the sensor
    capacitance increases by a factor of 2.4 and 3.2 for the small and large sensor,
    respectively. Small sensor capacitance increases by a factor of 3.8 from 15% moisture
    to 25% soil moisture. This nonlinear response to soil moisture is caused by the
    quadratic relationship between soil moisture and soil dielectric constant [28],
    [34]. The smaller sensor, once again, shows a lower response to moisture than
    the larger one. Fig. 9. Large (top) and small (bottom) CNF-composite sensors in
    different soil moisture levels (a) phase of sensor reactance, (b) susceptance
    of the sensors, and (c) equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz. Show All 2) Soil Cycling:
    Fig. 10 shows the result of the soil moisture cycling experiment. The equivalent
    capacitance at 915 MHz is shown over time as a function of soil moisture. In dry
    soil the capacitance of the small sensor before and after the drying cycle decreases
    by 2%. In soil with 15% moisture, capacitance before and after drying decreased
    by 5%. These differences in capacitance are negligible compared to the 150% increase
    in capacitance caused by the 15% increase in soil moisture. Similarly, the large
    sensor capacitance in dry soil decreased 5.5% before and after drying, while its
    capacitance at 15% soil moisture varied by 0.3%. These variations are once again
    minimal compared to the 200% increase in capacitance caused by the 15% increase
    in soil moisture. Here, the large sensor capacitance at 15% soil moisture is smaller
    than in Fig. 9. This is caused by a difference in sensor self-resonant frequency.
    The self-resonance of the sensor in Fig. 10 at 15% soil moisture is 1.34 GHz.
    In Fig. 9(a), the sensor self-resonance is 1.16 GHz. However, the phase of the
    sensor at 915 MHz has begun to decrease, which slightly increases the equivalent
    capacitance. This discrepancy in sensor self-resonance can be ascribed to the
    manual screen printing process. Small changes in the characteristics of the sensors
    can be caused by slight differences in applied pressure or squeegee angle. Uniformity
    in sensor performance will be improved in the future using an automatic or semi-automatic
    screen-printing machine. Fig. 10. Equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz for two soil
    moisture conditions over two measurement cycles. Show All 3) Soil Drying: To investigate
    the response of the sensor to changing soil moisture conditions, soil with a moisture
    content between 15% and 20% was placed on top of a small sensor. The S -parameters
    of this sensor were recorded over time, as the wet soil dried under ambient lab
    conditions. The equivalent capacitance of the sensor at 915 MHz was calculated
    and is plotted over time in Fig. 11. To compare the sensor response to the drying
    rate of the soil placed above the sensor, a soil drying experiment was repeated
    in similar lab conditions with the mass of the soil recorded over time using a
    precision scale. Soil moisture content decayed exponentially, and after 7.5 h,
    the moisture content had decayed to 10% of its equilibrium value, with it decaying
    to 5% after 10.5 h. From Fig. 11, the sensor capacitance decreases exponentially,
    and approaches its nominal capacitance in dry soil after approximately 12 h. This
    discrepancy in the response between the sensor capacitance and the soil mass can
    be explained due to the drying behavior of the system. As the soil dries, moisture
    first evaporates from the surface of the soil, followed by moisture from the bulk.
    Therefore, the sensor will only dry, and thus change its capacitance, after the
    soil above it has started to lose moisture. Thus, the sensor is capable of drying
    in soil at a rate acceptable for agricultural soil moisture monitoring [31]. Fig.
    11. Change in sensor equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz as the soil above the sensor
    dries. Show All SECTION VI. Discussion and Conclusion This work focused on the
    fabrication and design of soil moisture sensors on a nanocellulose-coated biodegradable
    substrate. The soil moisture response of the sensors was demonstrated over a timescale
    of several hours to a day. However, in an agricultural field, sensors would have
    to collect data over an entire growing season, which typically lasts several months.
    As the substrate degrades, the response of the sensor is also expected to degrade
    until the sensor is no longer deemed functional. Previous work has used the amount
    of biogas generation of cellulose materials as a method to characterize the rate
    and percentage of degradation. Pulp-based papers, similar to the cardstock in
    our CNF-composite, take 82 days to reach near 100% degradation in a high microbial
    content soil [25]. However, as our device relies on the moisture response of CNF,
    the degradation time of nanocellulose offers better insight into the operational
    lifetime of our sensor. Studies characterizing nanocellulose degradation have
    found that pure nanocellulose films degrade completely in 22 to 30 days [25],
    [26]. These studies suggest that the CNF layer on our device will completely degrade
    after a few weeks. While future work will have to be conducted to evaluate how
    the degradation process impacts sensor performance, we expect the unpackaged sensors
    to have an approximate lifetime of a few weeks. Preliminary work has shown that
    the lifetime of these devices can be extended through the use of appropriate packaging,
    which will be the focus of future studies. Additionally, to fabricate fully biodegradable
    sensors, the use of biodegradable inks, such as copper- or zinc-based inks [35]
    will be investigated. The CNF-cardstock composite’s demonstrated use at RF makes
    it an excellent candidate for developing fully biodegradable, passive, wireless
    sensing systems. Such systems would rely on a frequency-coded, passive chipless-RFID
    sensing mechanism. Fully biodegradable sensor nodes, where the soil sensor is
    integrated with a screen-printed inductor on the CNF-composite substrate, would
    allow for wireless communication ranges up to approximately 15 cm through weak
    inductive coupling. Communication ranges can be increased significantly (up to
    100 m) by integrating a high Q miniature acoustic resonator and replacing the
    inductor with a screen-printed RF antenna [36]. The addition of the acoustic resonator
    would leave a 1 mm3 piece of Si after full degradation of the CNF-composite substrate
    and conductive traces. These two communication schemes thus enable the use of
    this sensor in a variety of operational scenarios. In this work we presented a
    moisture-responsive capacitive sensor printed on a CNF-cardstock composite, an
    all-cellulose biodegradable substrate. The infiltration of nanocellulose reduced
    the porosity and roughness of the cardstock, producing a smooth surface suitable
    for screen printing electrical structures with good fidelity and repeatability.
    Structures printed on the CNF-composite were of high fidelity and of similar quality
    to those printed on polyimide, a standard substrate in printed electronics. The
    hygroscopic nature of the CNF-infiltrated layer leads to a sensor with good moisture
    sensitivity over a wide range of humidity and soil moisture conditions. Additionally,
    the fabricated sensors demonstrated moisture responsiveness throughout the 902–928
    MHz band and the small sensor maintained a self-resonance well above this frequency
    band, making it suitable for passive RF sensing applications. The sensors showed
    a 0.75 (large sensor) and 0.28 (small sensor) normalized increase in capacitance
    from 40% to 90% RH. The small sensor exhibited a 9× increase in capacitance from
    dry soil to 25% soil moisture. The sensor’s ability to respond to soil drying
    was demonstrated. Sensor response after a wetting and drying cycle was shown to
    be very similar to the initial response. A trade-off between sensor sensitivity
    and self-resonance was observed. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank

  description: The agricultural sector faces several difficulties today in ensuring
    the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study presents the design
    and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI system targeted towards
    smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder community is hesitant
    to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming reasons for this,
    but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning sensors cause
    inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make digital and
    innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available to these communities
    by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept. Considered a vital
    resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal behavior, providing
    information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent agro-field data
    leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable low-cost irrigation
    system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze anomalies
    and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected using an autoencoder
    (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with time series records from the datasets and replace
    detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When integrated with an IoT
    platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling of sensor anomalies
    and can help create supervised datasets for future research. In addition, anomalies
    can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning approaches, applying
    CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform the GANs, achieving
    an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity,
    respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that the data are of high
    quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared to the existing platforms.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract The agricultural sector faces several difficulties
    today in ensuring the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study
    presents the design and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI
    system targeted towards smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder
    community is hesitant to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming
    reasons for this, but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning
    sensors cause inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make
    digital and innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available
    to these communities by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept.
    Considered a vital resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal
    behavior, providing information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent
    agro-field data leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable
    low-cost irrigation system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    to analyze anomalies and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected
    using an autoencoder (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will
    feed the autoencoders’ anomaly detection models with time series records from
    the datasets and replace detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When
    integrated with an IoT platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling
    of sensor anomalies and can help create supervised datasets for future research.
    In addition, anomalies can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning
    approaches, applying CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform
    the GANs, achieving an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature,
    and air humidity, respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that
    the data are of high quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared
    to the existing platforms. Keywords: IoT; smart farming; anomaly detection; low
    cost; fog-AI; deep learning 1. Introduction The world’s population is anticipated
    to increase by close to 2 billion by 2050, causing a rapid escalation in food
    demand. To cater to the needs of the increasing population, the agricultural industry
    needs to be modernized, smart, and automated [1]. The food and agriculture organization
    (FAO) [2] claims that small-scale farming significantly contributes to rural economies
    and food security. On the other hand, smallholders usually deal with a range of
    restrictions that reduce their ability to produce profitably and advance the economy
    [3]. However, smallholder farmer communities (SFCs) have not benefited from adopting
    solutions to increase irrigation efficiency because of the high starting costs
    and the high skill levels needed to understand the technology. Recently, the fourth
    industrial revolution (IR 4.0) paradigm shift has ushered in a surge in technological
    innovation and sustainable transformation across various industries and sectors
    [4]. The innovative use of printed sensors for measurement and monitoring in smart
    agricultural applications has garnered considerable attention. Smart farming utilizing
    printed sensors is in its infancy and requires additional research [5]. Significant
    limitations restrict SFCs’ productivity and profit potential. As a result of a
    variety of crucial issues, including a lack of agricultural expertise, financial
    resources, climate change, and market access to address these challenges, we propose
    in this research a low-cost (USD 260) smart farming system for monitoring and
    prediction that will assist SFCs in forecasting future data in order to compute
    their water demands and properly schedule irrigation. The sensor component employs
    a low-cost design that is basic but sturdy and efficient, inspired by various
    do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives and previous contributions [6,7]. In terms of
    accuracy and error reduction, the system outperforms others. In this context,
    the goal of the PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project [8] is to increase the visibility and
    accessibility of digital and smart agricultural technologies among small and medium-sized
    farms. To meet the needs of this community, the suggested solutions must be economical,
    easy to implement in the field, and, most importantly, adaptable to current agricultural
    techniques. As a result, by inventing a low-cost, smart irrigation control system,
    INTEL-IRRIS hopes to transform the view that SFCs have of what was formerly highly
    expensive technology. INTEL-IRRIS also hopes that by using the “intelligent irrigation
    in a box” idea, they can make smart irrigation systems as easy to set up and use
    as home appliances, with a small investment compared to how much money they make.
    The main objective of this research is to improve on our previous work [3,9] by
    increasing the accuracy of low-cost sensors for data collection so that our water–soil–plants–climate
    interaction models will provide increased accuracy of predicted environmental
    factors to enhance the irrigation efficiency of smallholder farmers. There is
    a current need for our low-cost fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, that employs deep
    learning to analyze in real-time the anomalies and problems that appear in low-cost
    sensors. To reach this goal, we propose a low-cost, sustainable irrigation system
    that helps smallholder farmers manage irrigation more efficiently by providing
    a low-cost, open-source, autonomous, and easy-to-use smart irrigation control
    system that takes advantage of IoT capabilities, as shown in Figure 1. Figure
    1. “Intelligent irrigation in a box” idea of PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project. We will
    implement the “Intelligent Irrigation in a Box” idea by presenting a sensor/ control/actuator-based
    “plug-and-sense” system using significant technological advances from the last
    few years, including IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and decision support systems
    (DSS). This technology may be linked with existing irrigation infrastructure [10,11],
    allowing it to be controlled according to smallholders’ customs. Using sensor
    technologies, the provided platform collects critical physical phenomena such
    as soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, water level, water velocity,
    and light intensity using a DL methodology. An unsupervised learning approach
    is well-suited for detecting anomalies, especially in cases with limited labeled
    time-series samples and complex, nonlinear climate and soil patterns. According
    to the literature, the most promising approaches for anomaly detection are Autoencoders
    [12] and GANs [13] in time series. The sliding window technique is highly appropriate
    for predicting future sensor readings through a supervised learning approach.
    Utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture, combining convolutional and recurrent
    neural networks, enables the attainment of a minimal estimation error for similar
    sequence-to-sequence prediction problems [14]. Consideration is given to a novel
    Fog-IoT-Cloud platform for storing, analyzing, and using vast volumes of acquired
    data to assist SFCs in managing the irrigation mechanism efficiently. This work’s
    main contributions are as follows: (i) The design and development of a low-cost
    fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, fully targeted towards smallholder farmer communities
    (SFCs) to enhance irrigation decision making. (ii) We provide a comprehensive
    performance assessment and comparison between the autoencoders (AE) and generative
    adversarial networks (GAN) to detect anomalies in environmental factors data.
    (iii) Predicting the most important environmental factors (air temperature, air
    humidity, soil moisture) based on field sensory data and weather forecast data
    using CNN/BiLSTM architecture to provide SFCs with recommendations. The rest of
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the relevant
    literature on irrigation systems. The INTEL-IRRIS fog-IoT/AI system, at the heart
    of the architectural design discussed in this paper, will be presented in Section
    3. Sensor anomaly detection for smart irrigation systems is provided in Section
    4. Section 5 describes the most important environmental factors that can be predicted
    using deep learning. Finally, conclusions and future trends are given in Section
    6. 2. Related Studies In this section, we present a review of the relevant literature
    on irrigation systems. Each of them has focused on various aspects of the irrigation
    task. As illustrated in Table 1, we categorize the studies based on the following
    criteria: (i) Underground sensing: the IOUT requirement emerges partially or fully
    buried underground for real-time monitoring and soil sensing; several essential
    irrigation characteristics include soil moisture, soil texture, soil salinity,
    etc. (ii) Environmental sensing: it is used to monitor important weather pattern
    changes in real-time. (iii) Geographic information systems (GIS): provide a potent
    instrument for near-real-time analysis of crop status. Ground-based equipment,
    aerial drones, and satellites all collect GIS agriculture data. (iv) Soil texture:
    on precision agriculture (PA), we computed the useable reserve of water (RU) based
    on the soil texture (clay, limon, sand, organic matter). (v) Machine learning
    approaches: it indicates whether the study considered machine learning approaches
    for intrusion detection systems. (vi) Deep learning approaches: it specifies if
    the study was focused on deep learning approaches for intrusion detection systems.
    (vii) Low-cost: the objective of the Intel-Irris project is to use low-cost sensors
    by dividing the cost by a factor of 10 to 100. (viii) Anomaly detection: the detection
    of anomalies is a crucial stage that will enhance the quality of results in predictive
    modeling and pattern extraction, enabling the identification of problems and facilitating
    decision making in data-based services. In our previous works [3,9], we suggested
    an Edge-IoT-Cloud platform based on a deep learning methodology for monitoring
    and predicting farmers’ ability to satisfy crop water demands when there is insufficient
    rainfall. Recently, Citoni et al. [15] published a review and analysis of currently
    available LoRaWAN-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications for intelligent
    agriculture. Vuran et al. [16] focus only on the underground factors; however,
    environmental sensing and SIG play a very important role in irrigation tasks.
    Optimizing water resources for agricultural production using an automated irrigation
    system has proven feasible and cost-effective, as proposed by Gutierrez et al.
    [17]. Table 1. A comparative analysis between the proposed platform and previous
    platform.   A few scientific studies focus on the application of data processing
    techniques to agricultural data in order to develop a more robust decision support
    framework. Roopaei et al. [22] presented an appropriate approach to identifying
    key parameters to schedule irrigation: the amount of water used was monitored,
    irrigation was scheduled on the basis of the canopy temperature distribution of
    the plant, and data were collected by means of thermal imaging. However, using
    the thermal imaging technique has many drawbacks that affect irrigation scheduling:
    different emissivities and reflections from surfaces obstruct precise temperature
    measurements, and most thermal imaging cameras have ±2% accuracy. Also, thermal
    images are difficult to interpret for specific objects with erratic temperatures.
    Aurora et al. [25], using unsupervised algorithms, devised and tested a three-step
    irrigation system for urban parks. By extracting prior knowledge using a multivariate
    approach, this methodology reduces the time required by univariate anomaly detection
    systems to analyze the entire univariate time series. Goap et al. [19] proposed
    a smart irrigation architecture based on IoT and a hybrid approach that relies
    on DL to predict soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensor data collected
    from recent and past weather forecasts to predict soil moisture. However, environmental
    sensing is not sufficient to make a good irrigation schedule, and the authors
    also do not take into consideration the crop coefficient and the soil texture.
    Chen et al. [26] suggest a new approach for making irrigation decisions in paddy
    rice farming that uses deep Q-learning and short-term weather predictions. The
    new method was compared to the widespread practice of flooded irrigation in southern
    China. The results indicated the reliability of the daily rainfall forecast and
    the efficiency of the Deep Q-Learning strategy for saving water. Boursianis et
    al. [23] discussed the AREThOU5A IoT platform subsystems and their primary operations,
    as well as the deployed layered architecture stack. Within the context of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform, an innovative method for delivering power to the platform’s
    IoT modules has been implemented. Cheema et al. [24] constructed an intelligent
    system with multiple sensors and devices related to internet of things (IoT) technologies.
    In addition, they developed an Android application called \"Kistan Pakistan\"
    that allows illiterate and low-literate farmers to remotely administer its functions.
    Pham et al. [20] described a low-cost and full edge-IoT/AI system targeting smallholder
    farmer communities and how it can provide the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box”
    concept. It offers an “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the control component
    that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway and, as a result,
    does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP partner [27]. In
    contrast to previous research, the current study incorporates four factors to
    improve irrigation efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability, and the sustainability
    of agricultural production. In particular, we take into account the following
    factors: (i) soil texture; (ii) crop coefficient; (iii) sensed data with the weather
    forecast; and (iv) sensing of the subsurface parameter, in this instance, soil
    moisture. The objective is to calculate the requisite water quantity based on
    these variables. 3. Supplying Smallholder Farmers with Smart Technology 3.1. A
    Summary of the INTEL-IRRIS and PNR Projects As stated earlier, INTEL-IRRIS [8]
    aims to make digital and intelligent agricultural technology more appealing and
    accessible to small and medium-sized farms. However, a compromise will be made
    to accomplish the primary aim: to create a low-cost irrigation system that SFCs
    can implement out of the box. The soil moisture sensor component follows a basic,
    resilient, and cost-effective design that has been substantially influenced by
    several do-it-yourself projects and prior contributions [6,20]. Unlike low-cost
    sensors that often offer unreliable data, INTEL-IRRIS will significantly improve
    the quality of collected data with (i) improved calibration of various sensors;
    (ii) the calculation of the needed amount of water based on the farm’s soil texture
    and crop coefficient; and (iii) the prediction of environmental factors based
    on field sensory data using DL. 3.2. Smart and Sustainable Irrigation System Figure
    2 shows how the smart farming system architecture collects, transfers, and processes
    physical parameters from small-scale farming, such as soil moisture, air temperature,
    air humidity, water level, water flows, the intensity of light, combustible gas,
    etc., in order to improve irrigation efficiency by deploying a low-cost, open,
    autonomous irrigation control system based on IoT and AI techniques [28]. The
    irrigation scheduling algorithm determines the amount of water required to maintain
    the maximum production potential without wasting water (i) for a particular crop,
    (ii) at a specified time, and (iii) for a specific soil type. The following section
    summarizes the proposed platform’s details. Figure 2. Global view of our proposed
    operational architecture. 3.3. Hardware Architecture As illustrated in Figure
    2, the network component of our platform is supplied via multi-hop communication
    between box A (the sensor layer) and box B (the gateway node) up to box C (the
    fog layer). Finally, a virtual machine (VM) is created on the Azure cloud to deploy
    multiple anomaly detection and prediction models. In addition to using NRF24L01
    modules for wireless communication and Arduino boards as microcontrollers, we
    also intended to use Raspberry Pi 3 B+ boards as a fog layer. 3.4. Software Architecture
    Using open-source development tools, we created a software architecture to reduce
    bandwidth, latency, cost, load balancing, and scalability, as shown in Figure
    3. Using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, communication
    between the gateway and server is established. The TCP transport layer protocol
    ensures dependable data transmission (COAP uses UDP). Because of this, it is encrypted
    with SSL, supports quality of service (QoS parameter 2: requires messages to be
    delivered exactly once), and has a much shorter message header than HTTP. Figure
    3. Global view of our software architectural proposal. 3.5. Box A: Sensing Node
    The sensing node, which depicts the field data gathering tool, falls short of
    the total of USD 140. An Atmega328 microprocessor reads the output from these
    sensors. For around two dollars (USD), it may be used to construct a cheap design
    strategy for the Arduino. As seen in Figure 4, this box’s sensor layer devices
    are designed to collect data from smallholder farmers and transmit it using the
    NRF24L01 radio module, which is available for roughly 5 dollars (USD) and enables
    the supply of a radio communication layer with an SPI interface. The farmer can
    examine the data and keep an eye on the crops in real-time since the data may
    be kept in a private database or in the cloud to construct a dataset. Figure 4.

    and NRF module are in the box. Figure 4 provides a comprehensive description of
    the box’s sensors. We then set the NRF24L01 module to write mode and supply the
    destination address; we read the sensor values using the analogRead function on
    the data pins. The measured data are structured and transmitted to the IoT gateway
    every hour, where historical data are stored to detect anomalies at the fog layer.
    For the power supply of the sensor node, we used rechargeable 9 V batteries. Table
    2 lists the cost of all components. In total, a sensing and actuation node costs
    USD 260. A large portion of the budget is for the cost of box C. Table 2. The
    proposed platform cost. 3.6. Box B: Relay Node The relay node acts as an intermediate
    device and transmits the packets to the IoT gateway. In listening mode, we set
    up the gateway node by supplying the node address from whence the packets come,
    the channel number (122), and the data structure; if the data are received, it
    changes to sending mode, at which stage we provide the address of the next node.
    The power supply of the relay node was improved by using two AA batteries. 3.7.
    Box C: IoT Gateway Fog computing facilitates the operation of computation, storage,
    and networking services between end devices and cloud computing. Box C permits
    data to be transmitted to the internet network, but not for a total of USD 90.
    We picked a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ type board since it has adequate hardware resources
    for processing and is based on the Linux kernel, making it compatible with most
    languages and AI libraries. It needs a 5 V power supply, an external Wi-Fi 802.11
    card, and an Ethernet connector to connect to the internet. We used Python to
    create a concurrent TCP server (one thread per request), and we started by loading
    the prediction models from disk into the main memory (the kind of “*.tflite” files
    after the conversion to Tensorflow Lite). When a request comes in, a thread handles
    the receiving and preprocessing, resulting in the prediction. If we are looking
    for anomalies, we must compare the model outputs to an error threshold and provide
    the answer. On demand, we can also utilize the service to adjust the error levels
    of the various models. The server regularly delivers messages that include information
    such as the node’s IP address, available resources (RAM and CPU), and network
    latency. NodeJS listens on the serial port “/dev/tty0” at 115,200 baud. We extracted
    the measurements whenever new data were written to the port (separated by commas).
    We verified that all of the sensors were operational. This information is saved
    in the MySQL database for the time being. Finally, we produced a structured package
    including the latest six readings of each sensor, which had to correlate to the
    detection model anomaly entries. Then, we transmitted the latter to the Python-implemented
    service, which includes the various models; after receiving the answer, we checked
    for anomalies. An HTTP server configured using the “Express” module and listening
    on port 7000 sends the application pages to the browser. The route to each page
    is specified, and communication occurs via the “WebSocket” protocol. Every hour,
    a temporal event is triggered, which transmits the last received packet if none
    has come, allowing us to forecast it. The integrated Wi-Fi card is employed as
    an access point for configuration and adjusting the thresholds of anomaly detection
    models (leaving a means to reach the local network). Finally, data visualization
    from the gateway is required to assist the developer during maintenance. We investigated
    adding slave nodes that handle resource-intensive processing to enhance computing
    power and load balancing. The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ card’s Wi-Fi card creates a wireless
    network that the cluster uses to communicate. 3.8. Cloud Layer We suggest using
    cloud services to store significant volumes of data generated by sensors in order
    to guarantee the accessibility and availability of our platform everywhere and
    at any time. Furthermore, we use them to anticipate future meters, ensuring scalability
    and more resources when our platform is overloaded (elasticity). A free student
    offer was provided to us, and we will utilize it to create a VM with a public
    IP address that we can access via the remote desktop protocol (RDP). As seen in
    Figure 5, Influx DB offers a limited free cloud service, so setting up a user’s
    dashboard for data analysis and monitoring is straightforward. Figure 5. Monitoring
    and analysis of data on the cloud service. 4. Sensor Anomalies Detection for Smart
    Irrigation Systems Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular for tasks beyond
    image recognition, segmentation, and classification. Non-image data have been
    gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the advancement of IoT
    [29]. The main idea of unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series data is to
    identify whether data observations conform to normal data distributions over time.
    With this technique, we can discover patterns and anomalies that are otherwise
    hard to find. In order to spot unexpected patterns or anomalies as the data changes
    over time, it is crucial to comprehend how each variable within the time series
    affects the others. As shown in Figure 6, the received measurements are consolidated
    with the time series records in the local database. These merged data are used
    as input for anomaly detection models, which aim to identify any anomalies or
    unusual patterns within the data. The reconstructed inputs from the model are
    employed to estimate a corrected value for the abnormal measurement. The goal
    is to correct any inaccuracies or abnormalities identified in the original measurement.
    Once the new measure has been adjusted using the sensor value estimation model,
    it is stored back in the local database. This ensures that the corrected measure
    is available for future reference or analysis. In our research, the scarcity of
    labeled anomaly data poses a challenge. Therefore, GANs and AEs present advantageous
    options as they can effectively perform anomaly detection. Additionally, these
    techniques are capable of learning representations that capture both global and
    local dependencies within the data, enabling them to understand complex patterns
    effectively. GANs, in particular, leverage a discriminator network that can accurately
    classify anomalies. AEs focus on reconstructing input data and strive to minimize
    the reconstruction error. A threshold on the reconstruction error allows for the
    efficient identification of anomalies. Figure 6. Illustration of IoT gateway sensor
    anomaly detection and correction process. 4.1. Generative Adversarial Networks
    (GAN) Unsupervised anomaly detection using generative adversarial networks (GAN),
    as illustrated in Figure 7, involves training two models: a generator and a discriminator.
    The generator learns a model representing normal time series variability, while
    the discriminator learns to identify data points that do not conform to the normal
    behavior. The discriminator can then distinguish between time-series data corresponding
    to normal behavior. Moreover, using GANs for unsupervised anomaly detection in
    time-series data helps identify more complex anomalies than traditional methods
    since it can learn more complex dependencies between different variables within
    the time series (backpropagation). Figure 7. Overview of GAN structure. 4.2. Autoencoder
    (AE) Autoencoders are popular-deep learning-based anomaly detection models that
    have been observed to be reliable and effective. What makes this model so successful
    is its ability to reduce the time-series data to a lower dimension and reconstruct
    them in a higher dimension. As illustrated in Figure 8, this encoding and decoding
    can be performed with the help of different deep learning layers, such as convolutional
    layers. Then, the data are decoded to a higher dimension using an autoencoder
    algorithm. These reconstructed data can then be compared to the primary data to
    detect anomalies. Autoencoders have been a successful tool for anomaly detection
    in time-series data. Their efficiency can even be increased with the use of regularization,
    dropout, and noise-reduction techniques. Moreover, the autoencoder model is able
    to independently extract features from the input data, leading to better accuracy
    and lower computing costs. Figure 8. Overview of autoencoder network architecture.
    4.3. Problem Formulation Considering a time-series dataset 𝐷=[ 𝑋 1 ,  𝑋 2 ,…,  𝑋
    𝑛 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑛 , where each 𝑋 𝑖 =[ 𝑥 1𝑖 ,  𝑥 2𝑖 ,…,  𝑥 𝑡𝑖 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡 (for 𝑖=1,…,𝑛 ) comprising
    data obtained from sensors over a specific period of time t, the suggested model
    is trained with a subset of the dataset 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑘 which only contains normal
    samples, where k is the number of training samples. The samples for testing are
    𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 =[ 𝐷 𝑣 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 , 𝐷 𝑢 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×(𝑣+𝑢) , with v and u representing the number
    of normal and abnormal samples, respectively, and 𝑛=𝑘+𝑣+𝑢 . Due to the imbalanced
    nature of the time-series data, the size of normal samples is greater than that
    of abnormal samples. A GAN-based model is trained with 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 to reduce the output
    for each output 𝑋 𝑖 in 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . After the training process as shown in Appendix
    A, 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is passed through the trained model to evaluate it according to unseen
    samples during the learning. The trained generator can then generate fake normal
    samples from the noise vector. The discriminator model is used to accurately classify
    samples into normal or abnormal sequences. Autoencoders can be used as techniques
    for unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection. To train an autoencoder,
    this technique involves training a model on a dataset that contains only normal
    data. We use a supervised learning approach by dividing the dataset into training
    and testing sets. The training 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and testing 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 sets are divided into
    input and output components by applying the sliding window approach. This approach
    uses the previous time intervals as both the input and output variables. This
    technique allows us to apply supervised learning to the autoencoder network. To
    evaluate the performance of the trained model, we used the reconstruction error,
    ℒ(𝑥, 𝑥 ̂  ) , which measures the differences between the original input and the
    consequent reconstruction. The amount of discrepancy between a reconstructed representation
    and the original instance is used to calculate the anomaly score. The larger the
    difference, the greater the probability that it is an outlier. Moreover, the cutoff
    point for identifying anomalies can be adjusted by employing cross-validation
    to determine the most suitable threshold (Th) for the reconstruction error. 4.4.
    Dataset Preprocessing The data used in this analysis were obtained from distinct
    sources, as shown in Table 3. These datasets were selected as they encompass soil
    and weather information and have the same hourly sampling rate to address the
    univariate anomaly detection and forecasting queries. The transformation for anomaly
    detection models involves three steps. Firstly, the time series are scaled between
    0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This is an important step as it helps the network
    learn faster and converge with ease. Secondly, the time series is split into training,
    testing, and validation data. The training set consists of the first 80%, the
    testing set consists of the next 10%, and the validation set consists of the last
    10%. Lastly, the training and testing splits are divided into input and output
    components by using the sliding window technique with sequence length 6 for anomaly
    detection models. Table 3. Description of datasets used to train deep learning
    models. 4.5. Implementation We implemented a Generator network to produce fake
    samples. As shown in Table 3, it consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM,
    and dense layers with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Binary cross-entropy
    measures the performance of a binary classification model whose output is a probability
    value between 0 and 1. We implemented a Discriminator Neural Network that outputs
    a score for each sample, indicating whether it belongs to the real or fake sample.
    This Discriminator consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers.
    To obtain a probability value, a Sigmoid activation function is applied to the
    final layer. We implemented an Autoencoder Neural Network that tries to output
    the same inputs with less reconstruction error. This neural network consists of
    one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers, followed by a dropout layer
    to help prevent overfitting. Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent
    method based on the adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
    In our case, we used the Adam optimizer implemented in the Keras/TensorFlow library,
    with a learning rate of 0.001 and β 2 set to 0.5. GAN models are trained for 2000
    epochs with a batch size of 128, and the autoencoder models are trained for 50
    epochs with a batch size of 8. After each epoch, the model is stored on the hard
    drive to select the best model before overfitting occurs. The detailed network
    architecture of the autoencoder model can be found in Table 4, and the detailed
    network architecture of the GAN is presented in Table 5. Table 4. Network architecture
    of AE model. Table 5. Network architecture of GAN model. 4.6. Description of Evaluation
    Metrics After the learning process, the best model was selected and evaluated
    using balanced class validation data that contain 1000 normal and 1000 abnormal
    samples labeled by agronomy experts. Table 6 summarizes the evaluation metrics
    of the anomaly detection models related to soil moisture, air temperature, and
    air humidity. Table 6. Evaluation metrics of anomaly detection models. The metrics
    used for evaluating the anomaly detection models include precision, recall, F1
    score, and accuracy. They are calculated as follows: Accuracy= 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 𝑇 𝑝 +
    𝑓 𝑛 + 𝑓 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 Precision= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑝 Recall= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑛 F1−score=2× 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 True Positive (TP): represents the number of abnormal samples
    correctly classified as attacks (correct detection). False Positive (FP): represents
    the number of normal samples wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection).
    True Negative (TN): represents the number of normal samples wrongly classified
    (correct detection). False Negative (FN): represents the number of abnormal samples
    wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection). Accuracy: reports the proportion
    of properly categorized samples to all other samples in the testing set. Precision:
    reports the percentage of samples properly categorized for all TP and FP in the
    testing set. Recall: the ratio of TP samples to the total number of TP and FN
    samples is known as recall. The F1-score reports the harmonic mean between precision
    and recall. 4.7. Results and Evaluation We trained a GAN model on soil moisture
    data for 2000 epochs, with an early stop mechanism implemented to stop training
    if the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN
    model for soil moisture at 5 cm depth converged at 500 epochs, while the model
    for 20 cm depth converged at 2000 epochs. Autoencoders were also trained for 100
    epochs, with models saved to the hard drive after each epoch. The model before
    the overfitting occurred was selected, with the models at epoch 38 and epoch 20
    being chosen for soil moisture models at depths of 5 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
    According to Table 6, the accuracy of each model ranged from 57.10% to 97.60%,
    while the F1 score ranged from 43.40% to 97.60%. Among the models, AE obtained
    the maximum accuracy and F1 score of 97.60% and 97.60%, respectively, while GAN
    achieved accuracy and F1 scores of 87.50% and 88.88%, respectively. The autoencoder
    error thresholds were set according to the 95% percentile of training data. As
    shown in Figure 9, we chose four-month time-series data from a soil moisture dataset,
    covering the time period from October 2010 to January 2011. Figure 9. Results
    of anomaly detection models on the soil moisture parameter. The GAN anomaly detection
    model identifies many anomalies in the normal behavior of soil moisture sensors,
    which may lead to false alarms for the farmer. On the other hand, the autoencoder
    model only picks up anomalies in the curves’ peaks that result from irrigation
    or rainfall. We trained a GAN model for detecting anomalies in air temperature
    for 3000 epochs and added an early stopping feature that would stop the training
    if the loss for the generator and discriminator remained low for 20 consecutive
    epochs. The training of the GAN model for air temperature in New York was observed
    to converge at 2700 epochs, while the training of the model for Philadelphia converged
    at 1870 epochs. Additionally, we also trained autoencoders for 100 epochs, saving
    the models after every epoch. The model that was trained before overfitting occurred
    was selected, with the models at epochs 95 and 87 chosen for air temperature models
    in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. The error thresholds for the autoencoder
    models were set based on the 95th percentile of the training data. This resulted
    in high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models compared to
    the GAN models, with the precision being similar for both. As illustrated in Figure
    10, we selected four-month time-series data from an air temperature dataset, from
    October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN anomaly detection model detects abnormalities
    in the normal behaviour of the air temperature sensor, whereas the autoencoder
    model recognizes the typical pattern of the air temperature sensor and does not
    detect any anomalies. Figure 10. Results of anomaly detection models on the air
    temperature parameter. We trained a GAN model for anomaly detection in air humidity
    for 2000 epochs with an early stopping mechanism in place to stop training if
    the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN model
    for air-humidity in New York converged at 680 epochs, while the model for Philadelphia
    converged at 1412 epochs. Additionally, autoencoders were trained for 100 epochs,
    and the models were saved after each epoch. The model before overfitting occurred
    was chosen, with the models at epochs 93 and 100 selected for air humidity autoencoder
    models in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. This resulted in high accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models, which performed better
    than the GAN models. The data used in Figure 11 were a four-month time series
    of air humidity from October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN model identifies anomalies
    in the normal behavior of the sensor, while autoencoders recognize the normal
    patterns of the data and detect only a few anomalies. As per the model validation
    results, the autoencoder-based models demonstrated high accuracy and precision
    in detecting anomalies compared to the GAN models. To optimize the models without
    sacrificing accuracy, they were converted using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on
    IoT gateways. An API and a simple web UI were established to configure the anomaly
    error thresholds and alert end users of any sensor malfunctions, as presented
    in Figure 12. Figure 11. Results of anomaly detection models on the air humidity
    parameter. Figure 12. Configuring anomalies and error thresholds in the IoT gateway
    web application. 5. Irrigation Factors Forecasting Using Deep Learning As illustrated
    in Figure 13, the developed system incorporates various microservices, including
    anomaly detection, forecasting, and data analytics, to enhance farmers’ ability
    to make irrigation decisions. These microservices are exposed through the system.
    To provide the farmer with the necessary tools for monitoring and forecasting
    climate and soil measurements, we have implemented a time-series NoSQL database
    to efficiently handle the large volume of sensor data. This type of database is
    particularly well suited for managing time-dependent data and enabling efficient
    manipulation operations. Additionally, it supports auto-scaling capabilities,
    ensuring that the system can handle increased data loads if required. To provide
    accessibility to the system, we have deployed multiple web servers that host web
    applications. Figure 13. Illustration depicting the interaction between end users
    and cloud services within a system. This allows the farmer to access the system
    and its functionalities through a user-friendly interface. To an ensure optimal
    performance and distribution of user requests, load balancers are implemented
    to evenly distribute the incoming traffic across the deployed web servers. In
    the next experiment, we will test the accuracy of the soil and weather forecasting
    models using autoencoders. In the first stage, we will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with data from the datasets and replace detected anomalies
    with the reconstructed inputs. The obtained data are structured into sequences
    in the next stage by applying the sliding window approach. This methodology improves
    those observed in previous studies [3,28] when integrated with an IoT platform,
    as a tool for simplifying the labeling of actual anomalies, and can assist in
    the creation of supervised datasets for future research in the field. Prediction
    models based on deep learning techniques can also correct anomalies. We use the
    previous 24 records as inputs and the next 24 as outputs. This technique allows
    us to apply supervised learning to soil and weather parameter forecasting tasks.
    5.1. Forecasting Model for Potential Irrigation Factors Based on the previous
    comparison of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs) for
    finding anomalies, it was found that AEs are more accurate and have a lower rate
    of false alarms. As a result, AE models were chosen for the data collection process.
    This section aims to evaluate the performance of the forecasting models after
    applying data clearing and correction techniques, which are intended to enhance
    the data’s quality and reliability for accurate forecasts. Table 6 shows the architecture
    of the model. This architecture is a sequence-to-vector transformation, where
    the input sequence goes through a series of operations to pull out features and
    capture temporal relationships. This process involves using both convolutional
    and LSTM layers. The convolutional layers extract pertinent features from the
    input sequence, while the bidirectional LSTM architecture processes the input
    sequence in both forward and backward directions, enabling the model to capture
    past and future context simultaneously. Finally, the output of the LSTM layer
    is fed into a fully connected layer for additional processing and to generate
    the final output of the model. This architecture enables the model to effectively
    analyze and understand the input sequence, producing a condensed vector representation
    as the ultimate result. 5.2. Evaluation Metrics of Forecasting Models Based on
    Deep Learning Models When analyzing prediction models of future measurement performance,
    the following metrics are typically used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square
    Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are the three most commonly used
    loss metrics to evaluate the performance of DL models related to regression problems.
    They are given as follows: MSE MAE RMSE = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 |
    𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 | = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 5.3. Results and
    Discussion According to our empirical study, the Adam optimizer from Keras/TensorFlow
    with a learning rate of 0.001 was used for training the CNN/BiLSTM models for
    200 epochs using a batch size of 32. The model was saved after each epoch to pick
    the best model before overfitting occurred. Table 7 displays the in-depth structure
    of the CNN/BiLSTM models. The model inputs a sequence of 24 previous values to
    predict the next 24 subsequent sensor measures. As shown in Table 8, the evaluation
    results for the soil moisture forecasting model are presented for two different
    depth sensors (sm_5 and sm_20). For sm_5, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model achieved an MSE of 1.2273, an RMSE of 1.1078, and an MAE of 0.999. However,
    a significant performance improvement was observed when 1025 anomalies were replaced,
    resulting in a notable decrease in MSE to 0.272243, RMSE to 0.52176, and MAE to
    0.4703. These findings demonstrate that replacing anomalies positively impacted
    the model’s ability to forecast soil moisture at sm_5 sensors, leading to more
    accurate predictions. In the case of sm_20, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model yielded an MSE of 1.70128, an RMSE of 1.3043, and an MAE of 1.234. Table
    7. Network architecture of parameter forecasting model. Table 8. Evaluation of
    soil moisture forecasting model. Subsequently, when 716 anomalies were replaced,
    a slight performance improvement was observed, resulting in a reduced MSE of 0.8740,
    an RMSE of 0.9348, and an MAE of 0.861. The decrease in the MSE, RMSE, and MAE
    values indicates enhanced accuracy in the model’s predictions for sm_20 sensors,
    although the improvements were comparatively smaller than those observed for sm_5.
    These results underscore the significance of replacing anomalies in the dataset
    to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model. The improvements achieved for
    the sm_5 sensors demonstrate the substantial impact of addressing anomalies on
    the model’s performance. However, for the sm_20 sensors, the improvements were
    relatively modest, suggesting that anomalies had a lesser effect on the model’s
    predictions in this particular case. According to the results, the autoencoder
    model trained on clean data demonstrated the best forecasting performance, as
    shown in Figure 14. The actual and expected soil moisture were nearly identical,
    with minor discrepancies at the 5 cm and 20 cm depths. Table 9 presents the evaluation
    of an air temperature forecasting model for New York and Philadelphia, considering
    scenarios with and without anomaly replacement. The air temperature model in New
    York, not replacing anomalies, resulted in an MSE of 20.1318, an RMSE of 4.4868,
    and an MAE of 3.497. However, when 1140 anomalies were replaced, the model’s performance
    improved significantly, with the MSE decreasing to 17.7633, the RMSE decreasing
    to 4.2146, and the MAE decreasing to 3.436. This suggests that replacing anomalies
    enhanced the model’s accuracy in predicting air temperature in New York. Figure
    14. Results of soil moisture forecasting models over four months. Table 9. Evaluation
    of air temperature forecasting model. Similarly, for air temperature in Philadelphia,
    the model achieved an MSE of 16.2342, an RMSE of 4.0291, and an MAE of 3.3 when
    anomalies were not replaced. After replacing anomalies, the model’s performance
    improved further, resulting in an MSE of 4.635611, an RMSE of 2.1530, and an MAE
    of 1.648. This indicates that anomaly replacement positively influenced the model’s
    forecasting accuracy in Philadelphia. Overall, the results underscore the significance
    of anomaly replacement in improving the accuracy of the air temperature forecasting
    model, as depicted in Figure 15. The findings demonstrate that addressing anomalies
    led to more precise predictions for air temperature in both New York and Philadelphia.
    As indicated in Table 10, the evaluation results of an air humidity forecasting
    model for two locations are as follows. In New York and Philadelphia, the model’s
    performance was assessed under different scenarios where anomalies were either
    not corrected (corrected anomalies = 0) or replaced using a correction model.
    In the case of air humidity forecasting in New York, the results show that replacing
    anomalies had a minor positive effect on the model’s performance. Although the
    improvements in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values were relatively small, they indicate
    a slight increase in the accuracy of the model’s predictions after anomaly replacement.
    Figure 15. Results of air-temperature forecasting models over four months. Table
    10. Evaluation of air humidity forecasting model. Similarly, for air humidity
    forecasting in Philadelphia, replacing anomalies had a limited impact on the model’s
    performance. The reduction in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values was minimal, suggesting
    only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Overall,
    the results indicate that replacing anomalies had a limited influence on the performance
    of the air humidity forecasting model in both New York and Philadelphia, as shown
    in Figure 16. Anomalies may have a relatively small effect on the accuracy of
    the model’s predictions for air humidity in these locations. However, the long-term
    forecast error was significantly high due to various factors that can impact air
    humidity patterns, such as air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and air
    pollution. After validating the models obtained, they were converted using TensorFlow
    Lite to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and deployed on the cloud.
    An API and web dashboard were developed to display and predict weather and soil
    parameters, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 16. Results of air-humidity forecasting
    models over four months. Figure 17. Estimating irrigation measures using a web
    application accessible online. 6. Conclusions and Future Trends This article introduces
    version 1.0 of the INTEL-IRRIS low-cost and fog-IoT/AI system, developed by the
    University of Oran 1 for SFCs. We present an IoT-based smart farming system that
    integrates anomaly detection based on autoencoders, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to GANs with accuracy rates of 90% for soil moisture, 95% for air temperature,
    and 97% for air humidity. Additionally, anomalies can be adjusted using reconstructed
    inputs from autoencoder models. The results showcase minor estimation errors for
    soil moisture and air temperature hourly forecasting models, indicating the effectiveness
    of our approach. The proposed solution improves the effects observed in previous
    studies and can also assist in creating supervised datasets for future research
    in the field. This platform will need more research that takes into consideration
    several perspectives: To enhance the accuracy of the acquired data, we will increase
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors using autonomous and remotely managed techniques
    to improve the different sensors’ calibration [32]. As a consequence, our water–soil–plant–climate
    interaction models will prescribe more correct measures. To enhance the reliability,
    accessibility, and tracking of sensors and actuators, incorporating a blockchain
    security framework is recommended. This integration will establish a strong mechanism
    for data integrity, availability, and traceability in the system. The design and
    implementation of precision PA-based Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
    like Lora and Sigfox. These approaches are designed to conserve energy, like the
    Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN), and enhance the irrigation efficiency
    of large-holder farmers. Offer the “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the
    control component that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway
    and, as a result, does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP
    partner [27]. Traditional deep learning systems need centralized data gathering
    and processing, which is becoming more unfeasible due to efficiency issues and
    rising data privacy concerns. Due to these qualities, federated learning has been
    a hot topic in smart agriculture. We intend to conduct a comprehensive assessment
    of the FL approach and the centralized machine learning models. Author Contributions

  description: In an agricultural system, finding suitable watering, pesticides, and
    soil content to provide the right nutrients for the right plant remains challenging.
    Plants cannot speak and cannot ask for the food they require. These problems can
    be addressed by applying intelligent (fuzzy logic) controllers to IoT devices
    in order to enhance communication between crops, ground mobile robots, aerial
    robots, and the entire farm system. The application of fuzzy logic in agriculture
    is a promising technology that can be used to optimize crop yields and reduce
    water usage. It was developed based on language and the air properties in agricultural
    fields. The entire system was simulated in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment with
    Cisco Packet Tracer integration. The inputs for the system were soil moisture
    sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors, and the outputs were pump
    flow, valve opening, water level, and moisture in the sounding. The obtained results
    were the output of the valve opening, moisture in the sounding, pump flow rate,
    outflow, water level, and ADH values, which are 10.00000013 rad/s, 34.72%, 4.494%,
    0.025 m3/s, 73.31 cm3, and 750 values, respectively. The outflow rate increase
    indicates that water is being released from the tanks, and the control signal
    fluctuates, indicating that the valve is opening.

  explanation: 'This article implements an IoT device with an intelligent fuzzy logic
    controller for agricultural systems. It combines Cisco Packet Tracer with Matlab/Simulink
    to automate irrigation systems, using the Internet of Things to ''connect'' the
    devices together. The authors conducted a literature review on previous works

  extract_1: The IoT device collects data from temperature sensors, soil moisture
    sensors, and humidity sensors and controls the pumps and valve opening conditions.
    Inputs fill the water tank and their level is measured by water level sensors

    on the feedback signals, the fuzzy logic controller automatically adjusts the
    input signal and then sends it to the respective outputs.

    system; IOT device; smart agriculture system; intelligent controller 1. Introduction
    Farmers need to adapt to the shifting demands of the environment as well as those
    of regulators, consumers, food processors, and retailers. The effects of soil
    erosion, biodiversity loss, and climate change are all becoming more and more
    of a burden, as are consumer preferences for food and worries about its production.
    Furthermore, the natural world, in which farming interacts with plants, pests,
    and diseases, continues to provide difficulties. Even if there are many solutions
    available in modern agriculture, the results vary because every farm is different
    in terms of the amount of water needed, the kind of soil, the temperature, and
    the humidity [1]. For these reasons, farmers are looking for technology that can
    solve the issues facing agriculture today. For farmers, a highly promising solution
    is to integrate Internet of Things devices with intelligent controller algorithms
    in agricultural systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the agricultural
    sector by providing farmers with real-time data on crop health, soil moisture,
    and nutrient levels. These data can be used to optimize crop yield, reduce water
    usage, and minimize the use of pesticides and fertilizers. IoT sensors can be
    used to monitor the health and well-being of livestock, optimize feeding schedules,
    detect illness, and improve breeding programs. Automated irrigation systems can
    be used to monitor soil moisture levels and weather patterns to optimize irrigation
    schedules, which can help reduce water usage and improve crop yield [2]. Many
    researchers have spent their time on the application of IoT devices in agriculture
    without considering the application of different controllers in agriculture to
    date. Furthermore, to sustain the health of the farm and maintain mass productivity,
    it is necessary to implement intelligent controller algorithms such as fuzzy logic,
    adaptive, model predictive, and so on into an agriculture system in order to enhancement
    the communication between faming system. The nature of agriculture structure requires
    flexibility, ease of implementation, robustness, and interpretability. Among the
    intelligent controllers, a fuzzy logic controller is the best fit to address the
    nature of agriculture structure requirements. The reason is that it works with
    imprecise inputs, does not require an accurate mathematical model, and can handle
    nonlinearity. It enables advanced fuzzy logic to control a pump’s switching time
    according to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the main aspect of and
    contributor to the system [3]. It introduces an innovative irrigation time control
    system for smart farming that leverages fuzzy logic to regulate the timing of
    irrigation in crop fields, effectively curbing water wastage while ensuring that
    crops receive neither too little nor too much water. A smart greenhouse system
    based on an IoT and fuzzy inference system can create an automatic microclimatic
    condition that optimizes the conditions of plant growth through the use of IoT
    sensors and actuators that automate the controlling of weather factors to enhance
    the plant growing process. A smart farm system can optimize water usage for agriculture.
    The system implements an open loop fuzzy logic control system using a Mamdani
    control system. The inputs to the fuzzy logic control system are adapted from
    a humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and the flux sensor in the field [4,5].
    The purpose of this research is to improve automation systems in the agricultural
    industries by integrating intelligent controllers with Cisco Packet Tracer. As
    a result of Internet of Things devices being integrated into the system, farmers
    can now easily determine their current farming situation. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows: Section 2 carries out a literature review, and Section
    3 presents mathematical models of the system. The results and a discussion are
    presented in Section 4, and conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2. Literature
    Review Smart agriculture systems can be traced back to the mid-1980s, when research
    into automated fruit harvesting systems began in Japan, Europe, and the United
    States. Impressive advances have been made since then in developing systems for
    use in modern agriculture. To date, agriculture systems have utilized different
    technologies such as precision farming, hydroponics, aquaponics, robots, temperature
    and moisture sensors, aerial images, GPS technology, and vertical farming [6].
    The most popular applications of artificial intelligence in the agriculture industry
    are in three major categories: agricultural robots, predictive analytics, and
    crop and soil monitoring. Computer vision and deep-learning algorithms are used
    to process data captured by drones and/or software-based technology to monitor
    crops. Farmers use technology daily. Automated drones already monitor fields and
    collect data on crops. Agricultural robots are being developed to carry out the
    fieldwork. Robots have successfully planted, tended, and harvested crops. In order
    to realize the full potential of the IoT, there is a need to integrate ubiquitous
    smart devices and cloud-based applications [7,8]; a combined IoT framework with
    a cloud at the center gives the flexibility of dividing associated costs in the
    most logical manner and is also highly scalable. In the combined framework, sensing
    service providers can join the network and offer their data using a storage cloud;
    analytic tool developers can provide their software tools; artificial intelligence
    experts can provide their data mining and machine learning tools useful in converting
    information to knowledge; and computer graphics designers can offer a variety
    of visualization tools [9,10,11,12]. An agricultural management method supported
    by technology monitors, assesses, and evaluates the requirements of specific fields
    and crops. The focus of these efforts is on robotics, which includes sensors,
    aerial images, and sophisticated local weather forecasts, as well as Big Data
    and advanced analytics capabilities. This results in reduced environmental impact,
    financial savings, and optimized fertilizer utilization. Using data and information
    technologies to optimize intricate farming systems is known as smart farming.
    Smart farming does not place as much emphasis on exact measuring or differentiating
    between or within individual animals, as it does with PA. The emphasis is more
    on data application and access—that is, how to make intelligent use of the information
    gathered. Farmers can obtain real-time data regarding the state of the soil and
    plants, the terrain, the climate, the weather, the utilization of resources, labor,
    and funding [13,14]. By using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, farmers
    now possess the knowledge necessary to base their judgments on factual information
    rather than gut feeling. Regular use of web-based data platforms in conjunction
    with Big Data analysis, internal and external farm networking, and precision and
    smart farming techniques is common. Products for IoT-enabled smart agriculture
    are made to automate irrigation systems and use sensors to monitor crop areas.
    Consequently, farmers and related brands may conveniently and remotely check agricultural
    conditions. Agriculture currently uses a variety of technologies. Therefore, to
    determine the degree of technology employed in the system, it is necessary to
    identify and compare the various technologies. For simplicity, this is compared
    in Table 1. Table 1. Smart flatform comparison to date [15,16]. Researchers are
    using a variety of technologies in agriculture systems, including machine learning,
    remote sensing, image processing, sensor networks, and so on, to boost agricultural
    productivity. In order to gain insights, it is necessary to compare the controller
    algorithms used in agricultural systems. The comparison is based on how easily
    it can be automatically tuned during operation, as demonstrated in Table 2. Table
    2. Comparison of control algorithms in smart agriculture applications [15,16,17].
    3. Mathematical Models of the System Figure 1 demonstrates how the overview of
    the present work begins with the collection of related works and the identification
    of issues. Following accurate problem acquisition, mathematical models of the
    agricultural tanks are created. Appropriate control algorithms are developed based
    on the mathematical models. The complete system is then be tested and simulated.
    After integrating the models with Cisco Packet Tracers and simulating again, if
    the test result validates the requirements, the findings are received and discussed.
    The procedure is repeated until the intended outcome is achieved. If the tested
    results are not validated by the requirements, which are checked against the mathematical
    model, the procedure is repeated. Figure 1. Flow chart of the current work. 3.1.
    Working Principles of Smart Agriculture From Figure 2, it can be understood that
    agriculture can be a field as suitable as industry for the application of automation.
    Addressing the issues in the agricultural sector is challenging because crops
    are unable to communicate their emotions. Furthermore, humans are unaware of all
    the requirements that plants have. Farmers’ extensive and protracted experience
    offers partial, but not complete, comprehension. The use of the Internet of Things
    in smart agriculture would help with issues like industry 4.0 agriculture using
    artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts, and IOT smart farming [18].
    It aids in issue solving, goal keeping, improvement, categorization, and disease
    prediction in agricultural systems. Intelligent controllers (fuzzy logic controllers)
    would receive reference parameters (input) such as temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture. The controller would then estimate the necessary specification
    and send it to the agricultural system. The Internet of Things is integrated into
    the agricultural system, allowing farmers to receive messages and quickly understand
    any issues. The reference settings would be modified for the farmer based on the
    need [19,20]. Fuzzy logic controller algorithms would be used to make the decision
    and carry out the action itself if the farmers were not given the proper system
    parameters. On the other hand, industrial processes can be designed by modules
    to apply specific robots to specific tasks, whereas the complex tasks of agriculture
    sometimes cannot be split into simple actions. Figure 2. Smart agriculture system.
    3.2. Mathematical Models of the Water Reservoir Tank Level, and Its Opening Valve
    As shown in Figure 3, when considering a tank that has fluid flowing in (input)
    and fluid flowing out, we define the output as depth in the tank. Now, the research
    questions could be: Figure 3. Water tank level for smart agriculture system. How
    does the depth depend upon the inflow and outflow? How does the outflow depend
    upon the depth? In order to answer the questions, it must be understood that the
    outflow will depend upon the pressure in the tank (which depends upon the depth
    and density) and a constant linked to the pipe shape [21]. 𝑓 𝑜𝑢𝑡 =𝑅ρ𝑔ℎ (1) Equation
    (1) represents the outflow models; the rate of the change of the depth will depend
    on the cross-sectional area, the difference between flow in and out. 𝑑𝑉 𝑑𝑡 =𝐴
    𝑑ℎ 𝑑𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑓 𝑜𝑢𝑡 (2) 𝐴 𝑑ℎ 𝑑𝑡 +𝑅ρ𝑔ℎ= 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 (3) Observations from inflow Equation
    (3) show that the time constant depends on the resistance (pipe opening) of the
    outlet pipe and the cross-sectional area. 𝐴 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝑑ℎ 𝑑𝑡 +ℎ= 1 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 (4) Gain
    depends on the resistance (pipe opening) of the outlet pipe: 𝑇= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨    
    𝐴 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝐾= 1 𝑅ρ𝑔 (5) It was noted that the resistance to flow is actually 1 𝑅ρ𝑔
    . If the cross-sectional area is increased, the time constant increases. If the
    resistance to flow K is increased, the time constant and steady state gain also
    increase. We ignore the impact of density and gravity. This marks the end of the
    mathematical models for inflow and outflow models. To adjust the system automatically
    and fulfill the objective, it is necessary to look at the control strategy. This
    model works with inaccurate and hazy data. This is based on degrees of truth and
    is a glaring oversimplification of the real-world issues, as it includes only
    water tanks, which are a component of an agricultural system. For the time being,
    fuzzy logic control works well because some parameters are unknown. 3.3. Fuzzy
    Logic Control Design Fuzzy logic is a mathematical method for representing vagueness
    and uncertainty in decision making. It allows for partial truths, where a statement
    can be partially true or false, rather than fully true or false. Fuzzy membership
    is a concept in fuzzy logic that assigns a degree of membership to an element
    in a set. The degree of membership is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates
    that the element is not a member of the set, and 1 indicates that the element
    is a full member of the set [15]. There are different types of membership functions
    that can be used to model fuzzy sets, as represented in Table 3. While fuzzy logic
    has many advantages, there are also some disadvantages to using it. One of the
    main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to design a fuzzy system that accurately
    models a complex system. Fuzzy systems can also be computationally expensive to
    run, especially if they involve a large number of rules or membership functions.
    Additionally, fuzzy systems can be difficult to interpret, especially if they
    involve a large number of rules or membership functions [22]. Table 3. Comparison
    of fuzzy memberships. Based on the comparison hits, a Gaussian membership function
    was selected for this work [23]. 𝐹(𝑥,σ,𝑐)= 𝑒 − (𝑥−𝑐) 2 2 σ 2 (6) Figure 4 depicts
    the conventional layout of a fuzzy logic controller. Before going into the main
    control block, the inputs which were crisp values produced by the feedback error
    and change in error were conditioned by multiplying by constant gains using a
    preprocessor. The fuzzification block matches data with criteria of rules and
    transforms input data into degrees of membership functions. The Mamdani-type inference
    engine took the rule-based commands as input, calculated the degree of capability
    of the used rules, and produced a fuzzy set for the defuzzification block, which
    took the fuzzy output data and produced crisp values. Through the use of the centroid
    defuzzification approach, the outputs of the fuzzy sets were transformed into
    crisp values [24,25]. Figure 4. Fuzzy logic controller scheme. 3.3.1. Membership
    Function Assignments The membership assignment for temperature is displayed in
    Figure 5. Temperature regulation would be based on function. Low is represented
    in black, normal is presented in red, and high is represented by blue, which have
    been assigned to the values. The Gaussian function is used to represent the function.
    While probability was represented by the vertical axis, the horizontal axis was
    expressed in degrees Celsius. Figure 5. Fuzzy membership function for temperature.
    Figure 6 shows the membership assignment for humidity. Function would be the basis
    for controlling humidity. The values have been given as low, represented in black,
    normal, presented in red, and high, represented in blue. The function is represented
    by the Gaussian function. The horizontal axis was given in mass per cubic meter,
    whilst the vertical axis denoted probability. Figure 6. Fuzzy membership function
    for humidity. The membership assignment for humidity is displayed in Figure 7.
    The foundation for regulating soil moisture would be function. Three values have
    been assigned to the values: low, which is represented in black, normal, which
    is presented in red, and high, which is represented by blue. The Gaussian function
    is used to represent the function. The vertical axis represented probability,
    and the horizontal axis was expressed in mass per cubic meter. Figure 7. Fuzzy
    membership function for soil moisture. Figure 8 shows the membership assignment
    for opening the valve. Function would be the cornerstone for controlling the valve’s
    opening. Wet is represented by blue, cold is shown in red, moderate is presented
    in black, hot is demonstrated in purple, and dry is presented in green. The function
    is represented by the Gaussian function. Probability was represented by the vertical
    axis, while degrees were shown by the horizontal axis. Figure 8. Fuzzy membership
    function for opening valve. As shown in Table 4, the fuzzy logic designs were
    determined by the language rules. Z stands for zero response, P1 shows positive
    small, which means the valve would be open slightly, N2 signifies negative large,
    which means the valve is completely closed, and P2 indicates positive large, which
    means the valve is fully opened and the water is discharging. Table 4. Rule design
    for IOT device. Figure 9a,b demonstrate how these rules base their control efforts
    on a number of if–then statements regarding (e) and (De). Specifically, if the
    error is equivalent to the values for temperature (TV), humidity (HV), and soil
    moisture, then control (c) is changed to open the valve (OV). The system was tuned
    and experiments were conducted to identify the number of these if–then statements.
    It is simple to repeat the procedure by adjusting the input numbers with the aid
    of the vertically positioned red line. It adjusts itself prudently. The yellow
    color in Figure 9a indicates the face of the input parameters, while the blue
    color in Figure 9b shows the output parameters. Figure 9. Density probability
    for rules of the fuzzy interface system. Plotting the first output variable against
    the first two input variables, the fuzzy logic rule surface provides the output
    surface for the fuzzy inference system. The midpoints of each input variable’s
    corresponding range are used as reference values for the other input variables
    in fuzzy systems with three inputs. As a result, Figure 10 shows the smoothness
    of the control signal change and offers the rule surface that corresponds to the
    rules. Figure 10 shows the fuzzy numbers with the lightness change caption and
    colors representing the least and greatest uncertainty levels. and was greatly
    impacted by the work, which offered approaches for visualizing data with uncertainty
    based on variations in saturation, brightness, and/or intensity. The hue of the
    map indicates the degree of uncertainty with respect to the lower values. The
    color-coded map illustrates the degree of uncertainty towards the higher numbers.
    Figure 10. Fuzzy logic rule surface. The aim of this controller design is to enhance
    communication between ground mobile robots, aerial vehicles (quadcopters), and
    farming fields. In order to achieve the goals of this work, this section provides
    a case study for the intelligent fuzzy logic controller and formulations of air
    properties in agricultural fields. Figure 11 shows that the components consist
    of three inputs: soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors.
    The fuzzy logic controller then receives signals from the three inputs in order
    to control the pumps and valve opening conditions. As the valve opens, input fills
    the water tank. The filled water levels are measured by water level sensors and
    flow rate sensors, which send feedback to the fuzzy logic controller. Based on
    the feedback signals, the fuzzy logic controller automatically adjusts the input
    signals and then sends them to the respective outputs. Figure 11. Block diagram
    of smart agriculture system. Figure 12 shows the working principles of the IoT
    implementation in the agriculture system. The system starts up and initializes,
    then collects data from the agricultural fields. It then prints whether the soil
    moisture (SM) is less than 27%, in which case the sprinkler turns on, or if the
    soil moisture (SM) is greater than 27%, in which case the sprinkler turns off.
    Figure 12. Schematics of the model. 3.3.2. Case Study for the Intelligent Fuzzy
    Logic Model These rules can be used to create a fuzzy logic-based system that
    can control a pump’s switching time according to user-defined variables, whereby
    sensors are the main aspect of and contributor to the system. The proposed system
    can help automate irrigation and reduce water consumption and watering time [15,16,17,18,19].
    Here are some fuzzy rules for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil acidity
    as input and output in a smart agriculture system: Temperature: ◦ If the temperature
    is low, then the output is cold; ◦ If the temperature is normal, then the output
    is moderate; ◦ If the temperature is high, then the output is hot. Humidity: ◦
    If the humidity is low, then the output is dry; ◦ If the humidity is normal, then
    the output is moderate; ◦ If the humidity is high, then the output is wet. Soil
    Moisture: ◦ If the soil moisture is low, then the output is dry; ◦ If the soil
    moisture is normal, then the output is moderate; ◦ If the soil moisture is high,
    then the output is wet. Soil Acidity: ◦ If the soil acidity is low, then the output
    is basic; ◦ If the soil acidity is normal, then the output is neutral; ◦ If the
    soil acidity is high, then the output is acidic. These rules can be used to create
    a fuzzy logic-based system that can control a pump’s switching time according
    to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the main aspect of and contributor
    to the system. The proposed system can help automate farms and reduce water consumption
    and watering time. 3.3.3. Formulation of the Air Properties in the Agricultural
    Field It was assumed that the opening of the valve, moisture in the sounding,
    pump flow rate, and water levels during the valve’s operation would be taken into
    account. However, other factors were not considered in the work. Based on this
    assumption, the following parameters would be formulated as follows [20]: Moisture
    in sounding (%)= γ𝑝 ρ − − − √ ∗100 (7) where γ is the constant ideal ratio, p
    is the pressure sound in the system, and ρ is the specific density of the air.
    Outflows(Q)= π∗D 2 ∗𝑛∗𝐻 4∗𝑔 (8) where D is the diameter of the reservoirs, n is
    the number of moles, H is the head of the water in the field. Pumps flow (rpm)=GPM
    (9) where gallons per minute (GPM) is the flow rate. Valve opening=Q proportional
    to Area×Sqrt of DP (10) where DP is the pressure drop across the valve. 4. Results
    and Discussion The purpose of this research article was to create an Internet
    of Things (IoT) weather station that also incorporated a soil moisture monitoring
    component. The device is intended to notify the user when the moisture content
    of the soil drops below a certain value. To notify the user that the moisture
    content of the soil is too low, sprinklers, which correspond to the three soil
    moisture sensors, will turn on. The initial idea was to feed all of these data
    onto a server designed to handle IoT projects and then plot the data continuously.
    From Table 5, it was understood that IoT devices (temperature sensors, ADH sensors,
    and water vapor per kg) are used as inputs for the fuzzy logic control. The outputs
    are rotations of the pumps, moisture in the sounding, water level sensors, outflow,
    and valve opening. Of these output parameters, valve opening is constant throughout
    the process, while the input parameters vary. Table 5. Simulation results of the
    IOT application in smart agriculture system. Table 6 presents the comparison between
    the previous results [2,3,4] and the current results. Table 6. Comparison of previous
    work and current work. Figure 13 demonstrates the water levels in the fields.
    The vertical axis indicated the water level in mega metric cube (Mm3), whereas
    the horizontal axis showed the time in hours. At the beginning, it slowly increases
    since the amount of water required by the field was not much. It increases slowly
    until about 9.8 h, after which it dramatically increases, indicating that the
    field requires more water. Too much water in agricultural areas can affect how
    the soil functions, hinder plant growth, and increase the risk of nutrient runoff.
    Too little water, on the other hand, can have devastating effects on crops and
    their ability to take up nutrients from the soil. Intensive groundwater pumping
    for irrigation depletes aquifers and can lead to negative environmental externalities,
    causing significant economic impact on the sector and beyond. Figure 13. Measurements
    of water level in agricultural fields. As seen in Figure 14, valve opening is
    a term used in irrigation to describe the degree to which a valve is open or closed.
    It is typically expressed as a percentage, with 0% indicating that the valve is
    completely closed and 100% indicating that the valve is completely open. The valve
    opening determines the amount of water that flows through the valve and into the
    irrigation system. By adjusting the valve opening, the controller can control
    the amount of water that is delivered to their crops. For this case, its opening
    slowly increases, because the level of the water discharge flow rate is directly
    proportional to the product area and the drop in pressure. The water level has
    a minimum of 10 m3, meaning that when the valve is opened, the water level will
    likewise gradually rise from 10 m3. Figure 14. Valve opening mechanism. As shown
    in Figure 15, in the IoT, a controller effort is a term used to describe the amount
    of torque or force that is applied to a pump and valves in order to achieve a
    desired performance. Controllers are defined by the type of control input and
    the type of output they use to drive the pump and valves. For example, a flow
    rate controller accepts flow rate commands as input and produces torque (effort)
    commands as output. Figure 15. Controller effort. Figure 16 represents the discharge
    of water in the agricultural fields. It means that flow rate discharge is the
    volume of water that flows through a pipe or channel per unit of time. In the
    agricultural sector, flow rate discharge is an important parameter for irrigation
    systems. It is used to determine the amount of water that is delivered to crops
    automatically, and to ensure that the farm system is operating properly. Figure
    16. The discharge rates. As shown in Figure 17, errors related to water level
    grow proportionately. An inaccuracy characterized as a proportional error depends
    on how much the water level variable changes. Thus, the relationship between the
    change in water level and the change in time (hours) is straightforward. Time
    (hours) divided by water level always equals the same constant, since this change
    is always of an equally quantifiable quantity. A statistic that shows how much
    a water levels sample percentage is expected to deviate from the proportion in
    the overall proportion that constitutes the standard error of a proportion. Figure
    17. Water level error. After the controller design was finished, it was implemented
    in Cisco Packet Tracer with integrated MATLAB/SIMULINK environments. Figure 18
    shows the real-time flow of data packets during the simulation. The fuzzy logic
    intelligent controller is the home gate connected to the IoT backend server. The
    IoT connection enables users to check the status of the IoT parameters such as
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture from an IoT browser homepage. The IoT
    browser homepage shows a list of the smart devices, allows visualization of their
    status, and permits remote interaction with the devices. Logical interaction between
    smart devices can be set while connected to the IoT main homepage. Interactions
    between devices are based on set conditions, such as starting a chiller when the
    temperature of a particular unit needs to be lowered or reducing oxygen supply
    to a boiler in order to reduce fire tube temperatures. The central control PC,
    manager smartphones, and tablets, which are connected to the local central office
    wireless LAN (WLAN), can connect to the dedicated IoT homepage via a browser in
    order to monitor all connected IoT devices. Cisco Packet Tracer has a feature
    with the possibility to switch from real-time to simulation mode. The first mode
    enables the possibility to create the underlying network, connect IoT devices,
    and define IoT backend logic. However, only in the simulation mode, it was possible
    to validate that the network communication layer really happened between the devices.
    In the simulation mode, it was possible to simulate packet traffic between nodes
    and devices in order to check the connectivity, routing protocols, and other network
    logic. This mode helped to physically visualize and troubleshoot any kind of network,
    for example, setting up pings or more complex packages between nodes. Figure 18.
    Real-time flow of data packet. 5. Conclusions This study aimed to incorporate
    an Internet of Things (IoT) agricultural system that monitors soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity as input parameters and automatically opens the valve as an output.
    In order to achieve these goals, a wide range of pertinent research papers were
    looked into to determine the current problems. One of the problems was the difficulty
    of having valves in agricultural fields that open automatically. Based on well-founded
    concerns, mathematical models of agricultural tanks were created. Fuzzy logic
    controllers were designed using the mathematical models that were provided. It
    was determined to create fuzzy logic controllers by utilizing the language-based
    membership function. Fuzzification of fuzzy language started next, and was followed
    by rule evaluation and defuzzification. Next, a fuzzy logic surface and fuzzy
    logic rules were created. When the fuzzy logic system was complete, it was all
    transferred to a mathematical model of a water tank to watch how the controller
    functioned. After that, Cisco Packet Tracers were used to integrate the entire
    system within the MATLAB environment. Sprinklers that correspond to the three
    soil moisture sensors activate, and the gadget notifies the user when the soil
    moisture content falls below a predetermined threshold. After being loaded onto
    a server built to handle IoT devices, the data are continually plotted. The field’s
    water requirement rises gradually for approximately 9.8 h before sharply increasing,
    suggesting that the field needs more water. In agricultural settings, an excess
    of water can disrupt soil structure, impede plant development, and raise the possibility
    of nutrient runoff. Crops and their capacity to absorb nutrients from the soil
    can suffer greatly from inadequate watering. Aquifers are depleted, and adverse
    environmental externalities may result from intensive groundwater pumping for
    agriculture, which has a substantial financial impact on the industry and beyond.
    In agriculture, “valve opening” refers to the extent to which a valve is open
    or closed. A percentage is usually used to represent it, where 0% denotes a fully
    closed valve, and 100% denotes a fully opened valve. The amount of water that
    passes through the valve and enters the agricultural system is determined by the
    valve opening. Farmers can regulate how much water is applied to their crops by
    changing the opening of the valve. The amount of torque or force supplied to a
    pump and valves to accomplish a specified performance is referred to as the controller
    effort in the Internet of Things. The kind of control input and output that a
    controller uses to operate the pump and valves characterizes the controller. For
    instance, a flow rate controller generates torque (effort) commands as an output
    after receiving flow rate commands as input. Flow rate discharge is a crucial
    agricultural system element in the agriculture industry. It is used to figure
    out how much water is automatically applied to crops and to make sure the farm
    system is running smoothly. Smart gadgets are linked to the IoT backend server
    through a house gate. Through the IoT connection, users can remotely interact
    with the devices and check their status from the homepage of an IoT browser. While
    linked into the IoT main portal, smart device interactions can be configured logically.
    Device interactions are dependent on predetermined parameters. For example, a
    chiller may be started when a certain unit needs its temperature dropped, or the
    oxygen supply to a boiler may be reduced to lower fire tube temperatures. All
    linked IoT devices may be monitored by the central control PC, management cellphones,
    and tablets by connecting them via a browser to the specific IoT site. One characteristic
    that makes integrating MATLAB/Simulink with Cisco Packet Tracer possible is the
    ability to transition between simulation and real-time mode. It is feasible to
    confirm that the network communication layer between the devices actually occurred
    in the simulation mode. To examine network logic, routing protocols, and connectivity
    between nodes and devices, a packet tracer simulation can be performed. This mode
    facilitates the physical visualization and troubleshooting of any type of network,
    including the configuration of more intricate packages or pings between nodes.
    It was discovered that the optimal outcome came from combining the Cisco Packet
    Tracer with the MATLAB environment. If agricultural temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture content were all effectively controlled, as well as if water tanks
    could open on their own, these outcomes would occur. Farmers and crops would be
    in communication at the same time. Consequently, in comparison to earlier research
    studies, the suggested intelligent control system is the most appropriate with
    IoT gadgets for the implementation of smart farm systems. Author Contributions

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration
    are detailed in Table 5. Table 4. LDR sensor accuracy. Light dependent resistor

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    (b) Light intensity; (c) Temperature; and (d) Humidity. In addition to presenting
    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    techniques. Table 6 illustrates differences across various aspects of each study,
    including objectives and developed features. While all the studies in this section
    share the goal of enhancing environmental quality in mushroom crops, each focuses
    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and
    user-feedback applications on the job. Table 6. Features comparison between the

    wind and air. The diversity extends to the forms of technology communication and
    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.
    Method Number of managed vital parameters Number of actuating tools Ability to
    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: This paper addresses the concerns in irrigation mechanisms and employs
    a Sensors and cloud-based platform to monitor and control an irrigation system.
    In order to monitor the soil's moisture level in real time, moisture sensors are
    placed in the field. These sensors wirelessly provide data to the NodeMCU, which
    processes and relays the information. The NodeMCU gathers the sensor data and
    processes it, considering standard deviations and crop-specific parameters. Using
    this information, the system starts the water pump and opens the solenoid valves
    to begin the irrigation operation. The NodeMCU coordinates with these valve-opening
    devices via wireless communication. In addition, the system uses online weather
    prediction data to provide more precise watering schedule optimisation. The system
    dynamically modifies the irrigation schedule based on analysis of weather patterns,
    evapotranspiration rates, and crop water needs to save water during times of rain
    or high humidity. The solution makes use of cloud-based platforms to improve scalability
    and accessibility. The gathered sensor data and command instructions are safely
    transferred to the cloud server. This allows farmers to remotely check on and
    adjust the irrigation system by means of the web or mobile apps. In addition,
    data analytics methods may be used to infer information and provide suggestions
    for improved methods of water management and crop care. In conclusion, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) NodeMCU smart irrigation system provides an automated and intelligent
    approach to water management in agriculture. Water is saved, crop yields are boosted,
    and sustainability is enhanced thanks to the capacity to irrigate precisely based
    on real-time soil moisture data, weather predictions, and crop needs.

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in the entity sharing
    and minimizing the workload of the human beings in various aspects. Nowadays the
    term IoT is used in various fields such as health care, automobiles, industry,
    agriculture, and so on. Agriculture is the main source of food to whole world.
    There are various problems faced by the farmers in agriculture due to shortage
    and wastage of water and fertilizers. In this regard, an optimal IoT model has
    been developed and proposed to attain an effective crop field. The proposed IoT
    model will monitor, record temperature, and soil moisture values, which will be
    continuously analyzed to achieve optimal plant growth and yield. The motor will
    be connected to the IoT model which automatically switch on/off based on optimal
    threshold temperature and soil moisture content value. A novel irrigation algorithm
    named differential waterflow algorithm has been proposed and deployed in the proposed

    (IoT) plays a vital role in the entity sharing and minimizing the workload of
    the human beings in various aspects. Nowadays the term IoT is used in various
    fields such as health care, automobiles, industry, agriculture, and so on. Agriculture
    is the main source of food to whole world. There are various problems faced by
    the farmers in agriculture due to shortage and wastage of water and fertilizers.
    In this regard, an optimal IoT model has been developed and proposed to attain
    an effective crop field. The proposed IoT model will monitor, record temperature,
    and soil moisture values, which will be continuously analyzed to achieve optimal
    plant growth and yield. The motor will be connected to the IoT model which automatically
    switch on/off based on optimal threshold temperature and soil moisture content
    value. A novel irrigation algorithm named differential waterflow algorithm has
    been proposed and deployed in the proposed IoT model for the automatic usage of
    the motor in the field. The proposed IoT model provides a web interface to the
    user through the cloud storage, so that the farmer can control and monitor the
    system in remote. The proposed system will reduce the water consumption and will
    ensure the uniform water distribution to the crops through the Poisson distribution
    which results in increasing yield. 1 INTRODUCTION Economy of any country mainly
    deals with the growth in the agriculture. For the survival the countries in the
    world utilize their three-fourth of their human resource in the occupation of
    the agriculture. But nowadays growing an agricultural field is difficult when
    compared to the ancient days.1 The major reason for the decrease in the crop yield
    is wastage and shortage of the water and fertilizers.2 Many existing systems provide
    the irrigational methodology where the scarcity of water arises in the agricultural
    field. This is because of unavailability of rain and nonstorage of water in the
    wells. Another reason is the water storage body is also placed in maximum heights
    as well as in far distance.3 Based on the survey, agriculture utilizes more than
    three-fourth of the granted water in the world. Due to the growth in population,
    the maximum usage of water for agriculture occur which in turn leads to the rising
    demand in food items. The necessity arises in the current world to face the challenges
    in the shortage and wastage of water in achieving the optimal yield in the agricultural
    crop fields. So, there is a need for the work in maximizing the yield of the agricultural
    field with any of the effective measures. The current world is fully surrounded
    by technological components and improvements in various domains. One of the major
    domains named Internet of Things (IoT) will be highly useful to face the challenges
    in the agricultural crop field. IoT is the combination of various domains such
    as embedded system, wireless sensor networks, data analytics, and cloud computing.
    By using its features, the challenges faced by the current agriculture field can
    be addressed and solutions are provided to increase the yield in the crops of
    the agriculture field. Many feasibility studies have been performed before conduting
    the experimental analysis of the particular crop environments. In any irrigation
    system of an agricultural field, the crops in the soil get the water based on
    the variety of the soil. The water capacity for the crop is also measured based
    on the variety of the soil. The existing smart irrigation system infrastructure
    is built based on the processors like advanced RISC machines and radio frequency
    (RF). The objective of the RF model is to exchange the information to the controller
    in the irrigation model. This existing system consists of three end-user components
    to interact among themselves for the purpose of irrigation of crops of the particular
    agriculture field. The traditional smart irrigation systems are useful in improving
    the procedures of irrigation technology by using the algorithms in a schematic
    way and provide the improvised structure in the required nodes for the irrigation
    model.4, 5 The mobiles phones can be integrated with the IoT components for any
    useful work. IoT connects various electrical components located at various geographical
    locations. This connection establishes the communication between these devices
    using the internet. The sensor in the device acts as input and output of the model.
    The analysis can be performed by the IoT model for the prediction results and
    evaluation. The cloud technology of the IoT model is used to store the data of
    the process in any location of the cloud which is integrated with the IoT model.
    The current state of the component can be changed dynamically at a set interval
    to modify the inputs and to attain different results for the environment. AWS
    cloud storage has been used for this experimental setup and the connections are
    made default by the AWS interface after the login procedure. The processing unit
    of the IoT model contains the interaction devices which establish the communication
    to the user. Wireless fidelity device can be used for the interaction purpose
    in the IoT model. The sensor captures the input of the environment and analyses
    the input and translates into human understandable form and sends to the user.
    The mobile phones or any electronic interfaces can be used to receive the data
    from the IoT model by the user. This IoT model can be used to solve the water
    and fertilizer shortage and wastage problem of the agricultural field. Our proposed
    system will provide an optimal solution and will develop an effective irrigation
    model based on the humidity, temperature, and soil moisture of the field. As already
    mentioned the proposed model provides optimal solution for water scarcity in the
    agricultural crop fields by observation the various parameters such as temperature
    of the environment, humidity of the environment, and soil moisture of the particular
    field using the sensors of the parameters said above. The results of the parameters
    above said are sent to the user''s interface having the allotted IP address where
    the user can view the results of the parameters. The IoT model gathers the information
    from the allocated IP address in a nonstop way for analyzing the information.
    When the resultant values of the parameters such as temperature, humidity, and
    moisture exceed the threshold values of the environment, the IoT model automatically
    controls the motor of the field. Based on the values only the motor will ON/OFF
    automatically. The values are assumed as the threshold value through the proposed
    optimal algorithm called Differential Water-flow algorithm (DWA). The threshold
    value is based on three categories best, moderate, and worst. The working of the
    DWA has been depicted in the forthcoming sections. The interface which is connected
    to the cloud provides the resultant view to the user. The interface is a noncomplex
    utilized application which includes four icons. These four icons mention the state
    of the water motor, soil moisture resultant value view, temperature of the environment,
    and humidity of the environment. The state of the motor represents the current
    state of the pump in the agriculture field. 2 LITERATURE REVIEW A major survey
    has been done on the various layers such as identifying the objectives and working
    of the traditional systems, identifying the needs of the parameters of this problem,
    and identifying the preliminary steps in the generation of the proposed systems.
    The sensors to identify the level of moisture in the soil, the degree of temperature
    of the particular environment, and the sensors which exchange the information
    to the user interface are located at the root level of the crop. The algorithm
    is said to be designed to fix the threshold value of the moisture of the soil.
    The algorithm is appended in the microcontroller to monitor and manage the water
    quantity.6 An automatic model for irrigation to sense the values of the moisture
    in the soil was proposed to develop an irrigation model which automatically works
    for the water motor. It performs the ON/OFF operation based on the wetness of
    the soil of the crop field which is identified by the automatic model for irrigation.
    The limitation in this model was, it concentrated only on the identification of
    moisture level in the soil and transmitted to the user through any sensing devices.7
    The identified information about the parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    and moisture in the soil were transmitted to the famer of that particular agricultural
    field through SMS. Here for doing this operation the model utilizes wireless sensor
    network and observes the green environment of the agricultural field from the
    far away distance.8 For the purpose of plantation in an agricultural crop field
    remote irrigation depending upon the Arduino was proposed to generate the required
    water level by identifying the humidity of the environment from the remote. Here
    the humidity value is set to a point value, if the humidity value goes beyond
    the limit, then the irrigation system automatically provides water for the crops
    in that particular agricultural field.9 This model did not concentrate on the
    moisture present in the soil and temperature of the environment. It is also important
    to consider the power consumption for the motor usage of an agricultural crop
    field. One of the existing systems focused on the usage of power and water by
    developing a control system using GSM and Android. This existing system controls
    and manages the power and water of the particular environment.10 The optimal utilization
    of hardware was also important at that time due to minimization of the infrastructure
    in size. One of the existing system used low memory-utilizing microcontroller
    for controlling and managing the crops in the agricultural field.11 The traditional
    wireless drip irrigation automation was proposed to identify the moisture in the
    soil by using the sensors. Here also the model did not concentrate on the identification
    of temperature and humidity of the environment which helps in the yield of crops
    in the agricultural field.12 The latest microprocessor was used to improve the
    technologies used in the agriculture by updating the procedures in the working
    of the devices used in that environment. It also tried to provide better infrastructure
    by choosing the needed hardware in the building of its structure to establish
    the automation in irrigation.13 The data are stored in the database which is connected
    serially to a personal computer''s receiver board for the further purpose. The
    performance of the database has been improved by the usage of the neural network
    approach in its working procedure.14 The irrigation is done only in the places
    where the soil moisture value goes beyond the threshold value and other places
    of the crop field are not considered.15, 16 A novel resource clustering algorithm
    was proposed to enhance the effectiveness in the wireless personal environment.
    This particular work gave an idea of ways of approaching the personal network.17
    The agricultural growth depending on IoT will provide the highest priority to
    enhance the crop yield and for the improvement in the quality of yielded crops
    of the particular agricultural environment.18-20 An efficient performance evaluation
    model based on continuous Markov chain and Poisson process was proposed to show
    how the performance of the irrigation model can be evaluated.21 Many technologies
    had been deployed based on the convergence technology for the future agriculture
    which identifies the demand and supply of the crops early. It also manages the
    quality of the crop and current conditions for the crop growing which changes
    dynamically at certain time period.22 The relational analysis has been done by
    using the technology called text mining to ensure the analyses in correlations
    of the text based on agriculture, resident situations, inclusion, and removal
    of crops. This type of relational analysis is the initial step to be done for
    a technology to adopt the agriculture production system.23 The agricultural production
    model which depends upon IoT includes three components such as service offered
    by IoT, prediction based on statistics, and analysis done based on the relations.24
    Combining statistical models using modified spectral subtraction method for embedded
    system was proposed to produce an effective IoT environment related to agriculture
    in the future.25 These are the literatures undergone for the above-mentioned agricultural
    problem. Many of the existing systems considered anyone of the parameters, temperature,
    soil moisture, and humidity. The proposed IoT model will concentrate on all these
    three parameters for the efficient growth of the crops in the agricultural field.
    In addition to that the proposed model introduced a novel algorithm called DWA
    which automatically switch ON/OF the motor based on the set threshold value. The
    experimental results of the proposed system have been compared and evaluated with
    many of the above-said existing systems. In maximum cases the proposed algorithm
    performs well and produces the optimal growth for the crops in the agricultural
    field. 3 PROPOSED IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING IoT In the proposed IoT irrigation system
    many inexpensive sensors are used to monitor the temperature, humidity, and moisture
    in the soil of the environment. The proposed model observes the agricultural crop
    field 24/7 and transfers the details to the interface deployed using the cloud
    computing. The input information sensed by the sensor are managed in the cloud
    database. The procedure of the IoT model verifies and analyzes the received information
    with the set threshold value of the parameters such as humidity, moisture, and
    temperature of the environment. Based on these results the motor automation is
    performed by the procedure of the novel algorithm named Differential Workflow
    Algorithm (DFA) which is described through the pseudocode mentioned below. The
    conditions for the motor switch ON/OFF mentioned in the pseudocode of the proposed
    DFA. The structure of the proposed model is depicted by using the sections such
    as information investment, microcontroller component, section for transmission
    of wireless data, sections for storing the data in the database, processing the
    information and model of irrigation automation. The overall scenario of our work
    is shown in the Figure 1. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow diagram
    of the proposed working environment The flow diagram of the proposed working environment
    comprises three sections such as challenges in agriculture, solutions by the proposed
    system and benefits to the society. These three sections are dominated by the
    major objective “Innovations in Agriculture through IoT”. The first sections depict
    some of the major challenges in the agriculture such as wastage of fertilizer,
    shortage of water, difficulties in managing the costs, and difficulties in facing
    the increase in the needs. The section two deals with our initiatives to address
    the challenges in agriculture and gave solutions through the design of proposed
    systems. The proposed system is deployed using the latest technology IoT. This
    model identifies the level of moisture in the soil, temperature and humidity in
    the environment. By knowing these values, the proposed model switches the motor
    ON/OFF automatically. That is why the proposed model is mentioned as automated
    irrigation system. Section 3 concludes the flow diagram of the proposed working
    environment with the social benefits. The proposed system provided an optimal
    solution for growing the crops in the agricultural field. It increases the crop
    growth, enriches the economy of the society through optimal agricultural, optimal
    usage of water and fertilizer, and encourages the farmers in the cultivating the
    crops. 3.1 Pseudocode of the proposed DWA Input: Temperature value, Humidity Value,

    moisture The microcontroller belonging to Arduino is connected with the sensor
    and the procedures of the DFA are coded into the board for the operation. After
    the code deployed a cylinder structure material has been built to place the IoT
    model in it and located in the crop field. The sensor used to sense the moisture
    present in soil contains two electrodes and they are placed dipped in the soil.
    The electrodes are used to transfer electricity in to the soil. The soil which
    contains low level of moisture will pass more electricity in the soil and the
    soil which contains high level of moisture will transfer less electricity through
    in the soil. This will help in identifying the level of moisture in the soil.
    The objective function for humidity and soil moisture given is 3.3 Working of
    IoT Model in identification of level of humidity and temperature The next phase
    is to identify the humidity and temperature of the environment of the agricultural
    crop field. Humidity is defined as quantity of vapor of water in the atmosphere.
    The identification of comparative humidity is done based on the temperature change
    in the environment. The comparative humidity changes when there is a change in
    the environment''s temperature. The changes of the temperature and humidity of
    the environment occurs in both the cases as before irrigating the field and after
    irrigating the field. The quantity of water vapor level in the atmosphere is maximized
    after the completion of irrigation. Because of this particular scenario, temperature
    is minimized, at the same time the level of humidity is maximized in the environment
    of the agricultural crop field. The continuous notification is sent to the cloud
    interface where the farmer of that particular agricultural crop fields will have
    the knowledge of their environments from anywhere in the world. 3.4 Working of
    IoT model in identification of illumination power of the environment To identify
    the power of luminosity or illumination the luminosity sensor is used in the environment.
    Illumination strength plays a vital role in the growth of the agricultural crops
    and does the photosynthesis for that particular environment. Luminosity-based
    resistor has been utilized for the operation of the identification of illumination
    power of the environment. Here, when the flow of current is minimized indicates
    the maximum power of luminosity occurs in that particular agricultural crop field
    environment. The luminous power may change periodically at that time to identify
    the resistance the component called Ampere segregation switch is used. The level
    of ampere maximizes the power of luminosity when the ampere level is maximized.
    3.5 Procedure for information transmission using the wireless medium The information
    acquired from the sensors are transferred to the database server deployed in the
    cloud data center using the wireless medium. The wireless medium used here is
    MQE5K13. This particular medium is used for transmission of information between
    the agricultural crop field and the database server deployed in the cloud. 3.6GHZ
    transmitter and receiver have been used for this purpose. The microcontroller
    which is the heart of the proposed IoT model is connected to this transmitter
    and receiver to exchange the information. As the agricultural crop field acts
    as one of the end and named as back end and the web interface deployed using cloud
    acts as another end named as front end. The transmitter placed in the back end
    and the receiver is placed in the front end of the proposed model. Unique tokens
    are given to all the transmitter and receiver present in the proposed IoT model
    which is deployed in the agricultural crop fields. The source transmitter will
    have the knowledge of destination receiver''s token to pass the information to
    the particular receiver, because without knowing the receiver''s token the transmitter
    cannot pass the information to the receiver. As already said the receiver is tied
    with the interface of the farmer who can monitor and view the values of the temperature,
    humidity, and moisture level of the soil of the particular environment. The farmer
    as a user can access the interface at anytime and anywhere because the interface
    is deployed in cloud. 3.6 Information processing and concluding the values The
    information obtained from the agricultural crop field are transferred by the wireless
    medium MQE5K13 and loaded in the server present in the cloud datacenter with the
    help of connection-oriented network protocols. At regular intervals the IoT model
    receives the information and loads in the cloud database. The objective of information
    processing is to identify the information received from different sensors of the
    agricultural crop field and compares the information with the set threshold values.
    The set threshold value depends upon the variety of plants. Due to this the set
    threshold value will differ among the plants. Based on the working procedure of
    the DFA the motor will automatically switch ON/OFF according to the sensor values
    produced by the IoT model. 3.7 Smart irrigation model using proposed IoT approach
    The working of the proposed IoT approach start its operation of automation when
    it receives the information from the interface deployed on the cloud datacenter.
    The actuator sensors are used to transfer the managing messages from the interface
    to the input ports present in the physical layer of the IoT model. The actuator
    sensor works as a switch which is operated using the current. The mother board
    which has minimum load inputs is managed by using the actuator sensor. When the
    outside current is appended or flow on the corners of the actuator sensor then
    it enables ON/OFF of the motherboard depends upon the input value. To observe
    and identify the level of water in the well a special type of water sensor is
    used named OE5L928A. 3.8 Deployment of IoT in the proposed smart irrigation model
    The latest technology IoT has been deployed in the proposed model, where the IoT
    is major cause of dynamic technological behavior in today''s world. The main objective
    of the utilization of IoT in the proposed system is to exchange the information
    between the farmer and the proposed model. The data related to the soil is passed
    to the user interface deployed in cloud through many sensors which senses the
    soil parameters. Then the values of parameter such as level of moisture in the
    soil, temperature, and humidity are passed to the user interface in which the
    farmers can view and observe the information. All the information related to the
    crop is analyzed and sent to the user interface. As per the procedure of the proposed
    DWA, when the level of moisture of the soil is decreased, temperature and humidity
    of the environment increase and then the water will be spread to the field through
    the smart automated proposed IoT model which operates the switch ONN/OFF automatically
    based on the condition. When all the parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity satisfies the set threshold value then the motor switches OFF automatically
    based on the condition of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm DWA describes
    the water spreading to the field for all the cases which is depicted in the pseudocode
    of the DWA. 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The proposed IoT model results are evaluated
    in a real crop agricultural field. The results are evaluated for the parameters
    moisture of the soil, humidity cum luminous power and temperature of the environment.
    The threshold limit is categorized into two ways such as upper control limit and
    lower control limit. Upper control limit represents the best category of threshold
    value limit and lower control limit represents the worst category of threshold
    value limit. The evaluation for these limits is shown by using the sigma calculation
    in the Figure 2. Some of the heterogeneous resources of both wired and wireless
    devices are used for this current research work. The simulation tool used for
    this research is AWS IoT model and a real IoT test bed environment fixed on the
    crop field. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Set threshold upper and
    lower limit The set threshold upper control limit and lower control limit is shown
    accurately using the proposed IoT model interface deployed in the cloud. This
    is shown in the Figure 3. As per this chart the temperature, humidity cum luminous
    power and moisture level of the soil is calculated. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Accurate view of the set threshold limit by proposed Internet of Things
    model Based on the threshold set value the luminous power of the environment in
    the agricultural crop field is calculated and shown in Figure 4. The luminous
    power is calculated in four categories as dark, dim, light, and bright. FIGURE

    5 shows the level of moisture in the soil of the particular environment based
    on the threshold value. The motor will start work automatically by using the procedure
    of the proposed algorithm DFA deployed in the proposed IoT model. Two graphs have
    been shown in Figure 5 soil moisture measurement based on threshold value. The
    first graph depicts the overall measurement of the level of moisture in the soil
    for the particular environment and second graph shows the deeper level of moisture
    present in the soil for the particular agricultural crop field. FIGURE 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture measurement based on threshold value
    After the calculation of level of soil moisture in the agricultural crop field,
    the temperature of the environment is calculated on three categories as temperature
    in minus degrees or cold temperature environment, hot temperature environment,
    and moderate or flexible temperature environment. The calculated minus degree
    temperature is shown in Figure 6. Figures 6-10 contain two graphs, one graph is
    for overall calculation and another one is for accurate calculation. FIGURE 6

    Comparison of existing and proposed algorithms Based on the above calculation
    of humidity cum luminous power, soil moisture calculation, and temperature of
    the agricultural field the motor embedded using the proposed the IoT model automatically
    switches ON/OFF as per the procedure of the proposed DFA as shown in Figure 11.
    The proposed workflow algorithm produces 70% accuracy compared to that of existing
    approaches such as RTR and VTU approaches. The comparison graph is shown to justify
    the performance of the proposed system as shown in Figure 12. 5 CONCLUSION Agriculture
    plays a vital role in the growth of economy of any developing countries. Various
    crops what we had in the ancient days are not present now due to various issues
    in the current world. Agriculture faces various problems many due to the shortage
    and wastage of water. By keeping in this mind, our research work concentrated
    to address these problems and tried to provide solution. The paper proposed an
    IoT model containing a proposed algorithm called DFA. Our proposed IoT model calculates
    the parameters such as temperature, humidity, and level of moisture in the soil
    in most effective by using the set threshold value. The calculated value is given
    as input to the IoT model and the motor embedded with the IoT model switches ON/OFF
    based on the procedure of the algorithm mentioned above. The proposed approach
    DFA is compared with the some of the existing systems and their results are evaluated
    based on the threshold value. The proposed DFA performs well and produces the
    optimal solution to yield better crop percentage comparing to existing approaches.
    Further it is planned to propose an algorithm for the parameter value calculation
    by restricting the sensor and human interface by using the machine learning approach.

  description: This study assessed the effects of rainfall on soil physico-chemical
    properties (pH, moisture, temperature, Nitrogen value, Phosphorus value and Potassium
    value) of MD2 pineapple cultivation on marginal soil, and also investigated correlation
    between rainfall and soil physico-chemical properties based on IoT-based monitoring.
    Agromon Smart Agriculture and NPK Sensors (Agromon) that is equipped with a Sigfox-based
    wireless transmitter was used to provide real-time marginal soil properties data
    from an experimental MD2 pineapple field plot in UiTM Sarawak. Rainfall data between
    March and July 2021 for Samarahan Rainfall Station were obtained from Department
    of Irrigation and Drainage, Sarawak (DID). Soil properties data were transmitted
    from field plot gateway to the nearest Sigfox base station in Santubong, and subsequently
    to SATU dashboard server in order to be accessible to all users. Agromon demonstrated
    the capability of IoT system in monitoring selected soil properties across favored
    and unfavored weather conditions. Pineapple farmers can make timely and cost-effective
    farm operation decision anywhere to optimize plant vigor and therefore, improve
    yield.

  explanation: 'This paper focuses on developing a wireless sensor network (WSN) for
    precision irrigation in agriculture. The WSN is designed to collect real-time
    data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant health, which is then
    used to optimize irrigation schedules and improve water use efficiency. The key
    objectives of the study are to: (1) develop a cost-effective and energy-efficient
    WSN for precision irrigation, (2) design and implement algorithms for real-time
    data collection and processing, (3) develop a decision support system for irrigation
    scheduling, and (4) evaluate the performance of the proposed system in a real-world
    agricultural setting.'

    equipped with a set of sensors for measuring soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and plant health. The sensor nodes are deployed throughout the field, and they
    communicate with each other and with a central gateway using a wireless protocol
    such as ZigBee or LoRa."'

    In recent years, IoT sensors have enabled smart agriculture to grow rapidly with
    many compelling real-world applications. One such application is the case of smart
    irrigation. A particular interest exists in forecasting soil water potential to
    allow for the establishment of more efficient irrigation systems. Nonetheless,
    forecasting soil moisture is a complex task and depends on various information
    sources. Most existing work relies on local approaches, which are less effective
    at leveraging shared information across different data sources. Therefore, this
    paper presents a robust global approach for soil water potential forecasting,
    combining various environmental factors through the cutting-edge Temporal Fusion
    Transformer. Our proposed approach outperforms established baselines for forecasting
    soil water potential. As such, this work contributes to the growing body of research

    irrigationSoil water potentialSensor data 1. Introduction In many domains, anticipating
    the future path of a time-series is of key importance. Smart agriculture is one
    such domain where forecasting holds a significant role, as demonstrated in [1].
    Smart agriculture contains a panoply of compelling predictive use-cases, including
    but not limited to, crop yield prediction [2] and automated crop disease detection
    [3]. A comprehensive overview of such applications can be found in [1]. Smart
    irrigation – a subfield of smart agriculture – has gained a specific interest
    in recent years due to its direct relationship with water scarcity [4]. To this
    end, soil moisture sensors have proven useful in facilitating smart irrigation
    systems by providing real-time insights [5]. Besides real-time monitoring, there
    is also a critical need for accurate soil moisture forecasting — especially over
    a multi-day horizon [6]. Accurate soil moisture forecasting can help farmers with
    smart irrigation scheduling and other precision agricultural decisions such as
    smart fertilization [7]. However, forecasting soil moisture is non-trivial due
    to complex non-linear temporal dynamics of both endogenous and exogenous nature
    [8]. Moreover, gaining insight from a wide variety of data sources in agriculture
    remains an open challenge [4]. Until recently, there was a heavy emphasis on time-series
    forecasting techniques that focus on isolated time-series — so called local forecasting
    methods [9], [10]. However, we argue that in a complex agricultural setting, such
    models would perform poorly since they do not exploit external information from
    e.g. other (IoT) sensors. As such, forecasting soil moisture requires models that
    can capture these complex non-linear relationships through data fusion. To this
    end, we suggest the use of the state-of-the-art Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
    [11] as a global forecasting model for efficient integration of various data sources
    in smart agriculture. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) To the best of our knowledge,
    we are the first to apply the state-of-the-art TFT – a transformer-based architecture
    – to multi-day sensor forecasting in the context of smart agriculture. (ii) We
    present a detailed comparison between global and local forecasting approaches,
    enriching the ongoing discussion on global vs. local forecasting. (iii) We overcome
    the significant data integration challenges associated with forecasting soil moisture
    sensors due to its dependency on a wide array of data sources stemming from various
    environmental conditions across fields. The remainder of this paper is structured
    as follows: in Section 2, we review related work. Section 3 through Section 5
    discuss, respectively, the specific setting along with a formal problem description
    and the methods used. Details on training and evaluation are covered in Section
    6. The results are presented and discussed in Section 7. Finally, the conclusion
    and future directions are presented in Section 8. 2. Related work A benefit of
    the rise of (IoT) sensors in smart agriculture, is the high volume of data captured
    by those sensors. This high volume creates leeway for more advanced data analysis
    techniques such as deep learning [12]. Since soil moisture sensors typically generate
    temporal data with non-obvious patterns, multiple studies investigated the use
    of advanced analytics techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. For example,
    in [13] multiple LSTMs were trained – one per site – for one-day-ahead prediction.
    The learned models were shown to generalize by testing them on independent fields,
    though with similar soil characteristics as the train data. Notably, the naive
    model yields strong performance for one-day-ahead predictions — though their discussion
    on this is limited. This may indicate a high correlation between current and next-day
    measurements. While one-day-ahead forecasts serve as a valuable proof-of-concept,
    the greater challenge lies in the realm of multi-day forecasting [6]. Other works,
    such as [14], include future open-source information from e.g. weather forecasting
    services to obtain better multi-horizon predictions for soil moisture and show
    promising results, though only for a single plot. The authors of [10] used a bidirectional
    LSTM for forecasting soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity. They used
    5 nodes ( plots), all located in one orchard. A forecasting horizon of 14 days
    was used, and the model was trained separately for each plot (i.e. a local approach).
    They point out that it could be valuable to include static variables such as soil
    properties and that training could be more efficient by utilizing knowledge obtained
    from the other fields (e.g. a global approach). However, the small dataset size
    for each node raises concerns about overfitting. Additionally, the use of a bidirectional
    LSTM may be impractical when not all variables are known 14 days in advance, as
    is often the case in real-world settings. The authors of [15] used a novel attention-aware
    LSTM model for predicting soil moisture and soil temperature on a one- and seven-day
    forecasting horizon. Their attention mechanism allowed for an interpretable network
    permitting expert validation of the learned model. It is worth noting that – while
    they obtained data from multiple sites – they trained a separate LSTM model per
    site, essentially treating the LSTM as a local model. While the size of their
    data permits the use of LSTMs as a local model, recent work [9] has shown that
    neural networks can indeed be used as local models given sufficient data, but
    produce superior results when used as a global model. As such, we identify several
    key challenges. For instance, local modeling approaches restrict the ability to
    integrate information across various fields or plots. This becomes problematic
    in scenarios with limited local data causing risks of overfitting or restricting
    model choice — as is the case for our dataset. This limitation is a significant
    driver for our work, as we advocate for a more efficient global modeling technique
    that can harness insights from multiple sources — even when those sources have
    only limited data available on a local level. Another important consideration
    is the challenge of multi-day soil moisture forecasting. This limitation has practical
    implications for agricultural planning and highlight the need for advanced techniques
    capable of addressing longer-term forecasting. Additionally, while there is recognition
    of the potential value of incorporating static properties and future information,
    the adoption of these factors remains limited in existing approaches. To this
    end, recent advances in deep learning permit to build global models that can address
    these challenges through the use of TFTs [11]. TFTs can include both static and
    future information along the historic endo- or exogenous measurements. This work
    presents a global soil moisture fusion transformer, applied on a challenging multi-source
    agricultural dataset. 3. Application We demonstrate the benefit of global data
    fusion over local data fusion on a challenging dataset generated by Watermark
    soil moisture sensors (Irrometer Company, Inc., USA), retrieved from [16]. These
    sensors (i.e. our targets) were located on three different pear orchards in Belgium
    and were operational from 2007–2009, measuring the soil water potential ( in kPa)
    every four hours during the months June-August. This yields a time-series of approximately
    three months for each sensor per year. Due to this discontinuity in time, we consider
    a sensor to produce a separate time-series for each year rather than one time-series
    over all three years. Given the low intra-day variability of the sensors, it was
    deemed appropriate to calculate the daily average for , in accordance with the
    daily frequency at which all other variables, such as rainfall and reference evapotranspiration,
    were measured to obtain a common frequency. This yields a multivariate time-series
    with an average length of 80 (e.g. 80 -measurements for each sensor for a given
    year). The value of the target, , is negative, expressed in pressure units (kPa)
    which indicates how strongly the water is held in the soil pores by capillary
    and adhesive forces in a soil that is not saturated. Basically, the drier the
    soil, the stronger these forces are, the more negative the soil water potential
    is, and the more difficult it is for plant roots to extract that water. Furthermore,
    each field was divided into several plots which each contained six sensors at
    different depth levels: three sensors at a depth of 30 cm, two at a depth of 60
    cm, and one at a depth of 90 cm. These sensors recorded soil moisture levels at
    different depths, providing a comprehensive picture of the . Other temporal variables
    measured at plot-level are irrigation-amount and plot-specific treatments (e.g.
    root pruning). These variables capture the effects of irrigation and other treatments
    on soil moisture levels. At field level, precipitation and reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) were – respectively – recorded and calculated over time. These variables
    provide information about the overall water availability and demand in the field.
    All of these variables have a proven relationship to the target, [16]. A full
    overview of all variables and their characteristics is presented in Table 1. The
    collection and integration of these heterogeneous information sources posed several
    challenges. Missing values typically only occurred at the beginning of a time-series
    since some sensors were deployed earlier than others. Selecting a common measurement
    period solved this discrepancy. Remaining missing values, although limited, were
    imputed using forward filling. Lastly, some -sensors were entirely removed from
    the analysis due to concerns regarding data quality. During certain periods, the
    readings from these sensors exceeded their measurement range, rendering them unable
    to provide data for those time frames. Furthermore, the trustworthiness of these
    sensors could not be guaranteed as it is unclear whether they would remain reliable
    once they returned to their normal measurement ranges. Despite these challenges,
    the final dataset consisted of approximately 560 unique time-series or 220 sensors
    per year1 (70 per orchard), totaling 50k data-points. Fig. 1 depicts the distribution
    of ten randomly selected -sensors from one of the pear orchards for a given year.
    Observe how both the mean and variance vary widely between sensors. This suggests
    that a model trained on one sensor (i.e. a local approach), might not generalize
    well to other sensors. Furthermore, the top row in Fig. 1 shows the -values for
    the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test. The -values are obtained through regression
    surface approximation from MacKinnon [17], using the updated 2010 tables [18].
    The ADF test indicates that many of the randomly selected sensors show random
    walk patterns, suggesting the use of e.g. methods that allow for inclusion of
    exogenous information. Table 1. Overview of variables included in each model with

    description Formally, we consider a time-series problem with inputs containing
    multivariate time-series along with potential metadata, where the goal is to learn
    a function that accurately forecasts the output . Let be a dataset of observations,
    where is a multivariate time-series input with time-steps and features, and represents
    static metadata with features. is the output with forecast-horizon . Our goal
    is to learn a function that maps the inputs and to the output . That is, we seek
    to find the parameters of the function that minimize the following objective function
    — Eq. (1) [19]: (1) where is a task-specific loss function. 5. Methodology Forecasting
    natural phenomena such as soil moisture requires a model that can exploit exogenous
    information while simultaneously exploiting a potentially non-linear relationship
    with lagged values of the target (see [20], [21] for a similarly complex task
    in evapotranspiration prediction). To this end, we distinguish between global
    and local forecasting methods. 5.1. Local methods In short, given many time-series
    (or sensors in our case), a local method would independently estimate model parameters
    for each individual time-series (or sensor) with its corresponding local input
    variables [9]. Since each time-series measures on average 80 data-points (see
    Section 3), the local method should be limited in terms of parameters to be estimated
    in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality. A visual overview is provided in
    Fig. 2(a). Naive model. As a baseline, a naive model is introduced which simply
    uses the last known value as the multi-horizon forecast. That is, a constant line.
    Including a naive baseline permits to investigate whether the more advanced forecasting
    methods actually obtain any skill (see e.g. [22] for a similar approach). Download

    2(a) shows a local approach where each (in this case) plot gets assigned its own
    model while 2(b) shows a global approach with one model for all plots. Vector
    AutoRegressive model. Next, a state-of-the-art flexible local method is considered
    which can exploit exo- and endogenous relationships present in the data. To this
    end, a Vector AutoRegressive model is used as a strong local method [23], [24].
    A Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model is a linear multiple-equation model that allows
    to model and forecast multivariate time-series. Section 3 described the multivariate
    nature of the problem. Moreover, it is known [25] that some input variables are
    influenced by (i.e. the target) raising issues of endogeneity, especially in multi-horizon
    forecasts. As such, to jointly model such dynamic interdependencies the Vector
    AutoRegressive (VAR) model is a feasible local method with proven theoretical
    properties and parsimonious parameterization, leading to a small model for the
    small local dataset. For full details we refer to the original paper [23] of VAR
    models. Note that VAR models can only include numerical historic variables. To
    this end, the final VAR model in concise matrix notation [24] is shown in Eq.
    (2): (2) with a -matrix for variables with forecasting horizon . a coefficient
    matrix with the size of the look-back window (or lag-length), a -matrix containing
    the lagged variables, and the error matrix. The actual variables included in the
    VAR model are indicated in Table 1. Observe how the number of variables , the
    size of the look-back window , and the forecasting horizon entirely govern the
    complexity of the model in terms of parameters. Therefore, since we need to include
    multiple exogenous time-series and are interested in a multi-horizon forecast,
    the look-back window will need to be properly tuned to avoid overfitting. Lastly,
    since VAR models assume stationarity, some variables (e.g. the target variable
    soil water potential — see Fig. 1) need to be transformed to obtain stationarity
    using e.g. differencing. 5.2. Global methods For global methods, the entire set
    of sensors and their corresponding predictors are considered at once, giving rise
    to a larger dataset (see Section 3). Global methods estimate the parameters jointly
    from all available time-series (or sensors). To this end, neural networks have
    shown to be particularly promising as global forecasters since they thrive in
    large data contexts [9]. In fact, given enough data, global forecasting methods
    such as neural networks can inherently model more complex non-linear structures
    in the data compared to local methods that are restricted in terms of complexity
    since their access is limited to local data only. A visual overview is provided
    in Fig. 2(b). LSTM. First, an LSTM network [26] is considered. LSTMs are widely
    considered to be a solid baseline in forecasting (multivariate) time-series data
    (see e.g. [22]). An LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable
    of learning long-term temporal dependencies in sequence data. A key component
    of the LSTM are so-called memory gates that mitigate the problem – typical for
    traditional RNNs – of exploding/vanishing gradients. Temporal fusion transformer.
    The TFT [11] is a state-of-the-art model for time-series forecasting. It stands
    out compared to e.g. LSTMs thanks to its ability to include static (i.e. time-invariant)
    variables and its efficient architecture. In an agricultural context this permits
    to condition on field-specific time-invariant variables which ultimately allows
    for efficient data fusion across different static properties. TFTs rely on a sophisticated
    transformer-based [27] architecture allowing them to model complex interactions
    between the different temporal (future or historic) and static inputs while preserving
    interpretability. The use of a quantile-based objective function, enables the
    TFTs to output -quantiles instead of point forecasts. The full architecture is
    shown in Fig. 3. We discuss the main components from the bottom-up (for a full
    overview we refer to the original TFT paper in [11]): Download : Download high-res
    image (618KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The full TFT architecture
    obtained from [11]. The left (in brown) shows the static variables encoder, followed
    by the past inputs encoder (in blue) and the known future inputs decoder (in dark
    red). Observe the variable selection units for all inputs. Multiple gates are
    present with skip-connections making the network efficient. The multi-head attention
    block permits for efficient information fusion. Parts with the same colors indicate
    weight-sharing. 1. Variable selection network: The network is trained on global
    data with different variable types: static (i.e. time-invariant), historic (i.e.
    exo- or endogenous time-series), and known (i.e. a priori known future inputs,
    e.g. day of week). By implementing a variable selection module, the model itself
    can select important and ignore irrelevant variables at different time-steps.
    2. Static variable encoders: In an agricultural context, e.g. soil characteristics
    can have a big impact on soil moisture dynamics [10]. Hence, mapping static variables,
    such as soil type, to a higher-dimensional embedding space can help the model
    to condition the temporal embeddings on such static properties allowing for conditional
    information fusion. 3. LSTM encoders: LSTMs [26] are incorporated for local processing
    of the time-series. Here, a sequence-to-sequence structure is employed for the
    LSTM-layer to learn fixed-length temporal embeddings as input for the attention
    heads. 4. Gating mechanisms: Throughout the network, multiple gating mechanisms
    with skip-connections (and normalization) are put in place. As such, the network
    itself can regulate its complexity and learn more efficiently if possible, even
    when limited data is available. 5. Temporal multi-head attention: A key component
    of the TFT is the multi-head self-attention block [27] which enables the network
    to attend to the most relevant dependencies present in the network. Thanks to
    a grouping operation (i.e. averaging) over the multi-head attention mechanism
    in the TFT, efficient information fusion takes place. Moreover, investigating
    the final grouped attention vectors can help with interpreting to which time-steps
    the TFT pays attention. 6. Quantile Forecasts: The final dense layer directly
    outputs a quantile forecast for the given prediction horizon. This results in
    a distribution forecast rather than a point forecast, providing a notion of uncertainty.
    6. Training and evaluation For a given time-step , we want to predict steps ahead
    (here, ), using a window of past observations with size . These past observations
    can include exogenous time-series as well as the target itself . For the TFT specifically,
    known future observations (numerical or categorical) can also be included . Finally,
    static information can also be included in the TFT. A full overview of the included
    variables and their type for each model is provided in Table 1. Next, the data
    is split into a train ( k - 92%), validation ( - 4%), and a test set ( - 4%).
    To respect the temporal nature and prevent data leakage, the validation set is
    represented by the penultimate forecasting window for the years 2008, 2009 — i.e.
    with . The test set is comprised of the last forecasting window of each sensor
    for 2008, 2009 — i.e. with . A graphical overview is presented in Fig. 4. Note
    that every time-series of 2007 is left entirely for training only. This allows
    the model to observe at least one entire growing season during training. To evaluate
    the performance of the local and global model, the mean absolute error (MAE) Eq.
    (3), the root mean squared error (RMSE) Eq. (4), and the mean directional accuracy
    (MDA) Eq. (5) are computed for each time-series [28], [29] as follows: (3) (4)
    (5) where represents the measurement of a given sensor at time and the length
    of the forecasting horizon. is the forecast by the model. These metrics, respectively,
    give insight in general performance, large errors, and directional skill of the
    model. Note that for the local models, by definition, the forecast for each time-series
    implies a different model. As such, for time-series, VAR-models would be created.
    Hence, for local models, the final MAE, RMSE, and MDA are aggregated across all
    local models to obtain global metrics. This ultimately allows for a fair comparison
    between the local and global models. For the MAE and RMSE the median is calculated
    across forecasts, and for MDA the mean. This permits to perform statistical tests
    to compare the performance across models. As such, the MAE and RMSE are compared
    across models with a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the MDA is compared
    using a -test. A Bonferroni correction [30] is applied to account for multiple
    testing. Lastly, following [11], the normalized quantile loss across the forecast-horizon
    is also considered, through -Risk (see Eq. (6)): (6) with the domain of the given
    dataset and (see Eq. (7)) the quantile loss [11]: (7) Here, represents the quantile
    of interest and . Note, when , then Eq. (7) MAE. Furthermore, -Risk is a global
    metric by definition and is not calculated for each time-series separately. As
    such, no statistical tests are performed for the -Risk. Download : Download high-res

    of a certain sensor for a given year for a given orchard. Note that each year
    for a given sensor per orchard is considered as a unique time-series as described
    in Section 3. 6.1. Training - Naive model The naive model simply forward-propagates
    the last known value for each sensor per year across the horizon . Hence, no actual
    training is done for this model. 6.2. Training - VAR model Since the VAR model
    is a local method, training is done on local time-series data only. That is, one
    model is trained per sensor, per year, taking into account exogenous information
    from that time-period. We refer to Table 1 for a full overview of the included
    exogenous information per sensor, per year. The main interest is in comparing
    predictive performance of the local and global methods on the unseen test data.
    As such, since 2007 is kept as a train set for the TFT (see Fig. 4), it is omitted
    for the local method estimation as it does not contain a test set. This preserves
    the fairness in comparing both methods. Given the non-stationarity of the target
    (see Section 3), first-order differencing is applied such that the target becomes
    . The target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation. This is done
    to obtain stationarity which is a requirement for VAR models. Other exogenous
    temporal variables that were non-stationary were also transformed through first-order
    differencing. The lag is a key hyperparameter that governs the model complexity.
    As such, the optimal lag (limited to a maximum of four to prevent overfitting)
    is determined using the Akaike Information Criterion [31] on both the train and
    validation set for a given sensor. A constant is added to allow for a time-series
    with a non-zero intercept. Lastly, each VAR-model with optimal lag is then refitted
    on the local train and validation set after which the final results are obtained
    on the local test set. 6.3. Training - LSTM The LSTM is trained on the train data
    shown in Fig. 4. Hyperparameters were selected using the validation data with
    a full grid search — see A.1. The data is normalized — a requirement for any neural
    network. While first-order differencing of the target (as done in Section 6.2)
    is not a necessity for neural networks, better results where observed for the
    LSTM when first-order differencing was applied. Hence, the target becomes . The
    target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation. The final model contained
    two LSTM-layers (i.e. a stacked LSTM network), each with 64 LSTM cells and a dropout-rate
    of 0.2. A final fully connected layer is added with five nodes to obtain a five-day-ahead
    forecast. The network is trained for 50 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [32]
    with a learning rate of 0.001 on a single Nvidia T4 GPU and implemented in Pytorch
    Lightning v1.6.5. 6.4. Training - temporal fusion transformer The TFT contains
    multiple hyperparameters. The original paper [11] also showed that the performance
    of the TFT on a given dataset, largely depends on the set of hyperparameters.
    Due to the complexity of the TFT, a full grid search (as done for the LSTM in
    Section 6.3) is not feasible. To this end, we use Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
    [33] to tune the hyperparameters of the TFT. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
    is a computationally efficient manner for finding that optimizes a given objective
    function. Bayesian hyperparameter tuning relies on Bayes theorem to approximate
    the true objective function shown in Eq. (7) with a surrogate objective function
    – here, a Gaussian Process regression – that can be sampled efficiently. Recursively
    optimizing yields repeatedly improved sets of hyperparameters. Essentially, this
    allows for an informed search in the hyperparameter space when a full grid search
    is not feasible. For more details on Bayesian hyperparameter optimization we refer
    to [33]. The actual Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was done through Weights
    & Biases [34]. The final set of hyperparameters is shown in Table 2. An overview
    of the priors can be found in A.2. All variables were normalized and here too,
    an improvement was observed when predicting the first-order difference rather
    than the raw target. The target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation.
    The TFT implementation was obtained from Pytorch Forecasting v0.10.1, and Pytorch
    Lightning v1.6.5. Training was done for 50 epochs on a single Nvidia T4 GPU. Table

    we examine the performance of various SoTa models used in soil moisture forecasting.
    We present a comparative analysis that highlights the effectiveness of our approach
    and provide insights into the practical relevance in varying agricultural scenarios.
    7.1. Model comparison The results are presented in Table 3. The TFT significantly
    outperforms all other approaches on all metrics. The discrepancy between the MAE
    and the RMSE shows that all methods might have (a few) larger forecasting errors,
    potentially due to the noisy dataset. Indeed, Fig. 5(a) shows that almost all
    models make some larger errors for orchard one — except for the VAR model. Furthermore,
    the MDA shows that the learned directional insight of the TFT is better. In fact,
    the other methods are only correct about the direction of the forecast in 50%
    (or less) of the forecasts — i.e. a random guess. Note that the naive method –
    by definition – does not have any directional insight, since it simply predicts
    a constant. The TFT on the other hand, shows more prowess about the direction
    of the forecast. In terms of -Risk, the TFT outperforms the other methods — though
    the LSTM gets close for the 0.9-risk. Table 3. Performance of the TFT compared
    to the global and local baselines on the unseen test set. The TFT outperforms
    the other approaches on all metrics with statistical significance. For the MAE
    (in kPa) and RMSE (in kPa) the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. For the MDA,
    a test was used. *** marks the 0.01 significance level. For all tests the Bonferroni
    correction for multiple testing was applied [30]. No tests are performed for the
    -risk since those are global metrics. Model Type Test set performance Empty Cell

    the practical benefit of the TFT – allowing for conditional global information
    fusion due to the addition of static information – versus the other methods. Interestingly,
    the VAR-model has fewer larger errors in orchard zero compared to the other models.
    This suggests that the local approach flexibly adapts to sensors that are out
    of the ordinary. Though, note that its median MAE is higher than the other models
    in orchard zero indicating that the local gains are only marginal. Perhaps surprisingly,
    the naive model scores relatively good as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. However,
    a closer look at Fig. 5(b) shows that the good performance of the naive model
    is mainly due to its accuracy in the earliest forecasts, which are close to the
    last known value. This is further supported by Fig. 6, which shows the correlation
    between the last known value of and the true values at different forecasting horizons.
    Specifically, Fig. 6 shows a strong correlation during the earlier time steps,
    which weakens as time passes. As such, it is important to note that the naive
    model is not useful for longer-term forecasts as supported by Fig. 5(b) and Fig.
    6. For example, a prediction at for the naive model would not capture important
    changes in . Orchard one and two in Fig. 5(a) demonstrate the superior capability
    of the TFT to efficiently fuse the information from the different orchards in
    order to perform better locally. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download

    horizon representing the correlation between at time and at to . 7.2. Model interpretability
    One argument against global models – typically neural network-based – is their
    lack of interpretability. A key novelty of TFTs is the interpretable multi-head
    attention mechanism for time-series data. The attention heads permit for an interpretation
    of which time-steps the model pays attention to. Fig. 7(a) shows an example of
    a forecast on a random sample from the unseen test set. Note how the model pays
    the highest attention at the moment where the history of the target changes direction.
    Looking at the global attention in Fig. 7(b), a broader understanding of the attention-mechanism
    in the model can be acquired. On average, the model pays most attention to the
    value from seven days ago and then – in a downward trend – takes into account
    values from closer to the present day. However, attention varies widely across
    time as shown by the boxplots in Fig. 7(b). Note that the size of the look-back
    window was considered as a hyperparameter during Bayesian hyperparameter tuning
    (see Section 6.4) with seven being the minimal value considered. The insights
    from such attention mechanism can foster interesting discussions with e.g. agricultural
    experts and perhaps even deliver novel insights to the experts. Download : Download

    a five-day-ahead forecast of the first difference of soil water potential. The
    gray line (secondary y-axis) illustrates the attention of the model for this sample.
    Note how attention is the highest at the point where the observed value changes
    direction. The attention across the forecast-horizon sums to one. 7(b) shows side-by-side
    boxplots of attention per timestep (with mean-indicator) obtained from the model
    on the test set. Furthermore, thanks to the variable selection networks present
    in the TFT (see Section 5.2), a measure of variable importance can be established.
    The static variable importance in Fig. 8 corresponds well to expert knowledge.
    For example, the name of the particular pear orchard, the measurement year, and
    the depth of the sensor have the highest importance. This is to be expected since
    soil moisture will differ substantially depending on the orchard-specific characteristics
    and the year considered [10]. Further, different depth levels can have different
    root distributions. Sensors at different depths (especially those in deeper levels)
    might have a delayed soil moisture response to e.g. precipitation. As such, Fig.
    8 confirms that the TFT is capable to pick up on these regional and temporal differences.
    Note that the inclusion of static variables in the TFT allows to train a global
    model on this data despite the different characteristics present in the data.
    This is – inherently – not possible with local methods or other global methods
    such as the LSTM. Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Variable importance learned by the variable selection
    networks of the TFT. Fig. 8 also shows the variable importance for the historic
    and known variables. For historic information, the measurement month and soil
    temperature both receive nearly equal importance. The importance of the measurement
    month is as expected and shows again that the TFT picks up on temporal patterns
    available in the data. Soil temperature on the other hand, does not directly reflect
    expert knowledge. However, soil temperature is a proxy of evaporative demand.
    This could potentially explain why this variable is considered as important by
    the model since evaporative demand is known to influence soil water potential.
    In terms of known variables, the precipitation amount receives the highest importance,
    followed by measurement month and ETo. This is not a surprise since precipitation
    and ETo act as a supply and demand mechanism for soil moisture. As such, it is
    worth observing that the model accurately emphasizes those variables as important.
    It should be noted that precipitation and ETo are taken from the actual data and
    provided as future input. In reality however, one could rely on weather forecasting
    services to obtain future information for those variables. 7.3. Practical implications
    The practical applications of our findings are significant in the realm of smart
    agriculture. The advanced forecasting capabilities of the TFT model could potentially
    lead to more efficient and sustainable irrigation practices, tailored to specific
    needs of fruit orchards. This would not only enable optimization of water usage
    but would also support farmers in making informed decisions. This could ultimately
    enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, to obtain actionable
    irrigation advice based on the -forecasts, further work is needed. To this end,
    one could rely on a simple rule-based system that gets triggered when a -threshold
    is reached (see e.g. [35]). More advanced prescriptive analytics or automated
    policy learning could also be explored to get a more precise or self-adapting
    advice. 8. Conclusion and future work In this work, we contribute to the literature
    by comparing global and local forecasting methods for the complex case of soil
    moisture forecasting in smart agriculture with various information sources. We
    showed that a transformer-based global approach outperforms the local and previous
    state-of-the-art global approaches with statistical significance. We discussed
    how – for noisy agricultural sensor data – efficient combination of heterogeneous
    information is necessary to skillfully forecast soil moisture sensors across multiple
    days. It is argued that the use of TFTs permits to build skillful global models
    due to its unique structure and its ability to incorporate static information,
    next to historical and temporal future information. This demonstrates the utility
    of an advanced global model such as the TFT for the complex use-case of soil moisture
    forecasting given limited local data. We built and trained all models on a challenging
    and unique dataset from pear orchards collected at different points in time from
    different locations. The statistically significant results indicate that the TFT
    better succeeds at exploiting the various exogenous data sources while the other
    approaches struggle with finding signal in the noise. As such, the TFT successfully
    incorporates multiple real-world datasets, ranging from soil moisture readings
    to weather station data across fields. It also aligns closely with expert knowledge
    by focusing on relevant variables. While all models are thoroughly trained and
    fine-tuned, it is noted that the local model – i.e. the VAR model – is a linear
    model. As such, more complex non-linear interdependencies that potentially exist
    in the data cannot be captured by a linear model like VAR, thus giving the TFT
    and LSTM a potentially inherent advantage. Improved multi-day forecasting of opens
    multiple future avenues of research. For example, the demonstrated ability to
    learn the underlying characteristics of can potentially help in forecasting other
    important measures such as — a measure of tree water status directly related to
    irrigation. Given our successful integration of various climatic data sources
    into one model, the use of such model as a foundation for domain adaptation towards
    other crops could also be explored. Additionally, exploring the feasibility and
    strategies for on-edge deployment can provide crucial insights into the practical
    application of these techniques in real-world scenarios. Lastly, prescriptive
    analytics should be explored to transform the forecasts into actionable irrigation
    advice as to directly reflect economic value for farmers. CRediT authorship contribution

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Greenhouse and vertical farming, which
    provide optimum growing environments for plants, are becoming more and more important
    in modern agriculture. As reported, there are more than 9 million greenhouses
    around the globe [1], and their market worth is expected to rise to almost 1.3
    billion dollars by 2022 [2]. Precision irrigation aims to increase crop output
    and reduce water consumption [3], [4], [5]. To enable this vision, soil moisture
    sensing plays a key role since a suitable moisture level not only improves plant
    productivity but also saves up to 25% of irrigation water [6]. To measure soil
    moisture, existing commercial soil moisture sensors are expensive despite their
    high accuracy (e.g., an ECHO-EC5 sensor costs 169 USD [7]), preventing their large-scale
    application in real-world farm fields or greenhouses. To reduce the system cost
    and bring the wireless connection to the system, recent studies propose to employ
    low-cost IoT wireless devices (i.e., Wi-Fi [8], RFID [9], UWB [10]) for soil moisture
    sensing. For example, Strobe [8] proposes to estimate soil moisture by placing
    a Wi-Fi transmitter in soil and placing a Wi-Fi receiver on-ground to measure
    the time of flight (ToF) of the signal traveling the soil. However, a pair of
    transceivers can only measure soil moisture in one location. Thus, it is costly
    to deploy thousands of sensors and power them with batteries or power cables on
    large farmland. To achieve low-cost and battery-free, GreenTag system [9] employs
    the commercial RFID tag as the soil moisture sensor and achieves 4% sensing error.
    However, it can not measure the deep soil moisture, i.e., the root moisture. To
    measure the deep soil moisture, recent work [11] buries a battery-powered tag/sensor
    in soil and measures the ToF of LoRa signals from the tag to the on-ground receiver.
    However, it requires battery power and may incur soil contamination due to battery
    corruption during long-term monitoring. Ideally, a soil moisture sensing system
    needs to satisfy the following four requirements: Battery-free and low-cost: It
    should be battery-free and low-cost so that sensing devices can be widely used
    and easily maintained, e.g., the battery-free can reduce the cost and avoid soil
    contamination. A high moisture sensing accuracy: It should achieve high accuracy
    (e.g., 2% sensing error) so that smart agriculture can make fine-grained irrigation
    control decisions to improve irrigation efficiency [12]. A wide moisture sensing
    scale: Its sensing scale should cover the soil moisture range that is suitable
    for the growth of most plants, i.e., 20% ∼ 60% [13], [14]. A deep moisture sensing
    depth: It should detect soil moisture at depth because the roots of most plants
    are at a depth of 5 ∼ 75 cm [15], [16]. To the best of our knowledge, there is
    no such system that can meet all the above requirements. To fill this gap, we
    are inspired by chipless sensors [17], [18], [19], [20], which are fully passive
    and made of low-cost metal surfaces and substrates. Thus, the chipless sensor
    is low-cost for massive production and has the advantages of flexible design and
    easy fabrication for meeting different requirements. Moreover, due to the pervasive
    availability of Wi-Fi devices and their inexpensive hardware, we further reduce
    the sensing system cost by leveraging ambient Wi-Fi signals to activate chipless
    sensors and capture their readings. In this paper, we introduce SoilTAG, a battery-free,
    chipless Wi-Fi tag-based high accuracy, and low-cost soil moisture sensing system.
    It consists of a pair of Wi-Fi devices and at least one chipless Wi-Fi tag. The
    chipless Wi-Fi tag, which acts as the moisture sensor, is attached to the soil
    surface or buried in soil as shown in Fig. 1. Benefiting from the chipless, our
    soil moisture sensor (i.e., the tag) is battery-free and designed as a low-cost
    microstrip resonator [21]. The key insight is that the resonant frequency of the
    tag changes in response to variations in soil moisture levels, which shares the
    same insight as our recent research [20] but this work aims to develop a dedicated
    soil sensing system and validate its performance in practical application scenarios.
    To illustrate this, Fig. 2(a) shows the simulated resonant frequencies (i.e.,
    f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 , and f 5 ) when soil moisture levels are 0%, 4%, 8%, 11%,
    and 90% (theoretical value). As we can see, even though there is a small moisture
    level change (e.g., 0% to 4%), the resonant frequency varies significantly (e.g.,
    about 350 MHz from f 1 to f 2 ). It implies that it is possible to achieve fine-grained
    moisture sensing. Fig. 1. Application example of SoilTAG: detecting soil moisture
    levels in a strawberry greenhouse. Show All Fig. 2. Illustration of frequency
    responses for different soil moisture levels. (a) The raw frequency responses
    in a wide frequency band. (b) Ideal frequency responses increase the sensitivity.
    Show All It is non-trivial to realize the high accuracy of soil moisture sensing
    due to the limited bandwidth of most commercial IoT/RF devices. For example, Bluetooth
    devices only have a bandwidth of 2 MHz, RFID devices only have a bandwidth of
    28 MHz, and even the most recent advanced Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) devices have a bandwidth
    of no more than 160 MHz. Thus, it is impossible to capture all the resonant frequencies
    that spread out over a few GHz bandwidth, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). To overcome
    the bandwidth constraint, we detect soil moisture through the amplitude of a given
    narrow frequency band. For example, Fig. 2(a) shows that there are large power
    amplitude changes (e.g., Δ d 1 ) in the Wi-Fi band (i.e., the pink region) for
    different moisture levels. However, there are two practical problems when applying
    the amplitude for soil moisture sensing. First, the sensing resolution is limited
    at some moisture range. For example, Fig. 2(a) shows that when the soil moisture
    changes from 8% to 11%, the power amplitude only changes by 1 dB, which may limit
    the sensing accuracy. Environmental noise may cause an average of 3 dB of amplitude
    variations [22], which would easily distort the small power changes caused by
    soil moisture change. To solve this challenge, we introduce a solution to optimize
    resonator hardware design parameters so that it can enlarge the frequency response
    power difference of adjacent moisture levels, i.e., the power changes can exceed
    3 dB as shown in Fig. 2(b). By spacing these frequency responses properly, we
    can increase the sensitivity in detecting soil moisture levels and enable a high
    sensing accuracy. To further cover the best/whole soil moisture scale for most
    plants, we propose a multiple resonator ensemble design strategy. Specifically,
    the whole soil moisture range is divided into several segments and each resonator
    is designed to work in each moisture segment. In this way, the sensing accuracy
    of SoilTAG can be improved in the whole soil moisture range. Second, both the
    tag location and soil moisture changes could cause amplitude variations in the
    channel frequency response, resulting in soil moisture estimation error. To cope
    with this problem, we use the amplitude ratio rather than the absolute amplitude
    of channel frequency response [23]. Specifically, we first measure a reference
    channel frequency response before attaching the tag to soil. Then, when the tag
    is attached to the soil, we get another online channel frequency response. By
    calculating the ratio between the two channel measurements, we get the relative
    ratio which is only related to soil moisture level and independent of the tag
    location. In Section III-D we theoretically prove that the frequency response
    ratio feature is independent of the distance changes. After resolving the two
    practical problems, we finally theoretically analyze the maximum working range
    of SoilTAG, as well as the application scenarios of the system. Specifically,
    we model SoilTAG as a bistatic radar [24] and use the radar equation to analyze
    the transmission power, as well as the tag antenna configuration, and the signal
    frequency band on the coverage area of SoilTAG, which is an important system deployment
    guide in the real-world for meeting requirement of working range. The analysis
    reveals that in order to improve the working range, the key is to increase the
    received signal at the tag side and to increase the signal to interference noise
    ratio at the receiver side. Following this insight, we design a high gain antenna
    to improve the received and reflection signal of tag, and employ beamforming and
    beam-nulling at the transceiver side to increase the incident signal to tag and
    reduce the interference signal to the receiver [19], [20]. In Section IV-A, we
    show the theoretical analysis. In Section IV-B, we present the tag antenna design
    in detail. We built two prototypes of SoilTAG system in 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band with
    WARP software radios and commodity Wi-Fi cards (Intel 5300 and Athero 9580). We
    evaluated SoilTAG with extensive experiments in five kinds of environments including
    both indoor and outdoor. Experimental results show that: (i) WARP radios-based
    system achieves 90th percentile moisture sensing error of 2% , 3.64% and 8% when
    the distance between the transmitter and the tag is 6 m, 10 m, and 13.9 m; (ii)
    commodity Wi-Fi cards based system achieves over 83.8% accuracy (iii) SoilTAG
    achieves the sensing depth up to 1 m. Contributions: Our contributions are summarized
    as follows: SoilTAG is the first battery-free, chipless Wi-Fi tag-based high accuracy
    and low-cost soil moisture sensing system. By employing the narrow bandwidth signal
    power feature and optimizing the resonator-based tag design parameters, we break
    the barrier of bandwidth limitation and deliver high sensing accuracy. We propose
    a new moisture sensing feature, i.e., the relative amplitude ratio, which is not
    only independent/robust to tag location changes but also only related to the soil
    moisture. We theoretically analyze the maximum working range of our system, which
    is an important system deployment guide in the real world for meeting the working
    range and coverage requirements. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrated
    the effectiveness of the proposed system. SECTION II. Related Work Our work is
    broadly related to the literature in the following four categories: • Commercial
    Soil Sensors: Commodity soil moisture sensors can be divided into three types,
    including TDR-based (time domain reflectometry) [25], FDR-based (frequency domain
    reflectometry) sensors [26], and neutron method based sensors [27]. Although they
    can provide high accuracy soil moisture sensing, they are extremely expensive
    with a price higher than 150 USD, which limits their widespread use. Furthermore,
    most of them require users to hand-hold, which is inefficient to measure soil
    moisture in a large number of locations in a farm field or a greenhouse. • Wireless
    Sensor Network: To realize automatic monitoring, wireless sensor networks were
    proposed [28], [29], [30] where the wireless module is responsible for data transmission
    with gateways and the sensor is responsible for soil sensing. Although WSNs can
    achieve large-scale soil moisture sensing, sensor nodes require battery power,
    and a large number of sensor nodes could be very costly. For example, the cheapest
    node mentioned in [29], [31] is $ 20. It requires battery and regular maintenance.
    In contrast, SoilTAG employs low-cost and battery-free chipless tags as soil moisture
    sensors and does not require maintenance. • Wireless Soil Moisture Sensing: Recent
    works [8], [10], [11], [32] exploit the changes in the wireless signal propagation
    speed in the soil to estimate soil moisture. Strobe [8] achieves a sensing range
    of 1.5 m by burying an active Wi-Fi transmitter and a 3-antenna array in soil.
    Another work [11] expands the working range to 100 m by burying an active and
    customized LoRa node in soil. The work [10] pushes the sensing depth to up to
    1 m theoretically. Unfortunately, all these techniques need to bury battery-powered
    nodes in the soil, which has the risk of soil contamination from battery corruption
    and adds additional maintenance cost in real usage and thus limiting the long-term
    monitoring. Different from the above works, a recent work CoMEt [32] exploits
    an ultra-wideband RF signal (2 GHz) to measure the ToF from the soil to the receiver
    which does not need to bury a tag/node in the soil, achieving a median error of
    1.1%. In contrast, SoilTAG is a chipless tag-based sensing system that does not
    require battery power or an energy harvester and has the potential for long-term
    and deep soil monitoring. It does not need an extra assistive mobile device to
    collect the sensing data and thus has a lower cost but also achieves a comparable
    sensing accuracy to the systems mentioned before. • Battery-Free Tag Based Soil
    Moisture Sensing: To address the power supply problem of sensor nodes in practice,
    previous research proposed the use of battery-free RFIDs for sensing soil moisture
    sensing [9], [33], [34]. Some previous studies [33], [34] have studied attaching
    RFID tags on the soil surface to measure soil moisture but it can only measure
    coarse-grained moisture variations. GreenTag [9] achieves high accuracy by capturing
    the DMRT feature of the RFID tag''s backscatter signal to estimate soil moisture.
    However, RFID tags are not suitable for sensing soil moisture in deep soil because
    the soil detunes the tag''s antenna. In contrast, SoilTAG can detect moisture
    underground up to 1 m. Past studies have also proposed chipless resonator based
    soil moisture [35], [36], air humidity [37], [38], [39], building wall humidity
    [40], and finger touch sensing technique [19]. Gopalakrishn et al. proposed a
    chipless resonator based soil moisture sensor [36], which employs VNA as the reader
    and requires a bandwidth of 100 MHz (0.875–0.975 GHz). Dey et al. proposed a chipless
    soil moisture sensor that estimates soil moisture based on the channel pulse response
    [35]. Similarly, to sense the humidity of air or building wall [37], [38], [39],
    [40], the researchers designed a special resonator to measure the resonant frequency
    or TDR. However, these systems require large bandwidth and are not suitable for
    widespread IoT devices. In contrast, SoilTAG works in 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi ISM band which
    is the most widely used frequency band. LiveTag [19] designed a chipless Wi-Fi
    tag to sense a finger''s touching or not touching. Different from LiveTag, SoilTAG
    aims to precisely measure fine-grained soil moisture changes. In addition, our
    recent work proposed a reconfigurable design framework for the chipless resonator
    based tag [20], which aims to eliminate the design effort. Similar to the previous
    work, SoilTAG employs DGS resonator as the sensing component. Unlike the previous
    work, SoilTAG aims to develop a dedicated soil moisture sensing system, including
    the robust moisture sensing feature selection, the new resonator hardware design
    optimization for improving the sensing accuracy, the theoretical analysis of maximum
    working range, and new antenna design for improving the working range. • Comprehensive
    Comparison: As reported in the literature [10], there are several important design
    considerations in soil moisture sensing system design, including accuracy, sensing
    depth and cost. In addition, we also take the moisture sensing scale into account,
    which is another important factor in practical usage. Table I lists the important
    parameters of most related sensors/systems. The overall cost of SoilTAG includes
    the cost of two commodity Wi-Fi cards, the chipless resonator, and two antennas.
    The price of the tag and antenna is the unit price of producing ten thousand units.
    Table I Comprehensive Comparison to Existing Soil Moisture Sensors/Systems Remarks:
    From Table I, we have the following remarks: 1) Commodity high-end sensors provide
    high accuracy but cannot capture moisture data wireless and also incur a lot of
    labor costs in real applications; 2) The wireless sensing system that employs
    LoRA signal as the sensing medium has the potential for large-scale monitoring
    but has limitations on the power supply for in-ground nodes; 3) Using radar/ultra-wideband
    signal has good sensing resolution in moisture and depth but has a risk of causing
    soil contamination due to battery corrosion in long-term monitoring; 4) Although
    the battery-free sensing system has a limited working range compared with LoRA
    based sensing system, it can be addressed by deploying a lot of tags in a large-scale
    farm since the tag is ultra-low cost and easy to fabricate. It also provides good
    resolution in moisture and depth and reduces maintenance costs. SECTION III. System
    Design This section introduces the system design. In Section III-A, B, and C,
    we present the design of the tag''s resonator for battery-free and low-cost soil
    moisture sensing. In Section III-D, we propose a new moisture sensing feature
    that is robust to the tag location changes. In Section III-E, we propose a light
    weight machine learning based soil moisture estimation model. A. Resonator-Based
    Soil Moisture Sensing To achieve the sensing purpose, the chipless sensing technique
    relies on the passive resonator [17], [45]. Specifically, the soil moisture level
    [46]1 would change the resonator circuit parameters (e.g., the capacitor), thus
    changing the frequency response of the resonator. The passive resonator can be
    realized by various geometrical structures such as defected ground structure (DGS)
    [21], microstrip ring [19], and spiral planar resonator [48]. To simplify the
    design process, we adopt the DGS resonator for soil moisture sensing since it
    has a more simple structure with only two parameters, i.e., the length and width
    of the etched slot. Fig. 4(a) shows the DGS resonator, which is made by printing
    metal strips/surfaces on a substrate. By attaching the ground layer''s DGS structure
    to the soil, the soil moisture can be transduced into the frequency response of
    the resonator. It has three layers including the transmission line on the top
    layer, the substrate in the middle layer, and the metal surface etched with DGS
    on the ground layer. The SMA connectors on both ends are used to connect the antennas
    for receiving and transmitting wireless signal. Fig. 3. Soil moisture θ versus
    Frequency response. Show All Fig. 4. The chipless DGS-based resonator and its
    equivalent circuit. Show All It can be equivalently modeled as an RLC parallel
    resonance circuit as shown in Fig. 4(b). The RLC parallel resonance circuit can
    be viewed as the sensing port as shown in the blue dash line in Fig. 4(b). Placing
    the circuit on the soil is equivalent to connecting the soil with the sensing
    port. The blue part represents the soil''s equivalent impedance Z soil . Z L is
    the impedance of the transmission line. C 1 represents the capacitor between the
    transmission line and the metal ground plane. L c , C c and R c represent the
    equivalent inductor, capacitor and resistor of the defected ground structure.
    Theoretically, the frequency response is the ratio between the output voltage
    and input voltage [49], which can be expressed as: FR(f)=20 log 10 | 2 Z D Z 2
    L +2 Z L +2 Z L Z D +2 Z D +1 |, (1) View Source where Z D is the impedance of
    the DGS resonator and f is the frequency of the input signal. When the resonator
    is attached to the soil, Z D can be expressed as: Z D = 1 1 R c +j2πf C c + 1
    j2πf L c + 1 Z soil – – – – – + 1 j2πf C 1 , (2) View Source As we can see, the
    soil moisture θ determines Z soil , and thus changes the impedance Z D as well
    as the resultant frequency response FR(f) in (1). Simplifying the soil as a capacitor2
    denoted as C soil , then it is equivalent to adding a capacitor in parallel to
    the original resonator circuit. Based on (2), when the imaginary part of impedance
    reaches zero, the circuit reaches resonance. Then, the resonant frequency f c
    can be written as: f c = 1 2π L c ( C 1 + C C + C soil – – – – – ) − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − − − √ . (3) View Source Thus, the resonant frequency f c is also
    affected by soil moisture. (1) and (3) explain the results shown in Fig. 3, where
    each soil moisture level has a unique frequency response FR(f) and a unique resonant
    frequency f c . In summary, the DGS resonator can convert the soil moisture level
    into the frequency response feature. Next, we show how to design and optimize
    the DGS resonator parameters to increase the frequency response sensitivity to
    soil moisture changes. B. Optimize Resonator Parameters for High Accuracy Moisture
    Sensing As illustrated above, the DGS resonator has three adjustable components
    including the substrate, the transmission line, and the DGS structure, which determine
    the resulting frequency response. We detail the design of the three components
    below. 1) Substrate Selection and Transmission Line Design To reduce the tag''s
    cost, the substrate employs inexpensive FR4 material and the thickness is designed
    to 1.2 mm, retaining firmness. In addition, to ensure the maximum signal transmission
    and achieve a long working range, the impedance of the transmission line should
    be equal to the antenna''s impedance of 50 Ω . The transmission line''s width
    determines its impedance Z line [49]: Z line = 87 ε r +1.41 − − − − − − − √ ⋅ln(
    5.98H 0.8 w l +T ), (4) View Source where w l is the width of the transmission
    line, ε r is the permittivity of substrate, H is the thickness of substrate, and
    T is the thickness of transmission line. Note that ε r , H and T are known at
    the fabrication process, i.e., ε r =4.4, H =1.2 mm, T =0.036 mm. Given Z line
    =50 Ω , we can calculate the value of w l . For the resonant frequency f c =2.45
    GHz, the width w l is 2.24 mm. The length only determines the phase of the ongoing
    electromagnetic wave and does not impact the resonant frequency. To satisfy the
    soil sensing purpose and save the substrate usage, the length and width of the
    substrate are 100 mm and 30 mm. 2) Optimized Design Process for DGS Size Above
    we introduced how to design the transmission line and substrate. Here, we show
    how to design the DGS''s size to make the frequency response change uniformly
    with the changes in soil moisture levels, so that we can increase the sensing
    sensitivity and accuracy. We tune the DGS''s geometric size since the width and
    length of the DGS determine the equivalent capacitor and inductor of the resonator,
    thereby determining its resonant frequency. The design goal can be formally described
    as finding a proper DGS size to ensure that the frequency responses of different
    soil moisture levels [F R 1 (f, θ 1 ),F R 2 (f, θ 2 ),⋯,F R i (f, θ i )] are as
    evenly distributed as possible within the WiFi band. To this end, the size parameters
    of the DGS structure should be carefully designed. The standard method relies
    on exhaustively searching the optimal parameter through multiple iterations of
    HFSS simulation, which however is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost, a straightforward
    method is to employ an optimization algorithm [51], [52] to optimize the resonator.
    In general, the basic idea of the optimization algorithm is to continuously update
    the population iteratively, so that their fitness values are getting higher and
    higher, that is, getting closer and closer to the optimal solution. However, in
    our implementation, we have two observations 1) the major time consumption comes
    from HFSS simulation, and 2) some parameters in the current generation are directly
    inherited from the former generation. This means the program will repeatedly conduct
    HFSS simulations for the same size parameters. The repeated simulation inevitably
    wastes the computation resource and time. Based on the two observations, we design
    a cache table based acceleration mechanism. Specifically, before the optimization
    program conducts HFSS simulation, it checks whether the current parameter is in
    the built cache table. If not, it will conduct HFSS simulation and record a ternary
    array including length, width, file address termed as {a,w,ind} , else, the program
    will retrieve the file address recorded in the cache table and compute its fitness,
    and then skip to the next individual parameter. By using this cache table, we
    can save time wasted on the repeated HFSS simulation. To achieve this, we present
    the optimization design flow by jointly using MATLAB and HFSS software (Fig. 5(a)).
    Given the soil moisture range [ θ 1 , θ 2 ] , the key to meeting the design goal
    is to make the resonant frequency of the low moisture θ 1 close to high frequency
    boundary or the one that makes the resonant frequency of high moisture θ 2 close
    to the low frequency boundary. Fig. 5. The workflow of the optimization algorithm
    and the parameter convergence process. Show All To do so, we define the fitness
    function as: Fitness= f 2 − f 1 | f i − f 1 |+| f i − f 2 | , (5) View Source
    where f 1 , f 2 are the target frequency boundaries, and f i is the simulated
    resonator frequency of the i - th DGS size individual < a i , w i > . To ensure
    the solved frequency f i is slightly higher than the upper boundary of Wi-Fi band,
    one can set f 1 =2.48 GHz and f 2 =2.5 GHz. The two parameters f 1 , f 2 can be
    set based on the design requirement. Thus the frequency responses can be approximately
    evenly distributed in Wi-Fi band. The optimization algorithm goes through five
    steps: Initialization: Set the population number n and the overall iteration times
    k , randomly initialize a set S with DGS size parameters of < a i , w i > , 1≤i≤n
    , the permittivity range of ε 1 ∼ ε 2 with the corresponding soil moisture scale
    θ 1 ∼ θ 2 in MATLAB.3 Check cache table and call HFSS: Based on these set parameters,
    the MATLAB program firstly checks the cache table and finds individuals that do
    not occur repeatedly. Then it generates a .vbs script to set HFSS project parameters,
    enabling HFSS simulation via .vbs script. HFSS simulation: HFSS simulates the
    frequency response of the DGS model for each size parameter < a i , w i > , 1≤i≤n
    , and saves n frequency responses F R i (f,θ) into a file, records its file address
    and updates the cache table. Fitness calculation: The optimization program reads
    the simulation results and calculates the resonant frequency f i and the fitness
    of each < a i , w i > based on (5). If the number of individuals whose fitness
    is equal to 1, exceeds a ratio β (i.e., 80%) of the population number, then the
    algorithm will obtain the optimal result. Selection, crossover and mutation: The
    optimization program selects the DGS size that corresponds to the n/2 larger fitness
    value as half of the new generation S ′ . Then, the program transforms the decimal
    codes of a,w to binary codes, and performs crossover and mutation to generate
    another half of the population. Then it generates the next generation DGS size
    set S ′ comprised of n/2 current individuals and n/2 new individuals. Repeat Step
    2,3,4,5 until the iteration process end. Finally, the optimization algorithm outputs
    the optimal DGS size. In this optimization algorithm, there are 3 parameters that
    affect the optimization results and the time consumption. The population number
    n , the iteration time k , and the convergence degree β . Too few populations
    will lead to non-convergence of results, while too many populations will lead
    to a low mutation rate and take a long time. In our experience, the population
    number n is set at 40–60. Similarly, the iteration number k is set at 10–15. The
    convergence degree β is determined by the design requirement. If one wants most
    individuals to satisfy the design requirements, the β should be set at 80%–100%.
    If the requirements are not too stringent, the β can be set at 20%–50%. Smaller
    β will reduce the optimization time since when the β achieves the preset value,
    the program will end even if the program has not executed the preset number of
    iterations. To visualize the process, we show the convergence process of parameters
    in Fig. 5(b), where the x-y plane represents the size parameter < a,w > and z
    -axis represents the iteration times. It shows that the < a,w > gradually converges
    to a smaller range with the iteration time increasing. Fig. 5(c) shows the mean
    error of each generation''s individuals. It is clear that the error gets close
    to zero when the iteration process reaches the 12th generation. It is noted that
    in our current implementation, the population is set at 60 and the iteration time
    is set at 15. Such a setting can output a good size parameter in 5 hours. In addition,
    by counting the number of repeated simulations in the optimization process, we
    found that if disabling the cache table, the number of simulations that HFSS needs
    to perform is 720 times (60 × 12), while enabling the cache table, HFSS only needs
    to perform 259 times, reducing 461 repeated simulations and saving about 64% of
    the time. Fig. 6. The frequency responses measured via VNA. Show All Fig. 7. The
    results of two-resonators tag design. Show All Fig. 8. The relative frequency
    response feature for soil moisture sensing. Show All After the five steps, the
    designed DGS resonator is ready for fabrication and testing. C. Extend The Soil
    Moisture Sensing Scale In order to cover the most suitable soil moisture scale
    (i.e., 20% ∼ 60%) for the growth of most plants, we introduce multiple resonators
    to customize the soil moisture sensing range. To do so, the soil moisture can
    be divided into 8 segments. Each resonator is responsible for detecting one moisture
    segment. To flexibly design the tag for a specific range, one can integrate different
    resonators into one tag. In theory, the sensing soil moisture scales can be divided
    as 0% ∼ 23%, 23% ∼ 30%, 30% ∼ 40%, 40% ∼ 50%, 50% ∼ 60%, 60% ∼ 70%, 70% ∼ 80%
    and 80% ∼ 90%, and customize the resonator size for each segment by using the
    design process shown in the previous subsection. However, in practical measurement,
    we test moisture no more than 67% since the soil approaches saturation when the
    water content is close to 60%. Fig. 6(a) shows the intrinsic frequency responses
    of 8 resonators. The geometric size of the eight resonators is a = {10,7,6,4.9,4.9,4.1,4.2,4}(mm)
    and w = {0.1,1,1,1,0.64,0.6,0.9,0.9}(mm) . To demonstrate the feasibility of this
    idea, we integrate # 2 and # 3 resonators into the same substrate. The simulation
    and testing results (Fig. 7(a) and (b)) show two different notches in the frequency
    response curves, which represent two resonators. Fig. 7(a) shows the simulation
    results – R1 for sensing 28.5%–32.5% and R2 for sensing 18.5%–23.5%. Fig. 7(b)
    shows the results measured with VNA - R1 for 21%–24% and R2 for 28%–31%. We can
    see that the actual frequency responses of the 8 moisture levels are basically
    consistent with the simulated results, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-resonator
    tag on sensing different moisture ranges.4 Further, we evaluate the accuracy of
    #1–#6 resonators for sensing 0%–67% soil moisture [53] in Section VI-B. The experimental
    results show that the 90th percentile sensing error is lower than 2%, verifying
    that the multiple resonators based tag is able to work in the most suitable moisture
    scale for the growth of most plants. D. Robust Soil Moisture Sensing Feature In
    the previous section, we designed the tag''s resonator that can convert soil moisture
    into the frequency response feature. However, when there are changes in the tag''s
    location, the distance between transceivers and the tag will change, resulting
    in variations in the channel frequency response. Thus, we may suffer from large
    sensing errors if using the absolute amplitude of the channel frequency response.
    To cope with this problem, we propose a new sensing feature – the relative frequency
    response, which is independent/robust to tag location changes and only related
    to the soil moisture. To obtain this feature, we first measure a reference power
    amplitude A ref of the frequency response when the tag''s resonator is shorted
    at the deployment stage. During the online measurement, we get another power amplitude
    A tag of the frequency response. Then, the relative frequency response is computed
    as A tag/ A ref . Next, we mathematically prove that the relative frequency response
    A tag / A ref is independent of the tag deployment distance and only related to
    the soil moisture. The idea is also used in existing RFID tag based sensing systems
    [9], [54] which obtain the RSS/phase difference between the sensing tag and the
    reference tag, whereas we compute the relative ratio between two frequency responses.
    The Channel State Information (CSI) represents the wireless channel response,
    mathematically denoted as H . A wireless signal S is typically represented as
    a complex number with amplitude |S| and phase θ , i.e., S=|S|⋅ e jθ . Suppose
    that S tx =| S tx |⋅ e j θ tx is the transmitter''s transmission signal. In practice,
    the received signal S rx is the superimposing of multiple components, because
    the signal also propagates along LoS path and multipath between the transmitter
    and the receiver. Mathematically, it can be formulated as (6) where h 1 is the
    frequency response of Tx-to-Tag channel and h 2 is the frequency response of Tag-to-Rx.
    h 1 and h 2 are directly related to the tag location. h tag is the frequency response
    of tag, which is only related to the soil moisture. When sensing soil moisture,
    the tag''s reflection signal received by Rx can be written as follow: S tag =
    S tx ⋅ h 1 ⋅ h tag ⋅ h 2 =| S tx h 1 h tag h 2 | e j( θ tx + θ 1 + θ tag + θ 2
    ) . (6) View Source And the wireless channel response of Tx-Tag-Rx is: H tag =
    S tag / S tx = h 1 ⋅ h tag ⋅ h 2 . (7) View Source When the tag''s resonator is
    shorted, the tag''s reflection signal received by Rx is: S ref = S tx ⋅ h 1 ⋅
    h 2 =| S tx h 1 h 2 | e j( θ tx + θ 1 + θ 2 ) . (8) View Source And the wireless
    channel response of Tx-Tag-Rx is: H ref = S ref / S tx = h 1 ⋅ h 2 . (9) View
    Source Then, the ratio between H tag and H ref can be written as follow: H tag
    / H ref A tag A ref = | h 1 h tag h 2 | e j( θ 1 + θ tag + θ 2 ) | h 1 h 2 | e
    j( θ 1 + θ 2 ) =| h tag | e j θ tag , =| h tag |. (10) (11) View Source It is
    clear that the relative frequency response is not related to h 1 and h 2 (i.e.,
    the tag location) and only related to the tag h tag . Note that we employ beam
    nulling to reduce the direct channel between Tx and Rx and do not consider the
    impact of the direct channel here. Therefore, by calculating the ratio between
    the power amplitude A tag and A ref , we can get the feature that is not only
    independent of the tag location but also is related to the soil moisture. Further,
    we demonstrate the effectiveness of the relative frequency response feature through
    a real-world experiment. We isolate the direct channel between the transmitter
    and the receiver manually. The transceivers are implemented with WARP software
    radios [55]. We fix the distance between the receiver to the tag and vary the
    Tx-to-Tag distance from 0.5 m to 3 m at a step size of 0.5 m. At each distance,
    we measure the reference CSI amplitude by shorting the resonator and taking another
    CSI amplitude measurement of the normal tag. Then we calculate the ratio of the
    two measurements. The CSI amplitude value is calculated by averaging the CSI amplitude
    of data subcarriers in the Wi-Fi band. Fig. 8(a) shows that the CSI amplitude
    measurements of the tag change significantly by distance variations (the red dashed
    line). In contrast, the relative frequency response (i.e., the ratio shown as
    the gray line) is robust and remains nearly constant over different distances.
    Finally, we examine whether the relative frequency response feature of different
    soil moisture is distinguishable in the Wi-Fi band. Specifically, we measure the
    relative frequency responses of 9 different soil moisture levels 0%, 3%, 5%, 8%,
    10%, 12%, 15%, 18% and 20%. The distance between the transmitter/receiver and
    tag is set at 0.5 m respectively. Fig. 8(b) shows that features of different soil
    moisture levels are distinguishable. With the soil moisture increasing, the relative
    frequency response gets higher. This trend is consistent with the results measured
    by VNA as shown in Fig. 6(b). This result shows that the relative frequency response
    is a robust feature for soil moisture sensing. E. Machine Learning Based Soil
    Moisture Estimation So far, we have designed chipless tags that can convert the
    soil moisture level into the relative frequency response (Fig. 8(b)). Then we
    need a method to identify soil moisture by using these relative frequency responses.
    A simple method is to fit a mapping function between the averaged frequency response
    and the soil moisture [9], as shown in Fig. 9(a). The circles represent the mean
    value of measured frequency response for different soil moisture levels, and the
    dotted line is the fitted exponential polynomial. Given a frequency response measurement,
    one can estimate soil moisture by using this fit function. However, this approach
    works well only when the measured frequency responses of soil moisture are accurate
    (e.g., by using VNA or in a clean environment). In practice, the captured frequency
    responses of the wireless channel are likely to deviate from the actual frequency
    response caused by soil due to direct signal interference between Tx and Rx. Therefore,
    using the fitted function may obtain wrong estimations. To cope with this problem,
    we instead resort to machine learning (ML) based moisture estimation. Recently,
    a lot of wireless sensing works have shown that ML-based classification/regression
    model has good robustness in the task of feature identification [56], [57]. To
    show the effectiveness of ML model in improving the soil moisture estimation accuracy,
    we adopt a non-linear dimension reduction method (named t-SNE [58]) to extract
    the two-dimensional feature of the relative frequency response for each soil moisture.
    Fig. 9(b) plots the two-dimension features of 9 soil moisture levels. It is clear
    that each cluster can distinguish from other clusters. Recall Fig. 8(b) where
    the frequency responses of 5% and 8% moisture are close to each other, while the
    two-dimensional feature clusters of 5% and 8% (the yellow and purple clusters)
    are clearly distinguishable, which can be easily identified. This explains why
    the ML model can improve the estimation accuracy. This task for inferring soil
    moisture can be formulated as a regression problem. Specifically, the process
    goes through two steps. The first step is offline training: we train a regression
    model by collecting the relative frequency response samples of each soil moisture
    level as the training dataset. The second step is an online estimation: we input
    a measured frequency response sample into the regression model, then the model
    will output the estimated soil moisture. Next, we show the data collection and
    model selection. Data Collection: To make the system more robust to environmental
    variation, we collect data from the five environments to train a comprehensive
    model. This ensures the diversity of the training dataset. We collect 33200 relative
    frequency responses of different soil moisture levels in five environments. The
    five environments are 1) the anechoic chamber which is a static environment without
    multipath; 2) the open room which is a static environment with less multipath;
    3) the home courtyard with less multipath and human motion; 4) the open farmland
    with the static environment; 5) the office room with the more multipath and static
    environment. In each environment, we collect the training dataset and test dataset,
    termed as S i ={ S train , S test },1≤i≤5 . The feature dimension of relative
    frequency response is 1×N and N is the number of subcarriers. In our implementation,
    we select 246 frequency subcarriers across the entire Wi-Fi band with 312.5 KHz
    space between two adjacent frequency subcarriers. The feature vector x and label
    y of training data <x,y> can be formally written as <[ A 1 , A 2 ,..., A 246 ],θ>
    , where A i is the relative frequency response of i - th subcarrier computed from
    (11) and θ is the soil moisture value. ML Model Selection: In order to achieve
    better soil moisture estimation accuracy in different environments, we test 9
    regression models including Linear regression (Linear), Ridge regression (Ridge),
    Lasso regression (La), Elastic Net (EN), Decision Tree (DT), KNN, Random Forest
    (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We compare the estimation
    accuracy of 9 models in 5 environments respectively. The comparison results are
    shown in Section VI-C7 and Fig. 25. We find that three models (DT, XGB, and KNN)
    perform better than other models in all five environments. In addition, the XGBoost
    performs best in the commodity Wi-Fi cards based soil moisture sensing system,
    as shown in Fig. 27(b). Finally, we select the XGB model as the moisture estimation
    model. Fig. 9. (a) shows the fitted function based soil moisture estimation method.

    In this section, we first analyze the system''s theoretical maximum working range
    and identify key parameters that have a great impact on the system''s working
    range. Then, we propose solutions to tune those parameters to improve the working
    range of SoilTAG. A. Theoretical Working Range Analysis Following existing backscatter
    studies [59], [60], we model SoilTAG as a bistatic radar. According to the radar
    equation [24], the received signal power can be modeled as: P r = P t G t G r
    λ 2 σ (4π ) 3 d 4 , (12) View Source where P t is the transmission power, G t
    is the transmitting antenna gain, G r is the receive antenna gain, λ is the signal
    wavelength, d is the distance from Radar to the target and σ is the radar cross
    section of the target. SoilTAG has a bistatic setup with two splitting links,
    called the downlink from Tx to Tag, and the uplink from Tag to Rx as shown in
    Fig. 10(a), where d down is the distance of the downlink, d up is the distance
    of the uplink. For the downlink, the received power of the tag can be modeled
    as: P tag = P t G t G ant λ 2 (4π d down ) 2 . (13) View Source Similarly, for
    the uplink, the received power of Rx can be modeled as: P r = P tag G tag G ant
    G r λ 2 (4π d up ) 2 , (14) View Source where G ant is the tag''s antenna gain
    and G tag is the transmission efficiency of the tag''s DGS resonator. Therefore,
    the working distance can be calculated as: d down ⋅ d up = P t G t G ant G tag
    G ant G r λ 4 P r − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ =D, (15) View Source
    where, D is a constant for a given configuration, i.e., transmission power, antenna
    gain, and frequency band. From the above equation, we have three observations:
    When the Tx and Rx are co-located, the maximum range for both the uplink and downlink
    is d up = d down = D − − √ when the self-interference between Tx and Rx is well
    canceled. When the locations of Tx and Rx are fixed, which is a more realistic
    setup in reality where only the tag moves, the maximum working range of uplink
    and downlink is limited by d up ∗ d down ≤D . The downlink distance is inversely
    proportional to the uplink distance under the same transmission power. Thus, to
    increase the downlink distance, the uplink distance should be reduced, and vice
    versa. For example, Fig. 10(b) shows the theoretical and measured working range
    of downlink and uplink, which is consistent with this observation. In practice,
    it is challenging to achieve the maximum working rang D − − √ for both the uplink
    and downlink, due to the strong self-interference when Tx and Rx are co-located.
    To avoid strong self-interference, our system uses the bistatic setup where transceivers
    are placed separately. Next, we show a numerical analysis of the impact of different
    system parameters on the working range when transceivers are separated by 4 m
    ( ≈ 12 ft). These analysis results help determine the optimal parameter setting
    for different application scenarios. According to (15), the parameters P t , G
    t , G ant , G tag , G r ,λ, P r have a great impact on the working range. In our
    implementation, some parameters are fixed: G tag =−23dB , G t = G r =8dBi , P
    r =−95dBm which is the minimum received power, called receiver sensitivity. Thus,
    we analyze the impact of P t , G ant , and λ on the working range. Coverage area
    under different transmission power P t : Fig. 11 shows that a higher transmission
    power can increase the sensing/working coverage, which is a well-known result.
    However, our new observation is that the maximum working range area is not centered
    at the transmitter like the traditional communication system, since the range
    is still constrained by the receiver as shown in (15). Coverage area under different
    tag antenna gain G ant : Fig. 12 shows that a high gain antenna for the passive
    tag has a great improvement on the sensing coverage area.5 It suggests that the
    tag should be configured with a high-gain antenna to increase the sensing coverage
    area. Coverage area under different frequency bands (i.e., signal wavelength λ
    ): Fig. 13 compares the coverage area of using 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz Wi-Fi bands.
    As we can see, the system has a larger coverage area when using the 2.4 GHz band
    than the 5.8 GHz band. This is because 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signal has a longer wavelength
    which can easily bypass obstacles, helping to increase the sensing range. This
    result indicates that 2.4 GHz band is more suitable for sensing soil moisture
    in the greenhouse scenario. In summary, we have analyzed the maximum working range
    of SoilTAG and identified three key factors (the transmission power, the antenna
    gain of tag, and the signal frequency band) that have a great impact on the working
    range. The analysis provides an important system deployment guide in the real
    world for meeting the working range and coverage requirements. Next, we show how
    to improve the working range of SoilTAG by boosting these three parameters. B.
    Improve The Working Range Based on the above analysis, we improve the working
    range by (i) using the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band, (ii) increasing the transmission power
    via beamforming at the transceiver side [19], [20], and (iii) designing a high
    gain tag antenna. In this section, we focus on the high gain tag antenna design.
    A simple approach is using a commodity high gain antenna such as horn antenna
    RFMAX [61] or employing the large phased-array antenna. However, the commodity
    horn antenna is not only expensive ( ∼ $ 144) for large-scale deployment but also
    hard to be integrated with the resonator. Another approach is using a large phased
    array, but it requires multiple expensive phase shifters and the chip (e.g, FPGA)
    to control the phase setting, which is also infeasible for the battery-free tag.
    To harvest the benefits of high gain and low cost, we choose the printed patch
    array antenna [62], which consists of multiple metal patches printed on the low-cost
    FR4 material substrate. Moreover, the patch array antenna has the advantages of
    easy fabrication, low cost, and flexibility to suit different types of tags. In
    designing the tag antenna for SoilTAG, the key is a trade-off between the gain
    and the geometric size. On one hand, we want to keep the antenna as small as possible.
    On the other hand, a high antenna gain requires many patches, which increases
    the antenna size and the overall cost [49]. Finally, based on our experience,
    we designed a 4×4 patch array antenna for achieving a high gain and a relatively
    small antenna size. Compared with an omnidirectional antenna, it has an improvement
    of ∼ 10 dBi while costing no more than $ 15 based on the manufacturer''s price
    estimation. Fig. 14(a) shows the fabricated patch array antenna with a size of
    31×31 cm 2 . To ensure a good impedance matching state in Wi-Fi band, we measure
    the return loss of the antenna using VNA. Fig. 14(b) shows that the antenna''s
    return loss is lower than -10 dB in 2.3 ∼ 2.7 GHz, demonstrating it has a transmission
    efficiency of over 90% in 2.4 ∼ 2.5 GHz Wi-Fi band. Fig. 14(c) shows the radiation
    pattern of the designed antenna. We can see that it achieves a maximum gain of
    16.8 dBi at 2.45 GHz. In summary, by designing a proper high gain antenna design,
    we can improve the working range of SoilTAG. SECTION V. Implementation SoilTAG
    system consists of three components: the chipless tag, Wi-Fi transceiver, and
    the backend soil moisture estimation software. Next, we present the implementation
    of three components. Chipless tag: The chipless tag is comprised of a DGS resonator
    and two antenna connectors as shown in Fig. 15(a). The chipless resonator is wrapped
    in a waterproof box that can be buried in the soil as shown in Fig. 15(b). To
    produce the resonator, we first design the DGS resonator of the chipless tag by
    the design method proposed in Section III-B. A laminate board consists of two
    copper layers and the dielectric substrate in between. We employ standard PCB
    milling technology to fabricate the 2D layout of the conductive layer on one side
    of the laminate, whereas the back side is directly used as the ground layer. The
    substrate is low-cost FR4 material with a thickness of 1.2 mm. The width of the
    transmission line is 2.24 mm. The two antennas are connected to the DGS resonator
    through two RF cables. To sense soil moisture, the user can bury the chipless
    resonator in the soil at a deep depth while keeping the antenna in the air for
    a long working range. Transceivers: We employ two types of devices as transceivers.
    To implement the beam-forming mechanism, we use the WARP software radio which
    works at 2.4 GHz with 80 MHz spectrum. The transmitter is configured with an 8-antennas
    linear array (Fig. 16(a)) to perform beam scanning and the receiver is configured
    with a 4-antennas linear array (Fig. 16(b)). The beam scanning implementation
    program is the same as our recent work [20]. The transmission power is set at
    lower than 30 dBm. In addition, to show the feasibility of sensing soil moisture
    using commercial Wi-Fi cards (Fig. 16(c)), another kind of transceiver is implemented
    with Intel 5300 NIC as the transmitter and Athero 9580 NIC as the receiver together
    with PicoScenes platform [63]. Backend implementation: Our CSI data processing
    and soil moisture estimation algorithm are implemented in MATLAB and Python code
    respectively. We use a laptop with a 2.3 GHz CPU (Intel i7-10875H) and 16 GB memory
    to run our software. The laptop is connected to WARP radios through a switch and
    Ethernet cables, and they communicate using WARPLab mode [64]. SECTION VI. Evaluation
    A. Experimental Method Definition of the Soil Moisture, Sensing Accuracy and Ground
    Truth: We use the gravimetric water content (GWC%) as the definition of soil moisture,
    which equals the mass of water divided by the mass of dry soil [13]. The sensing
    accuracy is defined as the absolute error between the estimated soil moisture
    and the ground truth. Two methods are used for measuring the ground truth moisture
    of different amounts of soil. Oven-based dry weigh method for a small amount of
    thin soil: In order to acquire the ground truth moisture as accurately as possible,
    we use the oven-based dry weigh method to make the soil samples (Fig. 17). However,
    this method can only deal with a small amount of soil since the whole process
    is complex. Specifically, we need to first dry the soil in the oven and then add
    the exact amount of water to the soil according to the desired soil moisture level.
    Finally, we need to stir it evenly with a stirring rod. Dedicated moisture sensor
    for deep and a large amount of soil: To measure the ground truth moisture of deep
    and a large amount of soil, we use the dedicated soil moisture measurement device
    [42] and also bury our tag close to the dedicated device, as shown in Figs. 18
    and 19. To avoid ground-truth measurement errors, we calibrate the moisture sensor
    using a standard soil calibration setting. We select the organic soil since the
    soil used in experiments was taken from organic farmland. As illustrated in Section
    III-E, we collect the training dataset and test dataset in five environments.
    In all environments, we bring the soil samples into the experiment area to conduct
    testing. To measure the soil moisture at different depths, we punched holes in
    the side of the plastic box and inserted the sensor into the soil. The position
    of the hole is where the tag is placed, which ensures that the soil moisture we
    measure is the soil moisture value sensed by the tag, as shown in Fig. 18. The
    plastic box has a size of 53 cm×40 cm×28 cm (Fig. 18(a)) for evaluating sensing
    accuracy at depths of 5 cm, 15 cm, and 25 cm. The acrylic box has a size of 30cm×30cm×100cm
    (Fig. 18(b)) for evaluating sensing accuracy at depth of 1 m. The experimental
    setup is shown in Fig. 20 where Tx and Rx are placed at 4 m space. Experiment
    Road Map: We first evaluate the overall sensing accuracy of SoilTAG for three
    types of soil. Next, we evaluate the impact of several factors on the sensing
    accuracy in Section VI-C including 1) the effect of the patch array antenna, 2)
    the effect of the beamforming, 3) the impact of tag antenna''s orientation, 4)
    the depth of tag buried into the soil, 5) the impact of Tx-to-Tag distance, 6)
    the impact of human motion around the system, 7) the impact of different ML models,
    and 8) the impact of different environments. Then, we evaluate the sensing accuracy
    using commercial Wi-Fi cards in Section VI-D. Finally, we conduct a case study
    to evaluate the performance of SoilTAG through continuous soil moisture monitoring.
    B. Overall Accuracy of Soil Moisture Sensing We evaluate the sensing accuracy
    of three types of soil – loam soil, clay soil, and sandy soil. The soil samples
    are prepared by the dry weight method, which is shown in Fig. 17. The tag is attached
    to the soil samples’ surface. Note that we test different types of soil with different
    moisture ranges. Because the water absorption capacity of different soil is quite
    different. For example, the water absorption capacity order of the following three
    soil is clay > loam > sand. At a low moisture level, it is hard to make the clay
    soil sample with an even moisture distribution due to its strong water absorption
    capacity. At a high moisture level, the sand soil becomes a mixture of soil and
    water with a lot of liquid. Thus, to avoid the ground truth error for clay and
    sand soil, we set the moisture range of clay soil at 20%–50% and the moisture
    range of the sand soil at 10%–30%. For the loam soil, we set its moisture range
    at 0%–67% due to its relatively good (i.e., medium) water absorption capacity
    which covers the maximum moisture range and more extreme moisture level. Moreover,
    loam soil is the most common type in farms for most plants. Accuracy of Loam Soil:
    For loam soil, we set 30 moisture levels from 0% to 67%. For each soil moisture
    level, we collect 100 data packets and extract the relative frequency response
    features. Then, we input these features into a well-trained regression model to
    estimate the soil moisture. Fig. 21(a) shows the estimated soil moisture value
    and the ground truth. As we can see, the standard deviation estimation error is
    only ± 2%. We compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of estimation
    errors, which is plotted with the red curve in Fig. 21(b). We find that the 90th
    percentile estimation error is 1.9%. Accuracy of Clay Soil and Sand Soil: For
    the two types of soil, we prepare four moisture levels. Fig. 22 plots the mean
    error (marked as the red circle), the maximum absolute error (marked as the gray
    bar), and the standard deviation of errors (marked as the red bar). Fig. 22(a)
    shows the sensing results of clay soil. The standard deviation estimation errors
    are no more than 0.5%. Fig. 22(b) shows the sensing results of sandy soil. The
    STD of errors is no more than 1.65%. In addition, we can see that the absolute
    error at 20% for clay soil and the absolute error at 15% are large, up to 5%.
    The high absolute error comes from occasional abnormal measurements, possibly
    due to experimental operation errors, such as poor contact between the tag and
    the soil, or uneven soil sample moisture. Statistically, the maximum error occurs
    very rarely. Thus the results demonstrate that the designed tag can achieve high
    accuracy in moisture sensing for different types of soil. C. Impact of System
    Parameters and Environment Noise We discuss the improvement of the tag''s high
    gain antenna and beam-forming on the working range, the impact of different system
    parameters (e.g., the tag''s deployment depth and range) and the environmental
    noise (e.g., the moving objects around the setup) on the sensing accuracy. 1)
    Effect of Tag''s Antenna on Working Range To boost the tag''s reflection signal,
    we designed a patch array antenna for the tag shown in Section IV-B. In this experiment,
    we aim to evaluate the effect of patch array antenna on improving the working
    range. Specifically, we compare the patch array antenna against a commodity omnidirectional
    dipole antenna which has a 5 dBi radiation gain. The main beams of the transmitter
    and receiver point to the tag''s two antennas. The Tx-Tag distance changes at
    a step size of 1 m. The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh
    method. Fig. 23(a) reports how the sensing error varies with distance when the
    tag is equipped with the two types of antennas. For the omnidirectional antenna,
    we can see that even within 1 m Tx-Tag distance, the sensing error is more than
    10%. When the Tx-Tag distance is over 3 m, the sensing accuracy gets worse because
    the relative frequency response features are indistinguishable. In contrast, when
    the tag is configured with the patch array antenna, the working range can achieve
    7 m that keeping the estimation error less than 5%. This is because the received
    signal and the reflection signal of the patch array antenna are much stronger
    than that of the omnidirectional antenna. For the omnidirectional antenna, when
    the SNR of tag''s reflection signal gets worse and even reaches the noise floor,
    the obtained relative frequency response will be invalid. 2) Effect of Beamforming
    on Working Range To evaluate the effect of the beamforming mechanism on improving
    the working range, we compare the sensing error with and without the beamforming.
    The tag is configured with the patch array antenna and is placed in front of the
    transmitter''s antenna array ( 0 ∘ direction). The transmitter''s main beam is
    fixed at 0 ∘ direction. The Tx-Tag distance increases from 1 m to 11 m at a step
    of 2 m. The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh method. Fig.
    23(b) reports the sensing error under different Tx-Tag distances. We find that
    in the case without beamforming, the working range where the sensing error keeps
    lower than 5% is about 3 m. In contrast, in the case of using beamforming, the
    working range can reach 9 m. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the
    beamforming in improving the working range. In addition, we find that the sensing
    error also increases with the Tx-Tag distance increasing. The reasons are twofold.
    One is that the received signal strength of the tag gets weaker when moving the
    tag away from Tx. The other is the presence of weak LoS signal leakage from Tx''s
    side lobes to Rx since the beam-nulling can not totally isolate the direct path
    between Tx and Rx. Despite that, the beamforming technique can still improve the
    working range significantly. 3) Impact of Tag Antenna''s Orientation In a real
    deployment, multiple tags are placed around a pair of transceivers. Here we examine
    how the sensing accuracy changes when the tag''s antennas are placed in different
    orientations relative to Tx. We change the orientation of the tag''s antenna relative
    to Tx and measure the frequency responses while fixing the tag''s transmitting
    antenna in 0 ∘ direction relative to Rx. The 0 ∘ indicates that the two antennas
    are facing each other. The directions are set at − 90 ∘ ,− 60 ∘ ,− 30 ∘ , 0 ∘
    , 30 ∘ , 60 ∘ , 90 ∘ . The distance between Tag and Tx is set at 1 m, 3 m, and
    5 m. The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh method. Fig.
    24(a) shows the sensing error under different antenna orientations. By observing
    the two figures, we have two remarks: 1) The sensing error changes with the tag''s
    orientation changes, which is consistent with the beam pattern of the patch array
    antenna. 2) As the distance increases, the sensing errors at 0 ∘ keeps almost
    unchanged while other orientations’ error increase. This is because as the orientation
    of the main beam deviates from the Tx''s main beam and the distance gets farther,
    the received signal strength at the tag decreases while the strength of the noise
    signal remains almost unchanged, i.e., the SNR decreases, resulting in higher
    sensing errors. 4) Impact of The Deployment Range The tags may be deployed at
    various ranges away from the transceivers, which may affect the sensing accuracy.
    Thus, we discuss the impact of a tag''s working range on moisture sensing accuracy.
    The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh method. The transmitter
    and receiver are placed at a separation of 4 meters. We fix the Rx-Tag distance
    and change the Tx-Tag distance from 0.3 m to 13.9 m at a step size of 0.8 m by
    moving the tag''s receiving antenna. At each distance, we collect 500 packets
    for each soil moisture level and calculate estimation errors. Fig. 24(b) shows
    the CDF of moisture estimation errors under different Tx-tag distances. We have
    two observations. First, when the Tx-to-Tag distance is less than 6.7 m, SoilTAG
    achieves high accuracy with the 90th percentile moisture estimation errors of
    1.78%. Second, the sensing accuracy decreases with the increase in distance. Overall,
    SoilTAG still achieves a 90th percentile of sensing error of 8% even when the
    working range is 13.9 m. 5) Impact of The Sensing Depth As illustrated before,
    the root depth of some plants (e.g., trees) can reach over 75 cm. Thus, in practical
    usage, the tag is buried in the soil at a relatively deep location. To evaluate
    the working depth of SoilTAG, we bury tags at depth levels of 5 cm, 15 cm, 25
    cm, and 1 m respectively to measure the sensing accuracy. The tag has a resin
    material coat to prevent it from shorting the circuit by the soil/water, as shown
    in Fig. 15(b). To measure the soil moisture at the depth of 5 cm, 15 cm, and 25
    cm, we use a plastic box full of soil (shown in Fig. 18(a)). To measure the soil
    moisture at the depth of 1 m, we fabricate an acrylic box full of soil, which
    has a size of 30 cm × 30 cm × 100 cm (shown in Fig. 18(b)). Then, we bury a tag
    into the soil at the box''s bottom (1 m depth). The system automatically collects
    data every half an hour. At the same time, we measure the ground truth of soil
    moisture at the four depths using the dedicated sensor. Fig. 24(c) shows the boxplot
    of soil moisture estimation errors at four depth levels. We can see that SoilTAG
    achieves median error of 9.9%, 2.58%, 1.4%, and 2.14% at the depth of 5 cm, 15
    cm, 25 cm, and 1 m respectively. By observing the measurements, we discovered
    that our system''s soil moisture estimate values are rather steady at four depths,
    whereas the sensor''s readings at the depth of 5 cm are lower than SoilTAG''s
    estimation. As a result, the estimation error at a depth of 5 cm seems to be higher
    than 15 cm, 25 cm, and 1 m. The reason is that deep soil moisture is more homogeneous
    and steady. This means that both the tag and the sensor must be in full contact
    with the soil in order to acquire a more accurate soil moisture measurement in
    practice. In addition, by observing the error at depths of 15 cm, 25 cm, and 1
    m, we find there is no correlation between the sensing accuracy and the sensing
    depth. Therefore, this result verifies that SoilTAG can reach 1 m sensing depth,
    showing the potential of SoilTAG to work in a deeper depth. 6) Impact of The Environmental
    Variations In real application scenarios, environmental variations, such as the
    movement of the human body, would cause dynamic multipath, which may result in
    estimation errors. Thus, we evaluate the impact of environmental variations on
    sensing accuracy. To create a dynamic environment, we ask one person to move nearby
    the experiment deployment. The continuous movement results in occasional direct
    signal blockage and dynamic multipath interference which forms a more complex
    real environment. The distance between the moving person and transceivers is within
    0.2 ∼ 1 m, and the person continuously walks around during the data collection
    period. For each soil moisture sample, we collect 2500 packets with and without
    human motion and then calculate the estimation errors. The soil sample is the
    plastic box full of soil (Fig. 18(a)) that is brought into the experiment area.
    The sensing tag is buried at the depth of 15 cm. We inserted the commercial sensor
    probe into the hole on the side of the box and measured the moisture ground truth
    at the tag position. Fig. 24(d) shows the CDF of soil moisture estimation errors
    with and without human motion. Compared with the static environment, the 90th
    estimation error increases from 2% to 8% when there is human motion. Because human
    movement would introduce dynamic interference signals, the direct signal from
    Tx to Rx increases, resulting in the relative frequency response features being
    inaccurate. Thus the estimation error in a dynamic environment is higher than
    that in a static environment. Overall, SoilTAG still achieves 90th percentile
    error of 8% in a dynamic environment. 7) Impact of Different Machine Learning
    Models To analyze the sensing accuracy when using different ML models, we use
    9 ML models to estimate moisture for five environments respectively. Specifically,
    in each environment, the training dataset and the test dataset each accounted
    for half of the total dataset. For each environment, we prepare new soil samples
    using the oven-based dry weigh method and attach the tag to the soil samples’
    surface to measure the frequency responses of each moisture. The experiments are
    carried out with 5 ∘ C ∼ 30 ∘ C air temperature spanning four seasons. In the
    five environments, the Tx-Tag distance is set at 3 m. Fig. 25 shows the sensing
    accuracy results. We find that in all environments, the three models (i.e., Decision
    Tree, XGB, and KNN) perform better than other models. In addition, we also find
    that the XGBoost model performs best in the experiment where two commodity Wi-Fi
    cards are used as the transceiver. The two results show XGBoost model can achieve
    the most accurate estimation result in the five environments, and thus is selected
    as the estimation model for the current system. 8) Impact of Different Types of
    Environments To analyze the impact of different multipath environments on sensing
    accuracy, we take the sensing result of XGBoost model for the five kinds of environments.
    Fig. 26 shows the boxplot of the soil moisture estimation error in the five environments.
    We can see that the median error for all environments is 0%, demonstrating our
    system''s high accuracy in soil moisture sensing. The anechoic chamber achieves
    the lowest sensing error since it is a clean environment without multipath-related
    direction signal leakage and human motion. Except for the anechoic chamber, the
    sensing errors in real scenarios have a slight increase. This is because there
    is static/dynamic multipath-related direct signal leakage from Tx to Rx due to
    the complex multipath or frequent human motions around the experiment area. Despite
    that, the 10th – 90th percentile errors are lower than 2%, implying that SoilTAG
    is suitable for the common soil moisture sensing application scenarios, e.g.,
    the farmland, courtyard, etc. D. Soil Moisture Sensing With Commercial Wi-Fi Card
    To show the feasibility of sensing soil moisture with commodity Wi-Fi cards, we
    conduct this experiment with two Wi-Fi cards (i.e., Intel 5300 as Tx and Athero
    9580 as Rx) and use PicoScenes platform [63] to collect CSI. The two cards’ working
    frequency is tuned in 2.4–2.48 GHz band through a script program to achieve hopping
    channels. We prepare soil samples with 10 moisture levels from 5% to 50% at a
    step size of 5% using oven-based dry weigh method. We collect ∼ 800 frequency
    responses for each soil moisture level. The data collection is conducted twice
    – the first is to collect the training samples and the second is to collect the
    testing samples. To illustrate the relative frequency responses measured by WiFi
    cards, we plot the relative frequency responses of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% in Fig.
    27(a). It is clear that they are distinguishable in 2.4–2.48 GHz. Then, we use
    the ML model to estimate the soil moisture of the testing samples. Finally, we
    compute the sensing accuracy and find the sensing accuracy over 83.8% as shown
    in Fig. 27(b). This result demonstrates that SoilTAG can also work with commodity
    Wi-Fi devices to achieve a high sensing accuracy. E. Case Study: Continuously
    Soil Moisture Monitoring Finally, we conduct a case study to monitor continuous
    changes in soil moisture. We bury the tag into the soil at the depth of 15 cm
    to detect soil moisture because the moisture at this depth does not change too
    fast or too slowly during a long period according to practical experience. The
    tag has a resin material coat to prevent it from shorting circuit by the soil.
    The MATLAB program automatically collects CSI data every half an hour. In order
    to measure the ground truth, we manually measure the soil moisture every half
    an hour using high accuracy commodity sensor. Fig. 28 plots the soil moisture
    in two weeks. The blue line is the ground truth and the red dotted line is the
    estimated value of our system. We can see that there are estimation deviations
    during the long-term monitoring but has the same changing trend as the ground
    truth value. The maximum error is only 2.38% and the mean error is 0.33%. In addition,
    we can see that the ground truth soil moisture decreased by 5.5% from 22.5% to
    17%. Most cheap soil sensors cannot accurately detect such small changes in soil
    moisture. Actually, for some plants, slight soil moisture changes would affect
    their growth. Such application requires a system that is able to detect small
    changes in soil moisture, to tell the farmer to irrigate the plant timely. This
    result demonstrates our system is capable of continuously monitoring soil moisture
    changes on real-world farms. Fig. 25. The soil moisture estimation error when
    using different ML models. Show All Fig. 26. The soil moisture estimation error
    in five environments. Show All Fig. 27. Soil moisture sensing with commodity Wi-Fi
    cards. Show All SECTION VII. Discussion • Calibration cost: SoilTAG exploits the
    relative frequency response to remove the impact of distance. Thus, in real applications,
    we need to collect the reference frequency response of each tag at the deployment
    stage. The user does not need to perform calibration frequently once the devices
    are settled down in an application area. Thus, the calibration cost is low. •
    Working range: The maximum working range of the current SoilTAG is insufficient
    for large open farm fields. Therefore, proper use scenarios are greenhouses or
    indoor vertical farms. To extend the coverage area and apply SoilTAG to large-scale
    farms, a possible solution is to divide the farm into several small areas and
    deploy a pair of transceivers in every area. This solution would enlarge the coverage
    area but at the expense of increasing the overall deployment cost. Fig. 28. Continuously
    soil moisture monitoring. Show All • Work with multi-tags: To work with multiple
    tags, we proposed a spatial direction based tag identification method in the previous
    work [20]. In this work, we employ the same approach as before. Based on this
    method, we can measure the moisture distribution of deep soil at different levels
    by deploying multiple tags at different depths. • Improve the generalizability
    of sensing model: When there are changes in SoilTAG''s deployment setup or the
    RF environment, our machine learning based moisture sensing model needs to be
    retrained for high sensing accuracy in the new setup or the new environment. However,
    the retraining cost of ML models usually is high [65]. To reduce the retraining
    cost, one may improve the generalizability of ML models. For example, one can
    use the transfer learning approach [66] to fine-tune an existing (or pre-trained)
    sensing model for the new setup or the new environment. We will explore this direction
    and improve the generalizability of our moisture sensing model in the future.
    • Make SoilTAG work with the transceiver with a single antenna: In this work,
    the Wi-Fi transceivers used in SoilTAG have multiple antennas and are capable
    of performing digital beamforming. If the transceiver devices have only one antenna,
    they can be configured with the high gain directional antenna to improve radiation
    power. Moreover, a possible self-interference avoidance solution is to make the
    two antennas be polarization orthogonal [67] since the signal goes through a large
    attenuation between two antennas with complete polarization mismatching. • Extend
    SoilTAG to the temperature sensing: In addition to sensing soil moisture level,
    the tag can also be used for sensing temperature. According to the work [68],
    some substrate materials have thermal coefficient of dielectric constant (TCD,
    termed as α ϵ ), which means that the permittivity change ( Δ ϵ r ) of the substrate
    is linearly proportional to temperature changes ( ΔT ) (namely Δ ϵ r / ϵ r = α
    ϵ ∗ΔT ). Therefore, by replacing the current FR4 substrate with other materials
    (e.g., Rogers ), the tag''s resonant frequency and the frequency response feature
    would change with the temperature varying. To verify this feasibility, we fabricated
    a tag with Rogers substrate and measured its frequency responses under different
    temperatures. The results show that the resonant frequency changes by Δf (5.0
    GHz–5.043 GHz) when the temperature changes by ΔT= 9 ∘ C ( 27 ∘ C – 36 ∘ C ).
    By carefully selecting the substrate material, the designed tag can be sensitive
    to a specific temperature range. Therefore, SoilTAG can also be extended to the
    passive temperature sensing application. SECTION VIII. Conclusion This paper presented
    SoilTAG, a chipless Wi-Fi tag based high accuracy, low-cost and in-ground soil
    moisture sensing system. The moisture sensor is a battery-free, passive chipless
    Wi-Fi tag that is low-cost. The key insight of moisture sensing is to convert
    changes in soil moisture level into the frequency response of the tag''s resonator.
    Based on this insight, we designed a DGS-based passive resonator for soil moisture
    sensing and optimized key resonator parameters to increase the frequency response
    sensitivity for sensing even small soil moisture changes. To improve the working
    range, we analyzed the key factors that have impacts on the working range and
    designed a high gain patch array antenna for the tag and realized beam-forming
    at the transceiver side. Extensive experiments show that SoilTAG achieves 90th
    percentile moisture sensing error of 2% , 3.64% , and 8% when the distance between
    the transmitter and the tag is 6 m, 10 m and 13.9 m. The sensing depth can reach
    1 m, covering the root depth of most plants. We believe SoilTAG has promising
    potential for improving the productivity of farm fields and our exploration of
    passive sensor design can enrich other passive sensing applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].
    In order to promote sustainable agriculture, this survey article focuses on cutting-edge
    IoT and sensor applications in smart agriculture. The study also focuses on the
    IoT architecture for smart agriculture as well as the size of the worldwide market

    All things considered, the four-layer IoT architecture for smart agriculture offers
    a reliable and scalable foundation for gathering, processing, and analyzing data
    to enhance farming operations [46], [47], [48]. Farmers may increase efficiency,
    production, and sustainability by utilizing IoT technology, which will enhance
    food security and make the agriculture industry more sustainable. 3. IoT application
    in smart agriculture The IoT has made smart agriculture, which is the most significant
    area for innovation in contemporary agriculture, conceivable. The combination
    of sensors, IoT, and data analytics technologies allows for real-time monitoring
    and management of farming activities, which helps to maximize resource utilization
    and increase crop yields. This section examines some of the most important IoT
    applications in smart agriculture, with a particular emphasis on 1) irrigation
    monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4)
    monitoring (yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing monitoring), forecasting,
    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may
    save time and money. They are the best option for anybody looking to install a
    more ecologically friendly and economical irrigation system since they allow users
    to preserve water resources while enhancing plant health and production [57],
    [58], [59], [60]. 3.2. Fertilizer administration Administration of fertilizers
    based in the realm of smart agriculture, IoT is a crucial application that makes
    use of IoT technology to maximize the usage of fertilizers. With the help of this
    application, farmers will be able to get up-to-the-minute information on the state
    of their soil and its nutrient content, which they can use to modify how much
    and what kind of fertilizer they apply to their crops [61], [63], [65], [67].
    Employing a variety of sensors, like the NPK sensors, temperature sensors, soil
    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling
    crop diseases is an essential part of contemporary agriculture. Illnesses may
    drastically lower agricultural production, costing farmers money and jeopardizing
    the world''s food supply [71]. The overuse of pesticides and other chemicals can
    also have negative environmental impacts, such as polluting water supplies and
    upsetting natural ecosystems [72]. Fortunately, improvements in IoT technology
    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.
    Monitoring, forecasting and harvesting Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely
    used in smart agriculture are shown in Table. 2 name of sensors in column 1, sensor

    of soil NPK sensors can reduce fertilizer waste, enhance crop productivity and
    quality, and prevent nutrient runoff into nearby rivers [66]. Soil Moisture Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Forecasting and Harvesting. Measures the amount
    of water in the soil to determine when and how much to irrigate. These sensors
    may be positioned at various soil depths to monitor the water availability at
    varying depths. Soil moisture sensors can aid in crop growth optimization, water
    conservation, and avoiding overwatering, which can result in nutrient loss and
    soil erosion [19], [102]. Nitrate Sensor Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease
    Detection. Determines the nitrate content of the soil to aid in fertilizer application.
    Growers may alter fertilizer application rates and timing by using nitrate sensors
    to monitor changes in soil nitrogen levels over time. In addition to improving
    crop output and quality, nitrate sensors can assist minimize nitrogen runoff into
    surrounding waterways and decrease fertilizer waste [67], [104]. Soil pH Sensor
    Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease Detection. Determines the soil''s pH level,
    which can aid in enhancing plant nutrient absorption. Growers may modify soil
    amendments and fertilizer application rates by using soil pH sensors to monitor
    variations in soil acidity over time. The use of soil pH sensors can improve crop
    production and quality, reduce nutrient deficits and toxicities, and stop soil
    acidification over time [104]. Electrical Conductivity Sensor Fertilizer Administration,
    Quality Monitoring. Determines the electrical conductivity of water or soil, which
    may be used to check salt and nutrient levels. Adjusting irrigation procedures
    and preventing salt accumulation in soils may both be accomplished with electrical
    conductivity sensors [105]. CO2 Sensor Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the quantity of carbon dioxide in the
    air, which may be used to keep track of plant development and respiration. Growing
    conditions may be improved by adjusting ventilation and lighting systems, which
    can be done with the use of CO2 sensors, which can track changes in CO2 levels
    over time. By adjusting ventilation and illumination as necessary, CO2 sensors
    can assist minimize CO2 buildup, which can result in decreased plant growth and
    productivity. They can also aid in lowering energy use [98]. Temperature and Humidity
    Sensor Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Forecasting and Harvesting, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Monitors environmental
    conditions by taking air temperature and humidity measurements. Extreme temperature
    ranges, high humidity levels, and other environmental variables that may affect
    plant growth and development may all be found with these sensors. Sensors for
    temperature and humidity can be placed in a variety of places, such as outside
    weather stations or within greenhouses. These sensors can aid in improving growth
    conditions, guarding against pests and disease, and lowering energy expenditures
    [98]. Sensor name Sensor application Type of data collect and description Light
    Sensor Quality Monitoring, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the amount
    of light that plants receive, which can aid in maximizing growth and output. These
    sensors can measure the amount of light in different parts of a greenhouse or
    field and may be used to modify lighting or shade arrangements to improve growing
    conditions. By decreasing illumination or shading as necessary, light sensors
    may assist producers in producing high-quality crops with optimal yield and quality
    while also reducing energy use [106]. Weather Station Logistics Monitoring, Forecasting
    and Harvesting. Gathers information on the wind''s direction and speed, the amount
    of rain that has fallen, the barometric pressure, and other weather-related data
    that may be used by farmers to make choices about planting, harvesting, and other
    agricultural tasks. With the use of these sensors, producers can foresee weather-related
    hazards and improve crop management techniques by tracking weather trends over
    time. Weather stations can be set up on a farm or in a particular area and used
    to track regional weather patterns and microclimates [103]. Water Level Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Logistics Monitoring. The level of water in a tank,
    pond, or other body of water can be determined with a water level sensor. In order
    to monitor the water levels in irrigation systems and other bodies of water, water
    level sensors are frequently employed in agriculture [19]. Livestock Sensor Logistics
    Monitoring. Observes the health and conduct of cattle, which can aid in disease
    prevention and maximize output. Animal activity, body temperature, and eating
    habits may all be monitored with livestock sensors, among other parameters. These
    sensors can aid in improving feeding and breeding procedures, reducing animal
    stress, and promoting animal welfare [15]. Plant Disease Sensor Crop Disease Detection
    Analyzes plant tissue or soil samples to look for plant diseases. Plant disease
    sensors can be used to keep an eye out for illness in crops and assist producers
    in taking steps to stop its spread or potential harm [107]. Smoke Sensor Fire
    Detection The smoke sensor calculates how many smoke particles are present in
    the air at any one time, which may signal the existence of a fire. The sensor
    alerts the smart agricultural system when smoke particles are found so that it
    may take the necessary precautions to stop the fire from spreading [99], [100].
    Flame Sensor Fire Detection Using infrared light emission, the flame sensor locates
    fires. The sensor can recognize the infrared radiation that a flame releases when
    it is present. The sensor alerts the smart agricultural system when a flame is
    found so that it may take the necessary steps to stop the fire from spreading
    [99], [100]. Flexible sensor Yield Monitoring. An advanced, flexible, wearable
    sensor called the plant and food quality monitor was created specifically to track
    the quality of plants, fruits, and food. Real-time data collection is made possible
    by its soft and versatile shape, which makes it easy to install easily on the
    surface of various food items and plants without causing any damage [108]. In
    addition, as the world''s population continues to expand, IoT and smart agricultural
    sensors can assist farmers in meeting the rising food demand. Farmers may boost
    productivity while decreasing expenses and environmental effects by implementing
    these technologies. On the other hand, wave-based technologies are rapidly being
    used in industrial applications and smart sensors, due to their efficiency in
    analyzing and processing complex signals [109], [110], [111]. Together, these
    studies highlight the variety of applications for wavelet-based signal processing,
    from denoising and analysis in industrial environments to applications for smart
    sensors and machine learning. Given their versatility and efficiency in processing
    complex signals, wavelet methods are increasingly used in a variety of fields
    as useful tools for industrial processes and current sensor technology. Overall,
    the application of IoT and smart agriculture sensors in the agricultural business
    has the potential to alter the way we grow our food. These technologies can boost
    production and efficiency, and support sustainable farming methods by letting
    farmers gather and evaluate real-time data on numerous environmental conditions.
    This will be essential for supplying the world''s growing population with food
    in the future. 5. The benefits and challenge of IoT in agricultural 5.1. Benefits
    IoT application in agriculture, as in other sectors, provides previously unavailable
    efficiency, resource savings, cost, automation, and data-driven operations. IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture offers a number of noteworthy benefits, including superior efficiency,
    expansion, reduced resources, cleaner method, agility, and also product quality
    improvement. Numerous research papers have looked into the advantages of implementing
    the IoT in intelligent agriculture [30], [60], [112], [113]. As shown in Fig.
    6, the six benefits of the IoT in agriculture, we will discuss each benefit separately
    following: 1) Superior efficiency: Today''s agriculture is competitive. Farmers
    must produce more despite unfavorable soil conditions, diminishing land availability,
    and rising weather whims. Farmers can track their fields and environmental conditions
    in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can generate ideas rapidly,
    foresee issues before they happen, and determine how to avoid them by employing
    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

  description: Our earth has 71% water in which 97% is saline water and in 3% fresh
    water 70% of fresh water is in glacier form, water left for human usage is 30%
    that is less than 1% of total fresh water present on earth. To combat water scarcity
    in summer and to use water wisely in agriculture as it is the highest user of
    fresh water in the world we have done a comparison project between drip irrigation
    and IoT based irrigation. As agriculture uses most of fresh water but the water
    required for plants is much lesser than farmers water their plants, overwatering
    will lead into many problems rather than solution like fertility of soil decreases
    as the nutrients gets washed out, because of that fertility of soil decreases
    and over use of pesticides and fertilizers also degrades soil fertility because
    of that soil dies that is microbes dies, the first step to improve soil fertility
    is proper water management which can be achieved by using IoT that is by using
    Arduino, raspberry pi, solenoids, moisture sensor, temperature sensor and humidity
    sensor and this data can be collected so that it can be used for future farming
    by altering the water supply so that farmers can get good results. This not only
    increases soil fertility but also increases efficiency and decreases water consumption
    which can be used for later usage so the farmers will never face water scarcity.

  explanation: The study focuses on implementing an IoT-based irrigation system for
    small farms to optimize water usage. It employs a network of sensors to gather
    real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant health. This
    data is then used to automate irrigation, reducing water consumption and improving
    soil fertility.

    Split-Screen PDF Share Tools Our earth has 71% water in which 97% is saline water
    and in 3% fresh water 70% of fresh water is in glacier form, water left for human
    usage is 30% that is less than 1% of total fresh water present on earth. To combat
    water scarcity in summer and to use water wisely in agriculture as it is the highest
    user of fresh water in the world we have done a comparison project between drip
    irrigation and IoT based irrigation. As agriculture uses most of fresh water but
    the water required for plants is much lesser than farmers water their plants,
    overwatering will lead into many problems rather than solution like fertility
    of soil decreases as the nutrients gets washed out, because of that fertility
    of soil decreases and over use of pesticides and fertilizers also degrades soil
    fertility because of that soil dies that is microbes dies, the first step to improve
    soil fertility is proper water management which can be achieved by using IoT that
    is by using Arduino, raspberry pi, solenoids, moisture sensor, temperature sensor
    and humidity sensor and this data can be collected so that it can be used for
    future farming by altering the water supply so that farmers can get good results.
    This not only increases soil fertility but also increases efficiency and decreases
    water consumption which can be used for later usage so the farmers will never
    face water scarcity. Topics Soil fertility, Cryosphere, Hydrology, Electromagnetic

  description: An optimized irrigation system maximizes agricultural productivity,
    ensures efficient water use, and reduces off-site effects caused by excess percolation
    of water. To address the problems associated with conventional irrigation systems,
    a drip irrigation system that is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    for automation of irrigation scheduling was developed and tested for Egg Plant
    (Brinjal) crop in vertisols. The study compared crop performance under two different
    drip irrigation systems - one based on IoT and the other based on crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc). An intelligent data collection system, including sensors and a microcontroller
    was used in the experiment to monitor relative humidity, soil temperature, air
    temperature, and soil moisture content. The sensors collect data wirelessly transmitted
    to a cloud server via the IoT, allowing worldwide access from anywhere. The performance
    of the egg plant crop revealed significantly higher plant height and crop yield
    (12.05%) under a drip irrigation system utilizing IoT technology, which could
    be due to the optimum and timely application of water over ETc-based drip irrigation.
    Along with improved crop performance, water savings of 35.2% were observed as
    compared to ETc-based drip irrigation. The developed system can be evaluated in
    a large field with several sensors together along with a mobile app for a user-friendly
    system.

    15 March 2024 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in Brazil
    began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of savanna
    with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques for
    improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm

    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence

    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table

    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in

    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So

  description: Proper water management is crucial for agriculture, as its irrigation
    systems can waste approximately 60% of water. Using IoT for irrigation based on
    soil moisture can help reduce waste. This study used multidimensional time series
    modeling to predict soil moisture using two years of data on a US farm, including
    factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather. The models assessed were
    machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forests,
    Deep Learning's Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN), and Vector Autoregression
    as a reference model. Random Forest was the most efficient and stable model. Furthermore,
    the spectral temporal graph neural network could not outperform the reference
    model. Comparing Random Forest with univariate algorithms like Naive, Exponential
    Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) showed univariate's
    better performance in 9 of 10 datasets, with ARIMA being best in 8. A substantial
    disparity is observed when considering the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    metric. ARIMA yields an MAPE of 0.052, while StemGNN reports 0.127 as the major
    difference. ARIMA achieves a MAPE of 0.046 for the minor difference, whereas StemGNN
    obtains 0.038. In the remaining eight datasets, ARIMA consistently outperforms
    StemGNN by at least 30%. In summary, modern methods could not beat the older methods
    in the study data sets.

  explanation: Soil moisture (SM) forecasting is crucial for irrigation systems to
    provide adequate water volume for cultivation. This study investigates and compares
    univariate and multivariate algorithms for time series prediction of SM. The results
    show that multivariate time series models did not outperform the simpler univariate
    models in predicting SM. The study concludes that using exogenous variables had
    low predictive value in the SM series data sets evaluated in the study, and that
    there is a need for further investigation of methods for creating variables based
    on original bases.

    Commons license open access Abstract Proper water management is crucial for agriculture,
    as its irrigation systems can waste approximately 60% of water. Using IoT for
    irrigation based on soil moisture can help reduce waste. This study used multidimensional
    time series modeling to predict soil moisture using two years of data on a US
    farm, including factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather. The models
    assessed were machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random
    Forests, Deep Learning''s Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN), and
    Vector Autoregression as a reference model. Random Forest was the most efficient
    and stable model. Furthermore, the spectral temporal graph neural network could
    not outperform the reference model. Comparing Random Forest with univariate algorithms
    like Naive, Exponential Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
    (ARIMA) showed univariate''s better performance in 9 of 10 datasets, with ARIMA
    being best in 8. A substantial disparity is observed when considering the Mean
    Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric. ARIMA yields an MAPE of 0.052, while
    StemGNN reports 0.127 as the major difference. ARIMA achieves a MAPE of 0.046
    for the minor difference, whereas StemGNN obtains 0.038. In the remaining eight
    datasets, ARIMA consistently outperforms StemGNN by at least 30%. In summary,
    modern methods could not beat the older methods in the study data sets. Previous

    approximately 65 billion cubic meters of water, 50% of this water used for irrigation.1
    However, up to 60% of irrigation water is wasted due to inefficient irrigation
    practices [1]. With the expansion of agriculture and the growing risk of water
    shortages, the development of new irrigation strategies to avoid water waste is
    becoming increasingly important. Technology can play a vital role in addressing
    this challenge by creating efficient irrigation water management systems. An example
    is the Smart Water Management Platform (SWAMP) project, which used intelligent
    tools to manage irrigation plans. The SWAMP platform leverages technologies such
    as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and data science to offer farmers
    an intelligent strategy to monitor and plan irrigation schedules. The fields can
    be monitored by sensors and drones connected to a management system that receives
    real-time data. All data are processed and stored in the cloud, and historical
    data is used to train forecasting models that predict soil moisture (SM). The
    predictions generated by the models provide valuable information for farmers in
    planning irrigation schedules [2], [3]. Similarly, Amarendra Goap, Deepak Sharma,
    and their team have developed a fully autonomous irrigation system that combines
    IoT, cloud computing, and data science to predict SM levels in real time [4].
    The intelligent system collects data from soil sensors, air, and light radiation
    and uses machine learning models to forecast SM. The output of the model feeds
    into a decision system to control field irrigation. Furthermore, time series forecasting
    has proven applicable in various problem domains in recent years. For example,
    Yassen et al. [5] used time series prediction to predict water flow in Malaysia.
    Their study aimed to improve water management to ensure drinking water for citizens
    and energy production. Sezer, Gudelek, and Ozbayoglu [6] systematically reviewed
    the literature on studies that used time series forecasting to model financial
    time series. These studies applied machine learning and deep learning models to
    predict commodity values such as oil, coffee, and sugar and the values of company
    shares, currencies, and digital coins. Furthermore, Ediger and Akar [7] used time
    series forecasting to model fuel demand in Turkey. On the contrary, Barak and
    Sadegh [8] proposed to model annual energy consumption in Iran using time series
    forecasting. In both studies, the researchers aimed to predict the need for energy
    resources for government planning. Efficient irrigation is essential to ensure
    better water management and the continuity of agricultural production. Esfahani,
    Rua, and McKee [9] described how efficient irrigation prevents soil leaching and
    crop stress from excess water, thus ensuring productive capacity during water
    scarcity. Estimating the future value of the SM variable is essential for irrigation
    planning to ensure adequate water volume for cultivation. Typically, physical
    models that simulate the dynamics of water in the soil over time generate estimates
    for the SM variable [10]. These models require knowledge of soil properties to
    effectively simulate water dynamics in the soil [11]. Furthermore, the evapotranspiration
    of soil water, irrigation, precipitation, and transpiration of the cultivated
    plant are essential factors in estimating the variable SM [12]. There are various
    tools for generating SM estimates using physical models, with HYDRUS software
    being one of the most widely used [13].” A drawback is that obtaining all the
    calibration data from the HYDRUS software can be challenging. Thus, alternative
    approaches, such as time series forecasting with machine learning and deep learning,
    are being explored. Karandish and Simunek [14] compared various time series forecasting
    algorithms to predict SM, using the output model to feed a system that creates
    the irrigation schedule. Esfahani, Rua, and McKee [9] combined machine learning
    and sensor data to create an optimization system for the irrigation process. In
    their work, Goap and Sharma [15] used a regression model to forecast SM. The regression
    model output was then classified using a cluster model to generate a binary output,
    which determined whether to continue the irrigation process. Goldstein and Fink
    [16] utilized machine learning algorithms to predict SM time series, and the resulting
    predictions were used to plan the weekly irrigation strategy. Accurate SM forecasting
    is crucial for intelligent platforms and fully autonomous irrigation systems to
    generate information on irrigation schedules [17]. Applying time series modeling
    for soil moisture forecasting requires careful consideration of many technical
    details. These include the selection of appropriate models, the choice of input
    and window lag variables, and the optimization of parameters. Additionally, the
    accuracy of the forecasts must be evaluated to ensure that the model performs
    as expected. This paper proposes time series modeling of SM data and investigates
    the performance of univariate and multivariate algorithms for forecasting SM.
    Our experiments aim to explore the influence of data window size on algorithm
    performance and compare the performance of traditional algorithms with modern
    ones. We investigate the ideal sample data size required to build an efficient
    model, considering different scenarios of data availability ranging from one to
    twelve months or more. We also examine the impact of updating the fitting model
    on the prediction performance. Finally, we compare the performance of univariate
    and multivariate algorithms in ten datasets from various regions of the world.
    Our goal is to provide information on the performance of different SM forecasting
    algorithms and to identify the most efficient algorithms for this task. 2. Background
    This section presents the background of our research. 2.1. Soil moisture The target
    variable in this study is SM, which represents the amount of water content in
    a soil volume ( ) [18]. The study focuses on investigating the capability of machine
    learning algorithms to forecast future SM values, which is essential to create
    an efficient irrigation schedule. 2.2. Forecasting algorithms We used statistical
    and machine learning algorithms to analyze the SM forecast. Statistical algorithms
    included Naive [19], Vector Autoregression (VAR) [20], Exponential Smoothing (ES)
    [19], and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [21]. The naive method
    predicts the value of the future series as the last known observation [19]. ES
    predicts future values using weighted averages that exponentially prioritize recent
    samples, assigning them higher weights [19]. The VAR model predicts the future
    value of a series as a linear combination of past values of the target series
    and the series that influence it [20]. On the other hand, the machine learning
    algorithms consisted of Random Forest (RF) [22], Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
    [23], Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting
    (N-BEATS) [24], and Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time
    Series Forecasting (StemGNN) [25]. RF is an ensemble technique derived from bagging.
    RF comprises n predictors built using decision trees. It distinguishes itself
    from bagging by introducing random variable selection during predictor construction.
    It enables the algorithm to be trained with diverse input sets, reducing predictor
    variance and improving the accuracy of the final prediction [22]. XGB is a Gradient
    Boosting Machines implementation that incorporates decision trees as weak predictors
    and includes regularization in the cost function to prevent overfitting during
    training [23], [26], [27]. The N-BEATS architecture for univariate time series
    prediction consists of M stacks, which function as an ensemble model similar to
    boosting. Each stack specializes in predicting the residual of the previous stack.
    Stacks are made up of K blocks, which operate similarly. Each block predicts the
    residual of the previous block and comprises two parts: a fully connected neural
    network (FC) with four layers and two single-layer FC neural networks [24]. The
    StemGNN combines Graph Discrete Fourier Transform (GDFT), Discrete Fourier Transform
    (TFD), and deep learning components. StemGNN transforms multivariate time series
    into a multivariate temporal graph in the first layer. It uses a Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) layer to calculate the adjacency matrix W for series computation and
    self-attention. The second layer, StemGNN, involves a GDFT transformation, followed
    by a sequence of operations. It includes TFD, 1D CNN, Gated Linear Unit (GLU),
    and the inverse Fourier transform to capture intraseries patterns. The spectral
    matrix is filtered through a graph-convolutional neural network. The output consists
    of future value predictions and input series reconstruction. The loss function
    optimizes the network parameters by minimizing prediction and reconstruction errors.
    We have designated the Naive and ES models as the univariate baseline and the
    VAR model as the multivariate baseline. We selected the well-known ARIMA algorithm
    [28], [29], [30], [31] to provide a benchmark for statistical time series forecasting.
    We selected N-BEATS, a state-of-the-art algorithm that has demonstrated exceptional
    performance in time series forecasting [24] for deep learning models. To investigate
    decision tree-based models for multivariate time series forecasting, we selected
    RF [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] and XGB [40], which represent
    ensemble bagging [41] and boosting [40] based on decision tree models, respectively.
    Finally, we explore StemGNN, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm, as a representative
    for multivariate time series forecasting [25]. 2.3. Data description Throughout
    the work, we used a set of datasets to investigate SM forecasting using various
    algorithms. The Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) [42] data set was the result of the Long-Term
    Agroecosystem Research Group (LTAR), which consists of researchers associated
    with Washington State University who monitor the soil of an agricultural cultivation
    farm [43]. We also collected nine data sets from the International Soil Moisture
    Network (ISMN) project, an international collaborative initiative to store and
    make available SM records collected from soil monitoring sites worldwide [44].
    Our research comprises two sets of experiments to compare the performance of multivariate
    and univariate algorithms. In the first group of experiments, we focused on evaluating
    the influence of data window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms
    using the CAF dataset. The CAF data set comprises data from 42 sensors installed
    on a farm, divided into 42 zones, each monitored by one sensor. Each sensor records
    SM, temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity at five depths: 0.3, 0.6, 0.9,
    1.2, and 1.5 meters. Additionally, the data set includes daily temperature and
    rainfall data from the nearest meteorological station. Therefore, three new features
    were added to the data set: daily precipitation, maximum daily temperature, and
    minimum daily temperature. The data set contains daily measurements for two years.
    For our experiments, we selected the data generated by the CAF095 sensor and used
    SM, soil temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity from depths of 0.3, 0.6,
    and 0.9 meters. Therefore, our final data set consisted of nine soil features
    and three meteorological features. The second group of experiments focused on
    comparing the performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms on SM forecasts.
    For this purpose, we used ten data sets from different regions worldwide, including
    the CAF data set from the first group. We obtained the other nine data sets from
    the ISMN project, a global initiative that stores and provides access to data
    sets that contain SM records [44]. The ISMN partners monitor SM levels around
    the world and make the data available in the cloud. Table 1 shows the details
    of the location of the data set. Each station monitored air and soil using sensors
    and registered a feature group, generating each data set. Table 2 presents a comprehensive
    list of feature names, corresponding abbreviations, and accompanying descriptions.
    Meanwhile, Table 3 offers an overview of the constituent features of each dataset.

    in terms of the features they included. We selected SM, temperature, precipitation,
    and air temperature as our main features. In some cases, the sensors generated
    SM and soil temperature readings at different depths, and we used both whenever
    possible. We selected two years for each time series and grouped the hourly data
    into daily values using the trimmed mean at 80%. Our study highlights the importance
    of data window size in multivariate algorithms and sheds light on the performance
    of multivariate versus univariate algorithms for SM forecasting. Our results have
    implications for the design and development of future forecasting models in this
    field. 2.4. Performance measures Throughout this work, we used some metrics to
    measure the efficiency of our algorithms in forecasting SM. Our time series consists
    of daily values, so we aim to predict the next day''s value. To compare the performance
    of our algorithms, we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE), and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Using time series
    data from different locations throughout the world, we chose MAPE to compare the
    performance of the algorithm across different data ranges. In addition, we used
    RMSE and MAE to evaluate the impact of outliers on the forecast. While the former
    imposes a higher penalty for larger errors, the latter does not. Therefore, we
    use both metrics to analyze the effect of outliers on our forecasts. 3. Methodology
    The methodology used in our study consists of three scenarios designed to address
    key research questions. In the first scenario, we conducted seven experiments,
    each with varying training window size, to assess their impact on the performance
    of multivariate algorithms. We also evaluated the prediction stability over a
    year for each training configuration. Scenario two mirrored scenario one but with
    a reduced fitting frequency for multivariate algorithms, conducted every 15 days
    instead of 30. It allowed us to investigate the impact of the fitting frequency
    for model updating. In scenario three, we performed ten experiments comparing
    the best performing multivariate algorithm from scenarios one and two with univariate
    algorithms across ten diverse datasets from different geographical locations,
    providing insight into multivariate algorithm performance relative to univariate
    counterparts. The research questions were as follows. • How does the size of the
    training window influence the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the
    frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency?
    • Does the multivariate algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? We conducted
    seven experiments in scenario one to gain insight into the first research question.
    For each experiment, we defined a different training window to compare the impact
    of the training window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms. Additionally,
    we analyzed the performance of each multivariate algorithm over a year to assess
    the prediction stability of each training configuration. For scenario two, we
    conducted seven experiments identical to scenario one, but with a lower frequency
    of fitting of the multivariate algorithms. Specifically, the algorithms were fitted
    in scenario two every 15 days, compared to every 30 days in scenario one. This
    strategy allowed us to investigate whether the frequency of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms impacted their performance. Finally, in scenario three, we performed
    ten experiments that generated results to discuss the fourth question. We selected
    the multivariate algorithm with the best performance in scenarios one and two
    experiments and compared it with univariate algorithms. We considered ten datasets
    from different geographical points for the comparative study. Thus, we obtained
    results to discuss the performance of the multivariate algorithm compared to the
    univariate algorithms. 3.1. Scenario one In scenario one, we utilized the CAF
    dataset, as described in section 2.3. The target variable was the SM at a depth
    of 0.3m. The data set was divided into two periods of one year, with the first
    period used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models and the second period
    used for validation. For the training stage in scenario one, we used a sliding
    window format over the first data period, with the test dataset defined as 25%
    of the size of the training dataset. The training window was slid across the first
    year''s data, with one-third of the training dataset data updated in each iteration.
    We recorded the optimized hyperparameters and the predicted and test series for
    each training cycle to calculate performance metrics. During hyperparameter selection,
    we stored the model with the best performance per iteration of the experiment
    and grouped the hyperparameters into discrete and continuous categories. The discrete
    hyperparameters with the highest frequency were selected in the iterations of
    each experiment, whereas the mean was used for the continuous hyperparameters.
    Performance was used as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter selection. Experiments
    six and seven were exceptions to the described process. In both cases, the training
    window was one year, the training data set defined as 80% of the data and the
    test data set as 20%. After selecting the hyperparameters, we fitted the models
    using the entire available data set in the first period. During the validation
    stage, we did not perform hyperparameter optimization. Instead, we utilized the
    hyperparameters selected in the training stage and fitted the algorithms using
    the data window of the period prior to the prediction. For each day''s prediction,
    we used data from the previous days and, after 30 days, we fitted the model again.
    We recorded the predicted series values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation
    metrics. Experiment seven was an exception to the previously described process,
    with the training window not sliding. After predicting the first month of the
    validation dataset, we added the data to the training data set and used the entire
    period for algorithm fitting. 3.2. Scenario two In scenario two, except for the
    prediction step, we replicated the experiments conducted in section 3.1. Specifically,
    we conducted seven experiments to evaluate the impact of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms every 15 days compared to every 30 days in scenario one. We used the
    same data set in scenario one for each experiment and the same methodology for
    hyperparameter optimization and performance evaluation. The only difference was
    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithms, done every 15 days in scenario
    two. For prediction, we make forecasts one day ahead for the next 15 days. The
    primary goal of scenario two was to investigate the effect of the frequency of
    fitting of the models on their performance. 3.3. Scenario three In scenario three,
    we selected the multivariate algorithm that demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two and conducted ten experiments. Next, we compare the performance
    of the selected algorithm with the univariate algorithms using ten data sets from
    various geographical points. The results allowed us to evaluate the performance
    of the multivariate algorithm against the univariate algorithms at different locations.
    Section 2.3 describes the data sets used in the experiments. We used the results
    from scenarios one and two to design the experiment plan for scenario three. We
    selected the modeling arrangement in which the algorithms evaluated in the previous
    scenarios presented the best performance. We began the experiment by selecting
    the original data sets, from which we chose samples for two years. Next, we selected
    the algorithms evaluated in the comparative study, which included the RF multivariate
    algorithm that outperformed the other algorithms evaluated in scenarios one and
    two. We also selected four univariate algorithms, including three traditional
    statistical methods: Naive, ES, and ARIMA. The fourth univariate algorithm selected
    was the N-BEATS neural network architecture. We divided the data samples in scenario
    three into two periods of one year. We used the first period to optimize the hyperparameters
    of the algorithms, and we used data from the second period to validate the results.
    The experiments in this scenario compared the performance of the univariate algorithms
    with the multivariate RF algorithm, which had achieved the best performance in
    the previous scenarios. During the training stage of the experiments in scenario
    three, we optimized the hyperparameters of the RF and N-BEATS algorithms. The
    other algorithms evaluated at this stage of the study did not require optimization
    due to the nature of the algorithms. We used the same strategy as in experiments
    six and seven of the previous scenarios, using a training window of one year.
    The training base was defined with 80% of the sample data and the test base with
    20%. Once the hyperparameters were selected, we fitted the algorithms using one
    year for the validation stage. To select hyperparameters, we stored the model
    with the best performance per iteration of the experiment. We grouped the hyperparameters
    into discrete and continuous ones, selecting the discrete hyperparameters with
    the highest frequency in the iterations of each experiment. We use the mean to
    select continuous hyperparameters, with performance as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter
    selection. We did not optimize the hyperparameter during the validation stage
    using the hyperparameters selected in the previous step. However, we calibrated
    the algorithms using the entire available data period. The strategy was similar
    to experiment seven of the previous scenarios, using a daily aggregation window
    strategy before prediction and performing algorithm calibration with all available
    historical data. By expanding the daily training base, the model would have accessed
    the most significant sample variability. Finally, we recorded the predicted series
    values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation metrics. 4. Results and
    discussion This section discusses project questions based on the experiment results.
    4.1. How does the size of the training window influence the performance of multivariate
    algorithms? To investigate the first design question, we developed seven configurations
    of training windows, namely, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and annual.
    The annual window was used in two configurations, as explained in 3.1. Fig. 1
    presents the MAPE performance graph per experiment for all algorithms evaluated
    in scenarios one and two. The training windows successively increase from the
    first to the last experiment. There was no direct relationship between performance
    and an increase in the training window. The VAR algorithm in scenario one improved
    performance from the first to the second experiment, but the performance decreased
    from the second to the third one. The StemGNN algorithm showed continuous worsening
    from the first to the fifth experiment and has improved in the last. RF achieved
    similar results in experiments one to four, worsened in experiment five, and improved
    in experiments six and seven. The XGB algorithm presented regular results from
    the first to the fifth experiment and improved performance in experiments six
    and seven. Therefore, increasing the training window did not guarantee better
    algorithm performance. However, the results revealed that a one-year or longer
    window applied to experiments six and seven significantly improved the performance
    of all algorithms. Evidence found to explain the better performance referred to
    the periodic behavior of the series of CAF data sets. Table 4, Table 5, Table

    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence prediction efficiency?
    To investigate the second research question, we separated the fit algorithm frequency
    in experiments conducted in scenarios one and two. In scenario one, we split the
    validation step into 12 parts and predicted 30 observations continuously. Subsequently,
    we added the predicted observations to the training base and refitted the models.
    We repeated a similar configuration for scenario two, but with a prediction period
    of 15 observations. We present all the result metrics for each experiment in both
    scenarios in Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7. Fig. 1, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 present
    the results of the experiments in each scenario, with scenario one illustrated
    in blue and scenario two in orange. We presented the results of the MAE, RMSE
    and MAPE metrics. In all three metrics, reducing the calibration period improved
    the algorithms'' performance, except for experiment six of the StemGNN algorithm,
    which showed worsened performance for all analyzed metrics in scenario two compared
    to scenario one. Moreover, in experiment seven, we observed that the RMSE and
    MAE obtained for the XGB algorithm achieved slightly lower performance in scenario
    two. Therefore, the frequent calibration strategy generally resulted in better
    performance of the algorithms explored in the study. Download : Download high-res

    To address the third research question, we analyzed the results obtained from
    the experiments conducted in scenario three. Our objective was to compare the
    performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms in forecasting SM. For this
    comparison, we chose the RF algorithm, which demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two. We evaluated and compared the performance of four univariate
    algorithms: ARIMA, N-BEATS, ES, and Naive. Table 8 presents all the algorithms
    evaluated. We conducted ten experiments using different datasets, and the target

    CAF Interestingly, the RF algorithm could not outperform the Naive method in nine
    out of ten experiments. In particular, Naive, one of the simplest methods available,
    outperformed the RF algorithm in most experiments. The results suggest that the
    components registered in data sets containing SM series did not add predictive
    capacity to multivariate methods. The N-BEATS algorithm could not outperform the
    ES, Naive, and ARIMA algorithms in most experiments. These findings highlight
    the difficulty of modern methods in surpassing straightforward but practical approaches,
    at least with regard to the data sets used in this work. 5. Conclusions Through
    the investigation of SM prediction, we modeled the problem as a univariate and
    multivariate time series prediction problem, conducting a total of 28 experiments
    to answer three design questions: • How does the size of the training window influence
    the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the frequency of fitting the
    multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency? • Does the multivariate
    algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? In the first scenario, we performed
    seven experiments to generate results for discussing the first question. These
    experiments evaluated the performance of four multivariate algorithms (VAR, StemGNN,
    RF, and XGB) for the prediction of SM. We designed the experiments with seven
    modeling strategies that varied the configuration of the training sample size,
    using monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual samples. We used the
    results to investigate the effect of sample size on algorithm performance. We
    used scenario two to investigate the importance of recurrent fitting of the models.
    We conducted seven experiments similar to scenario one, with the only difference
    being the validation step, in which we fitted the models every 15 days. We compared
    the results of the experiments in scenario two with those of scenario one to answer
    the second question of the project. In scenario three, we designed ten experiments
    to compare the prediction performance of a multivariate algorithm with that of
    univariate algorithms, generating results to discuss the third question of the
    project. Based on the results of scenarios one and two, we selected the RF algorithm
    as the most efficient among the multivariate solutions evaluated in the study.
    We then compared its performance with the ARIMA, Naive, ES, and NBEATS algorithms.
    We considered ten datasets from different geographical points for the comparative
    study, enabling us to evaluate the algorithms'' performance in predicting SM under
    different exogenous conditions. In conclusion, we could answer all the questions
    posed in the study. Models with higher predictive capacity were obtained using
    data samples with more records, whereas shorter-period training samples resulted
    in unreliable and unstable models. Our experiments demonstrated that the multivariate
    RF and XGB methods outperformed the StemGNN neural network and the VAR method.
    These results are consistent with the findings of the M5 competition [38], which
    indicated that machine learning methods were more effective than traditional statistical
    methods and neural network architectures. Furthermore, our comparison between
    univariate methods and the RF algorithm showed that univariate approaches were
    more efficient in predicting SM. Our results suggested that exogenous variables
    had little predictive value in the SM series data sets. However, it remains to
    be investigated to what extent exogenous variables affected the performance of
    multivariate methods. When compared to Naive, the RF algorithm''s low performance
    could be attributed to exogenous series that only added noise and made it difficult
    to predict the RF algorithm. Our experiments showed that deep learning methods
    did not outperform the traditional methods evaluated. This finding is similar
    to that presented in [52], which showed that neural network architectures must
    be improved to be superior to traditional methods for predicting time series.
    In future work, we suggest exploring additional techniques for creating variables
    based on the original bases to advance the understanding of multivariate time
    series modeling. In the current study, we only added a series of variables delayed
    by one, two, and three days. Adding more variables could increase the predictive
    capacity of multivariate methods. Furthermore, the low performance of the RF algorithm
    compared to the univariate methods suggests that exogenous variables may have
    a low predictive value. For future work, it would be interesting to investigate
    the importance of each variable for multivariate methods and determine whether
    exogenous variables positively affect or not the methods'' performance. Regarding
    the modeling strategy, we did not explore optimization of the parameters of machine
    learning and deep learning algorithms with frequent periodicity. Additionally,
    we recommend incorporating the data component as an attribute in the training
    strategy. For example, the model could be trained using monthly windows, with
    data from January used to predict the series for January of the following year.
    Similarly, for a semester window, the algorithm could be trained using data from
    the first semester of a year to predict the first semester of the following year.
    It would also be valuable to investigate the prediction of periods longer than
    one day. Using the SM variable for windows larger than one day is typical in irrigation.
    Therefore, understanding algorithms'' behavior when predicting larger windows
    would be significant. We limited the experiments to evaluate the prediction of
    SM at an exact value. However, in the irrigation problem domain, it is essential
    to maintain the moisture concentration within a range in the soil volume where
    the crop root is located. The health of the crop depends on the respect of the
    upper and lower limits of the moisture concentration range. Therefore, future
    studies could investigate strategies to predict the volume of water necessary
    to maintain an adequate concentration for each crop category. In this study, we
    compared the performance of different algorithms for predicting SM, but we did
    not explore traditional physical models that simulate soil water dynamics over
    time. Comparing the performance of different algorithms with traditional physical
    models to predict SM would be of great value. Moreover, we could design hybrid
    solutions to achieve better performance in SM prediction. Declaration of Competing

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res
    image (352KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Circuit diagram of the
    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table
    3. Capacitive soil moisture sensor accuracy. Deep level Capacitive soil moisture
    sensor Gouevn soil moisture meter Difference value Error (%) 25 ml 45 % 50 % 5
    10 50 ml 62 % 65 % 3 4,62 75 ml 79 % 80 % 1 1,25 100 ml 93 % 90 % 3 3,34 Average
    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    techniques. Table 6 illustrates differences across various aspects of each study,
    including objectives and developed features. While all the studies in this section
    share the goal of enhancing environmental quality in mushroom crops, each focuses
    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and
    user-feedback applications on the job. Table 6. Features comparison between the

    Some studies delve deeper, incorporating additional sensors for monitoring soil
    moisture, carbon dioxide levels, light intensity, and even climate factors like
    wind and air. The diversity extends to the forms of technology communication and
    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.
    Method Number of managed vital parameters Number of actuating tools Ability to
    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Soil moisture, also referred to as soil water content, is a crucial
    geophysical state variable in various fields, including agriculture, hydrology,
    meteorology, and remote sensing calibration/validation (cal/val). Therefore, accurate
    measurements of in situ soil moisture are essential to ensure the improved modeling
    of geophysical processes, perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for
    societal benefits. There are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the gravimetric
    method of soil moisture measurement is the most accurate, however, it is not suitable
    for real-time or large-scale field studies due to labor- and time-intensive procedures.
    In other words, the gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not
    very feasible for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large number
    of in-situ observations are needed frequently as well as for validation of the
    remote sensing-based products that require sampling in a narrow time window during
    satellite passes. Hence, alternative modern methods like electronic sensors that
    measure soil moisture instantly are necessary for such applications. Since soil
    moisture sensors usually operate on the principle of dielectric characterization
    of the soil and water and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture,
    these sensors require appropriate calibration for precise measurements. Although
    various procedures for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors are available
    in the scientific literature, factors affecting calibration, the technical complexity
    of calibration, and lack of confidence in their effectiveness limits their use
    in field studies. In this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration
    protocols has been conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and limitations
    of various calibration methods and approaches for dielectric permittivity-based
    soil moisture sensors. The importance of selecting an appropriate calibration
    method based on the sensor type, soil type, and environmental conditions is highlighted
    in this review. We also examine various calibration methods, including traditional
    equations based on linear or polynomial regression and advanced methods such as
    the nonlinear approach (i.e., artificial neural network). The need for regular
    calibration and maintenance of soil moisture sensors to ensure accurate and reliable
    data is also emphasized. The review concludes by providing recommendations for
    selecting the appropriate calibration method/approach for dielectric soil moisture
    sensors to achieve the required accuracy and future directions. Overall, this
    review provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field
    of dielectric sensor-based soil moisture monitoring and management.

  explanation: Soil moisture measurements are made using probes like TDR and capacitance
    sensors. They measure soil dielectric permittivity, which depends on the amount
    of water present in the soil. Soil dielectric permittivity and volumetric water
    content are related through a calibration curve. The calibration of a soil moisture
    sensor involves comparing sensor output to the measured soil moisture content.
    Various calibration techniques like laboratory calibration and field calibration,
    as well as different approaches like linear and nonlinear calibration, have been
    developed and discussed. The specific calibration method used depends on factors
    such as the type of sensor, soil type, accuracy requirement, cost, and intended
    use of the measurements.

    (FDR) 1. Introduction Accurate measurement of soil moisture is crucial in various
    hydrological, agricultural, and remote sensing applications (Chen and Or, 2006,
    Lamaoui et al., 2018, Robinson et al., 2008, Rosenzweig et al., 2014). It determines
    crop water needs (Dong et al., 2020) and affects crop growth (Mane and Kadam,
    2021). Surface soil moisture (∼5 cm) significantly impacts rainfall-runoff relationship
    (Brocca et al., 2017, Mohanty et al., 2000, Pan, 2012, Rowlandson et al., 2013)
    and plays role in drought, floods, groundwater recharge, and water management
    (Robinson et al., 2008; Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014, Vereecken et al., 2014). These
    applications rely on soil moisture’s influence on various atmospheric processes,
    affecting hydrology, weather predication and agriculture (Lal et al., 2023, Seneviratne
    et al., 2010, Vargas Zeppetello et al., 2019). Understanding these interactions
    informs decisions on water resources, drought and flood mitigation and land use
    practices. Though soil moisture is an important hydrological state variable for
    various applications, these applications require soil moisture measurements at
    different spatial scales i.e., point- (for soil moisture monitoring stations),
    field- (such as farms), watershed-, and regional-scale. Fairly accurate soil moisture
    measurement at various spatial scales is essential to fulfilling the technical
    requirements of applications such as initializing the state, data assimilation,
    optimization of model parameters, and validation of model outputs (Lal et al.,
    2022). However, obtaining the soil moisture value (average) at a particular spatial
    scale beside the point-scale is no trivial task. As spatial evolution of soil
    moisture across scales depend on the soil texture, vegetation, terrain, and variability
    in precipitation (Pan and Wang, 2009, Yao et al., 2012). Thus, conducting in-situ
    soil moisture measurements at various locations within the chosen scale is necessary
    to obtain an accurate estimate of average soil moisture. The conventional approach
    of soil moisture measurement i.e., gravimetric sampling is the most precise in-situ
    method (Gardner, 2018), but not feasible to extend measurements at watershed-/regional-scale
    (Singh et al., 2019) and real-time continuous measurements at point-/field-scale
    (Mukhlisin et al., 2021, Mwale et al., 2005). Hence, there is a need for alternatives
    to gravimetric sampling, providing precise, spatially distributed in-situ soil
    moisture measurements over large regions with less time and effort to support
    various applications and validate remote sensing data. Over the past decade, the
    use of sensor-based techniques, for indirect measurement of soil moisture, has
    increased significantly (Yin et al., 2021). Various commercial sensors, including
    neutron, electromagnetic, tensiometry, and hygrometry types, have revolutionized
    soil moisture measurement (Gorthi et al., 2020, Nagahage et al., 2019; Susha Lekshmi
    et al., 2014). Electromagnetic sensors, like Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR),
    Transmission Line Oscillator (TLO), Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR), and
    Capacitance-based sensor are popular due to their simplicity and efficient data
    handling (Barkunan et al., 2019, Soulis et al., 2015, Spelman et al., 2013). These
    sensors typically measure soil dielectric permittivity, indirectly estimating
    volumetric water content (VWC) by assessing electrical conductivity or charge-storage
    capacity or travel time. Calibration is a crucial process that involves adjustment
    of the sensor readings to account for the specific conditions and properties of
    the soil to provide accurate and consistent soil moisture readings (Bogena et
    al., 2007, Spelman et al., 2013). For example, soils with higher clay content
    typically exhibit higher electrical conductivity, whereas soils with higher sand
    content often display lower electrical conductivity (Heil and Schmidhalter, 2012,
    Stadler et al., 2015). This difference can significantly affect accuracy of soil
    moisture sensors, especially those operating at lower frequencies, up to 150 MHz
    (Kizito et al. 2008a). Hence, the development of a robust calibration for a dielectric
    principle-based sensor is crucial to consider the frequency of the sensor and
    the type of soil where measurement needs to be carried out (Baumhardt et al.,
    2000, Bogena et al., 2007, Chandler et al., 2004, Seyfried and Grant, 2007). Several
    studies on calibration of soil moisture reveal conflicting results in the performance
    of lower-frequency soil moisture sensors and their relationship to the effects
    of temperature. Chen and Or (2006) established a relationship between frequency
    and electrical conductivity for soil moisture sensors having operating frequencies
    less than 150 MHz but did not investigate temperature sensitivity. Kizito et al.
    2008a suggested a solution to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors by
    increasing their frequency to more than 150 MHz. This helps to make the sensors
    more sensitive and reduces the effect of temperature. As a result, a single calibration
    curve can be used across different types of soils. In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015)
    found temperature and salinity sensitivity for the low frequency sensor at 50
    MHz such as Stevens Water Hydra Probe, and Cosh et al. (2016) reported a low absolute
    error (± 0.013 m3m−3) estimates for the low frequency impedance probe such as
    Theta Probe at 100 MHz. However, the recent study by Zawilski et al. (2023) emphasized
    the inadequacy of a single calibration curve (i.e., generalized calibration) for
    dielectric-based soil moisture sensors in same soil textural class at different
    locations, and suggested to develop soil-specific calibrations to achieve high
    accuracy in measurement. The many past studies (Cosh et al., 2016, Rowlandson
    et al., 2013, Singh et al., 2021, Zawilski et al., 2023) highlight the importance
    of developing various calibrations i.e., field-specific, soil-specific, and generalized
    calibration for achieving reliable accuracy based on the available resources.
    The divergent results in the literature emphasize the importance of appropriate
    calibration procedures for dielectric-based soil moisture sensors. While calibration
    of dielectric soil moisture sensors is crucial for accurate measurements, there
    is currently a lack of standardization and consistency in calibration methods
    among different studies (Francesca et al., 2010, Mittelbach et al., 2012, Ojo
    et al., 2015, Rowlandson et al., 2013, Singh et al., 2021). In this regard, the
    review conducted by Ochsner et al. (2013) focused on describing the state of large-scale
    soil moisture monitoring and identifying critical research needs to optimize the
    use of available soil moisture data. Their review covered emerging sensing techniques,
    remote sensing missions, monitoring networks, and applications of large-scale
    soil moisture measurements. From this review it was revealed that the lack of
    standardization in sensor calibration is a significant challenge for monitoring
    accurate soil moisture over a large area. Without standardized protocols for sensor
    calibration, the quality and accuracy of soil moisture measurements collected
    across different soil types and a wide geographic extent remain uncertain, making
    it difficult to quantify the associated uncertainty. Although the review did not
    specifically address the critical calibration methods employed for soil moisture
    sensors, these methods are integral components of comprehensive soil moisture
    monitoring. Also, the literature on soil moisture sensing techniques, calibration,
    and factors affecting soil moisture sensing lacks a comprehensive organization.
    As a result, reviewing existing calibration practices and methods for soil moisture
    sensors becomes imperative. In the modern era of smart agriculture and advanced
    sensing technology, soil moisture measurement is increasingly shifting toward
    the adoption of indirect measurement technologies especially use of electromagnetic
    dielectric soil moisture sensor. Furthermore, with the upcoming launch of the
    NISAR mission, set for 2024, which will provide high-resolution satellite soil
    moisture measurements, there will be a growing need for ground validation of these
    satellite-derived soil moisture products. Dielectric soil moisture sensors can
    play a crucial role in the satellite soil moisture products validation process
    due to its instantaneous and reliable in-situ measurements. However, several challenges
    persist for the dielectric sensor based accurate soil moisture measurements in
    a large region. Firstly, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding
    the specific calibration requirements of various commercially available dielectric
    sensors used in this domain. Although numerous research studies have addressed
    dielectric-based soil moisture sensor calibration, the difficulty lies in translating
    these research findings and recommendations into practical guidelines for farmers,
    agricultural practitioners, and researchers. This aspect is often overlooked,
    creating a gap in the implementation of effective sensor-based soil moisture management
    practices. Establishing standardized protocols for dielectric sensor calibration
    can improve the quality of data, promote comparability, and enable a better understanding
    of soil water resources, which will be need of various Governmental as well as
    Non-Governmental Organization. Failure to address these issues could result in
    unreliable measurements, misinformed decision-making, and, ultimately, environmental,
    and economic consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive review of previous research
    on dielectric soil moisture sensor calibration is needed to gain a deeper understanding
    of the most effective calibration methods and the limitations of current commercially
    available sensors. The primary goal of this review is to identify the most suitable
    calibration approach or strategy and establish guidelines to enhance the calibration
    process of dielectric soil moisture sensor, ensuring consistently reliable and
    accurate measurements. 2. Soil moisture measurement technique by using sensors
    Generally, there are two types of sensors used to measure soil moisture: volumetric
    water content (VWC) and soil matric potential (Sharma, 2019). The VWC sensor indirectly
    measures the soil moisture (Jackson et al., 2010), whereas soil matric potential
    sensors measure the amount of force required to extract the water from the soil,
    which can further be converted to VWC using soil–water retention curve (Yu et
    al., 2021a). Usually, soil moisture sensors that measure VWC are considered over
    soil matric potential sensors because their measuring range is limited to 0 to
    − 85 kPa which is not useful for dryer soil and repeatability of calibrations
    is poor in the field even when the same sensor is repeatedly recalibrated in the
    same soil and perform (Evett et al., 2008, Noborio et al., 1999, Spaans and Baker,
    1992). Several techniques are available to measure VWC by using soil moisture
    sensors like neutron scattering, gamma attenuation, COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing
    System (COSMOS) and dielectric techniques, including TDR, Transmission line oscillator
    (TLO), and capacitance probes (Caldwell et al., 2018, Campbell and Anderson, 1998).
    Neutron moisture meters (NMM) were once considered a reliable tool for determining
    soil water content in the soil profile. The NMM sensors work by measuring the
    amount of thermal or epithermal neutrons that are scattered or absorbed by the
    soil. However, due to radiological regulations and the need for constant supervision
    and trained personnel, the use of NMMs became limited, as highlighted in studies
    by Kafarski et al. (2019) and Susha Lekshmi et al. (2014). Furthermore, research
    by Yu et al. (2021b) has discussed that the NMM''s vertical precision is low,
    making it challenging to obtain accurate measurements of the surface layer. In
    contrast, the gamma-ray attenuation technique is a non-destructive in-situ technique
    that uses changes in saturated density to determine moisture content by using
    gamma rays (Evett et al., 2008). However, it comes with greater safety risks than
    NMM due to the use of gamma rays. Moreover, the operational costs of the gamma
    attenuation technique are relatively high compared to NMM. Despite its effectiveness
    in measuring soil moisture, potential hazards make it practically impossible to
    use gamma-ray attenuation techniques on a large scale, as emphasized by Zazueta
    and Xin (1994). The Cosmic-ray method, used to measure area-average soil moisture
    at the hectometre horizontal scale, is implemented within the COSMOS. This system
    utilizes a stationary cosmic-ray soil moisture probe to measure neutrons generated
    by cosmic rays interacting with air, soil, and other materials (Zreda et al.,
    2008). These neutrons are predominantly moderated by hydrogen atoms, primarily
    in soil water, and subsequently emitted into the atmosphere, where they mix instantaneously
    over hundreds of meters. The density of these neutrons is inversely correlated
    with soil moisture levels (Bogena et al., 2022, Zreda et al., 2012). This approach
    offers an advantage over the NMM sensor. It operates in a manner similar to the
    neutron probe, with a key distinction being its utilization of cosmic rays as
    the source of fast neutrons. This design choice eliminates the challenges associated
    with handling a radioactive source (Zreda et al., 2008). The COSMOS system offers
    a landscape-scale perspective on soil moisture, complemented by point measurements
    obtained through dielectric-based electromagnetic soil moisture sensors. However,
    it is important to note that the practicality of employing COSMOS in agriculture
    (as highlighted by Li et al. (2019)) and the probe''s measurements alone may not
    fully capture changes in soil moisture at greater depths (Dimitrova-Petrova et
    al., 2020, Peterson et al., 2016). A dielectric-based soil moisture sensor is
    a powerful tool for accurately measuring soil moisture content. Unlike other methods,
    such as NMM and Gamma-ray attenuation, this sensor works by detecting changes
    in the electrical properties of the soil, specifically the dielectric permittivity
    (Topp et al., 1980). The dielectric permittivity of the soil changes as the soil
    moisture content varies, which is reflected in the EM signal measured by the sensor.
    Analyzing these changes in the EM signal allows for estimating the soil moisture
    content with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, this type of sensor has a
    rapid response time (Mwale et al., 2005), making it ideal for applications where
    real-time data is crucial. Moreover, it can be easily calibrated for specific
    soil types and fields thus, enhancing its measurement accuracy. The versatility
    of the dielectric-based soil moisture sensor is another advantage, as it can be
    used as either a stationary or portable unit with minimal cost of operation. Overall,
    dielectric-based reliable and effective solution for measuring soil moisture content
    can be used in various other applications including agriculture and hydrology
    (Chen et al., 2012, Kameyama et al., 2014, Scheuermann et al., 2009, Schimleck
    et al., 2011). The dielectric-based soil moisture sensor has advantages over other
    methods, such as NMM and Gamma-ray attenuation. It is a valuable tool that has
    gained popularity due to its accuracy, rapid response time, and versatility. 3.
    Principle of dielectric soil moisture sensors Soil moisture sensors based on dielectric
    permittivity operate on the principle that when a sensor propagates electromagnetic
    (EM) wave through the soil, it encounters variations due to changes in soil dielectric
    permittivity. Dielectric permittivity is an electrical property of the soil that
    is highly influenced by the soil moisture content. The soil dielectric permittivity
    is defined as the ratio of the permittivity of the soil to that of free space,
    and is commonly referred to as the relative permittivity of soil or soil dielectric
    constant, which usually denoted as εr. The εr ranging from 80 for water to 1 for
    air, with variations between 2 and 5 for dry soil (Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018,
    Singh et al., 2019). Since the εr of water is much higher than the air and dry
    soil, the εr of soil–water mixture, is greatly influenced by the proportion of
    water present in the soil pores. As a result, electromagnetic dielectric soil
    moisture sensors, which make use of relative dielectric permittivity (εr), have
    evolved into well-established technologies for measuring the VWC of soil (Blonquist
    et al., 2005, Robinson et al., 2008, Topp et al., 1980, Wobschall, 1978). An essential
    aspect of comprehending the principle of operation of dielectric sensors used
    to measure soil moisture content is measuring the encountered variations in EM
    waves’ frequency, or charge-storage capacity, or travel time when passes through
    the soil–water medium. The variations in EM wave influenced by water content in
    soil as well as vary from one soil type to another, and may also influenced under
    different environmental conditions. In a soil–water mixture, a water molecule
    has the ability to either store energy (i.e., charge storage capacity) or release
    heat as a loss of energy when exposed to an EM field, which influences the EM
    wave and helps in measurement of εr. The εr is a dimensionless number that is
    in generally a complex-value, which can be characterized by its real (εr′) and
    imaginary (εr˝) parts, where the εr′ indicates the energy storage capacity (correlated
    with VWC) and the εr˝ denotes the amount of energy loss as heat (Mohamed and Paleologos,
    2018, Wang and Schmugge, 1980). The equations to calculate the real and imaginary
    parts of εr are as follows: (1) (2) The contribution of the σdc term is relevant
    only when the material has some ionic conduction, and its value is non-zero. The
    refractive index is represented by n, while εs stands for the static relative
    permittivity. ω is the applied angular frequency (2πf) and τ is the relaxation
    time (time required for the water molecule to align itself with an applied field).
    In general, dielectric soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture content by
    analyzing the ability of soil to store electrical energy in an electric field
    based on the soil dielectric permittivity (Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018, Wang
    and Schmugge, 1980). This unique property of soil, which enables the storage of
    electric charge without polarizing salt ions, is measurable in terms of the dielectric
    permittivity. Since soil consists of solid, liquid, and gas, each with a different
    dielectric permittivity, dielectric sensors relate the change in the dielectric
    permittivity of the solid and liquid components by volume to determine the VWC
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Campbell et al., 2021). 3.1. Types of dielectric permittivity-based
    soil moisture measuring techniques Generally, three dielectric sensor types are
    used for soil moisture measurements, such as Time domain reflectometry (TDR),
    Capacitance, and Transmission line oscillator (TLO). 3.1.1. TDR technique TDR-based
    soil moisture sensor is a commonly used technique to measure soil moisture based
    on the relative dielectric permittivity (εr) of soil. In general, TDR is based
    upon the cable testing technology, where sensors measure the time taken by the
    EM wave (travel time) to propagate along the stainless-steel rods that are surrounded
    by the soil, and this travel time depends upon the dielectric permittivity of
    soil. The schematic for measuring the soil moisture by using TDR is shown in Fig.
    1. The sampling oscilloscope generates an EM pulse and sends it into the soil
    through a TDR probe. It encounters a change in the εr at the soil–water interface,
    leading to alterations in εr and variations in EM pulse speed along the length
    of the TDR probe rods. Consequently, the initial pulse reflection occurs at the
    beginning of the probe rods within the soil, while the subsequent pulse reflections
    originate from the end of the probe rods. The elapsed time between these reflections
    serves as the basis for subsequent calculations. The technique involves measuring
    the time delay between the initial pulse and the reflected pulse is directly proportional
    to the distance between the probe, length of probe rods inside the soil, and the
    charge storage capacity (or dielectric permittivity) of the soil–water interface
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Chavanne and Frangi, 2022). TDR calculate the εr of soil
    by measuring the time delay (Δt) in EM pulse propagation along the TDR probe rods
    of length (Le) that are surrounded by the soil medium using the following relationships
    given by Topp et al. (1980): (4) where, c is the velocity of EM wave in free space
    and Le is length of metal tine or rods or waveguide. The term c×Δt/2 in Eq.4 can
    be referred as the apparent length (La) of TDR probe. The La measures as a distance
    between EM pulse’s initial reflection (occurs at the beginning of the probe rods
    within the soil) and reflection originate from the end of the probe rods (Baker
    and Allmaras, 1990). Thus, the Eq.4 can be written as: (4.1) since La is related
    to εr, it can also be correlated with VWC. Saturated soil experiences an increase
    in La of the EM pulse along the probe rods, leading to a high εr value due to
    the presence of a high-water content in the soil. However, in dry soil, the La
    of the EM pulse along the probe rods is shorter, resulting in a low εr value.
    Readers can refer to Noborio (2001) for more details about La of the EM pulse
    along the probe rods under different soil wetness conditions. The TDR based sensors
    considered as the highly accurate and reliable soil moisture sensors (Baker and
    Allmaras, 1990, Fellner-Feldegg, 1969, Heimovaara, 1994, Noborio, 2001, Smith
    and Mullins, 2001, Topp et al., 1980). The equipment required for TDR measurements
    is relatively expensive compared to other soil moisture measurement methods, such
    as capacitance-based sensors and frequency domain sensor (Scheberl et al., 2019,
    Singh et al., 2023, Staub et al., 2010). Download : Download high-res image (274KB)

    measure the capacitance namely electrical charge storage capacity, of the soil
    (Kelleners et al., 2004a, 2005a). The ability of soil to store charge is related
    to its water content present in the soil pores, allowing the sensor to determine
    the soil moisture. These sensors are cost-effective, and report acceptable accuracy
    with error less than ± 0.04 m3m−3 in soil moisture measurements (Bogena et al.,
    2007, Entekhabi et al., 2010, Francesca et al., 2010, Parvin and Degré, 2016).
    The relative permittivity or charge storage capacity of water is very high (εr
    = 80) as compared to dry soil (εr = 3–5) and air (εr = 1), thus any change in
    soil water content changes the εr of the soil–water mixture (Robinson et al.,
    2002, Singh et al., 2019). Since soil acts as a dielectric medium, the charge
    time of the sensor capacitor was used to measure the εr of soil. The capacitance
    sensor utilizes an electronic oscillator that generates a repetitive square waveform
    with a characteristic frequency (less than 100 MHz) to measure the εr of the soil–water
    mixture surrounding the two thin electrodes of the sensor, as illustrated in the
    schematic of the capacitance operation shown in Fig. 2. The relationship between
    the time (t) taken to charge a capacitor with a starting voltage (Vi) to a final
    voltage (V) with an applied voltage, Va of capacitor is as follows (Kargas and
    Soulis, 2012): (5.1) if resistance (R), Vi, and Va held constant then using Eq.
    (5.1), then charge time of capacitor (t) can be relate to capacitance (C), which
    is a charge-storage capacity of the dielectric material like soil–water mixture.
    The capacitance varies according to the water content present in the soil. The
    greater is the soil water content, the higher the capacitance of the sensor and
    vice-a-versa. Download : Download high-res image (179KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Capacitance-based schematic for measuring soil moisture. The capacitance,
    C, is related to the dielectric permittivity of a soil–water mixture and sensor
    geometrical factor, F (F = A/d, A is the area of conductive plates cross-section
    and d is the distance between the conductive plates) and can be calculated by:
    (5.2) By assuming charge time (t) as a linear function of dielectric permittivity
    of the soil–water mixture, the εr can be calculated as: (5.3) where, ε0 is the
    permittivity of free space. The εr of the soil is calculated by utilizing the
    charge time (t) of a capacitor in Eq.5.3. At a high-water content in soil the
    capacitor charge slowly and therefore the charge time is higher in wet soil as
    compared to the dry soil (Bogena et al., 2007). A typical capacitance sensor provides
    the outputs in terms of voltage (V) level, which is directly related to the charge
    time of the capacitor. The resulted output voltage is then related to εr or directly
    to VWC using specific calibrations. Capacitance sensors, which operate at low
    frequencies (less than 100 MHz), are widely used for measuring soil moisture content.
    However, their accuracy is highly sensitive to temperature and salinity, and therefore,
    a robust calibration is required to compensate for these factors during the measurement
    process (Bogena et al., 2007, Kelleners et al., 2004b). Despite this limitation,
    studies have demonstrated that low-cost capacitance sensors can provide soil moisture
    measurement with an acceptable absolute error less than ± 0.04 m3m-3 in the 0
    °C to 20 °C soil temperature range and up to 9 dS/m salinity. This makes them
    a viable option for validating remote sensing based soil moisture products (Mittelbach
    et al., 2012). Capacitance-based soil moisture sensing is relatively simple, instantaneous,
    and inexpensive, giving it an advantage for regional scale soil moisture measurements.
    However, the accuracy of capacitance sensors is limited by the depth of placement
    (Mazahrih et al., 2008), length of probe and the presence of salts in the soil
    (Kelleners et al., 2004a, Kelleners et al., 2004b, Kizito et al., 2008). Therefore,
    while capacitance sensors are a promising option for soil moisture measurement,
    their limitations must be taken into account when using them for different applications.
    3.1.3. Transmission line oscillator (TLO) technique and frequency domian Reflectometry
    (FDR) The TLO technique involves transmitting an EM wave into the soil and measuring
    its reflection, which is influenced by the soil''s dielectric permittivity (Caldwell
    et al., 2018, Munoz Carpena, 2021). The TLO sensor consists of a transmission
    line, a probe, and a measurement system as shown in Fig. 3. The transmission line
    is used to transmit the electromagnetic wave into the soil, and the probe (which
    act as an extension to transmission line) is used to measure the reflection of
    the wave. This measurement is then used to calculate number of reflection (Kelleners
    et al., 2005) or probe impedance (Gaskin and Miller, 1996). A differential oscillator
    circuit (frequency generator) is connected to the rods, and it experiences a state
    change in its oscillator when it detects the reflected signal from either of the
    rods. The measurement system is used to analyze the two-way travel time (t) or
    period (P) of the reflection of the EM wave and determine the soil moisture content
    as per the varying dielectric permittivity of soil under different soil wetness
    conditions (Caldwell et al., 2018). The travel time of the reflection is inversely
    proportional to number of reflections per second (fr, T−1) of the EM wave (Caldwell
    et al., 2018). The commercially available TLO sensors like Campbell Scientific’s
    CS-615 and CS-616 utilizes this principle for soil moisture measurement. The travel
    time (t) for the reflectometer can be related as follows: where, L is the length
    of probe rods, Sf is scaling factor, c is speed of light in free space, td is
    delay time in the probe head before the next pulse is triggered. Download : Download
    high-res image (106KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. TLO-based schematic
    for moisture measurement. The radiometric coaxial transmission line oscillator
    technique, such as used in Stevenson’s Hydra Probe, utilizes probe impedance (Zp)
    to measure the dielectric permittivity. It is also referred as the FDR technique
    to measure soil moisture, which is based on swept frequency (i.e., collecting
    the data over a wide range of frequencies) of the EM wave. The sensing probe acts
    like an extra section of the transmission line, and its impedance changes based
    on the dielectric permittivity of soil around the probe rods (Gaskin and Miller,
    1996). Notably, the both TLO and FDR sensor-based measurement process involves
    repetition of multiple frequencies to obtain a frequency response of the soil
    based on the wetness. The frequency response of the soil is analyzed using mathematical
    models to determine the soil moisture content (Seyfried et al., 2005, Topp et
    al., 1980; Xu et al., 2012). When the voltage applied to the coaxial FDR, the
    response of signal is related to Zp is as follows (Seyfried et al., 2005): where
    Zc is the characteristic impedance of the coaxial cable (determined independently)
    and Γ is the complex ratio of the reflected voltage to the incident voltage. Under
    these conditions, the probe impedance is determined by the electrical properties
    of the probe itself (Z0) and the εr of the media in the soil–water mixture. The
    relationship is as follows: where L is the probe length and c is the speed of
    light. By using the raw signal outputs i.e. voltage level, it can be solved for
    εr (Seyfried and Grant, 2007). TLO and FDR technique offers significant advantages
    over other soil moisture measurement methods, such as TDR and capacitance sensors.
    Similar to TDR, TLO is also utilized for continuous measurements of soil moisture
    content at various points over a larger area (Lievens et al., 2015, Sanchez et
    al., 2012), and can measure moisture content to a greater depth (Bosch et al.,
    2006, Cosh et al., 2016). Capacitance sensors are limited in their ability to
    measure moisture content to shallow depths. However, the TLO technique is more
    expensive than capacitance sensors. Despite the higher cost, TLO provides more
    accurate measurements of soil moisture content, particularly in clay and organic
    soils. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of TLO in measuring
    soil moisture content in a range of soil types. For instance, Bosch et al., 2006,
    Kelleners and Verma, 2010, and Zawilski et al. (2023) found that Hydra probe provides
    more accurate soil moisture measurements in clay and organic soils compared to
    TDR and capacitance sensors. However, it is important to note that Bittelli, (2011)
    and Zawilski et al. (2023) reported that the accuracy of TLO or FDR measurements
    may still be affected by various factors, such as salinity, clay and organic soil.
    Although some experimental and theoretical approaches have been studies by Caldwell
    et al., 2018, Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2015, and Zawilski et al. (2023) to
    address this issue and all of them suggesting a soil specific calibration to improve
    the accuracy which is also the similar for other two types of techniques we discussed.
    Furthermore, from a cost perspective, the sensor based on TDR technique notably
    more expensive than both the Capacitance and the TLO or FDR technique. Specifically,
    the sensor based on TDR technique is approximately 3.08 times more costly than
    the Capacitance based sensor. Comparatively, the sensor based on TLO technique
    is around 1.29 times more expensive than the Capacitance sensor. Furthermore,
    when directly comparing the TDR and TLO or FDR, the TDR is roughly 2.41 times
    more expensive than the TLO or FDR sensor. The given costs comparison for a single
    sensor with a data logger were obtained from Kukal et al. (2020) and quote obtained
    from the respective companies. These cost differentials underscore the financial
    considerations associated with choosing the TLO or FDR sensor for soil moisture
    measurement, especially in large-scale applications. Therefore, while TLO or FDR
    offers many advantages over other soil moisture measurement techniques, users
    should carefully consider their specific needs and circumstances before choosing
    this technique. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the accuracy in soil moisture measurement
    of different technique-based dielectric sensors as reported in various research
    studies. Table 1 lists the measurement accuracy details of manufacturer-provided
    calibration or factory calibration and the calibration developed in various research
    studies for popular commercially available dielectric soil moisture sensors such
    as 10HS, TDR, EC 5, Hydra Probe, and Theta Probe. It is evident from the Table
    1 that the accuracy of measuring soil moisture using a dielectric sensor varies
    depending on the type of sensor used, the calibration method adopted, and the
    specific application. For instance, the 10HS sensor shows an accuracy of approximately
    ± 0.03 m3m−3 with factory calibration as well as specific calibrations developed
    in various research studies. However, the CS616 and CS625 sensors found to have
    soil moisture measurement accuracy of ± 0.025 m3m−3 with factory calibration and
    an accuracy range of ± 0.016 m3m−3 to ± 0.129 m3m−3 using specific calibrations
    developed in various research studies. The widely used Hydra Probe and Theta Probe
    found to have an accuracy range between ± 0.0177 m3m−3 to ± 0.0623 m3m−3 and ±
    0.018 m3m−3 to ± 0.055 m3m−3, respectively, in various research studies. These
    past studies also revealed that soil or field-specific calibrations can significantly
    improve the accuracy of the sensors in measuring soil moisture, as seen in the
    examples provided in Table 1. These finding highlights the importance of calibrating
    sensors to specific soil types and conditions to obtain accurate soil moisture
    measurements (Burns et al., 2014, Colliander et al., 2017, Cosh et al., 2005).

    affecting the accuracy of dielectric soil moisture sensors The soil moisture sensors
    are criticized for being non selective because of soil environmental impacts since
    they frequently operate at the low end of the frequency (Chen and Or, 2006, Kizito
    et al., 2008). The data presented in Table 1, demonstrates that the accuracy of
    the sensor differs when the identical equation is applied in the same soil type.
    This indicates that factors other than soil moisture content, including temperature,
    salinity and soil texture, affect the accuracy of the sensor. The laboratory and
    field calibration methods are commonly used in academic, scientific, as well as
    professional studies. Several studies have been conducted in past and still, there
    is a lot of research scope to ascertain how factors in the soil environment, such
    as temperature, salinity, and soil type, affect the measurement''s accuracy and
    dependability (Chandler et al., 2004, Kelleners et al., 2005b, Seyfried and Murdock,
    2004, Topp et al., 2000). Following we discuss such environmental factors (soil
    type, soil temperature, and salinity) that introduce uncertainties in the development
    of a robust calibration of the dielectric sensors and restrict them to become
    applicable universally. Another factor influencing the accuracy of sensor measurements
    during any application is the cost of the sensor under consideration (Mittelbach
    et al., 2012). 4.1. Soil properties The physical properties of soil, such as particle
    size, organic content, and management practices, are significantly influenced
    by a combination of factors. The amount and composition of the soil solution,
    along with porosity, density, and mineralogical composition, primarily determine
    these properties and depend on the soil type. Together, these factors constitute
    crucial parameters that distinguish different types of soil. The polarization
    and conduction of electric charge in the soil water system are significantly affected
    by the soil physical properties (Heil and Schmidhalter, 2012, Wobschall, 1978).
    The soil moisture sensor which utilizes dielectric permittivity a physical property
    of soil that measures the polarization and conduction of electric charge in the
    soil water system. However, alterations in the soil, arising from variations in
    soil physical properties, impede the precision of these sensors, necessitating
    their consideration and universal applicability (Arsoy et al., 2013, Bogena et
    al., 2017, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Stangl et al., 2009).
    Soil texture classification primarily divides soil into two categories: mineral
    soil and organic soil. Clay soil within the mineral category is known for its
    high reactivity, while coarse-textured soil in the same category exhibits lower
    reactivity (Ojo et al., 2015). The electromagnetic soil moisture sensor uses relative
    dielectric permittivity (εr) for the estimation of the soil moisture in soil water
    medium. The TDR soil moisture sensor relies on apparent relative permittivity
    and employs the calibration equation developed by Topp et al. (1980). However,
    when dealing with soil high in organic matter, this calibration equation may not
    be suitable, necessitating the determination of a separate calibration equation
    as suggested by Kirkham (2014). Furthermore, Topp et al. (2000) observed that
    the equation proposed by Topp et al. (1980) becomes less reliable, especially
    for soil samples with a VWC exceeding 0.15 m3m−3, particularly when soil rich
    in salt or clay content. This inconsistency may arise from the complexities of
    conduction inherent in this method. To address this issue, they recommended incorporating
    the imaginary component of relative permittivity (εr) during the TDR calibration
    process. Similarly, Vaz et al. (2013) conducted an evaluation of multiple soil
    moisture sensors across various soil textures and reported variations in accuracy
    attributed to the type of soil. Additionally, Singh et al. (2021) conducted a
    comprehensive analysis of soil moisture sensors utilizing TLO or FDR techniques,
    with a specific focus on the ML3 Theta Probe. Their research findings underscored
    that the accuracy of these sensors exhibited variability depending on the soil
    type under investigation. In the course of their studies, they recommended the
    implementation of soil-specific calibration when dealing with soils rich in clay
    and organic matter. In a related study, Kim et al. (2020) delved into the performance
    of various electromagnetic-based soil water content probes, including the Hydra
    Probe, HS2, and FS100, in sandy loam soils. They noted Root Mean Square Deviation
    (RMSD) values around ± 0.040 m3m−3 without employing a specific calibration approach.
    However, they observed a significant improvement, with RMSD values falling to
    less than ± 0.025 m3m−3, when a soil-specific calibration was utilized. In conclusion,
    when calibrating soil moisture sensors, it is essential to consider the soil type
    under examination. For soils rich in clay and organic matter, it is advisable
    to develop a soil-specific calibration to achieve high accuracy. Conversely, when
    dealing with coarse-textured soils, a general calibration may yield acceptable
    accuracy. This approach ensures the precise measurement of soil moisture content,
    as highlighted in the studies conducted by Datta and Taghvaeian (2023) and Zawilski
    et al. (2023). Their research underscores the critical importance of tailoring
    calibration to the specific properties of the soil, particularly clay content,
    for accurate soil moisture measurements. 4.2. Soil temperature The dielectric
    soil moisture sensor utilizes frequency or electromagnetic waves to determine
    electric property of soil (i.e., dielectric permittivity) to measure VWC of the
    soil. The temperature of soil influences the physical and chemical properties,
    including its electrical properties (Andry et al., 2009, Kekane et al., 2015).
    Temperature fluctuations induce variations in electrical conductivity, consequently
    enhancing the interfacial polarization of water molecules. This leads to an increase
    in the real component of the dielectric permittivity of the soil, which can significantly
    impact the performance of dielectric soil moisture sensors, as highlighted in
    studies by (Bogena et al., (2017); Chakraborty et al., 2019, Yu et al., 2021.
    Contrastingly, Kelleners et al., (2005a) and Chen and Or (2006) have proposed
    that dielectric sensors operating at high frequencies (more than 100 MHz) exhibit
    considerable potential for accurately measuring soil moisture while minimizing
    sensitivity to changes in soil electrical conductivity and temperature. Notably,
    TDR sensors, widely acknowledged for accurate soil moisture measurements, operate
    within a high frequency range from 0.1 to 1.5 GHz. Within this frequency range,
    the impact of temperature on the calibration equation proposed by Topp et al.
    (1980) is generally minor, except under conditions of very high soil moisture
    levels (Yu et al., 1999). In contrast, TLO or FDR sensors operating at low frequencies
    (less than 100 MHz) exhibit minimal sensitivity to temperature variations. These
    sensors determine the real component of the soil relative dielectric permittivity
    by calculating it from both the soil dielectric permittivity and bulk electrical
    conductivity (σb). Notably, the Hydra Probe, an FDR sensor, records four voltages
    readings, with one specifically accounting for changes in soil temperature. These
    four voltage readings are then utilized to compute the relative dielectric permittivity
    of the soil through an empirical equation (Stevens Water Monitoring Inc, 2018).
    This implies that the Hydra Probe indirectly incorporates the influence of soil
    temperature into its measurements of the soil relative dielectric permittivity.
    Several studies have shown that capacitance sensors are highly sensitive to soil
    temperature (Evett et al., 2006, Kizito et al., 2008, Seyfried and Grant, 2007).
    Capacitance sensors operate at the lower end of the frequency, typically less
    than 50 MHz. The sensitivity of capacitance sensor measurements to temperature
    changes is primarily affected by operating at a low frequency (Chen and Or, 2006).
    The high sensitivity of capacitance sensors to temperature changes arises from
    their working principle. This is because capacitance sensors incorporate the soil
    as dielectric medium where the permanent dipoles of water molecules within the
    dielectric medium align themselves in response to an electromagnetic field and
    become polarized. For contributing to the dielectric permittivity, the electric
    dipoles, regardless of their origin, must respond to the frequency of the electromagnetic
    fields (Paltineanu and Starr, 1997). As mentioned previously, an increase in temperature
    leads to an increase in soil electrical conductivity, thereby enhancing the interfacial
    polarization of water molecules. This effect significantly influences the estimation
    of the relative dielectric permittivity of soil, especially when using capacitive
    sensors. Several studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of capacitance
    sensors to soil temperature (Evett et al., 2008), while TDR sensors have been
    found to be less impacted by temperature (Olmanson and Ochsner, 2006, Robinson
    et al., 2008; Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014). Previous studies have proposed methods
    such as the measurement of temperature-based imaginary dielectric components and
    the application of temperature correction factors to reduce the temperature sensitivity
    (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2015, Fares et al., 2016, Saito et al., 2009).
    This highlights the importance of considering the soil moisture sensor technique
    as a potential factor of soil temperature when selecting sensor for accurate soil
    moisture measurements. Moreover, it is crucial to investigate the influence of
    temperature on sensor electronics amplification drift, especially when considering
    materials with relative dielectric permittivity. While there are a few studies
    that touch upon this aspect, such as Dean et al. (1987), who investigated the
    dimensional changes in electrode geometry induced by temperature fluctuations,
    highlighting the significance of the temperature effect on soil moisture measurements.
    They noted that it can be minimized in circuit design by incorporating component
    capacitors in parallel. Noborio et al. (1994) conducted a study on the impact
    of temperature changes on stainless-steel probes, specifically analyzing the TDR
    waveform. Their findings suggested no significant effects on the waveform due
    to temperature variations of the probes. In a study, Seyfried and Grant (2007)
    et al. examined the impact of instrument temperature on the calculated volumetric
    water content derived from the dielectric permittivity-volumetric water content
    relationship. They observed that the instrument''s effect exceeded 0.01 m3m−3
    in dry soil, diminishing at higher water content. Notably, their investigation
    spanned a temperature range of 5–45 °C. Despite these valuable contributions,
    the available literature remains scarce regarding the compensation for temperature-induced
    effects on sensor electronics amplification drift, especially concerning materials
    of relative dielectric permittivity. More extensive research is needed to elucidate
    the extent to which compensation mechanisms operate under these specific conditions.
    Future studies should aim to address this gap and contribute to a comprehensive
    understanding of the effect of temperature on sensor electronics. 4.3. Salinity
    Soil salinity refers to the concentration of salts in the soil, typically measured
    in terms of electrical conductivity (EC) or ion concentration which exhibit strong
    dependence on temperature. The presence of dissolved salts increases the EC of
    soil, which in turn increases the dielectric losses or conductive loss (i.e.,
    imaginary part of the relative dielectric permittivity) due to ionic conductivity
    and relaxation (Kargas and Soulis, 2019, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). As discussed
    in above sections, the dielectric soil moisture sensor utilizes various principles
    such as capacitance, TDR, and TLO or FDR to generate an electrical signal. It
    then measures a specific parameter (either frequency, travel time, period, impedance
    and charge time) in response to changes in the apparent permittivity or relative
    dielectric permittivity of the soil to infer the VWC using calibration equation
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Robinson et al., 2003). Consequently, the accuracy of
    soil moisture sensors is influenced by the increasing soil salinity due to the
    effect on the electrical property of soil (Kargas et al., 2011, Kelleners et al.,
    2004b, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). In capacitance sensor, VWC depends on how
    fast an electrical circuit in the sensor oscillate. This oscillation speed is
    decided by how much the soil affects the circuit''s ability to hold electrical
    charge, and that, in turn, is influenced by the soil''s electrical properties
    (Kelleners et al., 2004b). As salinity levels rise, there is an increase in the
    concentration of ions in the soil–water mixture. These ions facilitate the flow
    of electrical currents through the soil more readily than usual. Thus salinity
    presents in soil interrupts the usual behaviour of the dielectric sensor and leads
    to either over or underestimation of actual moisture content of soil (Baumhardt
    et al., 2000). Thompson et al. (2007) studied the effect of salinity on the capacitive
    soil moisture sensor and found that the VWC increases in the well-irrigated treatment
    fields. In TDR, when a signal is transmitted through the soil, the extent to which
    the signal can pass through depends on the soil''s conductivity. If the soil conducts
    electricity too effectively, the signal can be lost, rendering it impossible for
    the sensor to make measurements. This occurs when the soil''s conductivity is
    so high that it essentially short-circuits the sensor. The presence of ions in
    the soil (related to salinity) increases soil conductivity, ultimately affecting
    the performance of TDR sensors (Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014). TDR measurements
    remain reasonably accurate without overestimation for soils with bulk electrical
    conductivity values up to 5 dS/m (Blonquist et al., 2005, Louki et al., 2019).
    However, if EC exceeds this threshold, correction becomes necessary. The calibration
    trend is non-linear within the EC range of greater than 5 dS/m (Wyseure et al.,
    1997), and it is advisable to employ non-linear calibration, incorporating EC
    into the calibration equation to rectify sensor performance. Singh et al.(2021)
    have described a method for integrating EC and dry bulk density into the non-linear
    calibration equation. In saline soils, the low-cost dielectric sensors may overestimate
    VWC due to the high relative dielectric permittivity of the soil. This issue has
    been reported in several recent studies, including a study by Inoue et al. (2008).
    This highlights the importance of calibrating the soil moisture sensors under
    conditions that accurately reflect the soil and environmental conditions in which
    they will be used. In these efforts, researchers have developed correction methods
    aimed at minimizing the impact of soil salinity on soil moisture measurements.
    One such approach is the two-step correction method developed by Kelleners et
    al. (2005). This method involves calibration of the sensors using soil samples
    with known salinity levels, followed by the development of a correction factor
    to adjust the sensor readings for the influence of soil salinity. Apart from this,
    in a study conducted by Peng et al. (2022) the impact of soil salinity on the
    Thermo-Time Domain Reflectometry (TTDR) method for measuring VWC, was investigated.
    The findings indicated that correcting for the effect of soil salinity in VWC
    measurements contributes to improved accuracy. 4.4. Cost In scientific applications,
    priority is generally given to the accuracy of soil moisture sensors over cost,
    as precision and reliability are critical for producing valid and meaningful results.
    However, in the context of large-scale studies and commercial agriculture, cost
    becomes a crucial consideration in addition to accuracy (Kukal et al., 2020).
    This is because these applications often require the use of numerous sensors,
    which can be expensive to purchase, calibrate, install, and maintain (Songara
    and Patel, 2022). Moreover, the labor and management costs involved with retrieving,
    analyzing, and interpreting data (Spelman et al., 2013). Therefore, while accuracy
    remains a top priority, it is important to balance it with the financial consideration
    of using a particular sensor in these contexts. The study by Czarnomski et al.
    (2005) evaluated three soil moisture measurement devices and found that the low-frequency
    sensor (ECH2O) was low-cost and performed well compared to the other devices.
    As a result, there is an increasing interest in using low-frequency techniques
    to reduce the error in estimating soil moisture measurements for large areas (Kelleners
    et al., 2004a, 2004b). Nonetheless, the high cost of some sensors has led researchers
    to develop low-cost soil moisture measurement sensors that maintain accuracy (Adla
    et al., 2020, Bogena et al., 2007, Chavanne and Frangi, 2022, González-Teruel
    et al., 2019, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Mane and Kadam, 2021, Nagahage et al.,
    2019). The use of TDR and TLO techniques in hydrological research (Buytaert et
    al., 2014, Mohanty et al., 2000, Robinson et al., 2008, Singh et al., 2021) and
    remote sensing-based calibration/validation research (Cosh et al., 2016, Cosh
    et al., 2005, Jackson et al., 2010) suggests that these techniques are precise
    and reliable for soil moisture measurement. However, it is crucial to consider
    the trade-off between cost and accuracy, as some low-cost sensors may not be as
    accurate as high-cost ones. Therefore, while accuracy remains a top priority,
    it is necessary to balance the cost and feasibility of using a particular sensor
    for soil moisture measurement in different applications, such as scientific and
    commercial agriculture. Low-cost sensors, while offering affordability and accessibility,
    often face challenges during installation due to their construction using less
    expensive materials and simplified designs. Further research required on the durability
    of low-cost dielectric sensors. 5. Calibration strategies across spatial domains
    Upon examining multiple studies regarding soil moisture sensor calibration, the
    calibration process can be classified into four major categories: (i) point or
    site-specific calibration, (ii) field-specific calibration, (iii) soil-specific
    calibration, and (iv) generalized calibration. This classification aids in comprehending
    each individual calibration condition and facilitates its adoption in research
    endeavors. 5.1. Point or site-specific calibration Point calibration refers to
    the calibration of the soil moisture sensor at a single point or a specific site
    in the field having no variation in soil type, topography, vegetation, and environmental
    conditions. This calibration involves measuring the response of the sensor to
    different known moisture levels (i.e., gravimetric sampling) and then establishing
    a calibration curve that relates the sensor''s output to the moisture content
    of the soil. Point calibration is straightforward and easy to perform (Gasch et
    al., 2017). From Fig. 5, it is observed that the accuracy of the point or site-specific
    calibration is better than ± 0.04 m3m−3 i.e., ± 0.022 m3m−3. The highest accuracy
    of ± 0.004 m3m−3 was found by Matula et al. (2016), which is significantly better
    than the accuracies reported for other methods, such as soil and field-specific
    calibrations. Matula et al. (2016) also observed that the accuracy of soil moisture
    measurements is influenced by the dry bulk density factor, which refers to the
    degree of packing between the sensing rods of the soil moisture sensor and the
    soil/sand particles. The authors found that good contact between the sensing rods
    and soil/sand particles is important for achieving high accuracy and that significantly
    higher Root-Mean-Square -Error (RMSE) values were obtained for loose packing.
    Based on these observations, Matula et al. (2016) concluded that direct regression
    approaches, such as point calibration, may be necessary for achieving high accuracy
    with soil moisture sensors in sand/soil with lower dry bulk density values. This
    highlights the importance of carefully considering calibration approaches and
    measurement conditions when selecting a soil moisture sensor. Additionally, it
    is important to note that all three studies, including the studies by Sharma et
    al. (2017) and Burns et al. (2014), were conducted in a laboratory setting for
    point calibration. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the findings in a field
    setting, as the behavior of soil moisture sensors in the field may differ from
    that in the laboratory. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Comparison of accuracy of soil moisture sensor by using
    point calibration. 5.2. Soil-specific calibration Soil-specific calibration is
    a type of calibration for soil moisture sensors that involves taking measurements
    at multiple points within a specific soil type. The goal of soil-specific calibration
    is to establish a calibration curve that is tailored to the unique characteristics
    of a particular soil type (Parvin and Degré, 2016). By taking measurements at
    different locations within the same soil type, a more accurate calibration curve
    can be established that accounts for any variability in soil moisture content
    that may exist within that soil type. To perform soil-specific calibration, a
    set of measurement points is chosen within the soil type of interest. The sensor
    is then placed at each measurement point and a moisture measurement is taken.
    This process is repeated for multiple moisture levels to establish a calibration
    curve that relates the sensor''s output to the moisture content of the soil (Cosh
    et al., 2005). Fig. 6 shows the accuracy of soil moisture sensors under soil-specific
    calibration by using linear and nonlinear calibration approaches across laboratory
    and field measurement conditions. In section 5.1, it was discussed that the overall
    accuracy of point calibration for soil moisture sensors is less than ± 0.022 m3m−3.
    But the studies conducted by Kukal et al., (2019) and Dong et al., (2020) also
    reported good accuracy values for soil moisture sensors under soil-specific calibration.
    However, the accuracy varied depending on the sensor type and measurement conditions.
    For example, the TDR sensor reported by Kukal et al. (2019) achieved a high accuracy
    value of ± 0.025 m3m−3 in the field, while Ojo et al. (2015) had a lower accuracy
    value of ± 0.188 m3m−3 in the field. Ojo et al. (2015) used the Hydra Probe sensor
    with the manufacturer''s default soil-specific calibration for clay soil and found
    lower accuracy. However, by using a soil-specific calibration developed for the
    soil in the study area, the accuracy improved to ± 0.025 m3m−3, and by using field
    calibration, it became ± 0.026 m3m−3. Similar observations were reported by Zawilski
    et al. (2023), who suggested that laboratory calibration for clay soil is necessary
    to ensure accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (70KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Comparison of soil moisture sensor accuracy in soil-specific
    calibration. In contrast, Cosh et al., (2005) revealed that soil-specific calibration
    did not improve the accuracy of the sensor when compared with field-specific calibration,
    but other statistics, such as bias were greatly improved. Ojo et al. (2015) suggested
    that the effectiveness of soil-specific calibration depends on the soil textural
    class. Soil-specific calibration produced the best results for clay soil, but
    it showed little improvement over the calibration for low-reactive, coarse-textured
    soils. Similarly, Singh et al., (2021) found that soil-specific calibrations were
    limited to specific soil textural classes and failed to reduce the overall error
    in soil moisture measurements at regional scale. Therefore, the choice of calibration
    method should consider soil texture and other measurement conditions, such as
    sensor type and field vs. laboratory calibration, to achieve the best possible
    accuracy. 5.3. Field-specific calibration The goal of field-specific calibration
    is to capture the soil moisture variability that may exist within the field of
    measurement. By taking multiple measurements at different locations and wetness
    conditions within the area of interest, a more accurate calibration curve can
    be established that accounts for any variation in soil moisture content that may
    exist due to factors such as topography or vegetation. In field-specific calibration,
    the bulk density is not determined based on soil type but rather on the specific
    area of interest. This means that the bulk density is calculated as an average
    value over the entire area, regardless of the soil type (Cosh et al., 2005). Therefore,
    in field-specific calibration, the focus is on the specific area being studied,
    rather than on the soil type. Cosh et al. (2005) conducted a detailed analysis
    of the effectiveness of field-specific calibration for soil moisture sensors and
    found that, while there was a minor improvement in accuracy with field-specific
    calibration, there were significant improvements in bias and a reduction in errors
    and outliers compared to generalized calibration. However, the study also highlights
    several limitations of using field-specific calibration for impedance probes with
    low frequency of operation. Firstly, the improvement in root mean square error
    (RMSE) with field-specific calibration may not always be significant (Zawilski
    et al., 2023), as shown in Fig. 7. Secondly, the calibration may still have limitations
    at very low and very high soil moisture contents (Mittelbach et al., 2011). Thirdly,
    there may be an inherent bias in the measurement of high soil moisture contents
    (Mittelbach et al., 2012). In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015) conducted a study that
    suggests that field-specific calibration provides the highest accuracy for low-reactive,
    coarse-textured soils as compared to generalized calibration. Similar findings
    were reported by (Kim et al., 2020). However, this finding may not apply to all
    soil types or environmental conditions (Zawilski et al., 2023). Download : Download

    soil moisture sensor accuracy in field-specific calibration. Overall, it is important
    to consider both the advantages and limitations of field-specific calibration
    when evaluating the validity of the data collected by soil moisture sensors. While
    there may be some improvements in accuracy, bias reduction, and error reduction
    with field-specific calibration, the effectiveness of this approach may be limited
    in certain soil types and moisture content ranges. 5.4. Generalized calibration
    General calibration involves calibrating the sensor using intensive measurements
    from multiple sites, fields, and soil types across a large region. This approach
    aims to establish a calibration curve that can be used across a broad range of
    soil, vegetation, topographic, and environmental conditions within the area of
    interest. Developing general calibration is challenging since these conditions
    can vary significantly over a large region or watershed. However, for regional
    or watershed-scale applications, generalized calibration is advantageous over
    other calibrations of being more straightforward, less time-consuming, and practicable
    (Singh et al., 2021). Fig. 8 shows the accuracies reported in different studies
    by various researchers across the world. The RMSE values range from ± 0.022 m3m−3
    to ± 0.1 m3m−3, with some sensors having better accuracy in the laboratory than
    in the field. The best-performing sensor in the field is the TDR sensor, with
    an RMSE of ± 0.027 m3m−3. The EC5 sensor was evaluated by several researchers,
    with reported RMSE values ranging from ± 0.032 m3m−3 to ± 0.1 m3m−3. The Hydra
    Probe sensor was also evaluated by several researchers, with reported RMSE values
    ranging from ± 0.026 m3m−3 to ± 0.059 m3m−3. The Theta Probe was evaluated by
    several researchers, with reported RMSE values ranging from ± 0.022 m3m−3 to ±
    0.065 m3m−3. The lower accuracies observed in soil were higher variations in the
    soil texture observed and Ojo et al. (2015) reported that the general equation
    performs better in low-reactive, coarse-textured soils. Download : Download high-res

    sensor accuracy in general calibration. Based on the information provided in Table
    2 and the cited studies, it appears that general calibrations for soil moisture
    sensors can be a viable alternative to field-specific or soil-specific calibrations.
    For example, the study conducted by Vaz et al (2013), utilized the factory-supplied
    calibration equation in nine different soils, and average accuracy of the CS616
    observed is 0.128 m3m-3 which also support the previous research (Mittelbach et
    al., 2012; S.R. Evett et al., 2011). This accuracy is improved to ± 0.041 m-3m-3
    with an enhanced calibration, highlighting the need for improving factory-supplied
    calibrations (Udawatta et al., 2011). However, the accuracy of general calibrations
    depends on the calibration approach used. The linear and nonlinear calibration
    approaches have different effects on the accuracy of the sensors as shown in Fig.
    8. Table 2. Accuracies of various soil moisture sensors by using linear and nonlinear

    for soil moisture sensors and have found that nonlinear general calibrations can
    result in higher accuracy. For example, Vaz et al. (2013) evaluated both linear
    and nonlinear general calibrations for the 10HS and Theta Probe sensors in laboratory
    settings. They reported higher accuracy with the nonlinear general calibration
    for the 10HS sensor, with an RMSE of ± 0.073 m3m−3 for the linear general calibration
    and ± 0.029 m3m−3 for the nonlinear general calibration. Similarly, for the Theta
    Probe sensor, they reported an RMSE of ± 0.04 m3m−3 for the linear general calibration
    and ± 0.029 m3m−3 for the nonlinear general calibration. Kargas and Kerkides,
    (2008) also evaluated both linear and nonlinear calibrations for the Theta Probe
    sensor in the field, reporting an RMSE of ± 0.065 m3m−3 for the linear calibration
    and ± 0.054 m3m−3 for the nonlinear calibration. These findings suggest that the
    calibration approach used for soil moisture sensors can play an important role
    in achieving high accuracy with general calibrations. Therefore, it is important
    to carefully consider the calibration approach when using general calibrations
    for soil moisture sensors and to evaluate the accuracy of the sensors under different
    calibration approaches to ensure that the best approach is used. In summary, point
    calibration is the simplest and most straightforward method, while soil field-specific
    calibration and general calibration are more complex but lead to more accurate
    measurements in specific conditions or over a broader range of soil conditions.
    The choice of calibration method will depend on the application and the level
    of accuracy required. 6. Calibration methods for dielectric soil moisture sensors
    Dielectric soil moisture sensors encompass various principles such as capacitance,
    TDR, and TLO or FDR as mentioned in section 3.1. As observed in Table 1, current
    trends in soil moisture sensing predominantly rely on the relative soil dielectric
    permittivity for estimating VWC. The calibration process entails establishing
    a relationship between the measured relative dielectric permittivity and known
    volumetric water content through soil samples. Therefore, the primary focus is
    centred on dielectric-based calibration. Generally, soil moisture sensor calibration
    methods can be classified as laboratory calibration and field calibrations (Burns
    et al., 2014, Ojo et al., 2015). Field calibration requires obtaining gravimetric
    samples from the field being studied and then comparing them with the corresponding
    dielectric sensor readings obtained from the same location (Cosh et al., 2005,
    Dhakal et al., 2019, Stangl et al., 2009, Singh et al., 2021), while laboratory-based
    calibration involves adjusting the sensor readings with gravimetric sampling in
    a controlled environment (Adla et al., 2020). However, the choice of calibration
    method depends on various factors, such as the type of sensor, soil type, accuracy
    requirement, cost and time involvement, and the intended use of the measurements
    (Burns et al., 2014). In fact, each of these methods has its limitations and advantages.
    During field calibration, practically it is challenging to collect the gravimetric
    samples with very wet conditions and also for very dry conditions, specifically
    when the VWC falls within the range of 0 to 8 %. In these arid conditions, obtaining
    accurate gravimetric samples and corresponding sensor readings can be exceptionally
    difficult due to the limited availability of moisture. In very wet conditions,
    it is difficult to get sensor reading for dry soil condition. In such challenging
    circumstances, we found that laboratory calibration becomes a viable and pragmatic
    solution. By conducting laboratory calibration for the dry range, we can ensure
    the accuracy and reliability of the sensor calibration process (Stangl et al.,
    2009). 6.1. Laboratory calibration method There are two methods used for laboratory
    calibration of soil moisture sensors, wet-up and dry-down, which have been described
    by various authors in the literature. In the wet-up method, as described by Young
    et al. (1997), the soil sample is first weighed and then water is added at a known
    rate until the soil reaches saturation. The outputs from an inserted sensor in
    the soil column are recorded at regular intervals as the soil wets. In contrast,
    the dry-down method, as described by Bosch (2004), involves starting with a saturated
    soil sample and allowing it to dry out naturally while the sensor output is continuously
    recorded. To carry out laboratory calibration of soil moisture sensors, Burns
    et al. (2014) and Holzman et al. (2017) suggested a standard procedure as shown
    in Fig. 9. This procedure involves packing an oven-dried soil sample of known
    volume into a glass beaker, ensuring that the density of the soil sample is as
    similar as possible to the soil density in the field. The sensor probe is then
    inserted vertically into the soil column without touching the bottom or side wall
    of the beaker. The sensor is connected to a data logger and the output is recorded
    at 15-minute intervals. In addition, the weight of the soil sample is continuously
    observed and recorded by using weighing balance with data logger. It is advisable
    to use a data logger instead of relying solely on a traditional weighing balance
    to ensure accurate weighing of soil samples. This recommendation is based on the
    potential interference caused by the presence of a fan, which can occasionally
    disrupt the normal functioning of the weighing balance and result in inaccurate
    measurements. Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Configuration of the laboratory calibration experiment. The true
    VWC is calculated as Ojo et al.(2015): (7) where, is soil bulk density (ratio
    of the mass of dry soil to total volume of moist soil), WTi is the total weight
    (wet soil + probe), Wp is sensor probe weight, and WD is the dry weight of soil
    sample. For wet-up calibration, the distilled water is added to the oven-dried
    soil sample at a controlled rate. The controlled rate is determined to be suitable
    when the water is able to infiltrate without ponding into the soil sample (Champagne
    et al., 2010, Quinones et al., 2003). This process is continued until the soil
    is saturated or the output becomes almost constant. For dry-down calibration (Ojo
    et al., 2015), the saturated soil column was allowed to dry with a soil moisture
    sensor. At the same time, measure the change in weight of the soil column over
    time (Bosch, 2004, Huang et al., 2004). A small fan or dehumidifier must use to
    promote the evaporation. The procedure is considered complete when the evaporation
    becomes negligible or the change in weight of the soil column becomes negligible
    (Burns et al., 2014). It is important to note that for soil moisture sensor calibration,
    it is recommended to calibrate across a full range of soil water content conditions,
    from oven dry to saturation (Cosh et al., 2005). This is because incorporating
    a larger range of soil moisture conditions into sensor development can improve
    the transferability of the general calibration equation to different soils and
    environments (Rowlandson et al., 2018). The calibration equation is typically
    developed for these data using true volumetric water content (as truth) regressed
    with dielectric permittivity or voltage measurements from soil moisture sensor
    (Adla et al., 2020, Cobos and Chambers, 2010, Cosh et al., 2005). Research by
    Burns et al. (2014) suggests that the dry-down method is statistically more accurate
    than the wet-up method (Halley, 2016), particularly for soils with higher clay
    content. This is due to the fact that the dry-down method accounts for the natural
    variations in soil moisture content, providing more precise measurements (Rüdiger
    et al., 2010). However, it is important to note that the wet-up method can still
    be effective in certain soil types and should not be disregarded (Loiskandl et
    al., 2010, Seyfried et al., 2005). The laboratory-based soil moisture sensor calibration
    process is generally considered to be a more controlled and accurate method for
    calibrating soil moisture sensors, especially for sensors that are buried in the
    soil (Bell et al., 2013, Cosh et al., 2016) or used in a single location for a
    longer time. By following standardized procedures, researchers can obtain reliable
    calibration data, which can then be used to convert sensor output into soil moisture
    content. It is worth noting that although laboratory-based calibration is important,
    it is not always practical or feasible in the field (Colliander et al., 2017).
    In-situ calibration methods, such as comparing sensor data to manual soil moisture
    measurements, is useful alternatives when field-based measurements are required.
    6.2. Field calibration method Field calibration of a dielectric soil moisture
    sensor is a crucial step in ensuring accurate and reliable measurements in real-world
    applications. To perform a field calibration, it is important to select a field
    that represents the variability in soil water content and soil structure that
    the sensor will encounter in actual use (Caldwell et al., 2018). To calibrate
    the sensor, it is necessary to compare its output, which includes raw output data
    (voltage, and dielectric permittivity), with the gravimetric volumetric water
    content. Fig. 10 emphasizes the technique used for soil sampling for in situ or
    field calibration. The technique of collecting three soil samples from each field
    and averaging the results has been suggested as a potential solution to address
    the issue of sensor-to-sensor variability during field calibration of soil moisture
    sensors. The importance of this approach has been highlighted by several previous
    studies, including Cobos and Chambers, 2010, Cosh et al., 2016, Rowlandson et
    al., 2013 and Seyfried et al. (2005). Download : Download high-res image (619KB)

    method, where the sampling design at each sampling location is shown as a schematic
    diagram. Three-point measurements at a typical sampling location forming a triangle
    are for capturing spatial variability. A view of the gravimetric sample collection
    corresponding to Theta Probe measurement in the rice field is presented through
    photographs. This is a modified figure of Singh et al. (2021). The determination
    of gravimetric soil moisture content is achieved through the use of the oven dry
    method, (Gardner, 2018). The known volume of soil core sampler is required to
    collect the samples from the field. Then by using the dry bulk density (dry mass
    of soil / volume of soil sample) the gravimetric moisture content is converted
    to the soil VWC. Once the VWC is known, the sensor''s output is compared to this
    value. The relationship between the relative dielectric permittivity (εr) and
    VWC is established by using either linear or nonlinear equations. These equations
    can be used to develop a calibration curve that relates the dielectric permittivity
    of a soil to its corresponding VWC. Field calibration methods include in situ
    techniques such as neutron probes and gravimetric sampling. These methods measure
    the soil moisture content and provide a reference for calibrating the sensor (Leib
    et al., 2003). It allows for more accurate measurement of soil moisture, as it
    takes into account the real-world conditions that the sensor will encounter in
    the field (Chandler et al., 2004, Ojo et al., 2015, Singh et al., 2018, Stangl
    et al., 2009) including variations in soil type, temperature, salinity, soil structure
    (Caldwell et al., 2018, Geesing et al., 2004) and even unfrozen or frozen soil
    condition (Amankwah et al., 2022). However, field calibration can be challenging,
    time-consuming, and expensive, especially in remote or difficult-to-access areas
    (Caldwell et al., 2018, Cosh et al., 2005, Stangl et al., 2009). This can limit
    the use of dielectric-based sensors in some applications, particularly in areas
    where access is restricted. Furthermore, the calibration process can be influenced
    by various factors, such as changes in the soil structure over time or the presence
    of other materials in the soil, which can affect the accuracy of the readings.
    Though dielectric sensors have numerous advantages over other methods for measuring
    soil moisture, their practical application can be limited by the challenges associated
    with field calibration. Nonetheless, ongoing research is focused on improving
    the accuracy and reliability of these sensors, which may lead to increased use
    in various applications. In summary, while the field calibration of dielectric-based
    sensors can be challenging, it remains an essential aspect of ensuring the accuracy
    of soil moisture measurements in real-world conditions. 7. Linear and nonlinear
    approach for calibration of soil moisture sensor In the context of a dielectric
    soil moisture sensor, calibration refers to the process of establishing a statistical
    model/relationship between the measured dielectric permittivity of the soil and
    its corresponding moisture content. This relationship allows for a nearly accurate
    measurement of soil moisture content based on the dielectric properties of the
    soil. The approach of calibration used depends on the nature of the relationship
    between the dielectric permittivity and the moisture content, which can be linear
    or nonlinear. A linear calibration assumes a directly proportional relationship
    between the measured refractive index (which is square root of dielectric permittivity)
    and the soil moisture content, while a nonlinear calibration takes into account
    any deviations from linearity in this relationship. We examined previous research,
    including studies by Rowlandson et al., 2013, Vaz et al., 2013, Ojo et al., 2015,
    and Singh et al. (2021), which employed these two calibration approaches. The
    analysis revealed interesting insights and depicted in Table 2 and Fig. 11. For
    the generalized calibration of the Hydra probe sensor, Rowlandson et al. found
    similar root mean square error (RMSE) values for both linear and nonlinear calibration
    approaches indicating no significant improvement with either method. However,
    Vaz et al. (2013) reported similar observations in a generalized calibration setting.
    In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015) and Singh et al. (2021) reported improvements in
    RMSE when transitioning from linear to nonlinear calibration. Notably, all these
    studies consistently demonstrated improved RMSE values when employing nonlinear
    calibration for soil-specific calibration. Download : Download high-res image

    sensor accuracy using linear and nonlinear calibration approaches. These observations
    collectively suggest that the choice between linear and nonlinear calibration
    methods depends on the specific context and goals of the soil moisture sensor
    calibration. These insights have motivated to incorporate these approaches into
    a review, with the aim of providing valuable guidance to researchers and citizen
    scientists alike, enabling them to grasp the nuanced implications of these calibration
    methods in the context of point, soil-specific, and field-specific calibrations.
    7.1. Linear approach A widely used method for calibrating a dielectric soil moisture
    sensor that uses dielectric measurement involves establishing a linear relation
    between the sensor''s output and the gravimetric method based soil VSM. (Kelleners
    and Verma, 2010, Kim et al., 2020, Logsdon et al., 2010, Seyfried et al., 2005,
    Singh et al., 2021). The general form of this linear relationship is: (8) where
    εr (relative dielectric permittivity) and V (raw voltage) are the sensor outputs,
    and A and B are the calibration coefficients calculated empirically. According
    to Fig. 11, the linear approach results highest accuracy for the point scale calibration,
    with a median accuracy of ± 0.012 m3m−3. This suggests that linear calibration
    is highly effective for calibrating sensors at a specific point location (i.e.,
    fixed type soil moisture measurement for continuous measurements). The field-specific
    calibration has a median accuracy of ± 0.025 m3m−3, which lower than the point
    specific calibration, but still below the required accuracy of ± 0.04 m3m−3 for
    the satellite soil moisture product validations. The soil-specific calibration
    has a median accuracy of ± 0.031 m3m−3, indicating that calibration accuracy decreases
    when attempting to calibrate sensors across different soil types. The generalized
    calibration, typically developed for large-scale field studies, has demonstrated
    the lowest accuracy with a median accuracy of ± 0.048 m3m−3. The potential reason
    for this lowest accuracy of generalized calibration is the inclusion of diverse
    soil textural classes and field conditions across a large region, introducing
    potential nonlinear relationships that cannot be adequately captured through linear
    regression. This implies that linear calibration may not be the most effective
    method for calibrating sensor, particularly in the context of large-scale field
    studies. 7.2. Nonlinear approach Nonlinear equations are used to calibrate a dielectric
    soil moisture sensor, particularly when the relationship between the sensor''s
    output and soil moisture content is nonlinear (Bosch, 2004). Some examples of
    nonlinear equations that can be used for calibration include power equations,
    exponential equations, and second-order quadratic equations. The second-order
    quadratic equation is widely used as well as for the soil-specific calibration
    for both TDR and capacitance techniques. Studies conducted by Seyfried et al.,
    2005, Topp et al., 1980, Vaz et al., 2013 are using the second-order quadratic
    equation to calibrate the dielectric-based soil moisture sensors in the following
    format: (9) where, A, B, C, and D are calibration constants and εr is the relative
    dielectric permittivity. Fig. 11 shows the median accuracy for nonlinear calibration
    using different types of calibration approaches, i.e., point-specific, field-specific,
    soil-specific, and generalized. Similar to the linear approach, the nonlinear
    calibration approach for the dielectric soil moisture sensor also yielded the
    highest accuracy for point-scale calibrations and the lowest accuracy for generalized
    calibrations. However, as shown in Fig. 11, it is evident that the nonlinear approach
    consistently outperforms the linear approach in calibrating dielectric sensors
    across all calibration types, from point to generalized. The median accuracy for
    point-specific nonlinear calibration is ± 0.004 m3m−3, which indicates that this
    approach provides the highest accuracy for point-specific calibration. For field-specific
    calibration, the median accuracy for nonlinear calibration is ± 0.0085 m3m−3.
    The median accuracy for soil-specific nonlinear calibration is ± 0.028 m3m−3,
    which is higher than that for field-specific nonlinear calibration. The general
    nonlinear calibration approach has a median accuracy of ± 0.045 m3m−3, which is
    the lowest accuracy among the linear calibration approaches. From the data depicted
    in Table 2, we can observe that for developing the generalized calibrations, the
    nonlinear calibration approach has higher median accuracies compared to the linear
    calibration approach. However, it is also important to note that the difference
    in accuracy between the two approaches varies depending on the calibration type.
    For example, in the case of point-specific calibration, the nonlinear approach
    has a much better median accuracy compared to the linear approach, while in field-specific
    calibration, the difference is relatively smaller. It may not be practical or
    suitable to use specific (point or field or soil) calibration for large-scale
    study areas such as watersheds or agricultural areas. Over a large region, the
    soil type, salinity, and temperature might be different, and these factors are
    responsible for the determination of soil dielectric properties (Chen and Or,
    2006, Jacobsen and Schjønning, 1993, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). This implies
    that different soil types may have unique and complex interactions among their
    various components, resulting in different electric properties (Persson et al.,
    2001, Singh et al., 2021). This complexity is further compounded by the fact that
    previous studies have shown that the relationship between soil moisture content
    and the dielectric permittivity of soil can be affected by soil bulk density and
    porosity (Malicki et al., 1996). The complex dielectric response of soil makes
    it difficult to accurately describe the relationship between the dielectric permittivity
    and soil moisture content using linear regression methods alone (Persson et al.,
    2001, Persson and Bertacchi Uvo, 2003). To overcome this challenge, nonlinear
    models are often used to calibrate this relationship. However, these traditional
    nonlinear methods may struggle to capture the complex relationships between variables,
    which has led to the adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are machine
    learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of biological neural
    networks in the brain. ANNs are capable of learning complex relationships between
    input and output data and can be used to model nonlinear relationships and interactions
    between multiple input variables (Puri et al., 2016, Shanmuganathan, 2016). ANNs
    can account for interactions between multiple variables, including soil type,
    temperature, and organic matter content, which may affect the dielectric properties
    of soil. Therefore, ANNs are increasingly being used to model the relationship
    between soil properties and dielectric measurements. It has several advantages
    over traditional linear regression methods. One of the main benefits of ANNs is
    their ability to account for the effects of multiple soil properties on dielectric
    measurements, such as soil texture, temperature, and salinity, which can result
    in more accurate estimates of soil water content under a wider range of soil conditions
    (Namdar-Khojasteh et al., 2010, Singh et al., 2021). The calibration of the TDR
    soil moisture sensor by Zanetti et al. (2015) using ANNs achieved high accuracy,
    as evidenced by the low root mean square error (RMSE) values and high R2 values.
    Singh et al. (2021) compared a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to linear regression-based
    calibrations for estimating soil water content. The BNN-based approach outperformed
    the linear regression-based calibration, with a RMSE of less than ± 0.04 m3m−3.
    Singh et al. (2021) also suggested that the inclusion of soil physical properties
    as input into the BNN model further improved the calibration performance, yielding
    even lower RMSE value. Overall, ANNs have shown promise in accurately modeling
    the complex relationship between soil properties and dielectric measurements,
    providing a powerful tool for soil water content estimation (Arsoy et al., 2013,
    JingFeng et al., 2010, Persson et al., 2002). However, it is important to note
    that the accuracy of ANN models depends heavily on the quality and quantity of
    input data, as well as appropriate training and validation techniques (Köksal
    et al., 2011). However, one limitation of ANNs is that they require a large amount
    of data for training and validation (Shahid et al., 2019), and the results can
    be difficult to interpret in terms of the physical processes governing the relationship
    between the dielectric permittivity and soil water content (Singh et al., 2021).
    Overall, the use of ANNs for calibration is a rapidly evolving field, and the
    development of more advanced models, integration of additional data sources, and
    the application of more efficient training algorithms can further improve the
    accuracy of soil water content estimation. 8. Conclusions Soil moisture measurement
    plays a vital role in both agriculture and hydrology research, and the utilization
    of soil moisture sensors provides an efficient method of real-time measurements
    across the large study areas. Nonetheless, the calibration of these sensors is
    of paramount importance to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the obtained
    measurements. Researchers must aim to calibrate the sensors comprehensively, encompassing
    the entire spectrum of soil moisture conditions while accounting for variations
    in soil texture and different levels of soil wetness. This review aims to guide
    researchers in the selection of the most appropriate strategy for achieving precise
    soil moisture measurements. Prior to initiating the calibration process for the
    soil moisture sensor, it is essential to understand its working principles. Subsequently,
    assess factors influencing its accuracy, such as soil type, temperature, and salinity,
    in accordance with the sensor''s specifications. Additionally, consider cost implications
    during the calibration process. To align with the study''s specific requirements,
    carefully select the appropriate calibration strategies across various spatial
    domains, ranging from point-scale to regional-scale. Tailor the calibration methods
    and approaches to accommodate the prevailing environmental and soil, ensuring
    alignment with the necessary accuracy standards. In laboratory calibration, two
    primary methods are employed: wet-up and dry-down, with dry-down being more accurate
    for soils with higher clay content. While field calibration stands out as the
    optimal method, it demands a considerable investment of time and a collection
    of representative soil samples over a large area. Various calibration options
    are available, including soil-specific, field-specific, and generalized calibrations,
    among which point-specific calibration being the most accurate. Opting the field-specific
    calibration brings notable advantages, such as enhanced accuracy, reduced bias,
    and minimized overall errors. It is essential to acknowledge that developing a
    generalized calibration can be a time-saving and resource-efficient approach,
    especially when conducting extensive field measurements over a large region. Nevertheless,
    it is important to note that the accuracy of generalized calibrations for dielectric
    sensors is observed to be lower compared to point-specific and field-specific
    calibrations. Nonlinear calibration approach for dielectric sensor may yield higher
    accuracy compared to linear approaches, underscoring the importance of assessing
    sensor accuracy under different calibration approaches for optimal application.
    While a generalized calibration method proves practical and time-efficient for
    large-scale study areas, its accuracy may fall short in regions with diverse soil
    types, salinity variations, and temperature changes. Nonlinear calibrations, particularly
    those developed using ANNs, show promise in addressing the influences of multiple
    soil properties on dielectric measurements, as recently shown by Singh et al.
    (2021). This results in more accurate estimates of soil water content across a
    wider range of soil conditions. However, additional studies are needed to comprehensively
    evaluate the effectiveness of this approach across diverse soil types. In conclusion,
    the field of soil moisture sensing continues to evolve, and researchers should
    strike a balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness, considering variations
    in soil type, temperature, and salinity. The accurate calibration of soil moisture
    sensors across a full range of soil moisture conditions is crucial for reliable
    results. The selection of the most appropriate calibration method should be made
    based on the specific application, incorporating a thorough assessment of calibration
    accuracy to confirm the optimal approach. In this endeavor, the thoughtful application
    of the strategy outlined in Fig. 12 would be invaluable. Download : Download high-res

    of soil moisture sensor effectiveness and reliability, future research should
    prioritize the advancement of calibration techniques. This involves integrating
    multiple soil properties and exploring innovative approaches such as machine learning
    algorithms. Additionally, sustained efforts should be directed to evaluating the
    long-term stability and performance of these sensors, as well as establishing
    maintenance protocols to address any drift or changes in sensor accuracy. By continuously
    improving calibration methods and gaining deeper understanding of sensor performance,
    researchers can optimize the utility of soil moisture sensors and enhance their
    applicability across various fields. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  relevance_evaluation:
    extract_1: Soil moisture measurements are made using probes like TDR and capacitance
      sensors. They measure soil dielectric permittivity, which depends on the amount
      of water present in the soil.
    extract_2: Soil dielectric permittivity and volumetric water content are related
      through a calibration curve. The calibration of a soil moisture sensor involves
      comparing sensor output to the measured soil moisture content.
    limitations: 'The provided text discusses the calibration of soil moisture sensors
      but does not delve into the specifics of the paper "Advancements in dielectric
      soil moisture sensor Calibration: A comprehensive review of methods and techniques".
      Therefore, I am unable to provide a more nuanced response to the prompt.'

  description: The contribution of soil health to global health receives a growing
    interest, especially in urban environment. Therefore, there is a true need to
    develop methods to evaluate ecological functions provided by urban soils in order
    to promote smart urban planning. This work aims first at identifying relevant
    soil indicators based either on in situ description, in situ measurement or lab
    analysis. Then, 9 soil functions and sub-functions were selected to meet the main
    expectations regarding soil health in urban contexts. A crucial step of the present
    research was then to select adequate indicators for each soil function and then
    to create adapted reference frameworks; they were in the form of 4 classes with
    scores ranging from 0 to 3. All the reference frameworks were developed to evaluate
    soil indicators in order to score soil functions, either by using existing scientific
    or technical standards or references or based on the expertise of the co-authors.
    Our model was later tested on an original database of 109 different urban soils
    located in 7 cities of Western Europe and under various land uses. The scores
    calculated for 8 soil functions of 109 soils followed a Gaussian distribution.
    The scoring successfully expressed the strong contrasts between the various soils;
    the lowest scores were calculated for sealed soils and soils located in urban
    brownfields, whereas the highest were found for soils located in city parks or
    urban agriculture. Despite requiring a soil expertise, the proposed approach is
    easy to implement and could help reveal the true potential of urban soils in order
    to promote smart urban planning and enhance their contribution to global health.

    functionsSoil indicatorsEcosystem servicesUrban soils 1. Introduction What is
    soil health? Is it just a good way to communicate about the importance of considering
    soil or is it a useful concept that can be used for assessing soils (Powlson,
    2020)? Several definitions of soil health were proposed, as exposed by Janzen
    et al. (2021). Lehmann et al. (2020) saw soil health as being an overarching concept
    including soil fertility and soil quality, encompassing a broad range of ecosystem
    functions, services and actors. Faber et al. (2022) proposed soil health to be
    seen as the current condition of the soil compared to its potential (called soil
    quality) depending on its composition, climate and land use. In this latter definition,
    soil health is measured and compared to a potential as for Human beings where
    illness will reduce your well-being. Finally, the recent EU proposal for a directive
    on soil monitoring and resilience (EC, 2023) proposed to define soil health as
    the physical, chemical and biological condition of the soil determining its capacity
    to function as a vital living system and to provide ecosystem services. They also
    propose to use soil descriptors i.e. parameters describing a physical, chemical,
    or biological characteristic of soil health. In fact, whatever the definition,
    due to soil complexity a panel of descriptors or indicators are needed to understand
    soil functioning and assess all ecosystem services delivered. Soil health indicators
    have multiple aims (Jaenicke, 1998; Herrick, 2000): (1) expressing the actual
    state of a soil in terms of soil functions; (2) expressing changes in soil state,
    as a function of external drivers (i.e. environmental changes and management);
    (3) assessing the potential resistance and resilience of a soil in response to
    disturbance; (4) for land managers, optimizing the choice of actual and future
    land use as a function of soil health; (5) evaluating the contribution of a soil
    to ecosystem functions at a wider level. Apart from meeting the previous aims,
    their ease of measurement and cost-effectiveness are also expected (Dale and Beyeler,
    2001). The essential soil properties that express the state of the soil are: (1)
    physical (e.g., solid density, soil structure), (2) chemical (e.g., cation exchange
    capacity, pH), and (3) biological (e.g., soil enzymes, respiration) (Lal, 2016).
    A distinction can be performed between inherent (e.g. soil depth) and manageable
    (e.g., bulk density, nitrogen content) properties but also considering their evolution
    kinetics, from static (e.g., soil texture) to dynamic or rapidly changing (e.g.,
    soil temperature) properties; however, such considerations are not absolute and
    strongly context-dependent (Schwilch et al., 2016). In reviews about soil health
    or soil quality indicators, Zornoza et al. (2015), Bünemann et al. (2018), Faber
    et al. (2022) and Gatica-Saavedra et al. (2023) found that the most used properties
    were chemical (soil organic carbon content, pH, available P and K, total N, electrical
    conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and mineral N, in order of occurrence),
    followed by physical (water storage, bulk density, soil texture, structural stability
    and soil depth, in order of occurrence) whereas biological are less common (soil
    respiration, microbial biomass, invertebrate diversity and/or abundance, in order
    of occurrence). The selection of soil health indicators is notably influenced
    by the cost and time required to acquire them. A further step in the selection
    process is to consider the collinearity as well as the complexity of the relationships
    between indicators (O''Sullivan et al., 2017; Bünemann et al., 2018). As a consequence,
    the standard approach is to seek for a minimum dataset that can still enable policy-making
    and policy implementation (Stone et al., 2016). However, it is highly difficult
    to reach a small set of indicators due to the complexity of soil biota and functions
    (Bispo et al., 2009; Faber et al., 2022). At last, as mentioned by Bünemann et
    al. (2018): “An indicator is only useful if its value can be unequivocally interpreted
    and reference values are available”. It is essential to associate a reference
    framework to each soil property considering each soil function (Séré et al., under
    review). Indeed, a given soil property (e.g., soil texture) could be interpreted
    differently considering one soil function – water infiltration – or the other
    – water retention -. As highlighted by recent regulations in Europe and worldwide,
    the multifunctionality of soils and their capacity to deliver ecosystem services
    to societies are of increasing importance to land planners and decision-makers.
    These soil functions need to be estimated and visualised at relevant scales in
    order to improve their consideration in land planning decisions. Whereas there
    is increasing evidence that the improvement of ecosystem services increases the
    quality of life in cities (Tardieu et al., 2021), the contribution of urban soils
    remains strongly underestimated (O''Riordan et al., 2021). Urban soils exhibit
    a large diversity of properties but are dominantly perceived as degraded by stakeholders
    (Blanchart et al., 2018b). As a consequence, their potentials are not taken into
    account in urban planning even though they can deliver a range of ecosystem services
    (Blanchart et al., 2018a). For now, only a limited number of publications tackled
    the issue of linking soil indicators to soil functions and/or soil ecosystem services
    in the urban context. Calzolari et al. (2020) developed a framework that linked
    9 soil indicators to 6 soil functions, then connected to 6 ecosystem services
    that they applied to the urban soils of Capri. This seminal and inspiring work
    had some limits that include the collection of existing soil data set with a poor
    spatial resolution and the limited number of soil properties that were considered,
    consisting only of physical and chemical parameters. Meanwhile, they succeeded
    on calculating scores that were then mapped in order to identify hotspots of ecosystem
    services. On their side, Hyun et al. (2022) selected a novel urban soil quality
    indicator set in order to evaluate 6 soil functions (physical stability and support,
    water storage and infiltration, habitat provision, organic matter stabilization,
    nutrient supply and retention, pollutant immobilization and decomposition). Then,
    they expressed the soil quality as a function of a novel urban soil quality index.
    This valuable research only focused on top soil data that minimize the contribution
    of urban soils deeper horizons and was applied only to 9 locations. Our goal is
    to develop a method to reveal the true and poorly known potential of urban soils
    in order to promote smart urban planning and enhance their contribution to global
    health. Such a method relies on the creation of an integrated model to assess
    soil functions provided by urban soils. This paper starts with the identification
    and then the selection of bio-physico-chemical soil properties that meet the expected
    criteria: easy to implement, cost-effective and adequate to fulfil the expectations
    related to urban planning and regarding soil health. Then, an architecture was
    developed that connects soil indicators to expert-based reference frameworks that
    lead to an evaluation of the relevant soil functions. R code (R Core Team, 2023)
    was created to score and compare the soils in order to enlighten their actual
    and future potential in terms of land use and management. At last, it was tested
    on a variety of 109 urban soils across Western Europe. 2. Materials & methods
    2.1. Model definition 2.1.1. Workshop organization A group of 5 urban and agricultural
    soil scientist experts, involved in the SUPRA program (Ademe, grant number: 1772C0035),
    gathered a dozen times over 2 years in a workshop format to work on the architecture
    of the model. As proposed by Faber et al. (2022), a top-down approach was developed
    in order to: i) select the main ecosystem services to be delivered by urban soil,
    ii) identify the underlying soil functions, iii) review the parameters and indicators
    linked to each function and iv) then discuss and agree on the reference frameworks
    to establish and interpret each result (Table 1). The indicators linked to the
    different functions were first listed collectively. For each function, a pair
    of experts was then appointed as responsible for providing, for each indicator
    linked to the targeted function, the selection criteria and its reference framework.
    The pairs'' proposals were then discussed during workshops. The selection was
    made iteratively as the model was constructed. Table 1. Links between the functions
    and the indicators considered essential to reflect soil health. Indicators are

    based on literature survey To define a minimum set of indicators to be studied
    in urban context, the selection work was based on three elements: (1) the experience
    of the scientists involved in the research program SUPRA, (2) the work of three
    PhDs associated with the program (Blanchart, 2018; Cambou, 2018; Sauvaget, 2019),
    and (3) the search for state indicators or assessment tools available in the literature
    for urban soils. In three studies (Urban SMS, Vrščaj et al., 2008; UQualisol-ZU,
    2012; ENVASSO1), the indicator classification categories concerned general soil
    information and parameters of physical, chemical and biological soil properties.
    Contamination elements were treated separately. For the program SUPRA, the selected
    indicators had to satisfy three main ecosystem services selected by the scientist
    team: global climate regulation (via carbon storage), biomass provisioning and
    regulation of health and environmental risks linked to anthropic stresses in urban
    context. To inform these services, several functions have been identified, along
    with an initial list of the principal indicators required to adequately reflect
    the functions. Thus, six main functions have been selected to reflect soil quality
    and inform on the 3 ecosystem services. Certain functions have been divided into
    sub-functions in order to take into account the different possibilities associated
    with a given function. • Function “1 - Storage, recycling and transformation of
    organic matter” named “Organic matter cycle” reflects the soil''s capacity to
    store carbon. A good storage capacity will enable the development of the organic
    matter recycling function, which will depend mainly on biological activity (see
    also function 5 - Biodiversity support) and environmental conditions (e.g. presence
    of water, temperature). This function supports the service global climate regulation.
    • Function “2 - Retention and supply of nutrients (decomposition of organic matter)”
    named “Nutrient cycle” provides information on the soil''s capacity to supply
    plants, via their root systems, as well as soil organisms, with the nutrients
    required for their metabolic activity and development. Three sub-functions were
    listed: “2.1 Nutrient storage”, “2.2 Nutrient retention capacity” and “2.3 Nutrient
    recycling”. This function supports the service biomass provisioning. • Function
    “3 - Physical support – habitat” named “vegetation support” reflects the soil''s
    capacity to provide physical support for vegetation, as well as a habitat for
    biodiversity. For plants, the soil must anchor their roots and enable them to
    develop harmoniously without mechanical or physical constraints. This function
    supports the service biomass provisioning. • Function “4 - Water retention, circulation
    and infiltration” named “Water cycle” reflects, on the one hand, the soil''s capacity
    to retain useful water within its porosity (notion of useful reserve) and, on
    the other, the soil''s contribution to water infiltration (particularly rainwater),
    as opposed to run-off. This function is therefore linked to the ecosystem services
    of biomass supply and regulation of environmental risk through flood regulation.
    Two sub-functions were listed: “4.1 Water retention capacity” and “4.2 Water infiltration”
    in surface and along the profile. • Function “5 - Biodiversity support” reflects
    the soil''s capacity to support biodiversity. The indicators selected aim to qualify
    the presence and activity of different biological groups. Such function supports
    several ecosystem services and so the three ecosystem services selected. • Function
    “6 - Contaminant retention, filtration and degradation” named “Contaminant cycle”
    reflects the soil''s capacity to cope with contaminants. The indicators selected
    aim to qualify the presence or stock of contaminants, bearing in mind that their
    subsequent fate (infiltration, transfer, sorption, degradation, etc.) will depend
    in particular on biological activity (see function 5 - Biodiversity) and environmental
    conditions (e.g. flow properties, presence of water, vegetation, temperature).
    These elements have not been developed here, because if contaminants are found
    to be present, specific studies will have to be carried out to verify their compatibility
    with use. Thus, for this function, only stocks have been considered and supported
    the ecosystem service regulation of health and environmental risks. The set of
    indicators has been exhaustively listed to describe the selected functions of
    the soil (Table 1). As we wanted our approach to be used directly on the field,
    when doing the investigations, we also defined not only indicators measured with
    laboratory equipment but also in situ ones, using sensitive observations as for
    color, texture, structure. 2.1.3. Indicator selection The set of indicators to
    be selected must make it possible to define a list that combines both rapid, reliable
    and operational field observations/measurements and laboratory measurements or
    analyses. To define the set of indicators, the method used consisted in selecting
    the most relevant indicators based on various criteria: (1) usefulness of the
    indicators for assessing the functions and services selected, (2) complexity of
    assessment or measurement, and cost of acquisition, (3) significance of selected
    indicators vs. operationality for planners and stakeholders and (4) interactions
    between indicators. Moreover, as far as possible, indicators should be evaluated
    using value-range reference systems, and their acquisition should be based on
    well-defined measurement standards. For the research program SUPRA, 29 indicators
    - evaluated or measured in situ or in the laboratory - were selected among the
    60 previously listed in Table 1 (Table 2). The selection was based on: their relevancy
    towards soil functions, the availability of stabilized methods (standardized when
    available) and an existing reference framework. Operational and economic issues
    were also considered. Some soil indicators are used for estimating several functions
    or subfunctions. For example, soil texture is used in 6 functions or subfunctions,
    and bulk density in 4 of them. Some indicators are used in two functions or subfunctions
    like organic C. The other ones are used in only one function or subfunction. This
    is the case for instance of the diversity of soil biological communities. The
    expertise required for data acquisition and the average cost were evaluated by
    the scientist experts (Table 2). Table 2. List of indicators selected to contribute
    to the nine expected functions and subfunctions. Indicators are classified according
    to their mode of acquisition. The level of acquisition and the cost were estimated.

    and each function listed in Table 2, four value classes have been defined in order
    to assign it a score ranging from 3 (being a good value) to 0 (being the lowest
    one). The choice of value classes was based on literature data and/or expert opinion
    within the 5-person working group (cf.§2.1.1). To assess the accuracy of the value
    classes defined, a confidence index (CI) was assigned to each indicator based
    on the concordance of the sources of information used to define the value classes.
    The best score of 3 was awarded when several references available in the literature
    were in agreement, a score of 2 if several references were available but not in
    agreement and the programme''s experts had to choose the best reference, a score
    of 1 if only one reference was available and the experts gave an opinion, and
    finally a score of 0 if no reference was available. A relevance index (RI) was
    also estimated for each indicator to reflect its level of interest in calculating
    the function: a score of 3 indicated that the indicator was indispensable, a score
    of 2 that it was essential, a score of 1 that it was important but could be dispensed
    with for calculating the function because of the difficulty of acquiring it, and
    a score of 0 that it was not useful. A score was given either for the surface
    (e.g. slope, vegetation cover), for the soil profile (e.g. soil depth, earthworm
    density) or for a horizon. For each rated soil horizon, the notation value was
    weighted by its thickness relative to the total soil depth. This means that some
    of the values assigned to an indicator may be not integer values. The scoring
    method by function was based on the same aggregation principle as that developed
    in the Research program Destisol (Séré et al., under review; Ademe, grant number:
    1372C0059). This involved calculating an arithmetic average of the function indicators
    defined for the soil surface or profile or a horizon weighted by its thickness.
    The program''s experts developed the hypothesis that failure of certain indicators
    could strongly constrain the functioning of the soil. It was proposed to associate
    the notion of downgrading with certain indicators considered prohibitive in order
    to assign a score to the function (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5). This latter concept
    was preferred to that of indicator weighting, which remained complex to establish.
    For example, for the “infiltration (vertical vs. runoff)” function, we considered
    the “presence of surface crust” and “texture” indicators to be “downgrading”.
    This means that if one of these indicators has a score of 0, whatever the values
    of the other indicators, the function score will also be zero. Table 3. List of
    indicators to be described or measured directly in situ for the concerned functions
    and subfunctions (function 1 = organic carbon cycle; function 2.1 = nutrient storage,
    function 2.2 = nutrient retention capacity, function 2.3 = nutrient recycling;
    function 3 = vegetation support; function 4.1 = water retention capacity, function
    4.2 = water infiltration; function 5 = biodiversity support; function 6 = contaminant
    support). The rules of notation are defined between 0 and 3 (0 = bad value and
    3 = good value). For each indicator, confidence index (CI) and relevance index
    (RI) are defined between 0 and 3 (0 = bad value and 3 = good value). References
    are given when available, if no expertise is required. Indicator Function ID Situation

    and sub-functions have been scored individually and their mean value and sum could
    also be calculated to assess soil health. 2.1.5. Coding of the model The set of
    indicators was transcribed in an R program, via an Rstudio interface. The code
    aimed to make the indicator evaluation as accessible as possible for non R users,
    and to make easier any modification of valuation rules. Information on the different
    physicochemical properties came from a single Excel file, filled in by the different
    users. Output Excel files included scores of different indicators for each soil,
    and an indication of the quality of the scores obtained, according to the status
    of the various values given in the database: measured, estimated, or missing.
    The given proportion of missing values was essential to moderate the quality of
    the information, and possibly consider the need for new measurements to enrich
    the database. The current R program and input files will be later published. 2.2.
    Urban soils'' database The urban soils'' database, created on purpose, consists
    of 109 soil pits, located in 8 various cities across Western Europe, in 49 different
    sites. They are all located in urban or peri-urban areas in the following cities
    of France (FR) Switzerland (SW) and Spain (SP): FR-Angers (7 soils), SW-Lausanne
    (5 soils), FR-Marseille (16 soils), FR-Nancy (25 soils), FR-Nantes (18 soils),
    FR-Paris and peri-urban area (23 soils), FR-Rennes (2 soils), SP-Santiago de Compostela
    (13 soils). The corresponding climates of all locations are: i) Angers, Nantes,
    Rennes, Santiago de Compostela: Temperate oceanic climate; ii) Lausanne, Nancy,
    Paris: Temperate semi-continental climate; iii) Marseille: Temperate Mediterranean
    climate. The 109 soils that were observed, described, sampled and analysed had
    different land uses that were classified into 5 different classes: urban park
    (19 soils), sealed soil (5 soils), site under development, prior to any earthwork
    (35 soils), urban agriculture (19 soils), and urban brownfield (31 soils). Apart
    from the soil bio-physico-chemical parameters, only the soil cover was roughly
    described considering 4 different types: bare soil (24 soils), sparse vegetation
    (59 soils), dense vegetation (7 soils), garden vegetable (19 soils). The location
    and sampling strategy were various because of the method to create the database;
    whereas multiple soils were investigated on a single site, especially in Nancy,
    Marseille and Nantes, only one soil per site was dominantly studied in the other
    cities. To create such a large and original database, data were acquired in the
    frame of the SUPRA program but were also gathered from other research projects.
    As a consequence, not all the parameters that are required in our model were available.
    Overall, there was 21 % of missing data considering all soil indicators. Soil
    contamination is mostly concerned by lacking data (81 %) and inability to evaluate
    the linked function. This is due to the fact that some new indicators (e.g. linked
    to artefacts) are described on 19 % of samples only. Actually, some early campaigns
    did not include contamination aspects at all because no contamination was suspected
    (e.g. past use of the site). On the opposite, there was only 2 % of missing data
    regarding water retention and nutrient retention. By excluding soil indicators
    related to contamination, there was 13 % of missing data in our database. 3. Results
    3.1. Creation of reference frameworks for soil indicators to score soil functions
    Indicators were described in different tables according to the type of acquisition:
    in situ (Table 3), in situ and/or in the laboratory (Table 4) and only in the
    laboratory (Table 5). For each indicator, the function(s) concerned were specified.
    The observation type or sampling zone were then indicated: on the soil surface,
    on the entire soil profile or in each horizon. A unit of qualification or quantification
    was associated with each indicator. Then, the construction of reference frameworks
    had been performed. It consisted in the definition of upper and lower boundaries
    in 4 distinct classes for all soil indicators in all functions and sub-functions.
    It has to be noted that, for the same soil indicator, different reference frameworks
    could have been developed, depending on the functions or sub-functions considered.
    For example, “Coarse element content” (Table 4) was used to score 6 functions
    or sub-functions, and required 3 different reference frameworks to score them.
    This indicator could have opposite scores for the same reference: “lower bound
    >40” = 0 or 3 for functions 1–4.1 and function 4.2 respectively. When reference
    frameworks for some given soil indicators were available, their origins were specified
    in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. In Table 4, Table 5, which correspond to indicators
    measured or analysed in the laboratory, standards were also indicated when available.
    The fact that the indicator was possibly downgraded in terms of soil function
    was also specified. There were no degrading indicators for functions 1 (Organic
    matter cycle), 2 (Nutrient cycle), 5 (Biodiversity support). For function 3 (Vegetation
    support), only the “soil depth” indicator, with a value of <25 cm, was considered
    as downgrading. For sub-function 4.2 (Water infiltration), several indicators
    were downgraded because they did not enable the desired function to be fulfilled:
    (1) “surface situation” with a highly impermeable surface that favours runoff
    and not vertical infiltration, (2) “Horizon texture” for which the high clay content
    limits macroporosity and water infiltration and (3) “Coarse element content” with
    a volume value of <5 % does not favour water penetration into the soil. And finally,
    for function 6 (Contaminant cycle), several indicators were considered prohibitive
    for the use of a site: (1) “Land use history”, which may reveal a past that is
    certain to induce pollution in situ, (2) “Smell”, which is a characteristic indicator
    of the presence of certain pollutants, (3) “Horizon trace element” when values
    exceed authorized thresholds and (4) “Horizon trace organic pollutants” when values
    exceed authorized thresholds. For each soil indicator, the confidence and relevance
    indexes were estimated (Table 3, Table 4, Table 5). As defined in Section 2.1.4,
    the confidence index (CI) values of all the indicators were good and all between
    2 and 3. For the relevance index (RI), the values were also between 2 and 3 except
    for the “Pitfall-trap” indicator (Hedde et al., 2012; Auclerc et al., 2019) which
    had a value of 1 (Table 3). Indeed, this indicator required specific skills for
    soil macro and mesofauna identification. There is a strong operator effect in
    the determination of species which makes this indicator more sensitive to use
    and more variable. The total number of indicators used to assess the functions
    or sub-functions ranged from 5 (Function 4.1 Water retention capacity) to 13 (Function
    6 Contaminant cycle) (Table 2). Six functions (Function 1 Organic matter cycle,
    Function 2.1 Nutrient storage, Function 2.3 Nutrient recycling, Function 3 Vegetation
    support, Function 4.1 Water retention capacity, Function 4.2 Water infiltration)
    would require a low number of indicators - 5 to 7 - which are often indicators
    that are easy to describe or measure (Table 2). Functions linked to biomass provisioning
    (i.e. sub-functions 2 that express nutrients storage, retention capacity and recycling,
    function 3 that expresses roots anchorage and sub-function 4.1 that expresses
    water retention for plants) integrated all soil indicators linked to plant growth
    including the soil structure and depth for roots development, the access to water
    and nutrients and the presence of soil organisms and their activity. Function
    2.2 (Nutrient retention capacity) required the determination of 9 indicators,
    7 of which were determined in the laboratory. However, these indicators are measured
    or analysed routinely and do not require specialist expertise. Function 5 “Biodiversity
    support” was assessed by 8 indicators, 5 of which were determined solely with
    field observations and determinations as the depth of plant roots, abundance of
    soil invertebrates (through Barber pot or earthworms counting) and/or the presence
    of soil engineering fauna through its activity (e.g. burrow, casts) were included.
    At laboratory step, measurements of bacterial amount and activity through respectively
    DNA quantity assessment and enzymatic activities were also included. Doing so,
    several groups of organisms were included in our evaluation process that included
    abundance, diversity and activity and required considerable skill in terms of
    species identification. Note that all references come from agricultural situations.
    Function 6 “Contaminant cycle” was the most demanding in terms of the number of
    indicators (13) to be determined in order to satisfy an appropriate interpretation.
    This function focused on the stock of contaminants because modelling retention
    was considered too complex to achieve with a reduced dataset. The potential of
    degradation was not considered either because it could be derived from the biodiversity
    index and may be interesting only when organic contaminants are present. Contaminant
    infiltration was linked to the infiltration capacity of soils which is already
    considered in the water function. The soil retention capacity of contaminant depended
    on the contaminant itself and on the presence of organic and mineral bearing phases
    (like SOM, clay, iron or manganese oxi(hydro)xides), as well as on the physico-chemical
    properties of soil (pH, Eh, temperature) and humidity. The indicators considered
    to feed to the soil contaminant stock function help verify if there is a contamination
    issue or not. Most of them were considered as downgrading factor (Table 3, Table
    4). Land use history must be studied first in the office to verify the presence
    of any former activity that may have led to point source contamination (e.g. industrial
    or service activity, mining). Field observation were essential to find out traces
    of such activity. In case of a contamination issue, a verification of the compatibility
    between soil quality and the future use is first necessary. In case of incompatibility,
    either a change of use or the management of the pollution is mandatory. Because
    anthropogenic deposits are numerous in the urban area, and may be intrinsically
    contaminated (Le Guern et al., 2018a), attention must be paid to the presence
    of artefacts. They were classified according to their intrinsic potential of pollution
    and to their color (Table 3). T4 refers to materials with a high potential of
    pollution like industrial waste such as slag, fly ash, or tar, T3 to demolition
    materials that show often higher PCB contents (Le Guern et al., 2016, Le Guern
    et al., 2017, Le Guern et al., 2018a). Considering that some materials of natural
    origin may be enriched in trace elements, a special class (T0.5) was set to take
    this into account. As a consequence, in situ natural materials in place with a
    potential natural enrichment in trace element were considered together with this
    type of anthropogenic deposits. In addition, smell was also an easy parameter
    to detect some contamination issues (like fuel, solvent or benzene). Finally,
    the content of trace organic pollutants (TOP) and trace elements (TE) were necessary
    to attest the level of contamination. Table 6 shows the threshold values selected,
    based on the French references for excavated material management and pedo-geochemical
    national reference values. The ‘2xNPGB’ threshold value (Table 4) was expected
    to be replaced as soon as available by LPGB (local pedo-geochemical background)
    values. Some organic volatile substances were integrated in the list. Attention
    must be paid to the sampling procedure for such substances. The threshold A values
    proposed for organic pollutants refer to a relative sensitive reuse of excavated
    soils in redevelopment projects (under 30 cm of a topsoil layer in green space,
    under building or parking) (Coussy et al., 2020). Threshold C values correspond
    to higher values admitted for less sensitive use (road or landscape). Specific
    values may be calculated through sanitary risk assessment based on exposure scenarios
    linked to the current or future soil use. Table 6. Threshold values for contaminants

    3.2. Scores of soil functions Scores have been calculated for 8 soil functions
    and sub-functions based on the data from the 109 soil pits (13 % of missing data,
    with a limited influence that was not assessed here). Overall, considering all
    soil functions and all soils, scores were ranging from 0 to 3, the average score
    being 1.66 ± 0.3. The distribution of the scores of all functions (872 scores)
    was of Gaussian-type (Fig. 1). The most frequent scores were between 1.5 and 2
    (339; 39 %), then between 2 and 2.5 (210; 24 %) and between 1 and 1.5 (178; 20
    %). The rarest scores were 3 (1; 0.1 %), between 0 and 0.5 (9; 1 %), 0 (34; 4
    %), between 0.5 and 1 (53; 6 %), and between 2.5 and 3 (48; 5 %). Download : Download

    of the scores of soil functions calculated by the model for the 109 studied soils.
    The functions “Nutrient retention capacity”, “Vegetation support”, “Water retention”,
    “OM cycle” and “Water infiltration” were relatively high and almost similar (respectively
    1.79 ± 0.37, 1.79 ± 0.52, 1.76 ± 0.47, 1.73 ± 0.41 & 1.66 ± 1.01) (Fig. 2). “Nutrient
    storage” and “Nutrient recycling” scores were slightly above the average score
    (respectively 1.58 ± 0.5 & 1.52 ± 0.41). The lowest scores are the one for “Biodiversity”
    (1.42 ± 0.61). The highest variations were noted for “Water infiltration”, “Biodiversity”,
    “Vegetation support” and “Nutrient storage” (respectively 1.01, 0.61, 0.52 and
    0.50) and the smallest for “Nutrient retention capacity (0.37). There were 34
    “0” scores, mostly for “Water infiltration” (27 soils) - due to the presence of
    multiple sealed soils -. Oppositely, the only 3 score was also accounted for “Water
    infiltration”. Apart from these 8 functions, the scores of the function “Contaminants
    cycle” was considered apart, due to the high ratio of missing data; it has the
    highest medium score (2.67 ± 0.6) expressing the fact that a limited number of
    the studied urban soils exhibited significant contamination. Download : Download

    various soils but with a dominance of soils sampled during urban development projects.
    Twenty-three soils had mean scores between 2 and 2.5 and sums of soil functions
    between 18 and 22/27; they were all located in city parks. Surprisingly, the soil
    with the higher score (mean value of 2.45 and sum of 20/24) is a spontaneously
    revegetated urban brownfield located in Marseille that was left over for many
    years. Interestingly, another soil from the same site had also a high score (mean
    value of 2.29 and sum of 18/24) considering all functions except “contamination”;
    but, for this last and crucial function in the urban context, the score is 0/3
    - based on the acquired indicators - expressing a high contamination that leads
    to a strong degradation of soil functioning. Download : Download high-res image

    sorted by soils ID. 4. Discussion 4.1. Adapting the scores to urban soils As stressed
    for the indicators used to assess biodiversity, the main existing reference frameworks
    come from agricultural context since only limited operational researches have
    been conducted on urban soils. The situation is different for the concentration
    of contaminants in soils as several references already exist (see Table 6) for
    urban soils since trace elements and organic contaminants are currently measured
    in urban situations. For all other indicators, references in agricultural soils
    compared to urban ones may be quite different. As an example, Joimel et al. (2017)
    showed that agricultural soils exhibited lower abundance and diversity of soil
    microarthropod than urban soils - being strongly diverse - that were similar to
    forest soils. This point should be improved by investigating more urban sites
    to develop proper references. Note that quite all reference values (e.g. NPGB,
    Table 6) considered in this work are relevant at French scale. Monitoring urban
    soils should help defining reference values at all national scales across Europe.
    All the data should then feed open databases for further reuse as stressed by
    the recent EU proposal for a directive on soil monitoring and resilience (EC,
    2023). Such interoperable databases (local-national-Europe-International) appear
    necessary in this frame. One challenge relies in harmonised analytical protocols,
    knowing that different ones are used at the moment according to countries or objectives
    (e.g. agronomical study vs pollution diagnosis). 4.2. Promoting a use of a wider
    set of soil indicators None of the samples available in our database was fully
    informed. This comes from the fact that several sites were investigated before
    starting the current research. Some parameters have been estimated while others
    are missing which impacts the scoring of several functions and subfunctions. It
    is expected that the proposed minimum dataset will be fully measured in the future,
    becoming sort of a reference protocol for data acquisition to assess urban soils
    health and subsequent decision making. For instance, a better description of the
    nature, abundance and impacts on soil functions of artefacts should be strongly
    promoted. The trace organic pollutants to be analysed depends on the context of
    each site, which should be better taken into account in the function assessment.
    Persistent substances should be systematically analysed. Volatile substances,
    which need particular caution during sampling, should be checked only if expected.
    Obviously, a comparison of our suggested minimum dataset of soil health indicators
    to others should also be strongly encouraged. Some parameters determined at lab
    also suffer yet from high technicity and are still costly. Bulk density in particular
    is used in 4 subfunctions. Further research activity to ensure easy field acquisition
    is mandatory to check variability and render its acquisition easier with less
    error. Microbial DNA and enzymatic activities are also still costly but appear
    really relevant. Innovation is in progress and still needed to make such analyses
    less costly. For all parameters, sampling caution is mandatory, all the more as
    urban soils are heterogeneous. Urban soil mapping needs further research efforts
    to define soil units and precise their degree of heterogeneity. 4.3. Architecture
    of the model Our method is based on the diagnosis of soils, considered as 3D ecosystems
    constituted of natural or anthropogenic soil horizons. A selection of 29 soil
    indicators has to be described, measured and analysed by soil experts at the field
    or in the lab. These data are subsequently transformed into scores for 9 soil
    functions and sub-functions. A limited number of similar approaches have been
    conducted for now. Van Leeuwen et al. (2017)) assessed which soil attributes can
    be used as potential indicators of five soil functions in an agricultural context:
    (1) primary production, (2) water purification and regulation, (3) carbon sequestration
    and climate regulation, (4) soil biodiversity and habitat provision and (5) nutrient
    recycling. These authors focused on data of the upper soil horizon. They did not
    consider any indicator related to soil contamination for assessing the health
    of agricultural soil, while it is not negligible in urban context, since pollution
    linked to anthropogenic activity is frequent and can, as demonstrated here, lead
    to a strong degradation of soil functioning. Furthermore, unlike them, the “nutrient
    cycle” reference frameworks of our model are based on expectations in terms of
    landscape aesthetics or overall biomass production, but not on agronomic requirements
    as they did. At last, Van Leeuwen et al. (2017) also considered a parameter of
    relevancy, similar to our Relevance Index, but they also assessed the sensitivity
    of each indicator depending on the functions and considered weighting factors
    applied to the different indicators. Calzolari et al. (2020) focused on 9 input
    parameters that are not only soil properties (land use, land capability, pH, organic
    carbon, bulk density, soil texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, moisture
    at field capacity, average shallow groundwater depth) that are connected to six
    soil functions (potential habitat for soil organisms, filtering and buffering,
    carbon sequestration, food provision, water regulation and water storage). This
    early work has been expanded by Ungaro et al. (2022) by adding five new input
    parameters (leaf area index, analysis of presence and diversity of microarthropods,
    cation exchange capacity, rooting soil depth, coarse fragment content). Their
    indicators were scored from 0 to 1 with various standardization methods and were
    successfully translated into maps of ecosystem services hotspots at the scale
    of Carpi (Italia). Hyun et al. (2022) proposed a set of indicators to “represent
    the soil quality of metropolitan cities and develop a novel urban soil quality
    index”. They selected 9 bio-physico-chemical soil indicators (bulk density, saturated
    hydraulic conductivity, depth of litter layer, texture, cation exchange capacity,
    fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity, pH, available nitrogen, total concentrations
    in 6 trace elements) to evaluate six soil functions (physical stability and support,
    water storage and infiltration, habitat provision, organic matter stabilization,
    nutrient supply and retention, pollutant immobilization and decomposition). They
    also used these soil functions to assess 10 ecosystem services and applied the
    method on 36 soils from 2 South-Korean cities. At last, the Destisol model (Séré
    et al., under review) selected 20 soil properties to evaluate 15 soil functions
    that have been later associated with soil covers to assess 18 ecosystem services.
    This method is strongly connected to our approach that aimed at improving it by
    considering a larger spectrum of soil indicators and strengthening the construction
    of the reference frameworks. Compared to the ones that are mentioned above, the
    model that has been here developed lies on a larger number of soil indicators.
    If it promotes a wider apprehension of soil health, limits of such an approach
    are: i) the necessity of a solid soil science expertise to acquire all of them,
    ii) the time needed, iii) a substantial budget required (a rough estimate of cost
    analysis, depending on the country, would be between 300 and 500 € sample−1, without
    considering the opening of the soil pit). Note that for the latter the budget
    needed of the assessment of soil functions may be quite insignificant if considering
    the overall land planning operations (e.g. building new houses, developing a commercial
    area). Three major perspectives arose. The first one would be to take into account
    the soil cover and/or the land use as it may affect the capacity of a soil to
    function. For example, an actual sealed soil health could strongly be improved
    by desealing and greening operations. Furthermore, the type of vegetation (e.g.
    lawn or tree) could influence some specific functions (e.g. water infiltration,
    biodiversity). The second one would be to go one step further by conducting an
    assessment of ecosystem services. However, such additional step could be achieved
    only by considering not only the soil compartment but also the vegetation and
    possibly the human infrastructure that would have a significant contribution (Blanchart
    et al., 2018a). At last, a crucial ambition would be to be capable of mapping
    soil functions and sub-functions and, if possible, soil health at small and larger
    scales. This would require a sufficient density of information on soil cover,
    which for now is complex to imagine considering the strong spatial variability
    of urban soils. 4.4. Towards a decision support method Soils from our cities exhibit
    a high diversity and heterogeneity without no equivalent in the nature (Morel
    et al., 2005; Béchet et al., 2009). However, urban soils actually provide a wide
    range of ecological functions and ecosystem services that appear to be essential
    for the viability of urban areas to face multiple environmental issues (O''Riordan
    et al., 2021; Morel et al., 2023). From a wider perspective, considering the connection
    between human, animal and environmental health, having soils in bad health in
    urban areas - places with the highest concentration of population - could significantly
    damage our living conditions (van Bruggen et al., 2019). As a consequence, there
    is a true need of method to reveal the poorly known potential of urban soils in
    order to improve urban planning. Our method has been tested on a database of 109
    different urban soils. It has led to a wide range of scores that revealed their
    strong differences in terms of soil health that are influenced by their actual
    land use, but not restrictively correlated to it. Such information could be truly
    useful to orientate urban planning in order to: i) preserve the healthiest soils
    from artificialization; ii) promote the valorisation of healthy urban soil instead
    of scrapping and landfilling them before replacing them by agricultural top soil
    for urban greening; iii) anticipate the remediation of soils in poor health; iv)
    target the most degraded soils for the most degrading anthropogenic land uses
    (e.g. sealing, excavation). In order to be considered by urban planners and embedded
    in a smart urban planning process, the urban soils need to be characterized. Apart
    from soil functions and soil health scoring methods - such as the one that is
    presented in this paper - it would also require a larger network of urban soils
    experts that could perform such a critical fieldwork and transform the acquired
    information into efficient and transferable information, soil maps being one of
    the possibilities. 5. Conclusion This work aimed to propose and test a robust
    and science-based method, using urban soil indicators, to reflect the soil''s
    ability to perform different functions and to reflect soil health. These indicators
    range from bio-physico-chemical soil parameters to levels of contamination or
    biological activity in a broadest sense. The “calibration” part of the reference
    frameworks was an essential and complex phase to carry out in order to interpret
    the descriptions, measurements and analyses of the urban soil indicators as accurately
    and explicitly as possible. Our method was based on a scoring system for soil
    functions and sub-functions, itself based on a scoring system for each indicator
    selected by an expert or group of experts. As can already be seen when describing
    agricultural or natural soils, the values produced for the indicators will depend
    very much on the characteristics of the area studied and the opinions of the experts.
    This is why, in order to propose a generic method for assessing the health of
    urban soils, it is essential to move on from this definition and calibration phase
    to a validation phase. This will be developed in future national and EU projects.
    In order to improve the metrics of the scores, a comparison of the model results
    with the field assessment of soil health by various soil experts could be valuable.
    The results obtained show the wide disparity of soil functions and sub-functions''
    scores in the contrasted urban soils that have been studied. This research has
    led to the creation of a first version of a tool that takes into account soil
    potential (multi-criteria evaluation integrating soil depth and volume). By definition,
    such a model aims at assessing soil functions which is a concept, without any
    explicit metrics. To move forward a “calibration-like approach”, the scores calculated
    by the model needs to be confronted to the deep and long-time knowledge of soil
    experts can interpret, in their own field of expertise (e.g. agronomy, soil hydraulics,
    soil contamination), the functioning of soils. Furthermore, comparing the scores
    to middle up to long-term monitoring of carbon sequestration, biomass production,
    water balance would be of true interest. In addition, the opportunities and limits
    of its application to a wider diversity of situations, including agricultural,
    forest or natural soils shall be explored. The semi-quantification of the soil
    functions selected in this research programme should promote and optimize the
    allocation of land uses during the urban planning process by taking into account
    the expected and potential ecosystem services. More ambitiously, the setting up
    (at national, European or even international) soil monitoring networks in urban
    environments, could enhance the establishment of metric for ecosystem functions
    and services. It would be an ambitious but decisive objective for meeting the
    environmental challenges of sustainable cities that would perfectly fit into such
    decisive initiative as the recent European Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience.

    are a valuable food source, rich in proteins, fibre, antioxidants, and a variety
    of vitamins and minerals. However, their cultivation requires extensive training
    and considerable relevant expertise in order to fine-tune multiple environmental
    parameters [8]. These parameters are heat, humidity, illumination, and ventilation,
    and they should be controlled precisely for successful mushroom cultivation. Otherwise,
    the mushroom yield will be adversely affected or contaminated. The tragic conflict
    in Syria during the last decade caused the migration of many skilled farmers and
    a great loss of cultivated territories. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and
    its resulting international economic crises, such as supply chain crisis, have
    exacerbated these bad situations, threatening food security and adequate nutrition
    sources. Many Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries are working in agriculture
    and are involved in small/medium-scale mushroom production industry. For example,
    a large number of mushroom farms are operated by Syrian refugees in Turkey, where
    the total Turkish mushroom production was 55,455 tons in 2020 [19]. An 85 m2 mushroom
    oyster farm/greenhouse with a capacity of 1000×10-kg bags in Turkey can produce
    about 2700–3000 kg of mushroom every cycle. On the other hand, internally displaced
    Syrians in the Northern regions of Syria rely on very small-scale traditional
    mushroom production, which cannot meet their local demand. For example, a 3 ×
    4 m2 conventional oyster mushroom farm in these regions can produce about 300–400
    kg every cycle. Moreover, imported mushrooms are not readily available and would
    be unaffordable. To the best of our knowledge, no accurate statistics are available
    for the Syrian mushroom industry. Many international and local Non-Governmental
    Organizations (NGOs), such as the International Agricultural Cooperation Organization
    (IACO) and Shafak, working for Syrian refugees, have mushroom cultivation projects.
    They have reported significant difficulties and challenges in mushroom cultivation
    amongst the targeted beneficiaries, mostly housewives, even after providing them
    with materials and preliminary training, due to the complexities of controlling
    the environment [5]. These difficulties and challenges result in high failure
    rates amongst insufficiently experienced growers when trying to handle the multiple
    interfering environmental factors affecting and contaminating mushrooms. These
    reasons were the motivation behind this study to design and implement a smart,
    affordable mushroom cultivation system, which simplifies the mushroom production
    process for organic mushroom farmers, especially for internally displaced and
    refugee Syrians. Smart farming generally utilizes various information and communication
    technologies (ICT) [21] for sustainable agriculture to save resources and improve
    the efficiency and the yield of the farm through remote monitoring and management
    [22]. Many recent surveys [1,6,7] have reviewed smart agriculture techniques,
    opportunities and challenges for various types of agriculture and crops. For mushroom
    cultivation, traditional methods have been used for a long time, but incorporating
    state-of-the-art technologies for monitoring and controlling the cultivation process
    has been recently investigated. Smart technologies were introduced to mushroom
    cultivation quite recently, especially for small and medium-scale mushroom production.
    Angral and Thakur [2] classified current mushroom-growing systems into Programmable
    Logic Controller- (PLC)-based, microcontroller-based and IoT-based systems. However,
    this paper did not illustrate either the IoT platform or the data acquisition
    tools used for this work. Thong-un and Wongsaroj [17] used smart wireless industrial
    PLC for wireless monitoring, controlling, and propagating information to a database
    in order to enhance oyster mushroom productivity in Thailand. The wireless PLC
    node reads the different environmental parameters, such as temperature and humidity,
    through sensors to control spraying, water sprinkles and cooling fans. Onsite
    and remote monitoring and control of the mushroom farming system were available
    through onsite human-machine interface (HMI) screens or web applications. The
    system architecture, components, and working method are well explained and illustrated,
    but the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) and air quality inside the mushroom farm
    was not discussed in this work. Another similar system was developed in Malaysia
    by Ten et al. [16] for an automated controlled environment mushroom house (CEMH)
    using remote terminal unite, ADAM-3600, internet of things (IoT) technologies
    and different sensors for temperature, humidity, light and CO2. These two systems
    have proven to be dependable industrial systems, but their cost is relatively
    high. Similar industrial systems for automating a one-room mushroom farm could
    cost about $1500-$2000 in Turkey, excluding the set-up and online software costs
    of the system. Other cost-efficient solutions using inexpensive microcontrollers
    and sensors are also available. Some of these systems [10,11,14,15] were only
    used for monitoring the mushroom farm, while others [8,12] provided remote monitoring
    in addition to management and control of the farm. Inexpensive off-the-shelf sensors
    were utilized for humidity, temperature, CO2 and light, such as DHT11, DHT22,
    LM35, MQ135 and BH1750 sensors. The NodeMCU (ESP8266) was mostly used for connecting
    to the internet, while Arduino platforms were mostly utilized as controllers.
    Existing software products, such as Blynk and ThingSpeak, were mostly used for
    remote access and monitoring. The main problem with such inexpensive systems,
    which could cost about $100-$150, is related to dependability as most of these
    proposed systems were not tested in real environments. Conversely, He et al. [4]
    constructed not only the remote monitoring and management (RMM) system but also
    the whole mushroom cultivation farm in a dedicated container with 3 m x 3 m x
    9 m dimensions. They built a Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) system to
    provide fresh crops in urban areas, but they did not take the cost and yield of
    such container farms into account. Recently, emerging technologies of computer
    vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) have been used in mushroom cultivation for
    different purposes, such as the classification of mushroom spawn quality [18]
    and mushroom caps measurement [9]. Yin et al. [20] have surveyed different computer
    vision and machine learning technologies used in the mushroom industry reviewing
    related papers between 1991 and 2021. Recent related research [12] has implemented
    a mushroom automation system using a sensing module (BME260) for humidity and
    temperature, ESP8266 for wireless connection and ESP32 SoC as a controller, which
    gets the environmental parameters from the sensing module to control the mushroom
    farm automation. They also utilized a camera module with machine learning algorithms
    implemented on Raspberry Pi for classifying toxic mushrooms. Thus, the existing
    mushroom cultivation systems are either expensive industrial systems or unreliable
    inexpensive ones. Additionally, CV and ML technologies have shown promise in smart
    mushroom cultivation and could provide extra functionalities, such as disease
    detection, yield prediction, growth analysis and cost/power efficiency, if edge
    computing (EC) and digital twinning were included to provide an affordable dependable
    mushroom cultivation system with full remote access and monitoring [20]. Against
    this backdrop, the goal of this study was to deploy state-of-the-art emerging
    technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) techniques, for acquiring and analysing data from different sensors and cameras
    to remotely monitor and control the environmental conditions inside the mushroom
    farm, and for future research on growth analysis and disease detection problems.
    The main contributions of this paper include designing and implementing three
    different sensing nodes with different costs, in addition to two different control
    nodes to be affordable for various mushroom farmers. Furthermore, simple web and
    desktop user-friendly interfaces were implemented to facilitate the remote monitoring
    and management of the farm. Finally, an analysis of sensing node readings and
    obtained results has been made. 2. Materials and methods The proposed mushroom
    cultivation system can generally be divided into three main layers shown in Fig.
    1: The first layer is the monitoring/controlling physical layer, which is composed
    of sensors for environmental data acquisition, such as temperature, humidity,
    soil/composite temperature, composite moisture, air quality, CO2, illuminance,
    and cameras. Besides the sensors, there are actuators for controlling the different
    devices of the farm, such as air conditioners, humidifiers, sprinklers, extractor
    fans, and circulating fans. The second layer is composed of the edge boards, which
    regulate the data acquisition process and perform the required processing for
    precise and efficient controlling of the farm actuators. At the same time, they
    provide a connection to the cloud which constitutes the third layer of the proposed
    system, where different types of data ultimately exist. Download : Download high-res

    of smart mushroom cultivation system. The system is designed on the assumption
    that the farm is equipped with the necessary devices and infrastructure for oyster
    mushroom cultivation. Additionally, an electrical power source and internet access
    were available at the farm. In a situation where this may not be the case, alternative
    power and internet solutions will be required for the system to be implemented.
    For example, in off-grid rural areas, alternative power sources such as solar
    energy systems can be used to provide electricity, as is commonly done in off-grid
    areas in Northern Syria nowadays. To access the internet, mobile and satellite
    internet connections can be used. Fig. 2 shows a more specific block diagram of
    the proposed system, which is composed of sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers
    connected to an IoT platform. The sensors are used for monitoring the main environmental
    parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity, composite temperature, composite
    moisture, air quality, CO2, and illuminance. Besides, different cameras are utilized
    for monitoring the farm and capturing images to be used in future research for
    growth analysis using AI and ML techniques. Actuators manage and control the farm
    devices, such as air conditioners, humidifiers, and fans. Furthermore, the system
    utilizes ThingSpeak as an IoT platform for remote monitoring and management. Download

    Mushroom cultivation system block diagram. The proposed system was implemented
    and tested in a local oyster mushroom farm in Mersin, on Turkey''s Mediterranean
    coast. Generally, the climate is mild and wet in winter, with temperatures ranging
    between 8 and 15 °Celsius, and it becomes hot and humid in summer, with temperatures
    around 30 °Celsius. The farm has 14×7 m2 area and a maximum capacity of 1000 of
    10-kg mushroom bags, on its 4-storey shelves. Different types of sensing nodes
    were implemented and tested in the farm. The experiments were conducted for two
    cultivation cycles starting from late December 2022 until late April 2023. Different
    free IoT platforms, such as Blynk, Arduino IoT and ThingSpeak, were trialled.
    Blynk and Arduino IoT platforms offer user-friendly platforms with very limited
    capabilities for the free version. However, a free account on the ThingSpeak platform
    provides higher capabilities and allows 10 million messages a year with 3 years
    of data storage. ThingSpeak permits instant visualizations of data posted by the
    farm sensors, such as temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture data,
    which can be remotely monitored. Additionally, it shows the On/Off status of remotely
    controlled devices, and can perform data analysis and processing with all MATLAB™
    capabilities. Thus, it can present an efficient IoT system for the mushroom farm
    without the need to set up servers or develop dedicated web software. All of these
    made ThingSpeak more preferable for the system addressed here. 2.1. Sensing nodes
    To provide remote monitoring of the farm, various types of sensors with different
    prices and capabilities were trialled. Two different temperature/humidity sensors
    were utilized: DHT21 and SHT20, which measure the relative humidity and temperature
    of the farm. The DS18B20 was the most suitable choice for measuring the composite
    temperature inside mushroom bags because of its thermocouple principle and well
    insulation. For composite moisture, the two tested types are capacitive and resistive
    moisture sensors. For air quality and CO2 measuring, three different types of
    sensors, SGP30, CCS811, and MH-Z19, were trialled. Finally, the BH1750 was used
    as an illuminance sensor. Another important component for these sensors to work
    is the microcontroller boards which regulate the data acquisition process from
    sensors, and perform the required calculations for precise controlling of the
    actuators. Since one of the main targets was the design and implementation of
    an affordable monitoring/control system, the most appropriate microcontrollers
    were ESP8266 and ESP32 due to their affordable price and available capabilities,
    such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and I2C. The cost of the proposed system was a critical
    consideration in the project due to targeted users, refugees and displaced communities.
    Therefore, three different sensing nodes with low, medium and high costs were
    designed and implemented (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5) in order to compare their performance
    to choose the most appropriate product at an affordable cost. Every sensing node
    was associated with a ThingSpeak channel to monitor the sensor readings instantly
    in addition to saving historical sensor data to be analysed later. The prices
    of all utilized components in this study are offered in Table 1 according to 2023
    prices in Turkey, including 20 % value-added tax. Download : Download high-res

    microcontroller board and three sensors shown in Fig. 3. This node contains the
    NodeMCU ESP8266 development board, which is the cheapest amongst the family of
    microcontrollers that can connect to the Internet. It also contains the minimum
    number of general input/output pins (GPIOs) that can operate the sensors necessary
    to read environmental parameters. It contains one analogue input which enables
    us to read the analogue value of the capacitive soil moisture sensor. Also, we
    can easily connect the composite temperature sensor DS18B20 which works on 1-wire
    protocol and the DHT21 temperature/humidity sensor which works also on 1-wire
    protocol. We utilized a DC-to-DC converter (LM2596) to provide more accurate voltage
    values for sensors from a voltage adaptor. The node worked well with a margin
    of inaccuracy, especially with high humidity values. Fig. 3 shows the detailed
    schematic diagram that shows how these three sensors are connected, and to which
    pins, for the lowest-cost sensing node. Furthermore, all source code files and
    an instructional document are also provided as supplementary material. The medium-cost
    node, illustrated in Fig. 4, consists of ESP32 WROOM 32D as a development board,
    DHT21 as a temperature/humidity sensor, DS18B20 as a soil temperature sensor,
    capacitive soil moisture sensor, BH1750 ambient light sensor, and the SGP30 CO2
    sensor. The ESP32 WROOM 32D has more GPIOs than the ESP8266 development board,
    especially analogue inputs. Furthermore, this development board contains GPIOs
    pins for I2C protocol that deal with the I2C sensors easily, such as the ambient
    light sensor BH1750. The CO2 sensor, SGP30, has a moderate accuracy of about 15
    %, but it is acceptable as an indicator of CO2 level for the mushroom farm. Fig.
    4 shows the detailed schematic diagram of this sensing node, where a DC-to-DC
    converter (LM2596) has also been used to provide more accurate supply voltage
    values for the sensors. Download : Download high-res image (627KB) Download :

    voltage regulator, SHT20 as a trustworthy temperature/humidity sensor that uses
    I2C protocol, DS18B20, HD-38 resistive soil moisture, and CSS811 for estimating
    CO2 (eCO2) and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (tVOC). The SHT20 has high quality
    and it is water-proof and works on I2C protocol. The CO2 sensor CSS811 is also
    of high quality and works on I2C protocol. The schematic diagram of the highest-cost

    implemented to offer different choices for mushroom farmers of different scales
    starting from very small-scale refugee farmers up to medium- and high-scale farmers.
    Lowest, medium and highest-cost sensing nodes cost about $17, $33 and $90, respectively
    (Fig. 6), according to 2023 prices in Turkey where the experiments were conducted.
    All provided costs include also the cost of a voltage adaptor for every node.

    section of the farm, two different control nodes were designed and implemented,
    and a ThingSpeak channel was assigned for every control node. Fig. 7 shows the
    basic control node, which meets the minimum needs of a simple mushroom farm at
    an affordable price. Fig. 8 shows the more advanced one for a mushroom farm with
    high specifications that can control up to seven DC and AC devices. Download :

    image Fig. 8. Advanced control node. Starting with the first basic control circuit,
    which controls three devices necessary for a mushroom farm: a humidifier, an air
    circulation fan, and an extractor fan. As shown in Fig. 7, an ESP8266 microcontroller,
    a 4-channel relay module and voltage regulators were utilized. The advanced control
    node can control more devices that could exist in a larger mushroom farm, which
    includes: an air conditioner, a humidifier, lights, two air circulation fans,
    and two extractor fans as shown in Fig. 8. The most reliable electric control
    elements for the air conditioner, humidifier, and light are solid-state relays
    (SSRs) because they provide complete isolation between the output of the microcontroller
    and the input of the high- current/voltage devices. For the four air fans, the
    solid-state relays can also be used, but to control the speed of the fans a 4-channel
    alternating current (AC) dimmer module was added to respond better to the operation
    of other devices, such as air conditioner and humidifier. Five different speeds,
    in addition to the Off state, were supported as follows: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and
    100 % of the maximum speed for each fan. Finally, a cost comparison was made between
    the basic control node (about $14) and the advanced control node (about $49) as
    illustrated in Fig. 9. With simple technical help, the farmers can choose the
    most suitable nodes to implement in their farms with costs starting from about
    $30 for the two simplest sensing and control nodes. Also, it is worth mentioning
    that suitable packaging for the nodes is necessary to prevent high humidity from
    adversely affecting the boards. This can be done simply using affordable plastic
    food storage containers with secure closures. Download : Download high-res image

    user interface Every sensing or control node has been associated with a ThingSpeak
    channel for saving the node data. For control nodes, a web page that can be accessed
    using any smartphone, tablet, or any personal computer, was developed to allow
    farmers to control the mushroom farm devices in a convenient way. Additionally,
    a MATLAB application was also developed for controlling farm devices for professional
    users. The user interface is simple and user-friendly, where the farmer can select
    any device to turn it On or Off with simple indicators and history of the control
    commands for the MATLAB application. Fig. 10 shows the web page (a) and MATLAB
    application (b) of the basic control node. Two successive control commands should
    be separated by at least 15 s to ensure proper update and operation of the ThingSpeak
    channel. The user interfaces can also be integrated with ThingSpeak to save and
    monitor current and historical data related to the state of the controlled device.

    and the two extractor fans, Fig. 12(b). It has been taken into account that the

    order to control all devices in the mushroom farm, in addition to monitoring sensor
    data. Download : Download high-res image (294KB) Download : Download full-size

    system is the utilized cloud or IoT platform. Many IoT platforms have been trialled
    to adopt ThingSpeak, Fig. 13, as an IoT platform to aggregate, visualize and analyse
    live data streams in the cloud. The main advantage of the usage of the ThingSpeak
    platform is providing instant visualizations of data posted by sensors and devices
    in addition to historical data storage. Additionally, ThingSpeak supports all
    analysis and visualization capabilities of MATLAB, and it can be integrated with
    other websites easily. For example, a dedicated website was designed to provide
    a user interface for farmers to read the sensor values and control the devices
    on the farm. The farmer can access the farm dashboard through ThingSpeak directly
    or through a registered account on the website, connected with ThingSpeak, using
    a username and password to assure privacy and guarantee security. Fig. 14 shows
    the farm dashboard accessed remotely and securely. Also, the website interfaces
    have been designed to support different devices such as smartphones, tablets and
    personal computers. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download

    camera images were collected and saved successfully. Data related to relative
    humidity, temperature, the composite temperature inside the mushroom bag, moisture
    inside the bag and CO2 were collected successfully for two cultivation cycles.
    In the second cycle, the number of parameters were increased and most of the technical
    issues faced in the first cycle were overcome. More than 66,000 one-minute measurements
    were collected and saved for the second cycle. For both cycles, the number exceeds
    3,90,000 for 20-second measurements. Furthermore, a data set containing more than
    700 farm images and 500 videos, was also built successfully. Fig. 15 shows the
    Arduino IoT platform with the instant values of four monitored variables: temperature,
    relative humidity, temperature inside bag, and moisture, with only one-day data
    storage and visualization in the first agricultural cycle. Arduino IoT platform
    supports different computing devices from PCs, tablets and smartphones, but for
    free accounts only two things/nodes with a maximum of four variables for each
    can be connected and one-day data storage and visualization are available. On
    the other hand, a ThingSpeak free account supports four channels/nodes with much
    more storage, analysis and visualization capabilities. Each channel supports up
    to eight different fields/variables of data. Fig. 16 shows two fields of a ThingSpeak
    channel that show the instant and hourly monitored temperature and relative humidity
    values of an SHT20 sensor connected to a sensing node, which is associated with
    this channel and reads sensor values every minute. The hourly graphs clearly illustrate
    fluctuations of the sensor values due to the working pattern of the extractor
    fans, which were adjusted by the farmer to work when the temperature exceeds 19
    °Celsius and stop when under 19 °C to keep the farm temperature around 19 °C.

    platform. Fig. 20 shows daily and weekly data visualizations, where the differences
    between day and night, especially for relative humidity values, are very clear.
    These differences are related to working style of the extractor fans at this period,
    where they were working on timer in day and constantly in night to keep the temperature
    of the farm around 19°. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download :

    humidity (a) daily and (b) weekly values. Temperature data from different sensing
    nodes were also compared in Fig. 21 in the farm and inside mushroom bags. The
    temperature values inside mushroom bags were substantially higher in one bag due
    to mycelium colonization inside that bag. The working pattern of the circulation
    fans was changed by the farmer on 20 March afternoon (13:00 local time), which
    was reflected in the temperature values depending on their distance from the fans.
    Also, temperatures spiked on 20 March morning due to a power cut (07:53–08:43
    local time), which caused an increase in temperature values of about two degrees.
    Then, temperatures were restored in less than ten minutes when the power came
    back and the fans began working again. Download : Download high-res image (290KB)

    experienced, usually lasting no more than an hour. However, there was a prolonged
    internet outage due to a technical issue with the service provider. In response,
    a mobile internet connection was used to restore the required internet service
    for remote monitoring and management of the farm. Of course, it is essential to
    take precautions and have alternatives in place to overcome such unexpected outage
    problems. Various types of mobile power generators and internet connections can
    be utilized for such situations. Fig. 22(a) shows comparisons of relative humidity
    for three different sensing nodes. The differences between day and night were
    clear and a prominent spike value in humidity was also seen due to the farmer''s
    intervention by launching the humidifier manually for ten minutes. Fig. 22(b)
    shows eCO2 values measured by SGP30 and CSS811 sensors, where the differences
    between the sensor values were large, but generally, they behaved in a similar
    way such that any of them can be utilized as an affordable indicator for the CO2
    level in the farm. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download

    AI and ML applications. Download : Download high-res image (540KB) Download :

    was that the farmer who was enforced to commute to the farm twice a day to check
    the mushrooms, was able to monitor and manage the farm remotely when using the
    proposed system, reducing fuel and time costs. Ultimately, the technical design
    and implementation files, source codes, and instruction manual of all varieties
    of sensing and control nodes of the proposed oyster mushroom cultivation system
    will be made available under the CC BY license. Thus, the system can be configured
    and reproduced not only by NGOs and authorities working for refugee and displaced
    communities but also by any group that chooses to implement it. The system was
    implemented for oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus) mushroom cultivation in a greenhouse
    environment with temperature values ranging from 5 °C to 25 °C and relative humidity
    values at 60–95 %. However, the system can be adapted for different mushroom types,
    as well as for other crops, which are cultivated in greenhouse farming systems
    by configuring it to operate under the desired values of temperature and relative
    humidity at different cultivation phases depending on the species [3,13]. For
    example, the number of sensing nodes can be increased according to the size of
    the farm/greenhouse, and the sensors themselves can be replaced with more appropriate
    sensors for the cultivated mushroom or crop. The same can also be said for control
    nodes, where various farm necessary devices can be controlled and managed by these
    nodes using the same architecture and user interfaces. 4. Conclusion This research
    clearly shows that it is possible to design and implement an efficient and affordable
    remote monitoring and controlling system for organic oyster mushroom farming with
    costs starting from about $30. The deployment of this system drew promising insights
    represented by reducing labour efforts and production costs in addition to increasing
    the crop production time thanks to the remotely controlled and monitored process.
    This simplifies the mushroom cultivation process so that it can be operated by
    lay people with a modest amount of training, especially for internally displaced
    and refugee Syrians. Furthermore, it can support them with an extra income and
    an additional source of good nutrition. The implemented varieties of the oyster
    mushroom cultivation system in this study can be adapted for other mushroom types
    as well as for crops cultivated in greenhouse farming systems, as most of such
    systems rely on monitoring the greenhouse environment and managing the various
    relevant devices for controlling the internal greenhouse conditions. The project
    outputs can be shared not only with NGOs and authorities working on agriculture
    projects for internally displaced and refugee Syrians, but also with other agriculturalists
    in low-income countries for example. The operation and use of the system can be
    incorporated into mushroom cultivation training courses and workshops offered
    by these stakeholders. The proposed system can be produced on a larger scale for
    organizations working for refugees, where some UN agencies and international or
    local NGOs support such activities as a part of livelihood and local economic
    recovery programs. Ethics statement Not applicable: This manuscript does not include

    paper PDF 1 Introduction The majority of individuals can profit from advanced
    technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) has just started to play a big role
    in daily life, giving us more ways to sense our surroundings and letting us change
    them. IoT is used both to figure out field conditions and to manage them, especially
    in the agro-industrial and environmental fields [1] Additionally, it can tell
    the customer about the origins and characteristics of the product. It may be used
    to assess field factors including soil quality, weather, and animal or plant biomass
    [2]. It can also be used to keep an eye on and control things like temperature,
    humidity, vibrations, and shocks while a product is being shipped. WSN may also
    be used to track and manage variables that affect crop output and growth [3].
    They may also be used to manage machinery, find the best solution for a certain
    situation, find the best time to harvest, and more. In this study, we concentrate
    on information on soil moisture, humidity, and temperature in agricultural fields.
    We need a place to store the data, a way to get information out of the data over
    time, a way to connect with the user, and a way to water the plants. A database
    structure will be created to make decisions about the autonomous irrigation of
    plants [4]. Techniques for collecting, analyzing, and controlling data in real
    time improve operational efficiency, increase productivity, and reduce water waste
    [5]. This research highlighted the usage of the Internet of Things for smart farming
    and how different sensors can be used to make automated irrigation systems. An
    automated smart irrigation system was developed. 2 Literature Review A smart gadget
    developed by [6] can measure the temperature, pH, and moisture content of the
    soil in diverse places. An ANN model is then used to examine this data. The automated
    irrigation system developed by [7] was an attempt to develop an effective technique
    for producing agricultural crop operations [8]. A working model of an automated
    sprinkler system has been developed using an Arduino Microcontroller for monitoring
    soil moisture and relative humidity. Current issues and the implementation of
    Smart Agriculture Systems Based on the Internet of Things are discussed [9]. Madhav
    et al. [10] has investigated the machine learning technique and IoT in agriculture.
    These aid in gathering data for farmer management systems. While [11] has concentrated
    on estimating production measures for vegetable crops employing a fuzzy-logic
    control system, Upadhya et al. [12] has evaluated the development of smart IoT
    devices for agriculture applications. The output parameters are the precise crop-yielding
    values, while the input variables are humidity, temperature, and soil moisture.
    For the purpose of identifying undesirable plants on crops, Dasgupta et al. [13]
    has conducted research on a mix of IoT devices, WSN, and AI algorithms. Deep learning
    techniques and a drone have been used to capture data. The notion of an intelligent
    irrigation system was developed by [14] who concentrated on an IoT-based irrigation
    system for monitoring the rice crop field using various sensors. IoT-enabled smart
    drip irrigation system’s experimental performance employing web-based apps by
    [15]. Design and execution of a portable watering system that is solar-powered
    and IoT-enabled [16] Design and execution of a portable watering system that is
    solar-powered and IoT-enabled. Design and implementation of an IoT-based wastewater
    irrigation system [17]. This low-cost platform may assist manufacturers, governments,
    and farmers in forecasting environmental data over geographically expansive farm
    field, which improves crop yield and farm man—agreement in a timely and affordable
    way. The unique integration of IoT sensors with the drone in the obtained experimental
    findings implies that automatic and human-made sets of actions may be implemented
    and/or proposed. These smart efforts support precision agriculture, which significantly
    boosts agricultural output and preserves natural resources [18]. A framework for
    tracking and monitoring smart crops is presented in this research. Big data analytics,
    mobile apps, Internet of Things cameras, and sensors are all addressed. An Arduino
    Uno, a number of sensors, and a Wi-Fi module make up the hardware. As a result
    of this approach, the least amount of agricultural waste is produced while utilizing
    energy most efficiently. This article suggests a framework for agricultural disease
    identification. SVM classification is used for this. On the basis of previously
    existing soil data for a specific site, it recognizes disease in crops and recommends
    relevant pesticides [19]. The main objective of this research is to suggest a
    method for autonomously irrigating farms employing sensors that measure soil moisture
    in agricultural fields. Using buzzers and passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors,
    farmland may be secured to prevent animal encroachment. For crop health monitoring,
    a Raspberry Pi camera is employed [20]. In this study, a smart irrigation control
    system is installed using a customized Internet of Things (IoT) system for monitoring
    agricultural areas and properly utilizing water resources. Sensors are positioned
    in the agricultural field where the crop is cultivated in order to sense several
    characteristics, including soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and rainfall.
    A cloud infrastructure is used to store sensed data. Using a mobile application,
    it is possible to manually switch the motor pump between the ON and OFF states
    from a distance [3]. In order to estimate irrigation system water requirements
    and achieve sustainability, this work blends IoT, machine learning, and transfer
    learning methodologies. The key conclusion of this research is that it decreased
    water use and transferred prediction model characteristics in exchange for more
    accurate forecasting and analysis. IoT sensor devices gather fundamental data,
    including wetness, temperature, and humidity. With the help of meteorological
    and historical data, the total amount required for overall cultivation was projected
    and estimated in the short and long terms [21]. The study discusses smart agricultural
    and irrigation systems based on IOT. This paper’s main goal is to automate the
    watering of plants. This research enables us to understand the values of many
    factors for plants, such as humidity, moisture, and temperature, and to water
    them appropriately. Three sensors make up the system, which measures the humidity,
    wetness, and temperature of plants. The motor automatically turns on the water
    for plants if any of the variables drop. The tomato plant was success fully grown
    on the paper using an automated procedure. We were able to have a healthy farming
    operation because of this practice and the Internet of Things [22]. This review
    explores case studies on climate monitoring, greenhouse automation, crop management,
    cattle monitoring, and smart farming using IoT devices, highlighting the benefits
    of these techniques in agriculture over pre-existing tools [23]. The goal of this
    work was to examine existing information about the volumetric soil water content
    (VSWC) concept and electromagnetic sensor monitoring for irrigation control. In
    the context of the Internet of Things, capacitance, impedance, and the more dependable
    TDR sensors are examined for aiding automated irrigation [24]. 3 IOT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture The work that has already been done on smart sensors for
    agriculture applications is discussed in this section. The uses of sensors in
    animal husbandry, soil, irrigation, crop disease, and harvesting are then covered
    [25]. IoT applications in smart agriculture are discussed below (see Fig. 1).
    Fig. 1 Internet of Things-based smart agriculture applications Full size image
    3.1 Soil Health Monitoring An important factor in increasing agricultural product
    production is soil health. Monitoring the health of soil with sensors has made
    the analysis of soil composition more effective and efficient. It results in raising
    the standard of agricultural items, increasing the farmers’ financial rewards
    [26]. Smart sensors are most useful in agriculture for estimating soil moisture,
    nitrate and phosphate levels, and soil compaction, making a way to recommend fertilizers,
    measuring capsaicin levels, sorting land, and figuring out soil fertility. Soil
    health monitoring impacts nutrient concentration, affecting agricultural product
    production and quality [27]. Therefore, estimating these nutrients in advance
    and keeping track of them is beneficial for improving quality and cost-effectiveness.
    Smart devices with a variety of sensors allow for the monitoring of nitrate, phosphate,
    capsaicin, etc. concentrations. The farmers’ smartphones receive alarm texts.
    The amount of ploughing required on an agricultural field is determined by the
    assessment of soil compaction prior to ploughing [28]. 3.2 Automated Irrigation
    System Controlling the water flow in an agricultural region is simple with the
    help of a smart irrigation system. IoT is used to set up when water will be delivered
    and to get real-time information about the farm. The smart irrigation system may
    be used for a variety of tasks, such as climate-driven irrigation, water management,
    leak detection, and water level monitoring [29, 30]. Both the moisture content
    and the water level are monitored by the sensors. It makes sure there is enough
    water available for crops to flourish properly. Here, the water pump controller
    receives the sensor data from several sensors in order to automatically take the
    necessary action [31]. Because of this, the water pump works better when irrigation
    activities are planned well. By measuring the difference in pressure between two
    pipe connections, leaks in irrigation systems can be found. Pressure sensors are
    installed at each pipe junction to conduct leakage detection. If the pressure
    is low at any joint, it means that leakage happened before that joint. 3.3 Pest
    and Disease Detection Crop leaves in agricultural fields are an easy target for
    parasite and disease assaults. In traditional farming methods, it is not recommended
    that the farmer look at each plant in the field because it is often wrong and
    takes a long time. Smart agriculture offers a low-cost method of spotting illnesses
    in plant leaves [32]. The smart sensors for agriculture can be used to monitor
    leaf diseases in a number of ways, such as finding tomato leaf curl, parasite
    damage to leaves, and diseases in bananas based on their leaves. IoT-based real-time
    leaf monitoring enables the early detection of illnesses that impede plant development.
    The images from the many sensors that have been put in the agricultural area are
    looked at by the web server, which then sends alarms to the farmers. A sensor
    network was used to identify paddy and banana plant diseases earlier [33]. 3.4
    Crop Production Tracking Increased productivity and financial rewards for farmers
    are the main objectives of farming. Smart sensors aided in increasing agricultural
    output by facilitating efficient management and multi-point sensor monitoring
    [34]. For example, smart sensors can be used to find early crops, figure out how
    much fertilizer to use, tell when a plant is stressed, classify crop diseases,
    and build greenhouses that work well. The quality of the crop yield is greatly
    affected by how well you guess when to harvest. Crops are prematurely harvested,
    which results in lower-quality produce. So, using IoT to estimate when the harvest
    will happen can help farmers increase the amount of food they grow. Next, employing
    sensors to determine the precise needs for fertilizers and fertilizer results
    in a considerable improvement in product quality [35]. A number of temperature
    sensors have been put in the greenhouse to help control and keep an eye on the
    temperature. The way IoT-enabled greenhouses are built makes sure that the right
    conditions are always there for plants to grow in a healthy way. 3.5 Post Harvesting
    Events After the successful harvesting of agricultural goods, the main issue is
    the successful distribution of such items to consumers at the highest quality.
    Smart sensors for agriculture facilitate post-harvest operations by offering reasonably
    priced options for the monitoring of the storage and transit of agricultural products
    in real time [36]. It can be used for smart grain storage, smart inventory control,
    smart agricultural transportation, and smart agricultural product preservation.
    Two important factors—namely, “how to store?”—play a key role in the storage of
    agricultural commodities. Where should it be stored? Harvested grain sacks have
    passive sensors that monitor humidity and temperature. Temperature, humidity,
    and cleanliness data are provided in real time by the various sensors positioned
    within the inventory [37]. 3.6 Smart Animal Husbandry Agriculture is not possible
    without animal husbandry. In the last few years, there has been a big rise in
    the use of sensors in smart animal husbandry. Numerous advantages of smart animal
    husbandry include real-time animal activity monitoring, early illness identification,
    movement detection while grazing, etc. [38]. Farmers can benefit from different
    animal husbandry apps, such as those that let them keep an eye on pigs, beehives,
    sheep, and chicken farms. Smart sensors offer real-time in-dairy cow monitoring.
    By improving the cows’ constant assessment and real-time tracking, milk production
    can be more stable. In order to improve the quality of the honey supply, the farmers
    use sensors to keep track of the temperature, humidity, and other biological factors
    in the beehives. In a similar way, the radio collar’s sensors and GPS may help
    figure out how the sheep moves and where it is. Next, sensors are attached to
    the saddle and the rider’s clothing to track the horse’s gaits. Multiple sensors
    installed in the chicken farm also keep an eye on the environmental conditions
    inside [35, 39]. Early disease detection and real-time activity monitoring are
    made possible by monitoring pigs using cameras and radio collars systems. The
    outside temperature is monitored by the sensors that were installed in the animal
    shelter. The choice to graze outside is made based on the temperature threshold
    [40]. 4 Proposed System The Arduino UNO microcontroller is used to develop the
    smart irrigation system, which is an important part of this automated system.
    The microprocessor is connected to sensors such as soil moisture sensors, water
    level sensors, temperature sensors, and rain detection sensors. As a result, the
    Arduino UNO receives the output of these sensors. When such sensors send a signal,
    the microcontroller responds with the expected outcomes, turning on the relay
    in accordance with the soil sensor and rain and temperature sensor conditions
    and operating the water motor. A soil moisture sensor collects a reading of the
    soil’s moisture content and communicates it as voltage (analog signals). The necessary
    hardware and software are listed in Table 1. The output voltage is then compared
    with the standard voltage. The pump turns on and the agricultural area is automatically
    irrigated by the signal that is transmitted by the relay if the voltage used as
    the reference voltage is greater than the soil condition defined by the voltage.
    The pump stays in the OFF status and the relay does not activate in vice versa
    condition. The microcontroller receives an analog signal from the soil moisture
    sensor, which is transformed into a digital signal. The relay circuit receives
    the signal after the program has already been completed in the microcontroller.
    The motor is switched ON or OFF in accordance with the signal sent to the relay
    circuit. When the temperature drops, the soil gets moist, the voltage rises beyond
    the reference voltage, and a low signal (“logic 0”) is sent to the microcontroller,
    which turns off the motor and causes it to stop pumping water. The comparator,
    which is housed inside the sensor, provides the voltage. There will be conductivity
    in the field when the sensor is positioned there. Since water is an excellent
    conductor of electricity, good conduction indicates the presence of moisture.
    The signal is then transmitted, and the required signals switch the motor OFF.
    And when there is no conduction, it shows that there is no water present; as a
    result, the Arduino generates the appropriate signals to switch on the motor.
    The relay switch closes, the motor is attached to the circuit, and the water is
    pumped to the plants as soon as the control signal to turn on the motor is transmitted.
    Similar to this, if the control signal instructs the motor to be switched OFF,
    the relay switch is opened, cutting off power to the motor, which causes it to
    be turned OFF. As a result, the plants receive the water they require when they
    do, thanks to the Arduino software that has been programmed into its memory. Here,
    regular observation is not necessary. A block diagram of an automated regulated
    watering system is shown in (Fig. 2). Table 1 List of material required Full size
    table Fig. 2 System block diagram Full size image The design of the hardware and
    the basic structure of the system are both covered in the implementation. The
    basic construction is completed using a sprinkler irrigation system developed
    from parts such as a water pump, water tank, main pipelines, capacitive sensor,
    DHT-11 sensor for tracking air temperature and air humidity, LCD display to show
    the data, buzzer, and sprinklers. Numerous bulk irrigation control devices are
    constructed on a breadboard that is attached to an Arduino Uno board as the hardware
    implementation. These irrigation management devices are responsible for data collection
    and transmission to the system. The sensor information gathered is utilized to
    manage the irrigation system and keep an eye on the state of the crops. 4.1 System
    Implementation The Arduino IDE software contains programs that enable data reading
    from the transmitter and data transmission from an Arduino Uno to a system. The
    system’s prototype is displayed below (see Fig. 3). Table 2 displays the results
    from various times of the day from all sensors’ testing. Figure 4 explains the
    working flow of the proposed system. If the soil moisture is below 40%, the water
    motor turns on, and the relay enters an active state when it transmits the high
    signal to the relay. The red and green LED lights indicate their active state.
    If soil moisture is above 40% and in between 100%, the relay remains off as it
    receives the LOW signal from the relay, and only the single red LED light on the
    relay indicates its off state. Data samples from both wet and dry soil are collected
    to test the soil moisture by using a capacitive soil moisture sensor type v1.2
    to validate the result and test the relay. The values obtained for dry soil conditions
    are below the soil moisture required values, and the values obtained for wet soil
    conditions are above the soil moisture required values. The results show that
    the range of dry soil moisture values is between 40 and 0%, while the range of
    wet soil moisture values is between 80 and 100%. As result shown in Table 2, the
    rain sensor is used to indicate a rainy state. If it is raining, then it will
    indicate a rainy state; otherwise, it will not rain. The tank has a water level
    indicator installed to display the water level. If the water trough is full, it
    will show on the system. If the water trough is empty, it will show empty on the
    system screen. Since temperature and humidity are key factors in the growth of
    crops, the DHT11 sensor is used to measure air temperature and humidity. Data
    from soil moisture sensors and DHt11 sensors is displayed on an LCD display screen
    for a quick review of the data. Fig. 3 Prototype of smart irrigation system Full
    size image Table 2 Experimental result Full size table Fig. 4 Main flowchart of
    the proposed system Full size image Working Steps Working process of proposed
    system is explained below. 1 The moment the power supply is turned on, the system
    starts. 2 The Arduino is linked to the LCD display in order to make sure that
    sensor data gets displayed on the LCD panel correctly. 3 The soil moisture sensor,
    which measures the soil moisture content, sets a maximum threshold of 100% and
    a minimum level of 0%. The engine will pump water to the crops if the soil moisture
    content falls below 40%. 4 The agricultural field’s outside temperature is determined
    by the temperature sensor. 5 A rain sensor ensures that the motor is shut off
    when it starts to rain in order to save power. 6 Additionally, the user will receive
    all of the data acquired by sensors automatically. 5 Result and Discussion Agriculture
    has challenges with water management and irrigation since water supplies are depleting
    quickly and 60% of irrigation water is lost. In this study, a comprehensive irrigation
    system based on automated controls and wireless sensor networks was developed
    on a low budget. The primary goal of this research is to build smart control systems
    and automated irrigation systems at the local level. The system was successfully
    constructed and implemented, and its accuracy was tested; the results met expectations.
    At various temperatures, the rate of water content loss has been measured and
    is shown in Table 2. Because high temperatures might interfere with the irrigation
    plan, this lowered rate makes it easier to forecast when to irrigate next time.
    In these kinds of systems, automated and wireless sensor networks offer notably
    high efficiency. The ESP board and sensor were precise. The system’s soil moisture
    detection nodes are crucial; when water reaches all of them, the system instructs
    the water pump to turn off. This method cuts water waste by up to 70% by carefully
    planning irrigation. Results from experiments are used to generate Table 2. The
    temperature change and its impacts on soil dry rate forecast, irrigation system
    management, and moisture drop rate are shown in the table. The variation in the
    actual temperature is described by the temperature change rate. The relationship
    between a drop in moisture content and a rise in temperature is seen in the table.
    6 Conclusion A smart system for irrigation can potentially be used widely to decrease
    water waste and supply farmers with healthy crops. In our project, a relay that
    regulates this process allows the motor to be automatically turned ON and OFF.
    The water required by the crops is supplied by the motor-attached water tank or
    water storage. This project effectively monitors the water level of the plants.
    When necessary, it gives plants the right amount of water. The plants’ development
    and vitality can be preserved. As farmers are not required to regularly examine
    the irrigation operation, manpower and labor costs are decreased. Water wastage
    has decreased, which has numerous positive economic effects; as a result, this
    project has positive economic effects as well. The best way to prevent water problems
    in agriculture will be through smart irrigation. Sensor-based irrigation is in
    high demand now and will continue to grow in the future. By controlling soil moisture
    levels, it decreases human error and saves time. Precision agricultural farming
    is now feasible because of the advent of sensor-based applications in agriculture,
    which increase production, efficiency, and profitability. In order to further
    the sophistication and effectiveness of future research, field data will be gathered
    and combined with artificial intelligence, big data, and/or neural networks. References

  description: Precision agriculture (PA) has recently employed as an innovative agriculture
    to increase the profitability through enhancing the crop yields. Wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) is widely used in PA to measure the agricultural parameters. However,
    the main challenges of using WSNs in PA are to improve the measurement accuracy
    and to increase the network lifetime of WSNs. A novel scheme is developed in this
    paper to measure soil moisture and temperature in heterogeneous farms called Adaptive
    heterogeneous precision agriculture (AHPA). As well as the Extended kalman filter
    (EKF), AHPA contains two invented algorithms, named Optimally sensor selection
    algorithm (OSSA) and Adaptive sampling interval algorithm (ASIA). As part of the
    EKF, agricultural state is proactively predicted and then it is updated through
    measuring it using WSN so that the noises associated with sensor measurements
    are eliminated. OSSA employs the Genetic algorithm (GA) for selecting a group
    of sensor nodes that are used to sense the agricultural state, in order to enhance
    network lifetime and crop yields. The root system is modeled and used in the OSSA
    to select the nodes inside the area covered by the root system. In the prediction
    stage, the ASIA is used to calculate an adaptive sampling interval based on the
    predicted state of agricultural parameters. The simulation results show that the
    total energy consumption and the reduction of the agricultural parameters are
    improved in the proposed ASIA, compared with other fixed sampling interval schemes.
    Moreover, the number of dead nodes, the time of the first node death, the energy
    balance, the neighbors count, and the number of evolved nodes in sensing activities
    are enhanced in the proposed OSSA, compared with other schemes. Hence, the network
    lifetime and crop yields are enhanced. Moreover, the proposed OSSA selects the
    sensor nodes based on the root age so that the agricultural parameters of the
    whole soil of the plants are sensed.

    the agricultural parameters are improved in the proposed ASIA, compared with other
    fixed sampling interval schemes. Moreover, the number of dead nodes, the time
    of the first node death, the energy balance, the neighbors count, and the number
    of evolved nodes in sensing activities are enhanced in the proposed OSSA, compared
    with other schemes. Hence, the network lifetime and crop yields are enhanced.
    Moreover, the proposed OSSA selects the sensor nodes based on the root age so
    that the agricultural parameters of the whole soil of the plants are sensed. Previous

    1. Introduction The demands of food are constantly and exponentially increasing
    worldwide [1]. Until 2050, a study predicts a growth in global food demands of
    60 % to 110 % [2]. Furthermore, agriculture is a core source of improving the
    economy of countries [1]. At the same time, the main resources of agriculture
    such as water is decreasing [3]. Agricultural activities such as water irrigation
    requires rigorous labor and intensive time [4]. To enhance the crop yields, the
    agricultural requirements such as water and fertilizer should be provides at the
    right time, right place, and satisfactory amount [5]. Therefore, Precision agriculture
    (PA) is a smart agriculture that overcomes all these challenges and needs. PA
    uses the information and communication technology, sensor devices, and automated
    control to improve the crop productivity, profitability, labor efficiency, energy
    and environmental sustainability, and food safety [6]. Internet of Things (IoT)
    [7], machine learning techniques [8], Extended kalman filter (EKF) [9], Supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) [10] and optimization methods [11] are examples
    of information technologies needed for PA. The automated control in PA include
    the usage of sensor devices, controllers, and actuators. Sensor devices are used
    in PA to measure the agricultural parameters, including soil moisture, soil temperature,
    soil pH, and ambient humidity. The actuator in PA include water pumps, fans, and
    electronic valves. Microcontroller [12] and Programmable logic controller (PLC)
    [13] are examples of controllers used in PA. The communication technologies in
    PA include single-hop and multi-hop wireless communication to transmit the agricultural
    parameters and receive commands of the appropriate actions. One of the main and
    powerful needs for the PA is the Wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs consists
    of tiny and low-cost sensor nodes with sensing, limited processing, wirelessly
    communication, and limited storage capabilities [14]. WSNs is either deployed
    in fixed or random fashion [15]. Thousands of sensor nodes can randomly be deployed
    using airplane. Sensor nodes cooperatively execute the required tasks and activities.
    Cluster-based WSNs consists of clusters which are a group of sensor nodes that
    are managed using a single cluster head [16]. The communication activities take
    place between the sensor nodes and their cluster heads. The cluster heads forward
    the data to the sink node of WSNs via multi hop communication using other cluster
    head. The sink node relays the received data to the headquarter of the system.
    There are a wide variety of applications for WSNs, including PA, healthcare, wildlife
    habitat monitoring, disaster management, surveillance, environmental monitoring,
    and decision support systems [17]. In this paper, WSN is adopted for PA to measure
    the agriculture parameters such as soil moisture and soil temperature for each
    crop. In addition, WSN transmits the control and sensed data to the main controller
    via multi-hop wireless communication. The algorithms that manage the operation
    of PA and WSN are executed in the main controller according to the received data.
    In this paper, Adaptive heterogeneous precision agriculture (AHPA) scheme is proposed.
    The main components of AHPA are WSN which is used for sensing the agricultural
    parameters and transmitting the sensed data to the main controller, EKF that is
    used to eliminate the sensed noises and predict the future agricultural parameters,
    Optimally sensor selection algorithm (OSSA) which is used to proactively select
    the group of sensor nodes, and Adaptive sampling interval algorithm (ASIA) that
    is used to compute the interval time for the next sensing activities. To enhance
    the crop yields, the PA aims to apply the agricultural inputs such as water irrigation
    at the right time and place, according to the specific needs of each crop. AHPA
    addresses these challenges and needs through sensing the soil moisture and temperature
    which are used to take the right decision of the needed agricultural inputs for
    each specific crop. EKF is adopted in AHPA to eliminate the noises from the measured
    agricultural parameters sensed by the sensor nodes. The main contributions of
    the proposed AHPA scheme are three-fold. Firstly, OSSA is invented to select a
    group of sensor nodes that will be used to sense the agricultural parameters so
    that the network lifetime and the crop yields are optimized. Secondly, ASIA is
    introduced to independently compute the adaptive sampling intervals for each agricultural
    area based on the updated state of agricultural parameters. The sampling interval
    determines the right time interval between each two consecutive sensing activities.
    Finally, mathematical models of the research problem including the performance
    metrics and optimization problem are developed in this paper. This paper is organized
    into eight sections including this introduction. Section 2 explores the related
    work int PA. After that, the framework and modeling of the proposed AHPA scheme
    is presented in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates the EKF. The AHPA formalisation
    and modeling are introduced in Section 5. The proposed algorithms of AHPA scheme
    is presented in Section 6. The evaluation and results of AHPA scheme are explained
    and discussed in Section 7. Finally, the paper is summarized in Section 8. 2.
    Related work Soil moisture, soil temperature, and ambient humidity are measured
    in [18] using WSNs. The measured data is sent to the head nodes that redirect
    it to Internet of thing (IoT) environment. In [19], soil parameters such as moisture
    and pH, temperature, light intensity, and humidity are monitored to increase the
    crop yields. IoT platform is adopted in [20] for agricultural parameter monitoring
    including soil monitor, temperature, humidity, and flow of water sprinkler. Decision
    making is taken for suitable actions such irrigation in [19], and [20]. Precision
    farming using WSNs is developed in [21] to monitoring the apple diseases and taking
    the suitable actions. In [22], IoT and WSNs are used to smartly monitor the crops
    growth. Sensor nodes are randomly deployed in [22] to sense the soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and air quality. The agricultural
    land is monitored in [23] using WSNs so that the power consumption for the communication
    activities is reduced. pH, humidity, temperature and moisture sensors are used
    in [23]. Depending of the reading values, the suitable actions such as opening
    of water pump and turning on the fans are triggered to improve the crop yield.
    In [24], Nutrients in the soil including Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK)
    are measured using WSNs to obtain healthier crops. Precision irrigation based
    on fuzzy logic using WSNs is proposed in [25]. The crop water stress index and
    the soil moisture content are the inputs of the fuzzy logic controller. The output
    of the fuzzy logic is the water irrigation scheduling which is the pump control
    signal. Cluster-based WSNs is adopted in [26] for PA. Selection algorithm is perform
    in [26] to select the cluster head for each cluster based on the remaining energy
    and location of sensor nodes so that the network lifetime and energy efficiency
    are improved. In [4], the triggering time and period of irrigation process are
    computed based on the measuring data including soil moisture, temperature, the
    level of water tank, humidity, and the forecasting of rain level. IoT web interface
    is developed in [4] to enable farmers monitor the agricultural land. In [27],
    the agricultural field is monitored using IoT sensor nodes. The growth and health
    of crops are monitored through sensing the soil pH, soil temperature, and soil
    moisture. The dates of fertilization and irrigation are optimally computed in
    [3]. In [11], Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to get the rate of fertilization
    for different part in the agricultural land to get the best even distribution
    of nitrogen rates. GA is used in [28] to predict the rain fall so that a decision-making
    system is implemented to decide if the manual water is required or not. In addition,
    soil moisture senses the level of soil moisture. Water irrigation is performed
    using Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) when the soil moisture level exceeds a predefined
    threshold value. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) which is considered
    as Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is adopted in [48] to get the
    best solutions representing the conflicted objectives so that the crop yield is
    maximized and the total amount of fertilization and irrigation are minimized.
    However, EKF are not used in all above researches to eliminate the noises from
    the measured data by the sensor nodes. Therefore, there is no prediction and update
    stage for the measurement activities. In addition, the sensor node selection is
    not performed to selected the best sensor nodes to measure the agricultural parameters
    in all above researches In [29], sensor nodes are installed in greenhouses to
    measure the agricultural parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and acidity.
    IoT-based system architecture is used in [29] to get the sensing data. The readings
    strength of the sensor nodes is improved by using Kalman filter through reducing
    the noise associated with the sensor readings. Kalman filter is considered in
    [30] to increase the overall sensing accuracy of the agricultural land. However,
    all above researches adopted fixed sampling interval approach. In [9], Smart heterogeneous
    precision agriculture (SHPA) using WSNs is introduced to measure the soil moisture
    and temperature for agricultural farm. EKF is used in [9] to predict the measurements
    and illuminate the noise from the sensing data. Sensor selection algorithm is
    performed in SHPA to select the sensor nodes to measure the agricultural data.
    However, the selection algorithm in [9] is a greedy algorithm that selects one
    node for each iteration. Thus, the fitness evaluation of the whole selected sensor
    group is not performed. In addition, the sampling interval is fixed in [9]. Variable
    sampling interval is used in [31] to proactively select the adoptive sampling
    interval for each crop separately. However, the sampling interval is calculated
    in [31] based on the soil temperature without considering the soil moisture. Table
    1 succinctly summarize the key findings of the related works mentioned above.

    into PA, this research presents Adaptive heterogeneous precision agriculture (AHPA)
    scheme. AHPA adopts the concepts of spreading and dispersing of the selected sensor
    nodes that are used to sense the agricultural parameters so that the network lifetime
    and crop yields are improved. Moreover, the model of the root system is used in
    the proposed selection algorithm to cope with the root development of plants.
    Furthermore, adaptive sampling interval is proactively computed according to the
    updated value of soil moisture and temperature. 3. AHPA framework and modelling
    In this section, the framework and modeling of the proposed Adaptive heterogeneous
    precision agriculture (AHPA) scheme is presented. In this research, the symbols
    of sets, matrices, parameter variables, and normalized parameter variables are
    denoted by capital and bold letters, capital, bold, and italic letter, small and
    italic letter, and small, and italic letters with hat at the top of the letter,
    respectively. For instance, , , , and are examples of a set, a matrix, and a parametrize
    variable, and a normalized parameter variable, respectively. The transpose of
    matrix is denoted as . In this paper, heterogenous plants and crops are considered
    for the proposed approach so that different types of plants can be plant in the
    same farm as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, the farm set consists of areas , where
    . Therefore, the farm set is formed as follows: (1) Download : Download high-res
    image (333KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. AHPA Framework. As shown
    in Fig. 1, Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is randomly deployed [15] in the target
    farm to sense the soil moisture and soil temperature. Cluster-based WSNs [16]
    is adopted in the AHPA scheme. At time step , WSN consists of sensor nodes. The
    sensor node is denoted as , where is the identification of sensor node, is the
    number of the sensor nodes, and is the identification of the area containing the
    sensor node. Therefore, the set of the WSN at time step is formed as: (2) At time
    step , each area contains a set of sensor nodes. The sets of sensors nodes at
    all areas are not intersect such as: (3) Therefore, the set of the WSN and the
    number of the sensor nodes at time step are calculated as follows: (4) (5) One
    Cluster head (CH) is used for each area. The locations of CHs are at the center
    of the areas. Therefore, cluster-based WSN [16] is adopted for WSN topology. In
    each area, the sensor nodes send all control and information data to the CH of
    the area. The CH forwards the data to the Sink node (SN)/Base station (BS) via
    multi-hop communication using the other CHs. Finally, the data are forwarded to
    the main controller and users via Internet, satellite or cellular communication.
    The proposed algorithms of AHPA scheme are executed in the main controller. Each
    sensor node has two sensors to sense the soil moisture and soil temperature. Therefore,
    the soil moisture and temperature are measured by WSN at different time step .
    The sampling interval at time step of area is the time interval between the current
    time at time step and previous time at time step such as: (6) In this paper, the
    sampling interval for each area is dynamically changed according to the current
    measurements of the area. Therefore, Adaptive sampling interval algorithm (ASIA)
    is proposed to determine the value of the current sampling interval . Consequently,
    according to the Eq. (6), the next time for the new measurements of the soil moisture
    and soil temperature is computed as follows: (7) The second core algorithm in
    AHPA scheme is the Optimally sensors selection algorithm (OSSA). The main aim
    of OSSA is used to proactively select the group of sensor nodes at time step for
    each area according to the plant age and energy remaining of sensor nodes so that
    the network lifetime and crop yields are enhanced. The sensor nodes are numbering
    in their group as where is bounded in the interval . In Fig. 1, the farm consists
    of nine areas planted with different plants and crops. Different number of sensor
    nodes with different distances and angles to the area center are selected for
    each area to sense the soil moisture and soil temperature, based on the plant
    type and age. For instance, two, three, and four sensor nodes are selected for
    area , , and , respectively. Each area and sensor node are characterized with
    several attributes and variables as shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

    temperature are measured by the AHPA scheme. At each time , the soil moisture
    and temperature of each area, , are sensed. Hence, the state vector at time of
    area contains the soil moisture and temperature as:. (8) The dynamic model of
    the area [32,33,34] is defined as: (9) is the evolution function or system transition
    function which is time-varying function that relates the current state with the
    previous state and is the process noise which models the error associated with
    the system state. is assumed to be a zero-mean white gaussian distribution process
    with covariance matrix so that . 4.2. Measurement model The noise associated with
    measurements at time is modelled [32,33,34] as follows: (10) is the sampling interval,
    , and is the measurement function is the measurement noise. The sampling interval
    is defined as the time between two consecutive measurements. The distribution
    of is independent, and assumed to have a zero-mean white gaussian distribution
    with covariance matrix such that . 4.3. EKF method The Extended kalman filter
    (EKF) consists of two stage named prediction and update stages. The EKF [32,33,34]
    is adopted to calculate the predicted and update states and their covariance matrices.
    The predicted state is predicted for the next time step without knowing the measurements.
    When the measurements are available for the next stage, the update stage is performed
    to update the measurements. 4.3.1. Prediction stage In the prediction stage, the
    predicted state vector and its associated predicted covariance matrix are calculated
    at time . The predicted state vector is computed as follows: (11) The associated
    predicted covariance matrix of the predicted state is given by: (12) is the Jacobian
    matrix of at as follows: (13) 4.3.2. Update stage In the update stage is performed
    at time when the measurements are available. The update state vector and its associated
    updated covariance matrix are computed in this stage. The measurement residual
    is defined as the difference between the actual and predicted measurements and
    is computed as follows: (14) The associated residual or innovation covariance
    matrix of is given by: (15) (16) is the Jacobian matrix of at as follows: (17)
    The update state estimate is given by: (18) The associated updated covariance
    matrix of is calculated as: (19) The filter gain is given by: (20) 5. The AHPA
    formalisation and modelling The essential objective of the proposed AHPA approach
    is to prolong the network lifetime and the crop yields. Therefore, two main algorithms
    are invented to achieve this objective. At each time step , the Optimally sensors
    selection algorithm (OSSA) is performed to proactively select a group of sensor
    nodes to sense the soil moisture and temperature based on the plant age, the variance
    of angle spreading from the area center, and the variance of distance dispersing
    away from the area center. The group of the selected sensor nodes should satisfy
    the following equalities: (21) (22) At each time step , the Adaptive sampling
    interval algorithm (ASIA) is executed to dynamically compute the sampling interval
    according to the current measurement of soil moisture and temperature. In the
    following subsection, the performance metrics of the proposed OSSA and ASIA algorithms
    are defined and mathematically modelled. 5.1. Sensors group spreading To increase
    the crop yields, solid moisture and temperature should evenly sense in the whole
    area where plants are implanted. The selecting of sensor nodes group that are
    concentrated in particular places inside the agricultural area degrades the network
    lifetime because the death of selected nodes cause network gaps in these particular
    places [35,36]. Therefore, the network lifetime is prolonged when a group of sensor
    nodes are selected in spread places inside the agricultural area. This is because
    the possible deaths of sensor nodes are also spread and hence, the gap of the
    empty sensor nodes are reduced. The optimal angle at area between sensor node
    to the next sensor that maximizes the spreading of sensor nodes group is calculated
    as follows: (23) The normalized optimal angle at area between sensor node to the
    next sensor is computed by dividing the optimal angle to the maximums angle (
    ) according to the following equation: (24) (25) Consequently, the squared error
    from the normalized optimal angle of the normalized angle separated between sensor
    nodes pair ( , in the selected group at time step is defined as follows: (26)
    Before computing the errors in Eq. (26), the sensor nodes in the group should
    be firstly sorted in ascending order with respect to the angle between the sensor
    node and the positive direction so that: (27) is any point in the positive direction.
    is the angles between the selected pair of sensor nodes ( , and the at the area
    center, which is calculated based on the triangle low as follows: (28) (29) According
    to Eq. (28), the three points ( , , and ) of the angle are colinear occurs when
    the slopes of , , and are equal. In this case, the value of angle is 180°. The
    distance between any two-point vectors and is computed as follows: (30) The normalized
    angle between the selected pair of sensor nodes ( , and the at the area center
    is computed by dividing the angle to the maximums angle ( ) according to the following
    equation: (31) (32) The mean of all possible squared errors of the normalized
    angle separated between all sensor nodes pairs is calculated as follows: (33)
    (34) Therefore, the sensor group spreading error of area at time step is defined
    as the Root mean square error (RMSE) of the angle errors between sensor nodes
    pairs in the selected group, which is calculated as: (35) (36) In Fig. 2, of sensor
    nodes group are selected at time step to meaure the agricultural parameters for
    time step . Therefore, three possible angles can be calculated between the lines
    connected the selected sensor nodes and the located at the area center. These
    angles are , , and . The RMSE from the optimal angle of these three angles is
    the sensor group spreading . Download : Download high-res image (184KB) Download

    group dispersing The crop yields and the network lifetime are not only enhanced
    by selecting a group of sensor nodes in spread places inside the area with respect
    to the angle separations among sensor nodes, but also by selecting a group of
    sensor nodes with dispersing radius length from the area center where the plant
    is planted. In this paper, the radius variation between each sensor node to the
    next sensor node is linked with the root length of the plant. Therefore, the modeling
    of the plant root system is a key requirement in this research. In agriculture,
    root system for the plants delivers the carbon, energy, water, nutrient, and solutes
    for the plant [37]. Several researches focus on mathematical modeling for the
    growth of the plant root system architecture [38,39]. Root system architecture
    is used to visualize and analyze the branched structure of root system. Therefore,
    the soil volume of the plant can be determined and predicted [39]. Root system
    models are mainly function of space and time [38]. C-Root is one example of a
    continuous and general model of root system growth that emphases on the root growth
    in the soil with time and place. C-Root complies with wide range of plants roots
    type including tap and fibrous root system [40]. The length of the root is modeled
    using linear or exponential growth [37]. In this paper, linear growth of root
    system of area at time step is adopted according to the following relation [37]:
    (37) , , and are the minimum root length, maximum root length and the root growth
    rate of area , respectively. Therefore, with increasing the age of plant, the
    root is more circulated in the soil. The optimal radius variation of area between
    the radius of each sensor node to the radius of the next sensor maximizes the
    dispersing of sensor nodes group. The optimal radius variation of area at time
    step is calculated as follows: (38) The normalized optimal radius variation of
    area is computed by dividing the optimal radius variation to the maximum radius
    variation ( ) according to the following equation: (39) (40) Therefore, the normalized
    optimal radius of sensor node is computed according to the following equation:
    (41) is the number of sensor node in the group . Consequently, the squared error
    from the optimal radius of the normalized radius of the sensor node in the selected
    group at time step is defined as follows: (42) is the normalized radius of sensor
    node from the area center . Before computing the errors in Eq. (42), the sensor
    nodes in the group should be firstly sorted in ascending order with respect to
    the radius of sensor node from the area center so that: (43) The normalized radius
    of sensor node from the area center is computed by dividing the radius to the
    maximum radius according to the following equation: (44) (45) The mean of all
    squared errors of the normalized radiuses for all sensor nodes in the selected
    group is calculated as follows: (46) Therefore, the sensor group dispersing error
    of area at time step is defined as the Root mean square error (RMSE) of the radius
    errors of the sensor nodes in the selected group, which is calculated as: (47)
    (48) In Fig. 3, of sensor nodes group are selected at time step to meaure the
    agricultural parameters for time step . For , the three optimal radiuses for each
    sensor node are , , and . Download : Download high-res image (177KB) Download

    neighbors count percentage To improve the network lifetime, the group of sensor
    nodes is selected so that the neighbors count of the selected nodes are high,
    compared with other neighbors count of sensor nodes inside the area. Accordingly,
    when the energy remaining of selected sensor nodes is ended, other neighbors of
    selected sensor nodes will cover the network and avoid the holes in the network.
    For a communication radio range of , the number of neighbors of sensor node at
    time step are calculated as follows: (49) The Group neighbors count percentage
    is defined the ratio between the summation of neighbors count of the selected
    sensor group to the summation of neighbors counts of all sensor nodes inside the
    area at time step . (50) (51) 5.4. Group energy remaining percentage The energy
    is consumed from of sensor nodes due to the sensing, communication and processing
    activities [41]. Therefore, the selection of sensor nodes group with high energy
    remaining advances the network lifetime because sensor nodes with higher energy
    remaining can remain alive for longer period, compared with lower energy remaining
    nodes. The Group energy remaining percentage is defined the ratio between the
    summation of energy remaining of the selected sensors group to the summation of
    energy remaining of all sensor nodes inside the area at time step . (52) (53)
    is the energy remaining of sensor node at time step . 5.5. Energy consumption
    model The transmitting energy consumption and receiving energy consumption required

    of are calculated as follows [42,43]: (54) (55) depends of the transmitter processing
    such as coding, modulation and filtering, and is related to the amplifier energy.
    6. The proposed algorithms of AHPA scheme In this section, the proposed algorithms
    of AHPA scheme are presented. The measurement method of the agricultural parameters
    including the soil moisture and temperature are firstly introduced. After that,
    the detailed description of Optimally sensors selection algorithm (OSSA) is explained.
    OSSA aim to get the optimal group of sensor nodes that are employed to sense the
    agricultural parameters to improve the performance metrics which are sensors group
    spreading, sensor group dispersing, group neighbors count Percentage, and group
    energy remaining percentage. OSSA adopts the Genetic algorithm (GA) as an evolutionary
    optimization algorithm to optimize these performance metrics. Finally, Adaptive
    sampling interval algorithm (ASIA) of scheme is presented to dynamically compute
    the sampling interval according to the current values of the agricultural parameters
    so that the crop yields are improved. 6.1. Agricultural parameters measurements
    In this research, EKF mentioned in Section 4 is adopted to measure the soil moisture
    and temperature. As introduced in [9], the EKF algorithm starts from the initialization
    stage in which the initial updated state and its covariance matrix is initialized.
    After that, the prediction stage is performed to firstly predict the sampling
    interval of the next update stage using the current updated state . Adaptive sampling
    interval algorithm (ASIA) is invented in this research to proactively compute
    the sampling interval. Section 6.3 describes the ASIA in details. Secondly, the
    predicted state and its covariance matrix of the next measurement time are achieved
    using EKF. Finally, a group of sensor nodes are proactively selected to sense
    the soil moisture and temperature in the next update stage. Optimally sensors
    selection algorithm (OSSA) is invented in this paper to select the group of sensor
    nodes so that the performance metrics which are presented in Section 5 are improved.
    Section 6.2 describes the OSSA in details. Then, the update stage is performed
    again after the sampling interval is passed. The prediction and update stages
    continue to be performed until a termination condition is satisfied. 6.2. Optimally
    sensors selection algorithm The Optimally sensors selection algorithm (OSSA) is
    proposed in this paper to get the optimal group of sensor nodes that are used
    to sense the soil moisture and temperature so that the performance metrics described
    in Section 5 are enhanced. The proposed four performance metrics presented in
    Section 5 is combined into two performance metrics which are the Network lifetime
    (NL) and the Root system (RS) metrics. The sensor group spreading and dispersing
    errors are combined and averaged into the RS metric as follows: (56) The proposed
    optimization problem is a minimization optimization problem. Since it is required
    to maximize the group neighbors count and the group energy remaining percentages,
    the inverted version of and are used which are and . Therefore, the inverted group
    neighbors count and the group energy remaining percentages are combined and averaged
    into the inverted NL metric as follows: (57) At each time step , the fitness function
    of the proposed OSSA for the area is the weighted sum of the proposed performance
    metrics as follows: (58) In Eq. (58), the spreading and dispersing (i.e., RS)
    of sensors group are combined and weighted together by . On the other hand, the
    group neighbors count and the group energy remaining percentages (i.e., NL) is
    weighted by . Therefore, the main objective of the OSSA is to search for the optimal
    group of sensor nodes to sense the agricultural soil parameters such that the
    fitness function defined in Eq. (46) is minimized as follows: (59) This is subject
    to the constraints from Eq. (60) to Eq. (64) as follows: (60) (61) is the energy
    level remaining at sensor node and is the minimum energy level that should be
    remained by the sensor node . (62) Eq. (62) indicates that each sensor node at
    the selected group is unique and does not been repeated at the same group. (63)
    (64) Eq. (63) and (64) show that the selected sensor group of the area should
    be belong to the set of the sensor nodes at the same area . To get the best group
    of sensor nodes of the area at time step that minimizes the fitness function stated
    in Eq. (58), the best sensor nodes out from sensor nodes should be determined.
    Therefore, the fitness function stated in Eq. (58) have to be computed for all
    combinations of sensor nodes out from of sensor nodes. The number of these combinations
    is calculated as: (65) In addition, the number of all commination for all areas
    are calculated as: (66) The total number of combinations defined in Eq. (65) is
    large for large values of , , and . Consequently, computing the fitness function
    defined in Eq. (58) for all combinations requires high resources in term of time,
    processing, and communication which are limited in WSN. Therefore, the Genetic
    algorithm (GA) as an optimization technique are adopted to search for the optimal
    or near-optimal sensor nodes groups. It does not require to test all combinations
    using GA. The termination condition to end the searching of GA is determined by
    the algorithm based on different performance requirements. GA is an evolutionary
    optimization algorithm. It is adopted in this research to solve the optimization
    problem described in Eq. (59). GA is a population-based optimization technique
    that processes several solutions at each iteration. Biological genetic operations
    including the crossover and mutation inspire the operation of GA. The genetic
    operations are performed among the current population to produce a new generation
    with better individual. The iterations of generation production are repeated until
    a termination condition is satisfied [44,45]. In this paper, the chromosome is
    the suggested solution which is the group of selected sensor nodes. Therefore,
    the gene of GA chromosome consists of the identification of sensor nodes . Fig.
    4, Fig. 5 show examples of GA chromosomes of area with and area with , respectively.

    the roulette wheel selection. The absolute value of finesses summation of all
    chromosomes in is saved in . After that, a random number is generated between

    population are added one by one. For every iteration, if becomes greater than
    or equal the total fitness , the summation is stopped. The chromosome at which

    of is higher than the fitness function of . 6.3. Adaptive sampling interval algorithm
    In this section, the Adaptive sampling interval algorithm (ASIA) of scheme is
    presented. The sampling interval is the time between two successive sensing activities.
    To improve the crop yields, the sensing activities should perform at the right
    time before the soil moisture is getting under its threshold level. On the other
    hand, low value of sampling interval leads to consume more energy for sensing,
    processing and communication activities. Hence, the network lifetime degrades
    with low sampling interval. Therefore, the sampling interval should be dynamically
    computed according to the current values of soil moisture and temperature. The
    sampling interval is chosen to be a high value, for high level of soil moisture
    because the soil moisture takes high time to decrease to its threshold value and
    vis versa. Similarly, when the soil temperature has a lower value, the soil moisture
    can maintain for longer time. Therefore, the sampling interval is assumed to be
    changed linearly with the ratio between the soil moisture and the soil temperature
    as shown in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image (111KB) Download : Download

    7. Results and discussion In this section the proposed AHPA scheme is evaluated
    and analyzed. The simulation assumption is firstly stated. After that, the measurements
    technique of AHPA is evaluated and compared with other schemes. Then, the OSSA
    and ASIA are evaluated and compared with traditional schemes. 7.1. Simulation
    assumptions In this research, event driven simulation is adopted to evaluate the
    proposed AHPA scheme. C++ programming language is used to implement the simulation
    environment. Computer with 24GB memory and core i7–7500U-2.70 GHz processor is
    employed to run the simulation. Mersenne Twister random number generator [47]
    is adopted to produce random number from different probability distribution. The
    initial updated state and its covariance matrix for all areas are set as: (71)
    (72) The maximum root length presented in Eq. (37) is set based on the maximum
    area radius which is calculated as follows: (73) For the purpose of this research,
    the system transition function of Eq. (9) and its covariance matrix are assumed
    to be [5,9]: (74) (75) Thus, the Jacobian matrix with size ( ) of the evolution
    function at is computed as follows: (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) The model of measurement
    function of Eq. (10) for sensor node is assumed to be [5,9]: (81) The measurement
    covariance matrix of the selected group of sensor nodes is a diagonal matrix with
    size of . The value of element at the diagonal of matrix is computed as follows:
    (82) For example, for , the measurement covariance matrix is computed as follows:
    (83) Consequently, the Jacobian matrix with size ( ) of at is computed as follows:
    (84) (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) Unless it is specifically stated, the simulation
    assumptions for the evolution of the proposed AHPA scheme is shown in Table 4.

    EKF The updated state at each time step is plotted in Fig. 9. The updated soil
    moisture at each time step for each area is plotted in Fig. 9(a). Since the first
    area has the smallest soil type based on moisture variation , it has lowest soil
    moisture reduction according to the dynamic model assumed in Eq. (74). Fig. 9(b)
    shows the updated soil temperature at each time step for each area. The first
    area has the highest temperature reduction because it has the highest soil type
    based on temperature variation . The variation of the reduction values for soil
    temperature and moisture among areas affects the sampling interval calculation
    for different areas. This effect is discussed in Section 7.2. Download : Download

    In Fig. 10, Fig. 11, the errors of soil moisture and temperature are plotted with
    the simulation time for each area. The sensing readings of soil moisture and temperature
    by the group of sensor nodes for each area at the update stage at time are averaged

    the errors of soil moisture and temperature with and without using EKF are computed
    according to the following relations: (93) (94) As shown in Fig. 10 and 11, the
    moisture and temperature errors with using EKF is smaller than the ones without
    using EKF because the EKF can filter the noise from the noisy measurements sensed
    by the sensor nodes. On the other hand, the random noises from the sensor nodes
    will remain associated with the measurements when the EKF is not used. Therefore,
    the proposed AHPA achieves more accurate agricultural parameters measurements,
    compared with other traditional schemes. 7.3. The performance metrics and fitness
    function of the OSSA The root length presented in Eq. (37) with the simulation
    time for each area is plotted in Fig. 12. The first area reaches to the maximum
    root length before any other areas since the root growth rate of it is the highest.
    At the beginning of simulation time, the root lengths of areas persist at the
    minimum root length because the linear model of root system described in Eq. (37)
    gives root length less than the . The root lengths during the simulation time
    for each area are used to selected the appropriate sensor nodes inside the circle
    of plant root. Download : Download high-res image (196KB) Download : Download

    metrics versus the GA iterations with different weighting parameter are plotted

    2, area 3, and area 4, respectively. When the value of weighting parameter is
    zero , the root system metric is eliminated from the fitness function described
    in Eq. (58). Therefore, the objective of the fitness function devolves into the
    maximization of the network lifetime metric. Hence, the of area 3 and of area
    4 are minimized to maximize the network lifetime metric. Conversely, The RMSE
    of spreading of area 1, RMSE of dispersing of area 2 are minimized in Fig. 13
    when the weighting parameter is one . As shown in Fig. 12, the GA algorithm evolves
    with the iteration to get the optimal or near-optimal solution at the end of iterations.

    14, Fig. 15, the fitness function described in Eq. (58) versus the GA iterations
    and simulation time, respectively is plotted with different weighting parameter
    for each area. When the weighting parameter is zero , the network lifetime metric
    is maximized without taking the root system metric into account in the fitness
    function. Therefore, the sensor nodes with the highest neighbors count and energy
    remaining are selected when . On the other hand, the root system metric is only
    considered to be minimized in the fitness function, when the weighting parameter
    is one . Therefore, the sensor nodes with lowest spreading and dispersing errors,
    compared with optimal cases are selected when . When the weighting parameter is
    half , both root system and network lifetime metrics are taken into the account.
    Therefore, when the weighting parameter is half , the values of fitness function
    in Fig. 14 and 15 are located between the values of fitness function when and
    . Fig. 15 shows that the proposed OSSA converges to the optimal or near-optimal

    system metric is eliminated and the network lifetime metric is only considered
    in the fitness function of Eq. (58). Therefore, the averaged neighbor counts and
    remaining energy of the evolved nodes for each area at the end of simulation are
    high, compared with other values for weighting parameter . For , the network lifetime
    metric is removed and the root system metric is only considered in the fitness
    function of Eq. (58). Consequently, the neighbor counts and remaining energy are
    uncontrolled in OSSA. For , both root system and network lifetime metrics are
    considered in the optimization problem proposed in Eq. (59). Thus, the averaged
    neighbor counts and remaining energy of the evolved and unevolved nodes are located
    between their values when and . In addition, the averaged neighbor counts and
    remaining energy of the evolved nodes when and are greater than their values of
    the unevolved sensor nodes, because the OSSA selects the evolved nodes with higher
    neighbor counts and remaining energy. On the other hand, the averaged neighbor
    counts and remaining energy of the evolved and unevolved nodes cannot be compared
    and are out of control when . 7.4. The ASIA compared with the fixed sampling interval
    schemes In this section, the proposed ASIA is compared with the schemes [18],
    [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] that uses fixed sampling interval.
    The adaptive and fixed sampling intervals for each area with the simulation time
    are plotted in Fig. 16. ASIA is performed at each time step to compute the sampling
    interval for each area based on the Eq. (67). The fixed sampling intervals of
    10 min and 15 min are applied for all areas. It is worth to notice that the sampling
    interval of the first area increases with the simulation time because as shown
    in Fig. (9), the first area has the lowest soil moisture reduction and the highest
    temperature reduction, compared with other areas. On the contrary, the fourth
    area has the lowest decreasing in sampling interval with the simulation time because
    it has the highest soil moisture reduction and the lowest temperature reduction
    a shown in Fig. (9). Accordingly, the sensing activities of the agricultural parameters
    increases in the fourth area to take the proper agricultural actions in the right
    time before the soil converts to be unsuitable for plant. Since the first area
    has the largest sampling interval rising, the sensing activities are reduced and
    in sequence, the energy consumption for sensing and communication are reduced.
    As a result, the adaptive sampling interval empowers the agricultural system to
    take the right actions at the right time and place which in turn, leads to improve
    the crop yields and the network lifetime. Therefore, the proposed AHPA scheme
    is a ubiquitous system. Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download :

    Area. In this paper, the energy is consumed due to the sensing and communication
    activities. The total energy consumption for the fixed schemes of 10 min and 15
    min are averaged for all areas at each time step. In Fig. 17, the total energy
    consumption with the simulation time for ASIA of each area and the fixed schemes
    of 10 min and 15 min are plotted. The fixed sampling interval of 15 min has the
    lowest energy consumption. However, the plant implanted in the areas with the
    high moisture and low temperature reduction will damage due to the late time of
    sensing activities. When the fixed sampling interval is set 10 min, the sensing
    activities increases. Nevertheless, the energy consumption becomes the highest,
    which leads to reduce the network lifetime. For the adaptive schemes, the energy
    consumption depends on the computed sampling interval. When the sampling interval
    is high such as in area 1, the energy consumption is low, and vice versa. Therefore,
    the energy consumption in ASIA rises when more sensing activities are required
    for areas with higher soil moisture reduction and low soil temperature reduction,
    and vice versa. Download : Download high-res image (257KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 17. Total Energy Consumption of different Schemes for each
    Area. The reduction state in the soil moisture and temperature between two consecutive
    measurement activities is defined based on the following equation: (95) Fig. 18
    and Fig. 19 show the reduction of soil moisture and temperature during the simulation
    time for each area by using the ASIA and fixed sampling interval schemes of 10
    min and 15 min. The at a fixed sampling interval schemes of 15 min are higher
    than the ones at a fixed sampling interval schemes of 10 min. This large reduction
    in soil moisture could cause death or damage for the plant root, and hence reduce
    the crop yields. Although the at a fixed sampling interval schemes of 10 min is
    small which maintain more frequent monitoring of the soil, the energy consumption
    increases for small value of sampling interval. In the ASIA, the depends on the
    value of sampling interval for each area, which is computed in Eq. (67) based
    on the current updated value of soil moisture and temperature. For instance, the
    increases with the simulation because its sampling interval rises as shown in
    Fig. (16). In area 3 and 4, reduces with the simulation times because their sampling
    interval decreases as shown in Fig. (16). Finally, the is almost fixed for area
    2 because its sampling interval is almost fixed as shown in Fig. (16). Download

    scheme In this section, the proposed OSSA is compared with other approaches. The
    energy balance and neighbors count metrics of area at time step when the simulation
    is terminated are defined as [9]: (96) (97) Table 6 shows the different performance
    metrics for the proposed OSSA and SHPA scheme [9] with different values of the
    weighting parameter in case of OSSA and in case of SHPA. The number of dead nodes,
    the energy balance, the neighbors count, and the number of evolved nodes in sensing
    activities for the four areas are averaged and recorded in Table 6. The time of
    the first node death of the four areas is noted in Table 6. ASIA is adopted to
    compute the adaptive sampling intervals for both OSSA and SHPA. Table 6. Averaged

    number of dead nodes increases with rising the weighting parameter in OSSA or
    in SHPA. This is because the effect of the network lifetime metric on the fitness
    function for OSSA and SHPA reduces with increasing the weighting parameters. Nevertheless,
    the proposed OSSA performs better than SHPA in term of the average number of dead
    nodes because the root system metric also improves the network lifetime through
    selecting spreading and dispersing sensor nodes to sense the agricultural parameters.
    Due to degrading the effectiveness of the network lifetime metric in the fitness
    function with increasing its weighting parameters in OSSA and SHPA, the first
    death time of the sensor node and the neighbor count metric reduces with increasing
    the weighting parameters. With the OSSA, the network lifetime is determined by
    the root system and network lifetime metrics. So, the OSSA has a larger first
    node death and neighbor count metrics than the SHPA scheme. As part of its implementation,
    the proposed OSSA utilizes the concepts of spreading and dispersing in order to
    highly cover the agricultural area and to enhance the load balancing. Due to these
    reasons, the number of sensor nodes evolved in OSSA is greater than that in SHPA.
    As defined in Eq. (96), the energy balance parameter is the summation of the normalized
    energy remaining of all sensor nodes inside the area at the end of simulation.
    Therefore, if the sensor node does not evolve in the sensing activities, its normalized
    energy remaining will be one at the end of simulation. The high value of energy
    balance defined in Eq. (96) indicates that low number of sensors nodes are evolved
    in sensing activities. Consequently, the balancing in term of energy consumption
    among sensor nodes is degraded. In SHPA scheme, the energy balance parameter increases
    with rising the weighting parameter because the weight of the lifetime metric
    decreases with rising the weighting parameter. In the proposed OSSA, both the
    network lifetime and the root system metrics contribute in the load balancing
    among sensor nodes. Thus, considering of the both performance metrics gives the
    lowest energy balance parameter. Furthermore, the proposed OSSA has better energy
    balancing among sensor nodes, compared with the SHPA scheme because of adopting
    the spreading and dispersing metrics in the fitness function evaluation. Fig.
    20 and Fig. 21 illustrate the locations of evolved sensor nodes and dead sensor
    nodes in each area for SHPA and OSSA. This paper introduces the concepts of spreading
    and dispersing in OSSA to improve crop yields and network lifetime. The evolved
    sensor nodes in the sensing activities and the dead sensor nodes are more evenly
    distributed across the area in the proposed OSSA than in the SHPA. OSSA also has
    fewer dead sensor nodes at the end of the simulation time than SHPA, since its
    load balancing is higher. Aside from that, the OSSA monitors and uses the development
    of the plant root system with time to select the sensor nodes. Download : Download

    values of 0.5. 8. Conclusion In this paper, Adaptive heterogeneous precision agriculture
    (AHPA) scheme is invented to measure the soil moisture and temperature in a heterogenous
    farm. According to the root system development of plant, the group neighbors count,
    and the group energy remaining, the AHPA scheme firstly performs the Optimally
    sensors selection algorithm (OSSA) to select a group of sensor nodes that will
    be used to sense the agricultural parameters. OSSA uses the Genetic algorithm
    (GA) as a population-based optimization technique to select the optimal or near-optimal
    group of sensor nodes so that the RMSE of group speeding, the RMSE of group dispersing,
    the inverted group neighbors count percentage, and the inverted group energy remaining
    percentage are minimized. After that, the AHPA scheme adopts the Extended kalman
    filter (EKF) to predicted the agricultural states of the soil moisture and temperature
    for each agricultural area independently. Then, the Adaptive sampling interval
    algorithm (ASIA) is executed to proactively compute the adaptive sampling interval
    based on the predicted agricultural state for each area disjointedly. In the update
    stage, the update states of the soil moisture and temperature is calculated using
    the EKF. The simulation results show that the performance metrics of the proposed
    AHPA scheme is improve, compared with other schemes. The usage of EKF eliminates
    the noises caused by the sensor nodes and associated with measurements. The total
    energy consumption and the reduction in the soil moisture and temperature between
    two consecutive measurement activities are improved in the proposed ASIA, compared
    with other fixed sampling interval schemes. The number of dead nodes, the time
    of the first node death, the energy balance, the neighbors count, and the number
    of evolved nodes in sensing activities are enhanced in the proposed OSSA compared
    with SHPA. Therefore, the network lifetime and crop yields are enhanced. Additionally,
    the sensor nodes are selected based on the root age to sense the whole soil of
    the plants. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have

    Metrics Media Abstract: Plant disease detection and management is one of the pivotal
    areas in the agriculture sector, which needs attention to abate crop loss. The
    recent trends in machine learning and deep learning have played a significant
    role in reducing crop loss with the help of early plant disease detection. For
    plant disease detection prior information on soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    relative humidity, leaf wetness sensor (LWS), rainfall are crucial parameters.
    In this work, the objective is to identify the source of leaf wetness on the leaf
    canopy, which can arise due to irrigation, rainfall, or dew. To identify the source
    of wetness on the leaf canopy, either rainfall or humidity/mist sensors are used,

    I. Introduction Crops and plants are prone to attack by various diseases and pests.
    These attacks are detrimental to the quality of crops produced and, subsequently,
    to the livelihood of the farmers. According to the literature, diseases, pests,
    and weeds contribute to 36% loss of crops [1]. The foremost cause of frequent
    plant diseases is a lack of supervision and monitoring. To overcome this challenge,
    advanced sensors based technology could be employed to install a supervision system
    in place. Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor technology is one of the leading
    solutions to monitor and keep track of the plant growth environment. Sensor signals
    along with machine learning algorithms have been shown to create robust disease
    detection and prediction systems [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. To abate crop loss due
    to diseases, researchers have proposed various disease warning systems. A few
    essential parameters for these models are leaf wetness duration (LWD), ambient
    temperature, and relative humidity [7], [8], [9]. The presence of water molecules
    on the surface of the leaves, paired with suitable ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, enables the germination of fungal diseases on the leaf canopy [10].
    Therefore, consistent measurement of LWD plays a crucial role in developing a
    sound disease prediction model. Researchers have explored various types of leaf
    wetness sensors (LWSs) out of which electronic LWS is deemed suitable for in situ
    measurements [10]. A lack of standard measurement practices has affected the in
    situ estimation of LWD values. In this work, an in-house affordable, temperature-compensated
    LWS has been used, which has been reported in our earlier works [11]. It highlights
    the key features of the novel LWS. The IoT-based sensor system enables remote
    sensing of the field parameters; thus, the system would work autonomously. The
    source of leaf wetness could be a valuable insight for predicting diseases. It
    would help farmers identify the cause of leaf wetness and enable them to take
    instant preventive measures. In a remote setting, the output from LWS can be used
    to determine the cause of moisture on the surface of the leaves. As suggested
    in [44], dew, rainfall, or irrigation are the plausible sources of wetness on
    the leaf canopy. In this work, these three causes of leaf wetness have been accounted
    for dew, rainfall, and irrigation. The LWS used in this work generates a frequency
    output corresponding to the presence of water on the leaf surface [44]. If water
    is present on the surface, the frequency declines from the baseline level and
    ascends again once the surface is dry [11]. As mentioned, each event produces
    a different frequency output when subjected to dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Therefore, the pattern generated through the frequency output of the LWS provides
    critical insight for detecting the source of wetness on the surface of leaves.
    Pattern recognition is a famous classification and detection technique. It is
    a process wherein the machine tries to classify the data according to the information
    gained from the regu- varieties observed in different types of data. There are
    several applications of pattern recognition like speech recognition, object identification,
    and classification of medical and explosive signals [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
    [18]. In this work, pattern recognition has been explored for LWS data wherein
    the data points correspond to either dew, rainfall, or irrigation. Syntactic,
    template matching, and statistical models are used for pattern recognition [19].
    The rising popularity of neural networks (NNs) for feature extraction has driven
    researchers to explore NNs for pattern recognition [20]. NN is capable of feature
    extraction from numerical, image, and text-based datasets. Multilayer perceptrons
    (MLPs) are fully connected NN used for pattern recognition [21], [22], [23]. A
    class of NN called convolutional NN (CNN) is widely used for image classification
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. Networks like VGGNet [28], AlexNet [29], and GoogLeNet
    [30] are famous CNN structures used for pattern recognition from image datasets.
    In this work, an ensemble model is proposed, which takes the numerical and image
    data for classifying the source of wetness (dew, rainfall, or irrigation) on the
    plant. Based on the sensor data, this article aims to classify the leaf wetness
    events in one of the three categories: dew, rainfall, or irrigation. LWS data
    plays a crucial role in determining the source of leaf wetness. While the sensor
    produces time-series data, significant information can be extracted from the patterns
    observed in the frequency domain. Therefore, the time-series data has been converted
    to image form using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and spectrogram representation.
    In addition to LWS, the disease prediction system uses other sensors like ambient
    temperature and relative humidity sensors [11]. These sensors monitor the environmental
    conditions. Rainfall and dew are natural phenomena and are characterized by distinct
    environmental conditions. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Sensors System
    and Field Deployment In this work, the LWS and IoT-enabled system have been used,
    which is reported in [11]. Fabricated LWS produces frequency output when subjected
    to the water molecule on its sensing surface. Further, for the temperature and
    humidity measurements, commercial sensors MCP 9710 and HIH 5030 are used, respectively.
    Subsequently, these sensors are interfaced with the in-house developed signal
    conditioning and processing circuits. The data collected from these sensors are
    uploaded to the ThingspeakTM server every 30 min. For the field measurement, fabricated
    LWS was deployed on the Mango tree at 45° angles, as shown in Fig. 1. Further,
    the field measurements are carried out for four months where approximately 5000
    data points are collected. Fig. 1. Deployment of the sensor on the leaves. Show
    All SECTION III. Data Preprocessing The primary focus is to prepare the data for
    classifying the source of wetness on the leaf, which can arise mainly due to dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. This involves feature extraction to identify leaf wetness
    events caused by dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Further, data labeling is done
    for both numerical and image data. Numerical attributes are standardized and fed
    into the MLP model and subsequently image data is transformed into spectrograms,
    which are fed into the CNN model. Data augmentation techniques are applied to
    enhance dataset size and diversity. These processes collectively aim to facilitate
    the accurate classification of leaf wetness events in a dataset comprising 392
    instances of dew, rainfall, and irrigation events, which helps reduce overfitting
    and improve model accuracy. A. Feature Extraction The main objective of this work
    is to determine the cause of leaf wetness by analyzing the patterns generated
    by an LWS. Three distinct events, namely dew, irrigation, and rainfall, can make
    leaves wet. To apply a classification algorithm effectively, it’s crucial to isolate
    and extract these individual wetness events and create training and testing datasets.
    This is achieved by identifying specific points at the start and end of each event
    using the find_peaks function from the sciPy library. This function detects the
    highest values in a 1-D signal within a specified height range. Fig. 2 represents
    the signal with starting and ending points marked using orange and green colors.
    The resulting signal is then divided into separate events, leading to the creation
    of a dataset comprising 98 leaf wetness events, each marked by distinct starting
    and ending points. Fig. 2. Leaf wetness events marked with points. Show All B.
    Data Labeling 1) Tabular Data: In this work, a hybrid model is trained using both
    numerical and image data. Numerical data comprise data from sensors like ambient
    temperature sensors, relative humidity sensors, and LWS. Each wetness event is
    numerically characterized by four features, namely, LWD value, average ambient
    temperature, average relative humidity, and maximum magnitude of frequency. Average
    temperature and humidity values are calculated for the duration of each event,
    and the maximum magnitude of frequency is obtained from the output of LWS. LWD
    values are extracted from the frequency response of LWS after smoothening the
    signal. The procedure followed for calculating LWD values has been reported in
    our previous work [11]. The numerical features corresponding to a single-leaf
    wetness event vary broadly in magnitude. To avoid bias due to differences in the
    range of magnitude during the training process, the features are normalized using
    Minmaxscaler function available in scikit-learn library [33]. After normalization,
    all features would lie within a range of 0–1, eliminating any bias due to their
    magnitude. 2) Image Data: The dataset comprise individual frequency output responses
    corresponding to a particular event. To make it suitable for training a machine
    learning model, it has to be classified appropriately with the cause of the wetness.
    Three possible events are responsible for wetness on the leaves’ surface: dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. For ease of classification, the signal is inverted about
    the y-axis, such that a rise in the magnitude of frequency above baseline frequency
    marks the events. This is denoted by ( ΔF ) as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Isolated
    events from the frequency response of leaf wetness sensor corresponding to (a)
    dew, (b) rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All In this work, the time-series
    numerical data from LWS is transformed into image format to leverage the 2-D CNN
    model. CNN is one of the most popular NNs for image classification due to its
    high accuracy [34]. The signal is converted into the frequency domain from the
    time domain using an STFT to convert the numerical data for LWS into image form.
    STFT captures the signal’s frequency components over a small window length of
    256, which is the function’s default size, and tracks them across the duration
    of the signal. STFT of the frequency output of LWS has been computed using the
    scipy library [32]. In doing so, an attempt is made to capture the salient features
    of the patterns observed in the sensor output. These patterns are observed when
    the sensor detects the presence of water on the surface. Fig. 4 represents the
    spectrograms of STFT of the LWS sensor signals. It is evident from the spectrograms,
    as depicted in Fig. 4 that the intensity of frequency components differs for the
    different categories of events viz., dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Therefore,
    these spectrograms could be used for training a CNN-based classification model.
    The images are resized and converted to binary to assist the edge-detection capacity
    of CNN. Fig. 4. STFT spectrograms of leaf wetness sensor data for (a) dew, (b)
    rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All The frequency magnitude is the first indicator
    of the possible event that could have caused leaf wetness [44]. Leaf wetness due
    to dew is characterized by a frequency output response with a maximum magnitude
    less than or equal to 4 kHz. Therefore, all events for which the rise in frequency
    ( ΔF ) is less than or equal to 4 kHz are labeled “Dew.” Out of 98 leaf wetness
    events and 13 events for Dew have been obtained. Apart from considering the magnitude
    of the frequency output of LWS, to differentiate between the events due to irrigation
    and rain, a second parameter, LWD has been used. The events with a maximum magnitude
    of frequency greater than 10 kHz or LWD more than 19 h have been labeled as “Rain.”
    Subsequently, the rest of the events were labeled as “Irrigation.” From the given
    signal, 48 events due to rain and 37 events due to irrigation has been observed.
    Fig. 3 shows five signals, each corresponding to the three natural phenomena discussed
    above. The magnitude on the y -axis is under the criteria used to classify the
    events in the appropriate categories. C. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is
    a crucial strategy to prevent overfitting in NNs due to limited data. This study
    is critical because leaf wetness events are uncontrollable. Techniques like horizontal
    flipping and adding random Gaussian noise are applied to image data while preserving
    original patterns. Numerical data are also augmented with Gaussian noise. After
    using these techniques, the dataset grows from 98 to 392 leaf wetness events,
    enhancing the dataset’s size and robustness for machine learning purposes. SECTION
    IV. Proposed Model for Classification In this work, artificial neural network
    (ANN) is an attractive choice because it ensembles NNs that can be built to deal
    with different types of data at the same time. In this work, NN is devolved that
    is capable of learning both numerical data and image data simultaneously. The
    sub-model trained to learn numerical data is an MLP and that trained using the
    image data is a CNN. The model proposed in this work, has been implemented using
    the tensorflow library [36]. A. Multilayer Perceptron MLP is a class of feed-forward
    NNs with fully connected layers. It comprises input and output layers connected
    between multiple hidden layers. In this work, the MLP is supplied by four input
    features—LWD values, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity, and
    maximum magnitude of frequency observed for the event. As mentioned, the three
    types of layers in MLP have neurons responsible for propagating the information
    to the following layer. Fig. 5 shows a descriptive diagram of an MLP (sub-model
    1). The input features are supplied to the input layer. In this work, four features
    are used namely, LWD value, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity,
    and maximum magnitude of frequency. Let the input vector be represented by X i
    for i∈[1,4] . The input is passed on to the hidden layer. The output of the ith
    neuron in the lth hidden layer of MLP, y m [l]i , is the weighted summation of
    its input provided from the preceding hidden layer. The process is called forward
    propagation, accomplished by the following equation [23]: y m [l])i =F( ∑ i=1
    n−1 w m [l]i . a m [l−1]i + b m [l]i ) (1) View Source where w m (l)i and b m
    (l)i are the weight and bias of the neuron, respectively, and a m (l−1)i is the
    activated neuron from the previous layer. The function F(x) is the activation
    function assigned to each layer. For the hidden layers, it is a linear function
    called rectified linear unit (ReLu). This function maximizes the speed of training
    due to less computation and avoids the vanishing gradient problem [37]. In case
    of the input layer a m [l−1]i is replaced with X i . The output vector of MLP
    (sub-model 1) is denoted by Y m . Fig. 5. Proposed model for leaf wetness events
    classification. Show All B. Convolutional Neural Network A CNN was implemented
    for training the image data due to its superior image classification performance.
    CNN models learn by identifying the edges of the images during the training process.
    The convolutional layer is composed of 2-D filters, i.e., kernels, traverse over
    the entire image depending on the size of the kernel. The kernel is a 2-D weight
    matrix. The layer performs convolution of the filter and overlapping input and
    extracts the features of the given image. CNN follows the same process of forward
    propagation, as described in MLP, to transfer the information through the network
    layers. However, in this case, the input images of spectrograms are convolved
    with the filters. It is a multiplication operation on the 2-D input matrices,
    i.e., image and kernel. The following equation defines the convolutional process
    [45]: y c [l]u,v =F( ∑ i=0 p−1 ∑ j=0 q−1 w c [l]i,j . a c (l−1)(u+i),(v+j) + b
    c [l]u,v ). (2) View Source y c (l)u,v is the output of the lth convolutional
    layer at the (u,v) position. The variables w c [l]i,j and a c [l−1](u+i),(v+j)
    are the kernel and input image, respectively. Here, the dimension of the kernel
    is (p×q) . The activation function, F(x) , for intermediate layers is ReLu [37].
    Furthermore, a max-pooling layer is used to prevent over-fitting. The data is
    down-sampled by replacing the output of the convolutional layer with the maximum
    value observed in a particular neighborhood. The MaxPooling2D layer from tensorflow
    implements the max-pooling function [36]. A window of size 3×3 with a stride of
    2 is employed. This operation reduces the dimensions of the data and makes the
    computation much more efficient. An additional layer was added to ensure an effective
    learning process called batchnormalization. The principal objective of this method
    is to normalize the input to the following layer. The batch normalization layer
    from the tensorflow library is added to the model to ensure that the inputs are
    normalized and smooth and that the learning does not suffer due to bias toward
    a specific input owing to nonuniform distribution. Y c denotes the output vector
    of CNN (sub-model 2). C. Training the Hybrid Model The main advantage of the dataset
    collected in this work is data availability from various sensors. While the pattern
    observed in the frequency output of LWS directly corresponds to identifying the
    event that caused wetness on the leaves, the other sensors measuring ambient temperature
    and relative humidity offer critical insights into the environmental conditions
    when the leaf wetness event occurred. These environmental factors could assist
    the model in making a decision. As discussed in Section III-A, the sensor data
    is preprocessed and organized in tabular format. The patterns observed in the
    LWS data are converted to images, as discussed in Section III-B. Fig. 5 illustrates
    the model used to predict the leaf wetness event. The tabular and image data are
    processed parallelly using the first two sub-models. Sub-model 1 is a multilayer
    perceptron described in Section IV-A. It has three hidden layers, each activated
    using a ReLu function. Sub-model 2 is a CNN, as Section IV-B describes, with two
    convolutional and max-pooling layers and a final batch-normalization layer. The
    convolutional layers are activated using the ReLu activation function. The output
    of the two sub-models is concatenated and provided as to the standard NN. The
    connected outcomes can be represented as C=[ Y m , Y c ] T . (3) View Source The
    input passes through the model via forward propagation as described in (1) and
    (2), depending on the sub-model. The two sub-models are responsible for feature
    extraction from the original data received from the sensors. The NNs are adept
    at feature extraction because of their densely connected structure [22]. The sub-model
    outputs are concatenated into a single vector and used further for training. The
    final sub-model denoted in Fig. 5 is responsible for the predictions. The outcome
    of the NN ensemble is obtained from the last layer of the final sub-model. It
    has three neurons corresponding to each leaf wetness event—dew, rainfall, and
    irrigation. The output is the probability of occurrence of the event based on
    the input features. This output is achieved by applying “softmax” as the activation
    function to the output layer [38]. The process finds the normalized exponential
    value for each class σ( c o )= e c o ∑ N j=1 e c j . (4) View Source In the above
    equation, c o is the output value of a neuron for a particular class. The exponential
    divided by the exponential of every neuron in the output layer. Thus, (4) calculates
    the probability of occurrence of one of the events. The model is trained by back-propagation.
    The method aims to minimize the cost function of the prediction by reassigning
    weights. The cost function chosen for training this model is “categorical cross-entropy”
    which is suitable for multiclass classification [38]. In the multiclass category,
    the events belong to only one of the possible classes. The following equation
    represents the loss function: Loss=− ∑ o=1 3 t o log( y o ) (5) View Source where
    t o is the class’s true value, and y o is the predicted probability from the output
    layer, which uses the softmax function. The model has been trained for 200 epochs
    with a batch size of 32 because of the small size of the dataset. This combination
    would converge to a loss value faster. The optimizer used is Adam because of its
    superior performance [39]. Fig. 5 shows the complete ensemble model used in this
    work. SECTION V. Result and Discussion A. Exploratory Data Analysis This section
    uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data trends. A pie chart in
    Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of leaf wetness causes, showing that rainfall
    is the most common (about half of the events), followed by irrigation (37.8%)
    and dew (13.3%). The June to October 2021 study aligns with the monsoon season,
    explaining the prevalence of rain-induced leaf wetness. Fig. 6. Pie chart distribution
    of leaf wetness events. Show All B. Model Performance The experiments are conducted
    for various hidden layers and neurons, and it has been found that the best accuracy
    achieved is around 96.13% for the ensemble model. Both model sub-model 1 (MLP)
    and sub-model 2 (CNN) were combined with another NN (final sub-model). As a result,
    the hidden layers are changed and neurons in sub-model 1, sub-model 2, and the
    final sub-model. It has been found that the best layers and neurons are three
    layers and 30-24-16 neurons for sub-model 1, four layers, and 128-64-24-12 neurons
    for sub-model 2 and four layers and 30-24-16 neurons for the final sub-model.
    Table I displays a comparison of many models. The recommended model outperformed
    several techniques in Table I, with an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE I Comparison
    of Different Models As mentioned in Section IV-C, the ensemble model is trained
    for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32. Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the training and
    validation accuracy and loss for the proposed model. In this work, the proposed
    model architecture learns from a combination of numerical data and image data.
    The MLP is responsible for learning the numerical tabular data, while the CNN
    learns the image data, as described in Section IV. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the
    characteristic decline of the loss curve, which validates the learning process.
    The steady decline of the loss curve for validation data indicates learning and
    the absence of overfitting by the model. From Fig. 7(b), it can be observed that
    the ensemble model converges the fastest to the lowest loss value. Fig. 7. (a)
    Model accuracy, (b) cross-entropy loss, and (c) ROCs for dew, rainfall, and irrigation.

    gives information about the classification capability of the trained model. The
    45° reference line shown in Fig. 7(c) denotes a model incapable of differentiating
    between positive and negative outputs. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) graph
    is a point where the true positive rate (TPR) is 1 and the false positive rate
    (FPR) is 0. A good ROC curve is closer to the top left corner and away from the
    45° line. Fig. 7(c) shows three ROC curves, one for each of the classes- dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. The AUC is an insightful indicator of the model performance.
    AUC measures the model’s capability to differentiate between the classes. In this
    work, the AUC for dew, rainfall, and irrigation is 0.99, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively.
    The output layer of the NN ensemble described in Section IV uses softmax activation
    function which produces a probability of each possible outcome. These probabilities
    are converted to absolute values of 0 or 1, where 0 indicates negative output
    and 1 indicates a positive output. Further, the precision and recall have been
    calculated as tabulated in Table II. Precision is the fraction of predicted positive
    values, which are actually positive the following equation. On the other hand,
    recall is the fraction of actually positive values that have been correctly predicted
    the following equation [43]: Precision Recall = (True Positive) (True Positive+False
    Positive) = (True Positive) (True Positive+False Negative) . (6) (7) View Source
    TABLE II Evaluation Metrics for Classification of Dew, Rainfall, and Irrigation
    Table II gives the precision and recall values for all the events, along with
    the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It measures
    the model’s performance, accounting for the trade-off between precision and recall.
    From Table III, it can be observed that the version of the model is suitable for
    all the events. Slightly less memory is observed for dew. However, it is due to
    the limited number of samples. The average value of the F1 score is 0.8396, which
    signifies a good balance between precision and recall. The significance of a high
    F1 score is that the model can correctly identify the positive data samples. Table
    III presents a comparison of various ensemble models across different applications.
    Researchers have employed the CNN-LSTM model for applications in medical, robotics,
    pedestrian navigation, and e-commerce, while the Darknet19-CNN-LSTM model has

    VI. Conclusion Agriculture plays a pivotal role in a country’s economy and methods
    to make it more efficient should be devised. In this work, with the motivation
    of reducing the cost of early plant disease prediction systems, the leaf wetness
    sensor is used to detect the LWS and also the source of wetness on the leaf canopy.
    For this purpose, the data is collected from LWS, ambient temperature sensor,
    and relative humidity sensor. The initial preprocessing and data engineering helped
    us create a dataset that could be used to train a machine-learning model capable
    of predicting the natural event responsible for leaf wetness. The sensors produced
    numerical time series data indicative of the three leaf wetness events- dew, rainfall,
    and irrigation. STFT is applied to the LWS data to obtain an image since the patterns
    obtained in the sensor output for different events are different. Further, an
    MLP-CNN model is built, which is capable of learning from tabular data as well
    as image data simultaneously. The MLP with numerical data produced a satisfactory
    accuracy of 92.86% while the CNN model with image data produced an accuracy of
    62.93% and the ensemble NN (MLP-CNN) classifier produced an accuracy of 96.13%.
    It has been observed that the final model classified the leaf wetness events with
    an average precision and recall of 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. Authors Figures

    2015 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT) are widely adopted for various real-world applications, including medical,
    military, and environment monitoring. These systems have resource-limited sensors
    that collect environmental data, such as temperature and humidity. However, due
    to harsh deployment environments and the inherent limitations of sensors, WSNs
    and IoT systems are vulnerable to various forms of abnormal behaviour. Such anomalies
    can severely impact the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, ultimately
    affecting the applications dependent on them. In WSNs, an outlier refers to a
    data point that deviates significantly from the expected pattern of collected
    data [1]. These outliers can originate from various sources, including errors
    and noise, events, and malicious attacks, as described in [2]. Outlier detection
    approaches can be categorized based on different criteria, such as whether they
    target outliers or events, whether they operate online or offline, and whether
    they are supervised or unsupervised, distributed or centralized [2]. In our research,
    we focus specifically on online outlier detection. Therefore, to mitigate such
    issues, outlier detection techniques have been developed for IoT and WSN applications
    to monitor abnormal behavior and identify and classify outliers in real-time.
    This is essential in applications where timely decision-making is crucial, such
    as the following use cases: Healthcare monitoring: In healthcare applications,
    WSNs are used to monitor patients’ vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure,
    and temperature. Detecting outliers in real-time can help identify critical events
    or errors in the collected data, enabling healthcare professionals to take immediate
    action. Industrial monitoring: WSNs are deployed in industrial settings to monitor
    various parameters like temperature, pressure, and vibration. Outlier detection
    can help identify anomalies that may indicate equipment malfunction or potential
    risks, allowing for proactive maintenance and preventing costly downtime. Smart
    cities: WSNs play a crucial role in smart city applications, monitoring environmental
    factors, traffic conditions, and energy consumption. Real-time outlier detection
    can help identify abnormal patterns or events, such as pollution spikes or traffic
    congestion, enabling efficient management and resource allocation. Our work is
    primarily motivated by considering the real-time Decision-making in such applications.
    Offline detection techniques are insufficient as they cannot process streaming
    data in real-time. Therefore, there is a need for an approach that can detect
    and classify outliers online, ensuring data quality and enabling timely decision-making.
    Secondly, while various solutions have been proposed for online outlier detection,
    they cannot often consider the correlations between sensor data vectors and provide
    a real-time classification of errors and events. Including correlation information
    can help identify the origin of outliers, distinguishing between erroneous data
    that can be discarded and actual events in the physical world that require decision-making.
    The proposed SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach aims to address this limitation by considering
    the spatial-temporal relationships among sensor data vectors. Thirdly, WSNs collect
    data from multiple sensors, resulting in multivariate data. Many existing approaches
    struggle to handle such data effectively. The SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach addresses
    the specific requirements of the previous use cases by providing online outlier
    detection and classification capabilities, considering correlations between different
    multivariate data attributes, and enabling dynamic adaptation to seasonal variations
    in the data. Some existing works address these challenges but still operate offline
    or need more enhancements. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced approach of
    our previous work O\\(^2\\)DCA [3], for online clustering, outlier detection,
    and classification in WSNs. Our new approach, named SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, consists
    of two main systems: the CDC (Clustering, Detection, Classification) system, which
    comprises two key phases—training and online—and the monitoring system. For the
    training phase of the CDC system, we build an initial \\(TM_{0}\\) or a set of
    seasonal training models STM = \\(\\{TM1, TM2,... TMs\\}\\) in an offline manner.
    The goal of \\(TM_{0}\\) is to cluster an initial set of data vectors and detect
    and classify the outliers using different input parameters (cluster radius w and
    the number of nearest neighbours K) to reach the highest Detection Rate (DR) and
    the False Alarm Rate (FAR) performance metrics. This \\(TM_{0}\\) will be used
    later in the online phase to cluster the new coming streaming real-life data vectors.
    Our approach can also able to use a set of seasonal training models and change
    between them dynamically at the end of each season period. Within the CDC system,
    we consider the correlation of sensor data in both time and space. We aim to identify
    the origin of the outliers, distinguishing between erroneous data that can be
    discarded and actual events in the physical world that require a decision. The
    CDC system will alert the monitoring system for every detected error or event.
    The monitoring system will check the received alerts, process them and send different
    feedback information. To evaluate SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, we conduct a simulation test,
    where our approach uses the current \\(TM_{0}\\) until the DR performance changes
    and is less than a predefined threshold \\(\\alpha\\). In such case, we build
    a new TM and continue working online. We also conduct another simulation test,
    where our approach uses the first TM in the set STM and can change the TM dynamically
    at the end of each season. Our approach can also change the current TM and build
    a new one if the level of DR is less than a predefined threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\)
    or the FAR is greater than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Our evaluation focused on the DR
    and FAR performance metrics, specifically in the context of multivariate data.
    Our simulation results, using a combination of synthetic and real-life multivariate
    datasets, show that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms not only our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA
    approach but also other approaches from the literature. Additionally, our enhanced
    approach maintains stable performance across a range of \\(\\alpha\\) values even
    with fewer required \\(TM_{s}\\). The main contribution of this paper can be synthesized
    as: we introduce SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, a novel and advanced approach for online outlier
    detection and classification in WSNs. Our approach utilizes an initial TM that
    is dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of newly arriving streaming
    data vectors. We also developed our new approach to work with seasonal real-life
    applications where it can change the TM dynamically at the end of each season
    period. Our evaluation involves a comparative analysis of the performance of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    against O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] and two other approaches [4] proposed in the literature.
    We assess the performance of these approaches using several performance metrics,
    including DR, FAR, and ACC. Our methodology considers the spatial-temporal relationships
    among sensors multivariate data vectors to distinguish between erroneous and event-based
    outliers. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA,
    is the first to incorporate adaptive TM changing and dynamic adaptation to seasonal
    data in online outlier detection and classification solutions for WSNs. The subsequent
    sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the related
    works concerning online outlier detection in WSNs. Algorithms used in our proposed
    approach and its architecture are presented in Sect. 3. We provide the results
    of our evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets in Sect. 4, where we examine
    various performance metrics. Finally, we conclude the paper in Sect. 5. 2 Related
    Work Online outlier detection refers to identifying and flagging outliers in real-time
    or near real-time as data streams are generated. Such a process is essential for
    several WSN applications, where it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify
    and classify anomalous behaviours to respond to them effectively. On the other
    hand, offline outlier detection is the process of identifying outliers in a dataset
    after it has been collected. This type of outlier detection is commonly employed
    when dealing with massive amounts of data, as it allows for more thorough analysis
    and can provide more accurate results. However, it is unsuitable for applications
    requiring immediate outlier detection and classification. The literature offers
    several approaches for online outlier detection in WSNs. This section discusses
    relevant works in this domain, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In
    [5], a novel approach for outlier identification in WSNs was introduced. The proposed
    method leverages the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise
    (DBSCAN) algorithm and consists of two main modules. The first module focuses
    on parameter computation, specifically determining the minimum radius threshold
    (\\(\\epsilon\\)) for accepting a cluster. The second module handles class identification
    within a spatial-temporal dataset, enabling the detection of outliers. In [6],
    an approach for identifying outliers and events in wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    was proposed. This approach utilized the OPTICS clustering algorithm that eliminates
    the need for manual configuration or a predefined number of clusters. The experimental
    results demonstrated that their approach achieved high outlier detection and event
    identification accuracy while maintaining a low rate of false classification between
    errors and events. In [7], the authors developed a new classification model that
    combines deep belief networks with the Online Quarter-Sphere One-Class Support
    Vector Machines (QSOC-SVMs). This model is designed to improve the accuracy and
    efficiency of outlier detection in high-dimensional and large-scale datasets,
    such as those typically gathered by WSNs. Their model uses a sorting method to
    learn the quarter sphere radius during the training phase and then uses this information
    to classify data values as outliers or non-outliers during the unsupervised testing
    phase. In [8], the authors introduced an unsupervised algorithm for real-time
    anomaly detection in continuous data sequences. They utilized the Hierarchical
    Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm, which is an online sequence memory algorithm
    that can continuously learn and model the spatial-temporal characteristics of
    its inputs. However, HTM does not directly model anomalies or provide an anomaly
    score. To address this issue, the authors computed a measure of prediction error
    based on the HTM network output and used a probabilistic model to calculate the
    likelihood of the system being in an anomalous state. A threshold was then applied
    to this likelihood value to determine whether an anomaly was present. In [9],
    authors proposed an online density-based approach for outlier detection on big
    data. Their approach is based on computing the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and
    it has two main steps. First, the Grid-Based Partitioning (GBP) algorithm divides
    the data into grids and assigns them to the distributed nodes in the network.
    This allows outlier detection to be performed in parallel, which is essential
    for dealing with large and high-dimensional datasets. Second, the Distributed
    LOF Computing (DLC) algorithm is used to detect density outliers in each grid
    partitions. This algorithm is designed to be efficient and scalable, and it can
    effectively handle high-dimensional data without requiring a large amount of network
    resources. In [10], authors proposed a new timely fog computing outlier detection
    method for IoT systems. Their method is designed to overcome the high latency
    of centralised approaches and the high energy consumption of distributed ones.
    Their proposed method sends all data values directly to the fog nodes for outlier
    detection. This eliminates the need for multi-hop transmission and allows efficient
    and low-latency outlier detection. The authors proposed two algorithms for outlier
    detection: the Ellipsoidal Neighbourhood Outlier Factor (ENOF), which is based
    on the LOF algorithm, and the Hyper-ellipsoidal clustering algorithm (HyCARCE).
    The ENOF algorithm is designed for high efficiency and low computation cost, while
    the HyCARCE algorithm solves the problem of prior knowledge of cluster parameters
    by automatically choosing them. Together, these algorithms provide a flexible
    and effective approach for outlier detection in IoT systems. In [11], the authors
    proposed a one-time framework for detecting outliers with a request. Their framework
    consists of two primary phases: the offline phase and the online phase. In the
    offline phase, they employ the K-Medoids algorithm to cluster the data points
    within the dataset. They also use a density-based outlier factor to identify the
    normal and outlier clusters. In the online phase, they use the clustering information
    and the detected outliers to detect the newly arrived outliers on the fly based
    on specific requests. This allows the framework to quickly and accurately detect
    outliers in the dataset. In [12], the authors proposed an Optimised Adaptive and
    Sliding Windowing (OASW) framework for anomaly detection in IoT data streams.
    Their framework is designed to adapt to the changing patterns of online IoT data
    streams, using the fast and high-performance LightGBM machine learning model and
    the drift adaptation concept. The OASW framework is a combination of sliding and
    adaptive window-based methods and performance-based methods. It is designed to
    efficiently and effectively detect anomalies in IoT data streams, and it consists
    of two stages: the first stage involves offline learning to obtain an initial
    trained model, while the second stage focuses on online training to identify IoT
    attacks in real-time data streams. In [13], the authors proposed a fully distributed
    General Anomaly Detection (GAD) scheme for real-time anomaly detection. This scheme
    uses the principles of graph theory and takes advantage of the spatial-temporal
    correlations of processes to achieve fast and accurate anomaly detection. However,
    the GAD scheme cannot detect anomalous events that consist of a series of related
    unusual behaviours that reflect changes in those behaviours. This type of anomaly,
    which may be particularly interesting in some applications, cannot be detected
    by the GAD scheme. In [14], the authors proposed a Performance Weighted Probability
    Averaging Ensemble (PWPAE) framework for detecting anomalies in data streams generated
    by IoT devices. Their framework is designed to be drift adaptive, meaning that
    it can adapt to changes in the data distribution over time, which is a common
    challenge in the field of data stream mining. It combines two drift detection
    methods, ADaptive WINdowing (ADWIN) and Drift Detection Method (DDM), with two
    drift adaptation methods token from literature to construct base classifiers,
    which are then combined into a single ensemble model using a weighting scheme
    based on their real-time performance. They prove that their framework achieves
    high accuracy in detecting IoT attacks. In [15], the authors have employed a modified
    Hampel Identifier (HI) algorithm for real-time detection of temporal outliers
    and have merged it with a Gaussian process (GP) model and a graph-based outlier
    detection technique to enhance the algorithm’s ability to detect spatial outliers.
    The GP model enables the algorithm to consider the spatial relationships among
    data points, while the graph-based outlier detection technique identifies outliers
    that may not be apparent when considering individual data points independently.
    The proposed approach effectively detects temporal and spatial outliers in real-time,
    with a high accuracy identification rate and low resource requirements. In [16],
    the authors have suggested implementing real-time anomaly detection in telemetry
    data using streaming machine learning techniques. They have utilized the DenStream
    method, an unsupervised clustering technique, to process data as it is being generated
    in real-time instead of relying on offline processing of vast amounts of data.
    They have also conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of DenStream
    with other online and offline algorithms such as DBScan, Local Outlier Factor
    (LOF), ExactSTORM, Continuous Outlier Detection (COD), and Robust Random Cut Forest
    (RRCF). The experimental results have shown that DenStream performs as well as
    RRCF, which is the best-performing algorithm, in terms of detection outcomes,
    and is significantly faster than the other approaches, particularly RRCF. In [3],
    the authors proposed a centralized approach, named O\\(^2\\)DCA, for online outlier
    detection and classification in WSN. O\\(^2\\)DCA considers the spatial-temporal
    relationships between sensor data vectors and their neighbouring sensor nodes
    to distinguish between errors caused by sensor malfunctions and errors caused
    by events. The approach combines the distributed Fixed Width Clustering (FWC)
    and Inter Cluster Distance (ICD) algorithms for clustering and outlier detection,
    respectively. Additionally, the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method is used
    for classification. Simulation results showed that the proposed approach outperforms
    the offline approach and is suitable for real-life applications where the DR performance
    metric remains stable and better. In [17], the authors introduce a novel approach
    to enhance the security of wireless sensor WSNs by proposing a new Intrusion Detection
    System (IDS) based on a deep learning model. Emphasizing optimal cluster head
    (CH) selection among sensor nodes, the method considers energy levels, delay,
    and distance. The innovative Self-Improved Sea Lion Optimization (SI-SLnO) model
    is introduced for optimal CH selection. The paper advocates a multidimensional
    two-tier hierarchical trust model, evaluating content trust, honesty trust, and
    interactive trust for both CH and nodes. Intrusion detection is performed using
    a deep learning-based approach with an optimized neural network trained by the
    SI-SLnO algorithm. The paper concludes by evaluating the proposed approach against
    existing techniques, showcasing its potential for improving WSN security. In [18],
    the authors address in their survey the challenges posed by mobile nodes in the
    context of the IoT. With IoT nodes generating substantial data that requires seamless
    indexing for storage and processing, the mobility of nodes introduces complexities.
    Existing indexing techniques for mobile environments are deemed inadequate due
    to data transmission from diverse locations over varying time periods and the
    randomness of sensor movement. The survey aims to elucidate the relationship between
    activities of mobile sensors in IoT, focusing on data transfer, collection, and
    the effectiveness of indexing techniques. By exploring meta-heuristic, spatial-temporal
    indexing, and prediction model approaches, the review investigates the challenges
    affecting indexing effectiveness in mobile IoT nodes. The analysis delves into
    features, limitations, and requirements, providing insights into the behavior
    of mobile environments. The survey concludes by highlighting overlooked or unknown
    open issues in the domain. In [19], the authors propose a distributed algorithm
    for detecting dynamic environmental phenomena using mobile WSNs. The algorithm
    assumes there is no centralized server to collect and aggregate sensor data. Instead,
    the sensors self-organize into groups, with a few sensors elected as group heads
    (GHs). Each group of sensors detects phenomena locally, and the GHs communicate
    the detected information among themselves to detect global phenomena. The paper
    also introduces two GH election algorithms and an optimization technique to reduce
    energy costs. The proposed algorithms and methods are validated through experiments
    using the NS2 network simulator. The paper contributes a distributed algorithm,
    GH election algorithms, and an optimization technique to reduce energy costs in
    detecting environmental phenomena in mobile WSNs. In summary, we can say that
    several online outlier detection approaches are used in literature in WSNs and
    IoT. However, most of these works suffer from one or many of the following limitations:
    According to [5,6,7, 9, 10], and [11], the first limitation of their works is
    the lack of emphasis on exploring the correlation between sensors’ data vectors
    for outlier and event identification in the environment. Except for the O\\(^2\\)DCA
    work [3], which we reference for comparison. Although [8, 12, 13] have examined
    the correlation, they did not use its properties to differentiate between errors
    and events. The two baseline approaches proposed in the literature [5] and [6]
    are also referenced for comparison with our new approach. The selected approaches
    have been recognized as commonly used techniques in the literature, where they
    are online and manipulate the three different phases. Additionally, they have
    only detected one sensor outlier and only some events were detected without exploring
    correlations. The dataset used in that study was univariate and did not accurately
    represent the features of real-life WSNs applications. Another limitation highlighted
    in previous research, such as [9] and [10], is that their works can only provide
    an outlier score and may not detect all outliers promptly or distinguish between
    errors and events. Furthermore, the approach proposed in [11] only detects outliers
    upon request. A third limitation observed in previous studies, such as [11] and
    [12], is the lack of sufficient feedback information to facilitate adaptive changes
    in the TM of the online system. Except for the O\\(^2\\)DCA work [3], which we
    reference for comparison. In the case of [13], the authors have examined the spatial-temporal
    correlations and differentiated between novelties and anomalies using a univariate
    dataset without providing feedback information to the online system. One potential
    drawback in our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work [3] is the inability to dynamically
    adapt the TM to the streaming data and the use of the FWC clustering algorithm
    which forms fixed-size clusters using a fixed-width parameter w. However, the
    algorithm’s performance is sensitive to the selection of this parameter. If the
    chosen value of w is too small, the algorithm may generate an excessive number
    of small clusters, while if it is too large, it may produce too few large clusters.
    Thus, selecting an appropriate value of w is crucial for the FWC algorithm to
    operate effectively. However, determining the appropriate value of w can be challenging
    in practical scenarios, particularly for datasets with high dimensionality or
    clusters with varying densities or shapes. The K-means used in our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    approach is a centralised algorithm, different from the distributed FWC used in
    our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work. The shortcomings of previous studies have motivated
    us to develop a new online approach that utilizes a multivariate dataset for clustering,
    outlier detection, and classification of errors and events over time. This approach
    exploits the correlation properties of sensor data vectors and employs adaptive
    processing through various TM. We have used both real-life and seasonal real-life
    WSN streaming data to evaluate our approach. 3 SA-O2DCA Architecture The SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    consists of two main systems like O\\(^2\\)DCA: the CDC (Clustering, Detection,
    Classification) system with two main phases (training and online) and the monitoring
    system. Figure 1 gives a detailed flow chart of our CDC and monitoring systems.
    In what follows, we describe the two phases of the CDC and monitoring systems.
    Fig. 1 A detailed flow chart of our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach Full size image 3.1
    The CDC System The first phase of the CDC system involves building a set of offline
    seasonal training models STM. These models aim to cluster an initial set of seasonal
    data vectors and detect and classify the outliers using different input parameters,
    like the number of nearest neighbours K and the optimal clusters number N, that
    give the highest DR and the lowest FAR performance metrics. For that, we use the
    K-means clustering algorithm to group data vectors of each sensor in a centralised
    manner into clusters, where each data vector will be in a cluster with a radius
    w. After that, the base station executes the Iforest outlier detection method
    to identify the existing outliers. Finally, the classification of detected outliers
    into errors and relevant events is performed using the Newton interpolation and
    KNN methods. As a result, we have a set of training model STM where each TM in
    this set corresponds to a set of clusters C, so for the STM: STM = \\(\\{TM1,
    TM2,... TMs\\}\\) set we have another set TC: TC = \\(\\{C1, C2,... Cs\\}\\),
    a determined value of K and the optimal clusters’ number N which is calculated
    automatically for each TM in STM, that we can use in the online phase. The second
    phase of the CDC system is the online phase, where we use the first TM in the
    set STM to cluster the new streaming data vectors. The DR and the FAR performance
    metrics used to evaluate our approach are defined in (5 and 6) respectively. In
    this phase, the base station executes our new online outlier detection and classification
    Algorithm 1 using the first TM in the set STM. We start to work in an online manner,
    where we calculate the Euclidean distance (1) between the current newly arrived
    real-life streaming data vector and each cluster existing in the first C in the
    set TC. After that, we add this data vector to the nearest cluster based on the
    calculated Euclidean distance. We consider this data vector an outlier if we cannot
    add it to any existing cluster. $$\\begin{aligned} d(x,y)= \\sqrt{(y_{1}-x_{1})^2+(y_{2}-x_{2})^2}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) Our online system continues to receive the coming streaming
    data vectors and detects the existing outliers. We also differentiate between
    events and errors. During the online phase, we can send two different alerts to
    the monitoring system: Alert for an outlier data vector founded and classified
    as an error. Alert for an outlier data vector founded and classified as an event.
    Our approach uses the K-means clustering algorithm [20], a centralized and non-parametric
    approach to partition data into clusters based on their similarity. This algorithm
    is widely used in data analysis and has applications in various fields, such as
    outlier detection, image processing, bioinformatics, and social network analysis.
    Moreover, we employ the Iforest method [21] to identify the outliers, which is
    a technique for anomaly detection based on binary trees. Additionally, for classification,
    we use the Newton interpolation method [22] combined with the K Nearest Neighbours
    (KNN) method to study the correlation between sensors data vectors and classify
    detected outliers into errors and events using multivariate real-life and synthetic
    datasets. These algorithms have not been used in our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    [3], and we showed their effectiveness in this study. Our novel approach aims
    to address the limitations of existing methods in literature by considering correlations
    between sensor data vectors, providing real-time classification of errors and
    events, handling multivariate data, and dynamically adapting the Training Model
    (TM) based on the characteristics of the streaming online data. The choice of
    K-means, Iforest and Newton algorithms was motivated by their performance in dealing
    with multivariate online streaming data. The paper highlights the originality
    and unique contributions of the proposed solution in combining these algorithms
    to achieve effective online outlier detection and classification approach in WSNs.
    3.1.1 K-Means Clustering Algorithm K-means clustering is a technique to partition
    a set of n data vectors into k clusters. Each cluster is represented by its centroid,
    which is the mean of all the data vectors in that cluster. Each data vector has
    m attributes. The K-means algorithm aims to minimize the sum of squared distances
    between each data vector and its closest centroid. Let X = {\\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),...,
    \\(x_{n}\\)} be a set of n data vectors, where each data vector \\(x_{i}\\) has
    m attributes. The K-means algorithm can be described mathematically as follows:
    1. Initialize k cluster centroids randomly from X: C = {\\(c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\),...,
    \\(c_{k}\\)} \\(\\subset\\) X. 2. Assign each data vector \\(x_{i}\\) to the closest
    centroid \\(c_{j}\\), where: j = argmin\\(||\\) \\(x_{i}\\)-\\(c_{j}\\) \\(||\\)
    \\(^2\\). ArgMin is a mathematical function that returns the argument (i.e., the
    input value) that minimizes a given function. 3. Recalculate the centroid of each
    cluster as the mean of all the data vectors assigned to it: $$\\begin{aligned}
    c_{j} = (1/|S_{j}|) * \\sum x_{i} \\in S_{j} \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where \\(S_{j}\\)
    is the set of data vectors assigned to cluster j. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until
    the centroids no longer change or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.
    3.1.2 Iforest Outlier Detection Method Iforest is a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm
    used for anomaly detection. It operates by randomly partitioning the data space
    and isolating anomalies that are more easily separable than normal data vectors.
    The Iforest algorithm works by constructing a collection of isolation trees, each
    of which is a binary tree that recursively partitions the data into two subsets
    based on randomly selected features and split vectors. Anomalies are expected
    to be isolated in small, highly partitioned data space regions, leading to shorter
    average path lengths from the root to the leaf nodes of the isolation trees. The
    anomaly score of a data vector is calculated as the inverse of the average path
    length, which measures the degree of isolation of the vector. The Iforest algorithm
    has several advantages over other anomaly detection methods, including its ability
    to handle high-dimensional data, its efficiency in detecting anomalies, and its
    robustness to outliers and noise. The Iforest algorithm has been applied to various
    applications, such as network intrusion detection, fraud detection, and anomaly
    detection in time-series data. The algorithm can be described mathematically as
    follows: Given a dataset X = {\\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\),..., \\(x_{n}\\)} with
    n data vectors where each \\(x_{i}\\) is a vector of m attributes, the Isolation
    Forest algorithm constructs a collection of T binary trees, each of which is built
    recursively by randomly selecting a feature j from the d features and a split
    vector p between the minimum and maximum vector of feature j in a sub sample of
    n data vectors. The data vectors are partitioned into two subsets based on whether
    their feature j is less than or greater than p, and the process is repeated until
    each leaf node contains only one data vector or the depth of the tree exceeds
    a predefined isolation depth c. The anomaly score \\(s_{i}\\) of a data vector
    \\(x_{i}\\) is calculated as the inverse of the average path length from the root
    to the leaf nodes of the T trees that \\(x_{i}\\) traverses, normalized by a factor
    of c: $$\\begin{aligned} s_{i} = 2^{\\frac{-E(h_{i})}{c}} \\end{aligned}$$ (3)
    where: E(\\(h_{i}\\)) is the average path length from the root to the leaf nodes
    of the T trees that \\(x_{i}\\) traverses, and cis the isolation depth parameter.
    Anomalies are expected to have shorter average path lengths and higher anomaly
    scores than normal data vectors. The threshold vector for anomaly detection can
    be set based on the desired DR or FAR. 3.1.3 Newton Outlier Classification Method
    Newton’s interpolation method is a polynomial technique used to approximate a
    function using a set of data vectors. The polynomial is constructed by using divided
    differences of the function vectors at the data vectors. In our previous work
    [22], we use the Newton interpolation method to examine the correlation between
    neighbouring data vectors in both space and time. This helps us classify detected
    outliers as either errors or events. The Newton forward difference method is used
    to estimate the value of a data vector (y)=DV of a node \\(node_i\\) at a specific
    location (x) using a set of neighbouring independent indexes (\\(x_{i}\\)) and
    a set of \\(K+1\\) dependent data Vectors (\\(y_{i}\\) = \\(DV_i\\)). We start
    the process by calculating the KNN to find the K nearest neighbours for all nodes.
    The differences between these dependent data vectors (\\(y_{1}\\) – \\(y_{0}\\),
    \\(y_{2}\\) – \\(y_{1}\\),...,\\(y_{K}\\) – \\(y_{K-1}\\)) are referred to as
    the first forward differences: (\\(\\Delta\\) \\(y_0\\), \\(\\Delta\\) \\(y_1\\),...,\\(\\Delta\\)
    \\(y_{K-1}\\)). Then, we calculate the interpolated data vector \\(N_i\\): $$\\begin{aligned}
    N_i = y_0 + u \\Delta y_0 + \\frac{u(u-1)}{2!} \\Delta ^{2} y_0+...+ \\frac{u(u-1)(u-2)(u-K+1)}{K!}\\Delta
    ^{K} y_0 \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where: u = \\(x_i\\) - \\(x_0\\) and \\(x_i\\),
    \\(x_0\\) are the indexes of the \\(node_i\\) and its first neighbour. The neighbours’
    indexes of \\(node_i\\) is the list [\\(x_0, x_1,..., x_{K-1}\\)]. The neighbours’
    data vectors of \\(node_i\\) is the list [\\(DV_0, DV_1,..., DV_{K-1}\\)]. After
    that, we calculate the difference between the interpolated data vector calculated
    in Eq. 4\\(N_i\\) and the actual data vector \\(DV_i\\). If the difference is
    greater than \\(\\epsilon\\), we have an error data vector. Elsewhere we have
    an event data vector. 3.2 The Monitoring System The monitoring system will check
    the received alerts from the online system and compare them with the corresponding
    control data. These control data are stored in the monitoring system and contain
    information about the validity of the received alerts if they are true or false.
    The control data lets the adaptive processing unit generate three different feedback
    information that will be sent back to the CDC system: TPA: True Positive Alert
    for an outlier data vector received and classified rightly as an error or event.
    TNA: True Negative Alert for an outlier data vector received but classified badly
    as an error or event. FPA: False Positive Alert for an outlier data vector received
    but it is a normal data vector. The monitoring system can send this feedback information
    to the online system. The CDC system stays working online while receiving feedback
    information for a TPA. However, the online system will check the DR and FAR performance
    metrics and verify if it is less than a specific threshold \\(\\alpha\\) when
    the specified time intervals pass or if it receives TNA or FPA feedback information.
    If the DR is less than \\(\\alpha _1\\) or the FAR higher than \\(\\alpha _2\\),
    it builds a new (TM) using the recently stored data vectors (e.g. last 1000 records),
    where they are more suitable for the current situation and so on. Otherwise, the
    CDC system stays working in an online manner. If the DR stays higher than \\(\\alpha
    _{1}\\) or the FAR less than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), the CDC system stays working
    in an online manner until reaching the end of the first season then it changes
    dynamically to next TM in the set STM. This process is described in the Algorithm
    1. The code of our approach is available at [23]. Algorithm 1 SA-O2DCA algorithm
    Full size image 4 Evaluation and Simulation Results This section presents the
    results of our MATLAB simulations, which are designed to evaluate our approach’s
    performance with multivariate datasets. We provide a detailed description of the
    evaluation scenario and analyze the obtained results. Our simulation assumes a
    hierarchical network structure, where all sensor nodes are accurately synchronized,
    and the observed data vectors conform to the same unknown distribution. Furthermore,
    the nodes are assumed to be deployed in a homogeneous environment. The primary
    objective of detecting outliers in WSNs is to create efficient techniques that
    minimize communication overhead and account for resource limitations of sensor
    nodes, such as memory and battery life. Several performance metrics are employed
    to assess the efficacy of outlier detection and classification techniques, such
    as the DR, which is the percentage of abnormal data values accurately identified
    as outliers as defined in (5), and the FAR, which is the percentage of normal
    data values incorrectly identified as outliers as defined in (6). Another approach
    to evaluate outlier detection methods using the ACC, which is the proportion of
    true detections as defined in (7). We utilize the confusion matrix shown in Table
    1 to establish these performance metrics. We specify four distinct scenarios for
    evaluating the outlier detection phase, which are: True Positive (TP): An outlier
    is inserted, and the algorithm correctly identifies it. False Positive (FP): Nothing
    is inserted, but the algorithm identifies an outlier. True Negative (TN): Nothing
    is inserted, and the algorithm does not identify an outlier. False Negative (FN):
    An outlier is inserted, but the algorithm does not identify it. Table 1 The online
    detection phase confusion matrix Full size table $$\\begin{aligned} DR= & {} TP
    / (TP + FP) \\end{aligned}$$ (5) $$\\begin{aligned} FAR= & {} FP / (FP + TN) \\end{aligned}$$
    (6) $$\\begin{aligned} ACC= & {} (TP+TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN) \\end{aligned}$$ (7)
    It should be acknowledged that there are alternative methods of evaluating outlier
    detection techniques, such as assessing complexity and computational cost. However,
    our current study does not take these types of evaluations into account. 4.1 Evaluation
    Methodology We create the set STM, and we combine two datasets. The first dataset,
    known as the Real-life DataSet (RDS), is sourced from the Berkeley dataset. It
    consists of 2.3 million readings from 54 sensors deployed in the Intel Berkeley
    Research lab between February 28th and April 5th, 2004 [24]. Each data vector,
    collected every 30 s, contains attributes such as temperature, humidity, light,
    and voltage. For our experiments, we extract 2000 data vectors with temperature
    and humidity attributes to construct each TM in the set. The second dataset is
    a Synthetic DataSet (SDS) created to achieve high detection rate (DR) and low
    false alarm rate (FAR) performance metrics for the RDS. To generate the SDS, we
    use a uniformly random generator to introduce a set of errors and events. The
    SDS comprises 90 outliers, with 60 errors and 30 events. The process of constructing
    each TM in STM involves four key steps. Firstly, we apply the K-means algorithm
    to cluster the RDS and obtain a set of clusters C. The number of clusters is determined
    automatically in advance. Next, we employ the Iforest method to detect outliers
    in the RDS. In the second step, we use the SDS, which consists of three parts:
    temperature with added outliers, humidity with added outliers, and control data,
    to label the data vectors with values (0 for normal, 1 for events, and 2 for errors).
    We then check if each data vector from SDS belongs to any cluster in C. If it
    does, we consider it as normal and add it to the corresponding cluster. Otherwise,
    we identify it as an outlier and output it accordingly. In the third step, we
    classify each outlier data vector as either an error or an event using Newton
    and KNN methods. Finally, in the fourth step, we calculate the DR and FAR performance
    metrics based on the control data of SDS for different numbers of nearest neighbours,
    denoted as K. As a result, we choose the input parameters (K, C) that give the
    highest DR and the lowest FAR. These training models STM will be used in the online
    phase. In addition, we evaluate our CDC system with different values of \\(\\alpha\\),
    which are accepted to stay in the online phase. If the DR and FAR stay over the
    specified threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), or the CDC system
    did not receive any (TNA, FPA) from the monitoring system, so the CDC system stay
    online and wait until reaching the end of the first season to change the TM dynamically
    and work with TM2 and so on. Otherwise, we need to build a new TM from the recent
    coming data. 4.2 Discussion Results The performance of the offline approach is
    evaluated by computing the DR and FAR performance metrics. These metrics are calculated
    based on a confusion matrix, which is shown in Table 2. Four different cases are
    defined for evaluating the offline classification phase: TP: This refers to the
    situation where the algorithm correctly predicts an event when it is actually
    present. FP: This refers to the situation where the algorithm predicts the occurrence
    of an event when, in reality, no event is present. TN: This occurs when the algorithm
    correctly recognizes the absence of an event and predicts accordingly. FN: This
    occurs when the algorithm fails to predict an event that is present. Table 2 The
    online classification phase confusion matrix Full size table In the first experiment,
    we evaluated SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA in terms of DR, FAR and ACC under varying Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) conditions, measured in decibels (dB), as defined in [4]. The SNR
    values considered in their study encompassed a range of (-30 dB, -20 dB, -10 dB,
    0 dB, 10 dB, 20 dB, 30 dB). Each SNR level introduced different magnitudes of
    outliers into the data. Our objective was to examine the performance of the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    approach under different levels of outlier presence in the data. To assess the
    performance, we compared our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach with the O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    [3], as well as two other online approaches, namely OPTICS-OD and DBSCAN-OD, introduced
    in [4] during the detection phase. We employed a confusion matrix, as depicted
    in Table 1. The results, as shown in Fig. 2, indicated that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved
    the highest DR across all SNR values, surpassing our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    and the other two approaches. We also observed that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved the
    lowest FAR, except in comparison to DBSCAN-OD, where DBSCAN-OD exhibited the lowest
    FAR. Additionally, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieved the highest ACC, except in comparison
    to DBSCAN-OD, where DBSCAN-OD obtained the highest ACC. It is worth noting that
    the FAR and ACC values we obtained were considered reasonable. Conversely, the
    FAR and ACC values of OPTICS-OD and DBSCAN-OD appeared unreliable, as it is not
    plausible to have low DR, very low FAR, and extremely high ACC. Therefore, we
    can assert that our proposed SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach demonstrated superior performance
    compared to the other solutions examined. Fig. 2 Performance metrics at the outlier
    detection phase for the average of all SNR values Full size image In the second
    experiment, we build \\(TM_{0}\\) using 2000 data vectors with (m = 2) attributes,
    temperature and humidity. We also use an SDS that contains 90 outliers (60 errors
    and 30 events). In this experiment, we evaluate the offline approach and calculate
    the DR and FAR performance metrics. To calculate these metrics, we take the confusion
    matrix as presented in Table 2. We use the \\(TM_{0}\\) and an SDS of 300 outliers
    (200 errors and 100 events) as explained in section 4.1. We use the \\(TM_{0}\\)
    to cluster, detect and classify the complete set of data which contains 10000
    data vectors in an offline manner. We get for the offline approach a DR equal
    to 82% and a FAR equal to 10%. This value allows us to evaluate our online system
    with different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). In the third
    experiment, we evaluated SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA regarding DR and FAR
    performance metrics using the confusion matrix presented in Table 2. We use the
    \\(TM_{0}\\) to cluster the streaming dataset containing 10000 data vectors. We
    detect and classify the outlier in the streaming set in an online manner. Table
    3 shows the obtained results when evaluating the DR and FAR metrics of O\\(^2\\)DCA
    and SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches during the online classification phase. We notice
    that we have nine \\(TM_{s}\\) for our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach and five
    \\(TM_{s}\\) for our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach, each representing an average
    of several time intervals. The online system changes the model if the DR is less
    than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) or FAR is higher than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). These values
    are equal to the values of DR and FAR resulting from evaluating the offline approach.
    We notice that for O\\(^2\\)DCA, we have an average DR higher than \\(\\alpha
    _{1}\\) and an average FAR less than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for all \\(TM_{s}\\) except
    for \\(TM_{0}\\), \\(TM_{4}\\) and \\(TM_{5}\\). In these cases, we change them
    directly at the end of the time interval where we have DR less than \\(\\alpha
    _{1}\\) and FAR higher than \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Whereas for SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, we
    have an average DR higher than \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and an average FAR less than
    \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for all \\(TM_{s}\\). In addition, with SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA we
    reach the stable model quickly with less \\(TM_{s}\\) compared to O\\(^2\\)DCA.

    Full size table In the fourth experiment, we take the DR and the FAR values for
    the offline approach, which is calculated in the second experiment. In Table 4,
    we show that the DR and FAR metrics of our SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach during the
    online classification phase, for the average of all \\(TM_{s}\\), is better than
    the DR and FAR of our previous O\\(^2\\)DCA approach [3] and the offline approach.

    we evaluated the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches in terms of the DR
    and FAR performance metrics using different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) (80%,
    82%, 85%, 95%) and \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) (12%, 10%, 8%, 6%). We can see from Fig.
    3 that our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach has higher DR than O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] for
    all the different values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\). Fig. 3 The DR for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA

    see from Fig. 4 that our new SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA approach has lower FAR than O\\(^2\\)DCA
    for all the different values of \\(\\alpha _{2}\\). Fig. 4 The FAR for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches for the average of all the \\(TM_{s}\\) and different
    values of \\(\\alpha _{1}\\), \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) Full size image In the sixth
    experiment, we evaluated the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approaches regarding
    the DR and FAR performance metrics using a seasonal dataset of 8000 data vectors
    that contains four seasons. In this experiment, we build four offline training
    models \\(\\{TM1, TM2, TM3, TM4\\}\\). In this scenario, we check if the DR stays
    over the specified threshold \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) and FAR stay down the specified
    threshold \\(\\alpha _{2}\\), or if the CDC system did not receive any (TNA, FPA)
    from the monitoring system, so the CDC system stays online and wait until reaching
    the end of the first season to change the training model dynamically and work
    with \\(TM_{2}\\) and so on. Otherwise, we need to build a new training model
    from the recent coming data. From Figs. 5, 6, 7, we can see the percentage of
    the DR, FAR and ACC for the SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA. We notice that the
    two approaches have good performance metrics when dealing with the seasonal data
    with four \\(TM_{s}\\). From Fig. 5, we notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA
    have higher DR than the specified thresholds \\(\\alpha _{1}\\) for the four seasonal
    \\(TM_{s}\\). We also notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has higher DR than O\\(^2\\)DCA
    for all \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 5 DR of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach measured
    for the seasonal multivariate dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) and \\(\\alpha _{1}\\)
    = 82% Full size image From Fig. 6, we notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA
    have lower FAR than the specified thresholds \\(\\alpha _{2}\\) for the four seasonal
    \\(TM_{s}\\). We also notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has lower FAR than O\\(^2\\)DCA
    for all \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 6 FAR of SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach
    measured for the seasonal multivariate dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) and \\(\\alpha
    _{2}\\) = 10% Full size image From Fig. 7, we notice that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA has
    higher ACC than O\\(^2\\)DCA for the four seasonal \\(TM_{s}\\). Fig. 7 ACC of
    SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA and O\\(^2\\)DCA approach measured for the seasonal multivariate
    dataset with four \\(TM_{s}\\) Full size image To summarize the results, our new
    SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms both the offline approach, O\\(^2\\)DCA [3] and two
    other approaches [4] from the literature in the clustering, detection, and classification
    phases when worked in an online fashion. In addition, the DR and FAR performance
    metrics are still stable over specified thresholds, although we use different
    training models. So, we show the efficiency of our new approach and its ability
    to work online with both real-life and seasonal real-life multivariate WSN data.
    5 Conclusion This paper introduces SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA, a novel and effective online
    approach designed to address outlier challenges in WSNs while achieving high performance.
    The proposed approach has two central systems, the CDC and the monitoring systems.
    The CDC system consists of two main phases. In the training phase, we build an
    initial TM or a set of initial \\(TM_{s}\\) based on the K-means clustering algorithm,
    Iforest method for outlier detection and Newton interpolation method combined
    with KNN for outlier classification. In the online phase, we perform online clustering,
    outlier detection, and classification for the new real-life arrived streaming
    data vectors using the previous algorithms. The second system is the monitoring
    system that can check the received alerts from the online system and send different
    feedback information. Our system can stay online with higher DR, lower FAR and
    higher classification ACC performance than O\\(^2\\)DCA. It can also change the
    current training model by building a new one like O\\(^2\\)DCA. Additionally,
    SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA is suitable for real-life seasonal applications where it can change
    between a set of \\(TM_{s}\\) dynamically at the end of each season. The simulation
    results obtained from synthetic and real-life multivariate datasets and a seasonal
    multivariate dataset demonstrated that SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA outperforms O\\(^2\\)DCA
    and other existing approaches in terms of DR, FAR and ACC performance metrics.
    Notably, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA achieves superior performance while utilizing a smaller
    number of \\(TM_{s}\\) compared to our previous work, O\\(^2\\)DCA. Also, SA-O\\(^2\\)DCA
    can stay stable with fewer \\(TM_{s}\\) number than the number required by our
    previous O\\(^2\\)DCA work. In our future research, we aim to thoroughly assess
    our novel online approach by testing it with various clustering algorithms and
    datasets with high levels of correlation. Additionally, we plan to explore the
    potential of utilizing deep learning algorithms to facilitate dynamic switching
    between different \\(TM_{s}\\), enabling the reuse of pre-existing models rather
    than building new ones. Such a study could enhance our approach’s adaptability
    and efficiency. References Chandola, V., Banerjee, A., Kumar, V.: Anomaly detection:

  key_findings: The proposed smart irrigation system uses a combination of sensors
    to collect real-time data on environmental conditions, allowing for precise and
    automated irrigation based on crop water needs.
  limitations: Limited scope, as the paper primarily focuses on the design and implementation
    of a specific irrigation system rather than a detailed analysis of various advanced
    monitoring techniques.
  main_objective: To design and implement a solar-based smart irrigation system using
    a PID controller for automated and efficient irrigation management.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is moderately relevant to the outline point, as
    it demonstrates the use of multiple IoT sensors for data collection in an automated
    irrigation system, thus contributing to advancements in automated irrigation management.
    However, the research mainly focuses on the design and implementation of a specific
    system rather than a comprehensive analysis of advanced monitoring techniques.
    Nonetheless, it provides valuable insights into the use of IoT sensors in real-time
    irrigation systems.

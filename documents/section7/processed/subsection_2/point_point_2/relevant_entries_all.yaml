    \a\nAbstract: The term intelligent agriculture, or smart farming, typically involves\
    \ the incorporation of\ncomputer science and information technologies into the\
    \ traditional notion of farming. The latter\nutilizes plain machinery and equipment\
    \ used for many decades and the only signiﬁcant improvement\nmade over the years\
    \ has been the introduction of automation in the process. Still, at the beginning\
    \ of\nthe new century, there are ways and room for further vast improvements.\
    \ More speciﬁcally, the low\ncost of rather advanced sensors and small-scale devices,\
    \ now even connected to the Internet of\nThings (IoT), allowed them to be introduced\
    \ in the process and used within agricultural production\nsystems. New and emerging\
    \ technologies and methodologies, like the utilization of cheap network\nstorage,\
    \ are expected to advance this development. In this sense, the main goals of this\
    \ paper may be\nsummarized as follows: (a) To identify, group, and acknowledge\
    \ the current state-of-the-art research\nknowledge about intelligent agriculture\
    \ approaches, (b) to categorize them according to meaningful\ndata sources categories,\
    \ and (c) to describe current efﬁcient data processing and utilization aspects\n\
    from the perspective of the main trends in the ﬁeld.\nKeywords: smart agriculture\

    1. Introduction\nOver the last hundred years technological achievements, like\
    \ the utilization of heavy machinery\nand the industrialization of the production\
    \ chain, introduced major changes to the agricultural working\nstatus quo. These\
    \ changes, although pivotal for the current development of agriculture as we know\n\
    it until the recent years, are not considered to be the last resort of agriculture,\
    \ as world population\nfeeding needs increase over time. The term intelligent\
    \ agriculture, or smart farming, typically involves\nincorporation of computer\
    \ science and information technologies into the traditional notion of farming.\n\
    It allows the creation of large volumes of data, with the progressive introduction\
    \ of intelligence in the\nprocess of their transformation into organized information,\
    \ and the extraction of meaningful semantic\nknowledge, as the last link of this\
    \ virtual chain of actions.\nFactors such as climate change, demographic parameters,\
    \ population movements, and overall\naging and migration issues between rural\
    \ and urban areas, all play a signiﬁcant role and come into play\nwhen dealing\
    \ with intelligent agriculture research. Speciﬁcally, climate parameters like\
    \ temperature,\nprecipitation, and soil moisture have signiﬁcant impact on most\
    \ of the aforementioned factors, thus the\nexploitation of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and machine learning techniques towards their efﬁcient, reliable\nand accurate\
    \ prediction is of great importance in modern agricultural activities, since they\
    \ may heavily\naffect the corresponding production costs and can assist in minimizing\
    \ environmental constraints.\nHaving declared the necessity and importance of\
    \ the discussed domain, we may further elaborate\non the speciﬁc aims of this\
    \ paper. First of all, it is rather true that, being a modern application domain,\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278; doi:10.3390/su11123278\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n2 of 23\nmost of the corresponding research literature\
    \ on intelligent agriculture has been published over the\nrecent years. Still,\
    \ there are important research works, included herein, that deal with aspects\
    \ either\ndirectly or indirectly related to the modern ﬁeld. Considering this\
    \ context, our research aims to achieve\nthe following objectives: (a) To identify,\
    \ group, and acknowledge the research knowledge about current\nintelligent agriculture\
    \ that are state-of-the-art, (b) to categorize them according to meaningful data\n\
    source categories, and (c) to describe current efﬁcient data processing and utilization\
    \ aspects from the\nperspective of the main trends in the ﬁeld.\nOur main motivation\
    \ behind the production of this research work was our belief that\nidentifying\
    \ how computer science interprets intelligent agriculture over time, geographical\
    \ space,\nand methodologies may aid the production of new, advanced, and innovative\
    \ research with the\nobjective of covering areas that have received less attention\
    \ up until now and may introduce brand\nnew applications in the process. Thus,\
    \ we summarized and organized in a researcher-friendly tabular\nmanner important\
    \ or pioneer related research works deriving from diverse agricultural intelligence\n\
    domains. In the following sections, we initially focus on different data collection\
    \ techniques, ranging\nfrom meteorological data at the macro- (i.e., geographical\
    \ region), meso- (i.e., ﬁeld), and micro-level\n(i.e., speciﬁc intra-ﬁeld areas),\
    \ to GIS and remote sensing data, image data from drones, or even\ninnovative\
    \ crowd-sourcing activities. Moreover, we present the prevailing data processing\
    \ and\nutilization methodologies that exploit notions from the machine learning\
    \ computer science ﬁelds.\nWe categorize them into two main groups, namely machine\
    \ learning algorithms focusing on numerical\ndata processing, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ exemplars from the drone or even satellite imagery domain.\nOn top of that,\
    \ efﬁcient environmental monitoring suggests innovatice procedures of meaningful\n\
    knowledge extraction through various observation and evaluation techniques. In\
    \ the typical case,\n“machines”, under the generic auspice of computer science,\
    \ support and preserve acquisition and\nmanagement of such information into accessible\
    \ semantic modules [1], whereas the goal of integrating\nthe task of monitoring,\
    \ physical computing, information technologies and knowledge representation\n\
    has been served in the past by the semantic sensor network ontology and it’s many\
    \ variations [2].\nIn this framework, the two main factors are formed around the\
    \ tasks of a knowledge base creation and\ncorresponding data visualization.\n\
    It should be also noted at this point that this paper attempts to conduct a broad\
    \ modern survey of\nthe illustrated topics and, thus, form a somehow point of\
    \ reference for fellow researchers. It attempts\nto study the existence, importance\
    \ and impact of the notion of agriculture information handling\nmethodologies\
    \ within the scope of the modern and quite popular “smart” agriculture computing\n\
    framework. Still, this is a tedious task to tackle, since mainly given to its\
    \ inherent diversity, the term\nis nowadays widely acknowledged and has become\
    \ a topic of interest in several multi-disciplinary\nsub-ﬁelds, ranging from traditional\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms to contextual semantics and other\nrecently\
    \ emerged innovative applications. Focus is also given on the identiﬁed challenges\
    \ and potential\nfuture research directions that emerge from the herein discussed\
    \ approaches. To the best of our recent\nknowledge, researcher, academics, but\
    \ also interested stakeholders and even farmers themselves\nare nowadays eager\
    \ to obtain comprehensive and perspicacious written reviews of related studies\n\
    on modern smart agriculture information handling. Thus, this survey attempts to\
    \ provide a rich\nsource of ideas for them and a good point of reference for those\
    \ who want to start studying related\nsub-ﬁelds in depth within the framework\
    \ imposed by the latest related disciplines advances, namely\nagriculture and\
    \ informatics. Among its goals is the identiﬁcation of different types of methodologies\n\
    in agricultural informatics and the provision of an overview on the deﬁnition\
    \ and utilization of related\nresearch approaches exploited within recent approaches\
    \ and applications.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section\
    \ 2, we present related research works\nconcerning the various data sources utilized\
    \ with respect to agricultural aspects. Then, in Section 3,\nwe present the main\
    \ machine learning methodologies that may be efﬁciently applied on agricultural\n\
    data. Section 4 discusses ad-hoc topics that are built on top of the data and\
    \ algorithmic fronts, such as\nintelligent knowledge acquisition, data visualization,\
    \ and crowd-wisdom exploitation. Finally, a short\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n\
    3 of 23\ndiscussion together with drawn conclusions and future prospects relating\
    \ to the proposed framework\nare presented within Section 5 that concludes the\
    \ paper.\n2. Data Sources and Collection\nThe natural conditions of agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds and their neighbor areas are characterized by their\nmeteorological, climatic,\
    \ and soil attributes. Information Technologies (IT) have been shown to\nimprove\
    \ agricultural productivity in a number of ways. Furthermore, the study of conditions\
    \ is\nusually performed through different type of datasets and in a multi-level\
    \ scale. More speciﬁcally,\nin the following we reason agricultural monitoring\
    \ as a classiﬁcation of four concrete methods for data\nretrieval on the scope\
    \ of analysis and machine learning. In Section 2.1 we present works related to\n\
    on-site climatic sensory observations that largely produce numerical data, in\
    \ contrast to Section 2.2\nthat exhibits spatially correlated physical factors.\
    \ Additionally, satellite imagery presents a wealth of\nnumerical, spatial-aware,\
    \ and image data from remote sensing acquisition techniques (Section 2.3),\nwhich\
    \ is enriched through the advent of aerial imagery applications in agricultural\
    \ monitoring.\nLastly, application of drone-aided technology (Section 2.4) uniﬁes\
    \ all physical characteristics of the\napproximate environment on an accessible\
    \ research context.\n2.1. Meteorological Sensory Data\nManaging climatic and environmental\
    \ challenges in relation to wine production can be\nimplemented by recording and\
    \ assessing meteorological data. Hunter et al. [3] studied the impact on\nmicroclimatic\
    \ conditions using the distribution of local conditions for existing vineyards.\
    \ The vines\nhave a distinctive topology that is subjective to atmospheric, climatic\
    \ and soil conditions of their given\nlocation. The scientists studied different\
    \ orientations of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Shiraz variety in South\nAfrica and tested\
    \ their distinct environmental factors in three levels - macro, meso and micro.\
    \ They’ve\nrecorded temperature, radiation, rainfall and wind speed (at the macro\
    \ level), ambient photosynthetic\nactive radiation on top of the vines, wind speed\
    \ and direction (at the meso level) and ambient\ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ (at the micro level). Additionally, they measured relative humidity,\nleaf temperature,\
    \ photosynthetic photo ﬂux density (PPFD), transpiration, CO2 concentration and\n\
    photosynthetic activity at the canopy level, six weeks after the berry colouring\
    \ phase. Hunter et al.\nmanaged to provide novel knowledge on the effect of row\
    \ orientation on vineyard meso-, macro- and\nmicroclimate in addition to vine\
    \ physiological status. Their results produced quantitative data related\nto the\
    \ complex relationship between row orientation and physiological characteristics\
    \ of vines.\nThe vision of sustainable management in agriculture was studied by\
    \ Kaewmard and Saiyod [4]\nby introducing a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) control\
    \ system. They deployed several experimental\nsensing devices to monitor crop\
    \ irrigation and produced a platform for water management, employing\nmobile application\
    \ and services along with a wireless communication platform under the scope of\
    \ the\nInternet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, their experimental results were\
    \ related to the plants’ growth rate\nindicating highly accurate measurements\
    \ based on soil moisture, air humidity and temperature sensors.\nReal-time data\
    \ collection and distribution is an important aspect on the direction of applied\n\
    monitoring in agriculture. Under this scope Kiyoshi et al. [5] proposed a decision\
    \ support system based\non multilevel sensor measurements. Their interoperable\
    \ applications were capable of dynamically\nquerying sensor metadata and analyzing\
    \ historical weather data. Kiyoshi et al. produced predictions\nconcerning the\
    \ evaluation of various weather scenarios by implementing crop modeling and simulations.\n\
    Furthermore, the authors used heterogenous data sources, promoting efficient crop\
    \ management and\ncontrol and subsequently assisting farmers’ operation cycles\
    \ at all stages of cultivation.\nThe research of Bock et al. [6] is related to\
    \ the actual grapevine yield and quality and is\nbased on long-term data accumulation\
    \ for over the last two centuries (between years 1805–2010)\nin Germany. The authors\
    \ analyzed long-term time series of grapevine yield in yield per hectare\n(hL/ha)\
    \ measurements and the sugar content of must (i.e., the grape juice) in Degree\
    \ Oechsle (◦Oe)\nmeasurements, as well as climate data through bibliographical\
    \ references and sensor recordings.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n4 of 23\n\
    It should be noted that Degree Oechsle measures the relative sweetness of the\
    \ must and shows how\nmuch more 1 L of must weighs, compared to 1 L of water,\
    \ whereas the entire dataset was homogenized\nby monthly observations depending\
    \ on available resources. This long-term, multi-factoral research\nresulted into\
    \ a veriﬁed upward trend in both yield and must sugar content over the examined\n\
    time period. The researchers distinguished further between the anthropogenic and\
    \ climatic impacts\non yield in relation to temperature; their study underlines\
    \ the need for continuous and calibrated\nmeasurements of morphological and chemical\
    \ characteristics, along with meteorological conditions\nduring vine production\
    \ in relation to their productivity.\nAnother WSN agricultural monitoring platform\
    \ was introduced by Tarange et al. [7]. The researches\nproposed an automated\
    \ control system for crop irrigation based on soil moisture and temperature senors.\n\
    In particular, the sensor information was collected from the nodes in a continuous\
    \ manner, allowing\nthe system to control irrigation uniformly and reducing the\
    \ fresh water consumption without the need\nof human interaction.\nAndreoli et\
    \ al. [8] developed a simulation related to vine growth parametric processes for\n\
    the understanding of plant conditions at vineyard scale of Vitis vinifera L. Nebbiolo\
    \ of NW Italy.\nThe simulation is based on experimental observations from model\
    \ vineyards. Their model required\na set of meteorological data, soil parameters,\
    \ vine’s physical characteristics, geographic information\nand variety characteristics,\
    \ which was then evaluated through existing empirical equations. Recording\nfrequency\
    \ is adjusted depending on the nature of the data and the sampling took place\
    \ on 15 grid\npoints over the Piedmontese territory in mixed elevation. Furthermore,\
    \ the IVINE model showed that\nmeteorological data produce more stable results\
    \ and contrary to vine growth and phenological phases\nthat were less accurately\
    \ predicted.\nWater is one of the fundamental aspects of life on earth and provides\
    \ precious nutrients for\nmany types of crop. Yuan and Zhen [9] estimated water\
    \ consumption by agricultural activities in\nChina. More specifically their research\
    \ focused on agricultural water and irrigation net consumption for the\nperiod\
    \ between 1984 to 2008 in the Hebei province. Meteorological data were used to\
    \ calculate a baseline\nof evapotranspiration (ET0), along with grain yield to\
    \ find the actual evapotranspiration. Atmospheric\nand ground measurements included\
    \ daily average temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, duration\nof sunshine,\
    \ atmospheric pressure, vapor pressure, and wind speed, which emanate from 55\
    \ weather\nstations located in the Hebei area. Their study showed a spatial pattern\
    \ of increased ET0 that is\npossibly related to intensiﬁed agricultural activity\
    \ and increasing temperatures. This work points\nout the use of meteorological\
    \ monitoring (i.e., large scale monitoring, in this particular case) that\nmay\
    \ help researchers further understand the interdependent relations of climatic\
    \ conditions and\nhuman activities.\nThe work of Tagami et al. [10] was related\
    \ to the development and application of Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSN) in viticulture,\
    \ under the notion of developing appropriate management practices.\nThey deployed\
    \ a use-case scenario based on a network of highly usable hardware components\
    \ for\ndata collection. Their study was mainly focused on networking and software\
    \ infrastructures that\nsupport an array of prototype weather stations and sensors;\
    \ the latter collected information relevant to\nrainfall, wind speed and direction,\
    \ barometric pressure, solar radiation, temperature, and humidity.\nIn addition\
    \ to atmospheric variables authors took into consideration soil matrix potential\
    \ from soil\nmoisture by using soil measurement probes buried at two different\
    \ depths. The researchers achieved\nto minimize data loss and improve data accessibility\
    \ on the scope of long-term data acquisition system.\nFurthermore, the array of\
    \ sensors was operating properly and collecting reliable data due to the correct\n\
    placement of sensors within the vineyards.\nOne of the early adopters of WSN in\
    \ viticulture were Marino et al. [11], where they proposed the\nintegration of\
    \ specialized electronic sensors for climate monitoring and soil assessment. They\
    \ deployed\nan experimental network for on-site automatic data acquisition, based\
    \ on distributed processes.\nThe network was implemented with the introduction\
    \ of Electronic Zonal Stations (EZS) to a web\nplatform and a connected database.\
    \ The EZS consist of a data logger collecting measurements from the\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n5 of 23\nstations’ sensors, and an Ultra High Frequency (UHF)\
    \ radio modem that forwards the readings to the\nbase station. The produced dataset\
    \ is organized in registers that comprise measurements (temperature,\nrelative\
    \ humidity, leaf humidity, soil temperature, solar radiation, rain gauge, and\
    \ biological\nparameters), along with date and time. Ultimately, they provided\
    \ a low-cost and low power\nconsumption network that offers real measurements\
    \ in order to consistently validate various biological\nand ecological models\
    \ used in smart viticulture.\nIndices related to grapevine development were employed\
    \ by Neethling et al. [12] while analyzing\nnatural trends of climatic and bioclimatic\
    \ parameters for the main grapevine varieties in France.\nTheir research took\
    \ place at the Loire valley in northeast France, where the wine was determined\n\
    by the unique characteristics of the approximate geographical environment. The\
    \ research team used\ntemperature data from 7 stations in the area, but not situated\
    \ within the vineyards. More speciﬁcally,\ntemperature measurements produced several\
    \ indices: Mean and seasonal temperature, growing\ndegree-days index (GDD), Huglin\
    \ index (HI), cool-night index (CI), and Diurnal Temperature Range\n(DTR). Additionally,\
    \ they gathered monthly rainfall data from 5 stations within the research area,\n\
    which used to calculate total rainfall, dry-spell-mean index, and number of days\
    \ of heavy rainfall.\nMoreover, they dissected the indices in 2 groups (climatic\
    \ and bioclimatic), which assisted them\nto conclude on a temperature rise during\
    \ the growing season (April–September). Consequently,\nNeethling et al. used a\
    \ large meteorological dataset that helped them indicate the inﬂuence of climatic\n\
    and bioclimatic variations in berry composition of the main grape varieties cultivated\
    \ in the Loire valley.\nTaking above research efforts a step further, Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) technologies are supportive\nto conventional methods of data\
    \ acquisition through the prism of prediction models development.\nParra Plazas\
    \ et al. [13] proposed a Computational Intelligence (CI) model using IoT technologies\
    \ in the\nnotion of climate monitoring. Their dataset originates from weather\
    \ stations in a time-line between 2009\nand 2011. The variables under study are\
    \ precipitation (mm of water), atmospheric pressure (mm Hg),\nrelative humidity\
    \ (HR%), temperature (Co), wind speed (km/h), and wind direction (azimuth degrees).\n\
    The data collected during the aforementioned time period produced a knowledge\
    \ base on which two\nCI models were deployed. The models demonstrated that further\
    \ experimentation is needed with\nan ampliﬁed dataset in order to improve its\
    \ responsiveness.\nHaving said that, it is rather true that modern research on\
    \ agricultural production and adaptation\ntends to be based on multi-disciplinary\
    \ methodologies focused both on quantitative and qualitative\nmeasurements. Statistics\
    \ derived solely from arithmetic/numerical data cannot provide the excepted\n\
    results on production growth and durability. Thus, most recent studies deployed\
    \ several different\nmethodologies in the ﬁelds of geography, remote sensing,\
    \ and informatics that largely enable\nresearchers to further employ state-of-the-art\
    \ agricultural analysis on top of the aforementioned\nmethodologies and approaches.\
    \ The latter are discussed in the next subsection.\n2.2. Location-Based Data\n\
    Nowadays, the so-called Geographic Information Systems (GIS) play a powerful role\
    \ in spatial\nanalysis. The investigation and management of spatial variability\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds consist of\nmapping homogeneous management zones with\
    \ the use of proximal and remote sensing methods that\nprovide increased resolution\
    \ and accuracy of spatial characterization of physical parameters. The basis\n\
    of geographical integration into Decision Support Systems (DSS) introduced by\
    \ Tian-en et al. [14]\ndescribing spatial work-ﬂows and their components, under\
    \ the scope of precision farming optimization.\nTheir proposed web platform was\
    \ based on data structures derived form sampling areas. The data\nare soil, water\
    \ and climatic factors and are accompanied by location-based data in order to\
    \ assist\nagricultural management within the the study areas.\nFurthermore, it\
    \ may reduce on-site sampling costs, and improve management of wine quality\n\
    in relation to soil, crop, and yield features. In this framework, the notion of\
    \ spatial variability of\nmeteorological conditions is presented by Matese et\
    \ al. [15] for the distinction of best vintages.\nThe authors presented novel\
    \ results on spatial variability and its deﬁnition at different topographic\n\
    Sustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n6 of 23\nscales. They deployed several sensors\
    \ (temperature, humidity, solar radiation) within the study areas\nand developed\
    \ varied analytic methodologies depending on the climatic scale (meso, topo/macro,\n\
    micro 1 and micro 2). All factors assessed within the context of spatial variation\
    \ as dependant\ncategorical variables, which are designed hierarchically in order\
    \ to justify their meaning in parametric\nmonitoring assessment. Their results\
    \ illustrate the effects of several sources of spatial variation in\nviticulture\
    \ and presented a “proof of concept” methodology for on-site application. Additionally,\n\
    the in-ﬁeld measurements potentially provide support to production and disease\
    \ management\nfor research and technical purposes. Finally, Matese et al. highlight\
    \ the need to further develop\nmultifactorial means of analysis on the scope of\
    \ agro-meteorological monitoring in addition to the\nmanagement of large environmental\
    \ datasets.\nBai et al. [16] proposed a multi-sensor system that manages plant\
    \ phenotypic data, which based\non ﬁve sensor modules to measure crop canopy traits\
    \ from agricultural terroirs. The research team\nalso assessed data related to\
    \ canopy reﬂectance spectra thoughout RGB images on soybean and wheat\nﬁelds.\
    \ The produced integrated sensor system used solar radiation and air temperature/relative\n\
    humidity sensors, ultrasonic distance sensors, infrared thermal radiometers, NDVI\
    \ sensors, portable\nspectrometers and RGB cameras that then were synchronized\
    \ the analyzed data in order to provide\ninter-correlations among the sensor-based\
    \ traits, validated of the reliability of the apparatus in data\ncollection. Their\
    \ study indicated the useful capabilities of location based sensor systems during\n\
    plant breeding.\nGeo-statistics as a tool for monitoring agricultural practices\
    \ was the subject of study of\nIrimia et al. [17]. They used the daily averages\
    \ of temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration\nvariables for the period\
    \ between 1961 and 2013 at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees (i.e., 10 × 10\
    \ km)\nin order to produce a spatial distribution map assessing the climatic suitability\
    \ of wine production\nbased on oenoclimatic aptitude index (IAOe). Their ﬁndings\
    \ highlighted the negative evolution of\nclimate suitability for wine production\
    \ within the areas of study and where the changes are likely to\ngenerate climatic\
    \ classiﬁcation in wine growing regions in Romania.\nThe simulation of surface\
    \ ﬂows on the basis of erosion management was examined by\nRodrigo-Comino et al.\
    \ [18] in order to estimate soil erodibility, runoff discharge and erosion rate.\n\
    They’ve implemented several rainfall simulations in their study areas and produced\
    \ statistical results\nused in conjunction with spatial coefﬁcients, which indicate\
    \ spatial distribution of the mechanical\neffects of water in soil composition.\
    \ Furthermore, authors produced proportional symbol maps that\nvisualized the\
    \ results of spatial coefﬁcients, thus indicating the high soil and water losses\
    \ within the\nstudy areas.\nFinally, spatial characteristics of different energy\
    \ consumption patterns in agriculture were\npresented by Tian et al. [19]. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the authors implemented a GIS methodology in analyzing\nthe distribution between\
    \ energy types with respect to their contribution in yield. Furthermore, their\n\
    study recorded numerical data collected on-site that assisted them to analyze\
    \ the spatial variation of\nenergy consumption. They produced several thematic\
    \ maps, which visualize several indices related to\nspatial correlation, clustering,\
    \ and association. The results categorized the energy types in signiﬁcance\nand\
    \ Moran’s I index proved to be the most productive tool for large scale spatial\
    \ correlation analysis.\n2.3. Data from Satellites\nRemote sensing has proved\
    \ to be game-changing for the agricultural sector, as it is considered\nto be\
    \ fundamental for the trending “precision agriculture” framework. In principle,\
    \ remote sensing\nestimates the properties of a plant through non-destructive\
    \ processes in a fast and accurate method.\nIt may include a wide range of applications\
    \ in agriculture, such as crop growth monitoring, crop yield,\nand quality estimation,\
    \ identiﬁcation of irrigation needs, as well as biotic and abiotic damage [20].\n\
    Zarco-Tejada et al. [21] studied the effects of hyper-spectral indices in agricultural\
    \ research and\nin particular in the natural conditions of vineyards. Their scope\
    \ of research concentrated to vine\nreﬂectance along with soil spectra extracted\
    \ from images collected at spatial resolution of 1 m and on\nSustainability 2019,\
    \ 11, 3278\n7 of 23\n8 spectral bands. In particular, they concentrated at the\
    \ calculation of narrow-band indices of pigment\ndensity. Furthermore, this study\
    \ investigated the optical properties of Vitis vinifera L. leaves by taking\n\
    into consideration its reﬂectance and transmittance properties. Additionally,\
    \ the researchers measured\nthe optical index calculation along with the destructive\
    \ determination of pigments on a database\nretrieved between 2002 and 2003. The\
    \ images were obtained from 103 study sites that include 24 ﬁelds\nand enabled\
    \ the use of scaling up on leaf-level sensitive remote sensing indices. The indices\
    \ assisted\nthe researchers to assess on the effectiveness of canopy-level information\
    \ retrieval methodology.\nIt is acknowledged that water is a major resource in\
    \ agriculture and is related to arid regions.\nRemote Sensing (RS) toolkits offer\
    \ region characterization on drought through speciﬁed indices\ndeveloped for remote\
    \ study. Rhee et al. [22] proposed a RS-based drought index that monitors arid\n\
    and humid regions using multi-sensor data. Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI)\
    \ combines several\nassets of RS methodology (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI), Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer Sensor (MODIS),\
    \ and precipitation (TRMM)) in order to collect relevant\ninformation for the\
    \ effect of waterlessness on annual basis. The SDCI was affected by the varied\
    \ spatial\nresolution from each of the indices and scaling was an approach to\
    \ segregate the drought effect among\narid and humid areas, while the dataset\
    \ will get enriched over time.\nZone scaling on thematic maps of wine grape terroirs\
    \ was the subject of study of Vaudour et al. [23].\nThey proposed a mapping methodology\
    \ of implementing bootstrapped regression trees on distinct\ncombinations of morphometric\
    \ data in conjunction with 20 meter SPOT satellite images. Furthermore,\nthe authors\
    \ managed to capture expert knowledge on grape harvest quality at various spots\
    \ in South\nAfrica on a regional scale. Their proof of concept methodology relied\
    \ on a limited number of easily\navailable spatial data at a medium spatial resolution;\
    \ the positive aspect was the fact that the latter\ncould be duplicated to any\
    \ other homogeneous viticultural terroirs.\nProductivity assessment analysis while\
    \ implementing hyper-spectral reﬂectance recognition in\nrelation to vines biophysical\
    \ properties was proposed by Serrano et al. [24]. Their work focused\non berry\
    \ yield growth and quality attributes prediction in rain-fed vineyards. The indices\
    \ implied\ndifferences among vineyards with relation to their vine canopy vigor\
    \ and water status, on a water\ndeﬁcit time scale. Furthermore, their results\
    \ indicated speciﬁc correlations among indices that are\nmore susceptible to water\
    \ sufﬁciency or deﬁciency on the scope of predicting berry quality attributes\n\
    in relation to aquatic reserves.\nBourgeon et al. [25] proposed methodology for\
    \ characterizing vine foliage with the use of\nmultispectral satellite sensors.\
    \ More speciﬁcally, they introduced a proximal imaging sensor that\noperates within\
    \ the visible and near-infrared (NI) spectral bands. The camera sensor was deployed\
    \ at\nthe ground level and produced absolute reﬂectance images comparable to NDVI\
    \ maps produced by\ncommercial satellite systems. The physiological assessment\
    \ of the vines was implemented through\nradiometric calibration of multispectral\
    \ imagery by post-image processing tools on the scope of\ntemporal monitoring\
    \ the evolution of vine foliage.\nTang et al. [26] proposed both a proximal and\
    \ a remote sensing method, utilizing two\ndifferent methods for assisting in decision\
    \ support and yield estimation from existing technologies.\nThey employed ground\
    \ video feed for green pixel, in conjunction to local thresholding and\nSelf-Organizing-Maps\
    \ from satellite imagery, in order to identify non-productive vines in the available\n\
    canopy on the block level. This semi-supervised version provided recognition capabilities\
    \ at the\nphenological stage as an automatic and low-cost monitoring application,\
    \ potentially deployed over\ndifferent times within the season.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ socio-economic, and physical effects on Mediterranean vineyards is the subject\n\
    of study for Vinatier and Gonzalez-Arnaiz [27]. The researchers employed multi-temporal\
    \ satellite\nimagery in order to comprehend and track the changes in land cover\
    \ that shape agricultural landscapes.\nFurthermore, the changes in land management\
    \ were composed in transition matrices that interpret\ngains, losses, and swaps\
    \ for each category. In addition to temporal changes, images with sufﬁcient\n\
    spatial resolution were used in order to detect subtle differences in land use/cover\
    \ on a speciﬁc scale.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n8 of 23\nTheir work underlines\
    \ the usefulness of satellite imagery in classifying alterations in yield distribution\n\
    and quality, in relation to external parameters that drive land management in\
    \ agricultural areas.\nYield quality and productivity can be assessed through\
    \ satellite and proximal sensing by\nestimating spectral vegetation indices (SVIs).\
    \ Anastasiou et al. [20] employed satellite and proximal\nsensing at the various\
    \ stages of table grape growth for three cultivation years in a row (i.e., between\n\
    2015–2017). Landsat 8 satellite imagery and proximal sensing techniques produced\
    \ calculations of\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index\n(GNDVI) that the SVIs were based upon. The indices\
    \ measure seasonal plant response - exploiting soil\nand plant spectra—and produce\
    \ the type of relationship between visible and near-infrared reﬂectance.\nTheir\
    \ results indicated higher accuracy of proximal sensing, providing higher correlations\
    \ and temporal\naccuracy during the earlier period of grape growth.\nThe importance\
    \ of water resources in the quality of vine production is highlighted by Loggenberg\n\
    et al. [28]. They introduce a machine-learning based remote sensing methodology\
    \ for the study of\nwater stress in Shiraz type vineyards. The results are based\
    \ on terrestrial hyper-spectral imaging\ncapturing the study areas, which were\
    \ located in Stellenbosch at the Western Cape of South Africa.\nThey employed\
    \ several remote sensing methodologies upon data acquisition and pre-processing\n\
    techniques combining on-site and satellite sampling. The remote sensing methodology\
    \ consists of\nspectral smoothing for multi-band images, classiﬁcation (implemented\
    \ with Random Forest (RF) and\nExtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting) techniques),\
    \ dimensional reduction, and accuracy assessment.\nThe researchers concluded that\
    \ remote sensing machine learning methodologies on hyperspectral data\ndemonstrated\
    \ that Random Forest (RF) classiﬁcation optimally corresponds to water stress\
    \ modelling\nin applications related to viticulture.\n2.4. Image Data from Drones\n\
    In data-driven agriculture, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, as they\
    \ are usually\nreferred to, are a valuable tool for making inferences about grape\
    \ composition from multispectral\nmeasurements. They can acquire high-resolution\
    \ aerial images, digital RGB (Red-Green-Blue),\nhyper-spectral imagery of vineyards,\
    \ as well as data of other modalities. When equipped with\nappropriate sensors,\
    \ UAVs can collect useful data related to leaf temperature, vine water status,\n\
    and canopy vigor. Depending on the need of the applications, equipped sensors\
    \ can gather thermal,\nvisible, hyperspectral, and/or multispectral images. For\
    \ example, hyperspectral sensors can gather\na broader range of wavelengths; a\
    \ thermal camera can gather image data to determine canopy variables\nsuch as\
    \ water stress.\nComba et al. [29] introduced the adoption of detection techniques\
    \ in modern precision agriculture\nfor quality production standards. The researchers\
    \ proposed an image processing algorithm for the\nautomatic detection of vine\
    \ rows from gray-scale aerial imagery. Near-infrared (NI) images acquired\nwith\
    \ a Tetracam ADC-lite camera (http://www.tetracam.com/Products-ADC_Lite.htm) that\
    \ was\ninstalled on a Mikrokopter Hexa-II drone (http://wiki.mikrokopter.de/en/HexaKopter).\
    \ This array\nhas a ﬁeld of view and is able to achieve a 0.056 m/pixel ground\
    \ resolution at a ﬂight altitude of 150 m.\nAdditionally, the effectiveness of\
    \ the proposed method has been demonstrated by reporting the results\nof the elaborations\
    \ applied to 4 sample vineyard images. The proposed method is able to process\
    \ the\noriginal acquired image as it is, without any intervention or feedback\
    \ from the user and requires a very\nlimited number of calibration parameters.\
    \ The results obtained from the processing of a set of sample\nimages demonstrate\
    \ the effectiveness of the proposed method, with a very limited error rate, even\
    \ in\nthe case of images with disturbances and different vine row orientations\
    \ in the same image.\nThe work of Matese et al. [30] describes the implementation\
    \ probabilities of multi-sensor\nUAVs with a variety of monitoring tasks. The\
    \ researchers assessed the intra-vineyard in terms\nof characterization of the\
    \ state of vines vigor using multispectral cameras, leaf temperature (thermal\n\
    camera), and a model methodology of missing plants analysis with a high spatial\
    \ resolution of RGB\nbands camera. The aforementioned apparatus was designed speciﬁcally\
    \ for precision viticulture in the\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n9 of 23\nscope\
    \ of rapid and multi-purpose environmental monitoring within the areas of interest.\
    \ The UAV\nprovided images with discriminative details in rows and inter-rows\
    \ of vines and as a result provided\npure pixels with solely the foliage. Their\
    \ usage in agricultural applications, in general, and in viticulture,\nin particular,\
    \ is enhanced by high ﬂexibility of use, low operating costs, and a very high\
    \ spatial\nresolution that they offer.\nDe Castro et al. [31] exploited the capabilities\
    \ of UAVs to produce image data that support 3D\nlandscape models. The aerial\
    \ vehicles ﬂew over 3 vineyards with a distinct gap between the vine\nrows at\
    \ a different growth rate. More speciﬁcally they chose to make the ﬂights in July\
    \ and September\nin order to depict the two distinct phases of the crop. With\
    \ their approach, they managed to gather\ninformation from 3 ﬁelds at two crop\
    \ stages, analyzing a wide range of situations and as a result to\nproduce robust\
    \ data. The UAVs were ﬂown at 30 m of altitude, taking images with spatial resolution\
    \ of\n1cm per pixel (i.e., ground image size: 37 × 28 m) in a rate of 1 s per\
    \ frame. Therefore, they succeeded\nto get a 93% forward lap and 60% of side lap\
    \ in order to create a 3D reconstruction of crops.\nMulti-temporal monitoring\
    \ of agricultural lands demands continuous characterization of\nvegetation on\
    \ distinct dates. Pádua et al. [32] proposed a monitoring platform that uses multi-temporal\n\
    data related to precision viticulture (PV) that can be used to monitor the size,\
    \ shape, and vigour of\ngrapevines canopies. Their work aims to vegetation characterization\
    \ through multi-temporal analysis\nusing accessible and low cost UAVs for the\
    \ acquisition of very-high resolution imagery, up to ground\nsample distance (GSD)\
    \ and accompanied sensor nodes. Thereafter, the gathered data were analyzed\n\
    automatically with consideration of the natural, topographic, and morphological\
    \ variables of the area\nof interest. Their method produced RGB orthophoto mosaics\
    \ of the vineyards in whole, multi-temporal\nﬁeld analysis, and, ﬁnally, a crop-related\
    \ and non-invasive data acquisition method for farmers.\nAll in all, high-resolution\
    \ aerial images from drones can be used to determine the spatial\ndistribution\
    \ of a variety of canopy variables within a vineyard block and between different\
    \ vineyard\nblocks. In this way, UAVs can be used to measure the spatial distribution\
    \ of vigor, water stress, nutrient\nstatus, disease, yield components, and berry\
    \ composition. Rationale for employing drones in precision\nviticulture practices\
    \ are the higher ﬂexibility of use, lower operational costs compared to the usage\n\
    of conventional aircraft, and invariability to cloud cover. However, utilization\
    \ of UAVs in precision\nviticulture is a relatively new area of research, not\
    \ extensively tested and the major challenges to be\nconsidered are the massive\
    \ amount of collected data, the time required for post processing of collected\n\
    data, and the need for feature engineering in order to derive useful vegetation\
    \ indices that are speciﬁc\nto variables of interest.\n3. Machine Learning (ML)\
    \ Methodologies for Agricultural Data\nDuring the last years we have witnessed\
    \ a plethora of technological breakthroughs in domains\nsuch as computer vision\
    \ and machine translation, which have led to the establishment of Machine\nLearning\
    \ (ML) as one of the core tenets of the current technological landscape. The aforementioned\n\
    successes can mainly be attributed to the utilization of large and complex Deep\
    \ Neural Network (DNN)\narchitectures, better acknowledged as “deep learning.”\n\
    Moreover, the evolution and transformations in the smart agriculture ﬁeld over\
    \ the recent years\nresult nowadays in the mass production of huge amounts of\
    \ data, information, and content from many\ndifferent sources, such as IoT devices\
    \ and sensors, environmentalists, agronomists, winemakers, or\nplain farmers and\
    \ interested stakeholders. Thus, deep learning along with other more “conventional”\n\
    machine learning methodologies, can play a pivotal role towards addressing numerous\
    \ research\nproblems within the agricultural domain, mainly through the utilization\
    \ of the large amount of\navailable digitized agricultural information.\nIn the\
    \ following, Section 3.1 presents research works related to exploiting continuous\
    \ data\n(e.g., data from sensors such as temperature, soil moisture, etc.) for\
    \ the purpose of creating predictive\nMachine Learning models capable to provide\
    \ various forecasts, whereas Section 3.2 describes the\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 3278\n10 of 23\nusage of image-based information mostly by deep learning models,\
    \ which are capable of classifying\nplant species, detect deceases, and ﬁnally,\
    \ perform spatial-aware object classiﬁcation.\n3.1. ML-Based Forecasting on Numerical\
    \ Data\nOne of the worth-noting works in the ﬁeld is the one by Radhika and M.\
    \ Shashi [33],\nwhere they exploit Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for the task\
    \ of predicting the maximum\ndaily temperature. They use a Multi-Layer Perceptron\
    \ (MLP) as a baseline, trained through\nback-propagation. To accomplish the aforementioned\
    \ prediction task, they rely on weather data\nprovided by the University of Cambridge\
    \ for the time period of 2003–2007. Through their experimental\nﬁndings, the authors\
    \ showcase that the SVM-based approach is able to achieve signiﬁcant results,\n\
    thus showcasing its suitability for this particular prediction problem.\nSimilarly,\
    \ Gill et al. [34] develop a SVM regression model in order to predict the moisture\
    \ of soil.\nIn particular, the authors utilize both meteorological and soil moisture\
    \ data, from 11 weather stations\nfrom the Oklahoma region in the United States\
    \ of America for training and testing their prediction\nmodel. Finally, by comparing\
    \ their proposed model against an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN),\nthey showcase\
    \ its efﬁciency.\nMohammadi et al. [35] develop a predictive model for the task\
    \ of inferring the dew point\ntemperature, i.e., the temperature at which water\
    \ vapor in the air condenses into liquid, since by\npredicting this, it is also\
    \ possible to determine whether it will rain or snow at a particular date.\nTo\
    \ achieve that, the authors exploit Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), i.e., feed-forward\
    \ neural\nnetworks, in which the weights of the nodes within a hidden layer do\
    \ not require any kind of tuning.\nThrough an experimental evaluation of their\
    \ model against conventional machine learning models\n(e.g., SVMs and ANNs), using\
    \ as a training dataset measurements from two meteorological stations in\nIran,\
    \ the authors were able to show that ELM can be applied for this problem with\
    \ promising results.\nSalcedo-Sanz et al. [36] propose a Machine Learning model\
    \ for long-term air temperature\nprediction, a task that is useful for a plethora\
    \ of domains, such as agriculture. They use the publicly\navailable monthly mean\
    \ temperature dataset provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology\n(BOM),\
    \ from urban and regional areas in Australia. They develop and evaluate two distinct\
    \ methods,\ni.e., a SVM regressor and an ANN, and showcase that the former is\
    \ able to outperform the latter,\nregarding the air temperature prediction task.\n\
    Abbot and Marohasy [37] exploit Artiﬁcial Neural Networks in order to predict\
    \ rainfall,\nfor the region of Queensland in Australia. More speciﬁcally, the\
    \ authors apply the aforementioned\ncategory of Machine Learning models for the\
    \ purpose of providing a medium-term rainfall\nforecast that outperforms conventional\
    \ statistical models typically exploited for this task. Similarly,\nChithra et\
    \ al. [38] utilise ANNs, for detecting the impact of climate change on the monthly\
    \ mean\nmaximum and minimum temperature in the Chaliyar river basin located in\
    \ India.\nOnal et al. [39] proposed an extended IoT Framework based on data integration,\
    \ retrieval,\nprocessing, and learning layers trough a weather data clustering\
    \ analysis methodology. Their learning\nmodel implemented unsupervised clustering\
    \ as a method of big data utilization originating from\n8000 weather stations\
    \ from North America. Air temperature, wind-speed, relative humidity, visibility,\n\
    and pressure data were analyzed by a traditional k-means clustering algorithm\
    \ under the scope of the\nstations’ geographical alignment.\nSehgal et al. [40]\
    \ developed ”ViSeed”, a Machine Learning and visualization framework\nfor weather\
    \ and yield prediction, respectively. In particular, the authors train and evaluate\n\
    a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classiﬁer on the Syngenta 2016 crop data challenge,\n\
    whereas Song et al. [41] utilize a Deep Belief Network (DBN), in order to predict\
    \ the soil moisture\ncontent in a corn ﬁeld. By training and evaluating their\
    \ proposed model on soil data collected from the\nZhangye oasis, in Northwest\
    \ China, and bench-marking against a multi-layer perceptron, the authors\nwere\
    \ able to showcase its effectiveness for the aforementioned task.\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n11 of 23\nFinally, Priya et al. [42] developed an integrated\
    \ system for precision agriculture implementing\nbig data analytics, IoT, and\
    \ Machine Learning methodologies. Their crop recommendation system\nuses Naïve\
    \ Bayes to indicate if the conditions are optimal for sowing, plant growth, and\
    \ harvesting of\na plant, in addition to yield prediction and pesticide recommendation.\
    \ Furthermore, the researchers\nproduced a scalable model based on data collected\
    \ from various sources, such as satellite images,\nsensor recorded ﬁeld data,\
    \ irrigation related reports, crop data, and weather data in India.\nThe interested\

    In the framework of scene classiﬁcation, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard [43] apply\
    \ a deep neural\nnetwork for the task of fruit counting.\nIn particular, the authors\
    \ present two different neural\narchitectures, i.e., a novel convolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN) and a modiﬁed version of the\nwell-known Inception-ResNet network.\
    \ In order to train the presented deep neural architectures,\nauthors rely on\
    \ a synthetic dataset, whereas, in order to validate their performance, they use\
    \ real\nimages collected from Google Images. Through their experimental approach\
    \ authors showcase the\nefﬁciency of their proposed neural architecture against\
    \ various baselines.\nSimilarly, Sa et al. [44] present DeepFruit, a neural network\
    \ for fruit detection. More speciﬁcally,\nthe authors adopt the Faster Region-based\
    \ CNN architecture and through transfer learning train\nit to be able to successfully\
    \ recognize sweet peppers contained in an image. Yalcin [45] developed\nDeep-Pheno,\
    \ a CNN for the task of recognizing and classifying the phenological stages of\
    \ plants,\ni.e., its life cycle. The author uses images depicting plants such\
    \ as cotton, wheet, and pepper from\ncameras found on various agro-stations in\
    \ Turkey for training and testing the model. The presented\nneural architecture\
    \ was able to outperform various conventional machine learning algorithms in the\n\
    aforementioned classiﬁcation task.\nLee et al. [46] used CNNs in order to extract\
    \ features from images in a completely unsupervised\nway, so as to train classiﬁers\
    \ able to identify 44 different plant species. Moreover, the authors try to\n\
    understand the feature representation of the model, so as to shed some light on\
    \ its inner decision\nmechanisms. Authors train and test the CNN on a leaf dataset\
    \ collected from the Kew Royal Botanic\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n12 of 23\n\
    Gardens in England. Finally, in order to evaluate the usefulness of the features\
    \ that the network learns,\nthey use them as input to a NN and SVM classiﬁers,\
    \ and thus are able to achieve beyond state-of-the-art\nresults. In a similar\
    \ approach, Dyrmann et al. [47] propose a CNN architecture for classifying images\
    \ of\nseedings during the early growth stage of a plant. More speciﬁcally, the\
    \ authors train a classiﬁer that is\nable to predict, using vertically photographed\
    \ images of seedings, 22 different plant species, achieving\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ results by training the network on 10,413 images collected from six different\
    \ datasets.\nFurthermore, Bargoti and Underwood [48] present an image-based fruit\
    \ detection model using\nthe Faster R-CNN neural architecture for mangoes, almonds,\
    \ and apples, achieving very good results.\nIn order to train the model, the authors\
    \ use images captured from orchards in the regions of Victoria\nand Queensland\
    \ in Australia. They present ablation studies so as to showcase the inner functionality\n\
    of the neural model, as well as which factors within an image play an important\
    \ role for the object\ndetection task. Mohanty et al. [49] apply convolutional\
    \ neural networks for automatically detecting\nand diagnosing plant diseases through\
    \ images. To achieve that, the authors utilize a public dataset\ncontaining 54,306\
    \ images of both diseased and healthy plant leaves, and train two neural architectures,\n\
    i.e., AlexNet and GoogLeNet, for classifying crop species and diseases status,\
    \ achieving a 99% accuracy.\nSimilarly, Sladojevic et al. [50] use a convolutional\
    \ deep learning model in order to automatically\nclassify and detect plant diseases\
    \ from images containing leafs. The proposed model was able to detect\nleaf presence\
    \ and distinguish between healthy leaves and 13 different diseases, which can\
    \ be visually\ndiagnosed. Moreover, the authors created a new dataset for training\
    \ and testing Machine Learning\nmodels for this particular task, containing more\
    \ than 3000 images gathered from the Internet and then\nextend it to more than\
    \ 30,000 using various data augmentation techniques. Mortensen et al. [51] utilize\n\
    a deep neural network to perform semantic segmentation for mixed crops. In particular,\
    \ the authors\nwere able to use a convolutional neural architecture (i.e., VGG16)\
    \ and through transfer learning\n(i.e., ﬁne-tuning the network instead of training\
    \ it from scratch) have it successfully estimate both\nthe individual components,\
    \ as well as the total biomass of a crop using an image dataset from a plot\n\
    experiment at Foulum Research Center in Denmark.\nRußwurm and Körner [52] perform\
    \ multi-temporal classiﬁcation upon a time-series for the\nclassiﬁcation of crops\
    \ for two seasons achieving state-of-the-art results, and thus showcasing the\n\
    efﬁcacy of deep learning methodologies for this particular domain. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ to perform\nthe aforementioned task, the authors applied an encoder-decoder\
    \ neural architecture on an Earth\nobservation (EO) sensors time-series dataset\
    \ from the region of Munich, Germany. Finally, they also\nprovide a visualization\
    \ of the neural network’s activations, so as to facilitate a better understanding\n\
    of its inner decision-making mechanisms. Pound et al. [53] exploit neural networks,\
    \ to perform\nimage-based plant phenotyping, i.e., describe features such as its\
    \ anatomical, ontogenetical,\nphysiological, and biochemical properties. In particular,\
    \ the authors train two different CNN-based\nneural networks to perform root and\
    \ shoot detection for wheat varieties, using a different dataset for\neach task,\
    \ respectively. Using this experimental approach they were able to achieve state-of-the-art\n\
    results (i.e., >97% accuracy) for root and shoot feature identiﬁcation and localization.\n\
    Namin et al. [54] present a neural architecture consisting of a CNN and Long-Short\
    \ Term\nNetwork (LSTN) for the task of plant classiﬁcation. In particular, the\
    \ authors utilize the CNN\nfor the unsupervised generation of features, and the\
    \ LSTN to investigate the growth of plants.\nBy applying their presented deep\
    \ learning framework on an image-based time-series dataset depicting\n4 different\
    \ categories of Arabidopsis thaliana plant, they were able to showcase that deep\
    \ learning\nnetworks can generate more useful features than the traditional hand-crafted\
    \ image analysis features,\nas well as achieve better results than conventional\
    \ Machine Learning methodologies. Kussul et al. [55]\nperform Land Cover and Crop\
    \ Types classiﬁcation using a dataset consisting of remote sensing\ndata. To effectively\
    \ tackle this particular problem, they use a multilevel deep learning approach,\n\
    i.e., both supervised and unsupervised learning through neural networks for segmenting\
    \ and\nclassifying a multi-source satellite image dataset. Their proposed neural\
    \ architecture was able to\noutperform traditional Machine Learning techniques\
    \ such as random forests.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n13 of 23\nRiegler-Nurscher\
    \ et al. [56] studied the sustainable cultivation of arable lands by introducing\n\
    a novel generic image analysis method for the estimation of soil cover. They implemented\
    \ a machine\nlearning methodology for distinguishing between various types of\
    \ soil cover through training\na manageable amount of classiﬁcation samples. Their\
    \ method deployed entangled random forests\non a wide training data set of soil\
    \ images obtained by high resolution cameras.\nFurthermore,\nthe pixel-wise method\
    \ produced accurate classiﬁcation of living plant material, building the basis\
    \ for\nfurther development of soil cover estimation in agriculture.\nLastly, Hall\
    \ et al. [57] investigate whether traditional hand-crafted image features can\
    \ outperform\nthose generated in an unsupervised way through deep neural networks\
    \ for the task of leaf classiﬁcation.\nBy training a deep convolutional neural\
    \ network on the Flavia dataset, the authors were able to\nshowcase that features\
    \ generated by the network are more useful than hand-crafting image features,\n\

    \ Classiﬁcation\nModern imagery is possessed by hierarchies of features that are\
    \ optimally described through\nconvolutional networks. The goal of producing suitable\
    \ size of outputs while at the same time\nkeeping inference and learning at efﬁcient\
    \ levels is implemented by building fully convolutional\nstructures that manage\
    \ inputs of arbitrary size. Furthermore, deep machine learning is a powerful\n\
    and robust tool to analyzing and predicting the statistical, geographical, and\
    \ multispectral optical big\ndata. It provides predictions and simulations of\
    \ the landscape expanding and evolution (geographical\nbig data) in more reasonable\
    \ and robust method. In this framework, Long et al. [58] presented\nthe basis\
    \ of segmenting semantic data through convolutional networks. More speciﬁcally\
    \ they\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n14 of 23\nnoted that segmentation bridges\
    \ the gap between semantics and location, based on the distinction\nof global\
    \ (i.e., ”what?”) and local (i.e., ”where?”) information. Based on deep feature\
    \ hierarchies\nthe researchers were able to encode location and semantics in a\
    \ nonlinear local-to-global pyramid.\nThey managed to deﬁne a “skip architecture”\
    \ to take advantage of a spectrum of features that\ncombine deep, coarse, semantic\
    \ information, and shallow, ﬁne, appearance information. Furthermore,\nthey stated\
    \ that fully convolutional networks are a rich class of models, which are able\
    \ to extent\ntheir classiﬁcation nets to segmentation. Additionally, Semantic\
    \ Segmentation allows to improve the\narchitecture with multi-resolution layer\
    \ combinations that dramatically improve the state-of-the-art,\nwhile simultaneously\
    \ simplifying and speeding up learning and inference tasks.\nThe importance of\
    \ aerial survey is underlined by the existing image collection and interpretation\n\
    tools.\nRecent rapid progress on these domains incur due to accessibility and\
    \ advancements in\ntechnology. However, imagery has little meaning by itself,\
    \ unless it is processed and meaningful\ninformation is derived from it. Therefore,\
    \ image classification comes as a way to address the problem of\nalgorithm generalization\
    \ through deep learning on the purposes of object recognition and detection,\n\
    scene parsing, and classification. Categorizing each image pixel to a semantic\
    \ class is typically called\n”Image Segmentation” and aims at understanding an\
    \ image at the pixel level, although images of\na fixed size are required to achieve\
    \ optimized classification, dense prediction of images of any size,\nand significantly\
    \ increased speed in the process. Still, the concept of smart agriculture convicts\
    \ the\nautomation of such tasks, especially where the optical sensors play an\
    \ important role. Guijarro et al. [59]\ndeveloped an image processing algorithm\
    \ through new automatic approach for segmenting main image\ntextures. Additionally,\
    \ they also managed to refine the identification of sub-textures inside the main\n\
    ones. They implemented a three step approach of automatic image segmentation that\
    \ proved its\neffectiveness under different illumination conditions in outdoor\
    \ environments.\nThe re-establishment of bee colonies through color satellite\
    \ image segmentation was the subject\nof study of Sammouda et al. [60]. They introduced\
    \ a pixel clustering methodology by introducing\na Hopﬁeld Neural Network (HNN)\
    \ to consider monitoring aspects such as environmental conditions,\npoor resolution,\
    \ and poor illumination. The algorithm was implemented successively with two,\n\
    three, four, ﬁve, and six clusters, as well as with data from RGB channels, taking\
    \ into consideration\naspects such as population density, ecological distribution,\
    \ and ﬂowering phenology. Furthermore,\nsupervised multispectral land-use classiﬁcation\
    \ may be implemented through multi-view deep\nlearning methodology; Luus et al.\
    \ [61] designed a deep CNN (DCNN) for a well-known dataset\n(UC Merced Land Use\
    \ dataset: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html) and used\n\
    as a benchmark for several applications. Their end-to-end learning system was\
    \ capable of complex\nland-use classiﬁcation of high-resolution multispectral\
    \ aerial imagery. Furthermore, it was shown that\nmulti-scale views can be used\
    \ to train a single network and increase classiﬁcation accuracy compared\nto using\
    \ single-view samples.\nHigh-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) provides pixel size\
    \ classiﬁcation of individual entities in\ndetail. Längkvist et al. [62] proposed\
    \ a method for classifying objects from multispectral orthoimagery\nand digital\
    \ surface models (DSMs). The researchers investigated the use of convolutional\
    \ neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for per-pixel classiﬁcation on satellite imagery with\
    \ very high resolution (VHR)\ncharacteristics. They managed to categorize large\
    \ landscapes into 5 classes (vegetation, ground, road,\nbuilding, and water) and\
    \ discovered that at the context size of about 24 pixels they can achieve\nlow\
    \ training and testing simulation time, and concurrently high and stable classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy.\nAdditionally, the researchers deployed multiple CNNs in parallel\
    \ with varying context areas in order\nto provide a stable and accurate classiﬁcation\
    \ result.\nContinuing, modelling techniques of entities of the agricultural terrain\
    \ based on remote detection\nmay be produced through suitable algorithms’ development.\
    \ Comba et al. [29] proposed a categorizing\nmethod for parallel and equidistant\
    \ vine rows in order to eliminate spatial periodicity during the image\nelaboration\
    \ process. More speciﬁcally, the proposed algorithm is able to remove disturbance\
    \ image\nelements (e.g., roads, shadows) and minimize cloud obstruction. Their\
    \ multi-parameter technique was\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n15 of 23\nimplemented\
    \ autonomously, without user intervention, while allowing automatic path computation\n\
    in the corridors between vineyards. Finally the computational effort is affordable\
    \ and the results can\nbe obtained in a few minutes of elaboration for complex\
    \ images.\nThe use of crowd-sourcing geo-tagged ﬁeld photos in agricultural monitoring\
    \ applications forms\nanother interesting approach and was investigated by Xu\
    \ et al. [63]. They developed a land cover type\nrecognition model for ﬁeld photos\
    \ based on deep learning techniques. More speciﬁcally they combined\na pre-trained\
    \ convolutional neural network (CNN), as the image feature extractor, and a multinomial\n\
    logistic regression model, as the feature classiﬁer. Their model was able to describe\
    \ its prediction\nconﬁdence and can enable users to distinguish reliable and unreliable\
    \ predictions. The researchers were\nalso able to provide a new research direction\
    \ in citizen science by proving the possibility that Artiﬁcial\nIntelligence is\
    \ capable of helping with land cover classiﬁcation and evaluating the model’s\
    \ performance.\nThe topic of land classiﬁcation is strongly related to agricultural\
    \ applications through its\nmapping changes and transformation on the landscape.\
    \ Wurm et al. [64] investigated the application\nof Fully Convolutional Networks\
    \ (FCNs) in map entities categorization from various satellite\nimages. They deployed\
    \ high resolution optical imagery form Quickbird (https://bit.ly/2Fvpq4u),\nin\
    \ conjunction with Sentinel-2 (https://bit.ly/2UVFO3C) and TerraSAR-X (https://bit.ly/2WlZHBb)\n\
    data, by using them in FCNs without fully connected the existing layers popularized\
    \ by CNN\narchitectures. Furthermore, they explored the capabilities of this process\
    \ of ”transfer learning” to later\nadopt a pre-trained CNN from VHR optical Quickbird\
    \ imagery. The images were then applied to\ndatasets with larger mapping areas\
    \ but lower geometric resolution such as Sentinel-2. Additionally,\nthey assessed\
    \ the capabilities of transfer learning from optical imagery to existing active\
    \ SAR imagery\nfrom TerraSAR-X. Their results produced extremely promising segmentation\
    \ outcomes that can be used\nas a proof-of-concept in transfer learning and fully\
    \ convolutional networks for landscape mapping in\nsatellite imagery.\nLastly,\
    \ following the previous notation we introduce Table 3, which provides the comparative\n\
    overview of the above-mentioned research efforts in the same four-column tabular\

    \ practices, by improving accuracy and consistency of processes,\nwhile at the\
    \ same time reducing farmers’ manual monitoring procedures. These techniques are\

    The adoption of smart technology (e.g., sensors) within the domain of agriculture\
    \ has lead to\nan ever-increasing amount of digital information that can be utilized\
    \ for various knowledge extraction\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n16 of 23\n\
    tasks through visualization platforms and predictive models. Moreover, the datasets\
    \ created from the\naforementioned smart devices may be further enriched through\
    \ manual and/or automated annotation\ntechniques in order to improve their usefulness.\
    \ Following Section 4.1 describes how the domain\nof knowledge base creation may\
    \ beneﬁt agriculture, whereas Section 4.2 depicts how leveraging\nvarious data\
    \ visualization techniques can contribute towards a better understanding towards\
    \ the\napplicability of agricultural data. Finally, Section 4.3 showcases the\
    \ applicability of crowd-sourcing for\nthe domain of agriculture, stressing various\
    \ use-cases that can potentially enhance the efﬁciency of\nvarious agriculture-related\
    \ tasks.\n4.1. Knowledge Base Creation Characteristics\nAs the world becomes full\
    \ of sensor networks producing information, agriculture enters the ﬁelds\nof data\
    \ processing, storage, and retrieval at a very fast pace. Through various sources\
    \ of information\nderiving from a wide data spectrum (e.g., geo-information, soil\
    \ measurements, weather forecast,\nchemical analyses, to mention just a few data\
    \ streams), the agriculture industry is in a position to grow\nan extremely rich\
    \ system of integrated IoT data to power more informed decisions. The main challenge\n\
    lies in the high heterogeneity of data types in the agricultural sector; agriculture\
    \ makes use of various\ndifferent data (e.g., research, meteorological, soil,\
    \ ﬁnancial/economic, statistical, satellite/remote\nsensing, administrative, germplasm,\
    \ crop experiments, and ﬁeld trials, to name a few) and for each\ndata type there\
    \ are numerous standards used and these standards are not always linked between\
    \ each\nother or at least with the most prominent one of the sector. Thus, all\
    \ collected data that accompany\nan agricultural object (i.e., crops, seeds, etc.)\
    \ are typically stored in metadata records.\nMetadata records are critical to\
    \ the documentation and maintenance of interrelationships between\ninformation\
    \ resources and are being used to ﬁnd, gather, and maintain resources over long\
    \ periods\nof time, like viticulture historical data. The consistent application\
    \ of a descriptive metadata standard\nimproves the user’s search experience and\
    \ makes information retrieval within a single collection\nor across multiple datasets\
    \ more reliable. Descriptive, administrative, technical, and preservation\nmetadata\
    \ contribute to the management of information resources and help to ensure their\
    \ intellectual\nintegrity both now and in the future. In parallel with other domains,\
    \ many researchers in the digital\nagricultural community recognized the need\
    \ to lower the barriers for the management and aggregation\nof digital resources,\
    \ by implementing some measure of interoperability among metadata standards\n\
    and then with proprietary data structures. As a result, there is a wide range\
    \ of proposed solutions,\nincluding crosswalks, translation algorithms, metadata\
    \ registries, and specialized data dictionaries.\nTypically, a crosswalk provides\
    \ mapping of metadata elements from one metadata schema to\nanother and is considered\
    \ one of the most robust and ﬂexible solution. The prerequisite to a meaningful\n\
    mapping requires a clear and precise deﬁnition of the elements in each schema.\
    \ The primary difﬁculty\nis to identify the common elements in different metadata\
    \ schemas and put this information to use in\nsystems that resolve differences\
    \ between incompatible records. Crosswalks are typically presented\nas tables\
    \ of equivalent elements in two schemas and, even though the equivalences may\
    \ be inexact,\nthey represent an expert’s judgment that the conceptual differences\
    \ are immaterial to the successful\noperation of a software process that involves\
    \ records encoded in the two models. A crosswalk supports\nthe ability of a retrieval\
    \ mechanism to query ﬁelds with the same or similar content in different data\n\
    sources. In other words, it supports the well-known and much desired - in the\
    \ digital world - notion of\n”semantic interoperability”.\nCrosswalks are not\
    \ only important for supporting the demand for single point of access or\ncross-domain\
    \ searching; they are also instrumental for converting data from one format to\
    \ another.\nHowever, aggregating metadata records from different repositories\
    \ may create confusing display\nresults, especially if some of the metadata were\
    \ automatically generated or created by institutions\nor individuals that did\
    \ not follow best practices or standard thesauri and controlled vocabularies.\n\
    Still, mapping metadata elements from different schemas is only one level of cross\
    \ walking. Another\nlevel of semantic interoperability addresses datatype registration\
    \ and formatting of the values that\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n17 of 23\n\
    populate the metadata elements, e.g., rules for recording personal names or encoding\
    \ standards for\ndates, and the alignment between local authority ﬁles and adopted\
    \ terminologies, but these topics\nexceed the scope of the current survey work.\n\
    4.2. Data Visualization\nTaking above discussion a step further, the scope of\
    \ developing conceptual understanding through\ndata on agriculture is implemented\
    \ with the assistance of visual representations of natural processes.\nGraphical\
    \ representation, computer animation, and spatial overlay of agricultural data\
    \ are often used\nin visualizing natural phenomena, as a derivative of data analysis\
    \ and ML. Furthermore, scientiﬁc\nillustrations provide guidance on constructing\
    \ visual models for knowledge systems and connection\nfor visual modeling of the\
    \ corresponding ﬁndings. Scientiﬁc papers facilitate the important concepts,\n\
    schemata, processes, and rules that enhance learning through paradigms. Each ﬁgure\
    \ or diagram\nposses the particular element and processing step that will guide\
    \ researchers to form the appropriate\nresearch concept. Additionally, dynamic\
    \ visualizations offer comparisons that investigate the effect\nof visualization\
    \ components on the acquisition of environmental and spatial factors of agricultural\n\
    research. On the aspect of image processing and analysis, visualization techniques\
    \ are used to monitor\nand manage images that reduce transition complexities and\
    \ raising future potentials for the research.\nThe goal of data visualization\
    \ is to bridge the gap between researcher and data concepts on\nthe basis of their\
    \ underlying physical laws and properties. Thereafter, the presentation of massive\n\
    amounts of data as ﬁgures, allow the researcher to trim ineffectual information,\
    \ focus on the necessary,\nand comprehend the semantics of data. In this framework,\
    \ Bajaj [65] categorized the aspects of dynamic\nrepresentation of data in three\
    \ categories, namely computation, display and querying, which address the\nparameters\
    \ of every visualization environment. It is remarkable that visualization techniques\
    \ are not\nonly based on data types, but also on the processing operators that\
    \ are inherent in each visualization\ntechnique [66]. The techniques could be\
    \ described a visualization data pipeline that distinguishes\nthem into four data\
    \ stages: Value, analytical abstraction, visualization abstraction, and view.\
    \ These stages\ndescribe the states of data and their according processing operations.\n\
    The familiarity of information entities in relation to their real world representation\
    \ is crucial\nfor human perception.\nThe distinction between visualization were\
    \ “science visualization” and\n“information visualization” and is implemented\
    \ through the development of “visual analytics”.\nInformation visualizatio as\
    \ a branch of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) utilizes graphics to assist\nresearchers\
    \ in grasping and interpreting data on the purpose of developing form mental models\
    \ of data.\nAccordingly, numerical entities can reveal speciﬁc features and patterns\
    \ of the obtained information.\nFurthermore, the deployed toolset aims on improving\
    \ ”the clarity and aesthetic appeal of the displayed\ninformation and allows a\
    \ person to understand large amount of data and interact with it” [67].\nThe advent\
    \ of Big Data and ML guides data research towards shaping the goal of visual\n\
    representation on the scope of identifying hidden patterns or extremities in data,\
    \ increasing query\nﬂexibility and specialization, comparing various units in\
    \ order to obtain relative difference in\nquantities and enabling on-the-ﬂy human\
    \ interaction. New possibilities of visualization distinguish\nits techniques\
    \ by three factors, namely: Data type, process, and interoperability. It’s worth\
    \ noting that\nhuman perceptional capabilities are not sufﬁcient to embrace data\
    \ in large amounts, thus each method\ncan support varied data types, various optical\
    \ tools, and varied methods for interaction. In particular,\nagricultural space,\
    \ as a scientiﬁc ﬁeld that employs interdisciplinary research methods, utilizes\n\
    spatio-temporal transitions of land characteristics in conjunction with their\
    \ physical parameters.\nThe various facets of digital representation are based\
    \ on important aspects of each dataset on\nthe distinctions between data and phenomena.\
    \ Supplementary to that, agricultural research is\nbased on ﬁeld-collected data\
    \ that require high-level abstract models of data processing [68].\nThe data-ﬂow-driven\
    \ model is overlaid on cartographic representation of the areas of interest, utilizing\n\
    static and dynamic maps. Furthermore, such a system is optimally supported by\
    \ a client-server\narchitecture, in order sustain scalability for handling data-intensive\
    \ agriculture applications. Quite on\nSustainability 2019, 11, 3278\n18 of 23\n\
    the contrary, numerically based analytics produce outputs that are displayed in\
    \ the form of queries,\nreports, charts, and diagrams. Those static numerical\
    \ conceptions can in the typical case be utilized\nstandalone, or superimposed\
    \ on a dynamic visualization platform.\n4.3. Crowd-Wisdom Exploitation\nDuring\
    \ the past decade, the wisdom of the crowd, or, in other words, the so-called\
    \ crowd-sourcing\nestablished itself as a dominant platform for exploiting the\
    \ skills and knowledge of online Internet\nusers. In particular, crowd-sourcing\
    \ can be perceived as outsourcing the task of data collection and/or\ndata annotation\
    \ to a group of non-professionals. The contributors to a crowd-sourcing platform\
    \ may\nreceive monetary compensation, or provide their services free of charge,\
    \ having in mind the collective\ngood. In the agriculture case crowd-sourcing\
    \ may be used in order to increase the efﬁciency of\na multitude of tasks within\
    \ the aforementioned domain. For example, sensors can be used in a number\nof\
    \ contexts for agriculture. By developing a platform that stores this type of\
    \ information, users will be\nable to submit data stemming from their own sensor-based\
    \ projects, something that can lead to the\naggregation of information regarding\
    \ different plant and/or crop species, and geography. Moreover,\nthe task of identifying\
    \ the species that a plant belongs to, may be enhanced through crowd-sourcing.\n\
    In particular, a potential contributor can improve the performance of a Machine\
    \ Learning classiﬁer\nby providing hand-annotated images along with the correct\
    \ labels, as well as various metadata that\ncan be utilized as features by the\
    \ predictive model. Finally, weather information is pivotal for farmers.\nA number\
    \ of mobile applications, use forecast information and measurements both from\
    \ ofﬁcial\nweather stations, along with data provided by amateur stations, respectively.\n\
    However, in order for the aforementioned applications to reach their full potential,\
    \ a number of\ninitiatives and standards must be enforced in the future within\
    \ crowd-sourcing platforms, so as to\nensure open participation, implement data\
    \ quality policies, along with privacy and security issues\nwith respect to storing\
    \ and utilizing the crowd-sourced information. In addition, care should be\ntaken\
    \ about the identities of the contributors, whereas easy-to-use interfaces have\
    \ to be provided,\ndue to the fact that the Information Communication Technology\
    \ (ICT) skills of the contributors may\nsigniﬁcantly vary in the process. One\
    \ may identify different criteria for the crowd-sourcing initiative\nto be appealing\
    \ and sustainable in a mass scale in the ﬁeld. Among others, good participatory\n\
    user interfaces, service and information salience provided to farmers, as well\
    \ as the provision of\nreliable services are considered absolutely necessary for\
    \ the advance of this initiative. In addition,\ncare should be taken about the\
    \ credibility of the provided information to the farmers or the agricultural\n\
    stakeholders, together with appropriate data quality policies, yet to be deﬁned\
    \ at least at the European\nlevel. As a ﬁnal thought, sustainability is quite\
    \ dependent on both the contextual information feedback\nfrom a farmer’s perspective\
    \ and the community’s to which the farmer may or may not belong to.\n5. Discussion\
    \ and Conclusions\nIn this smart agriculture survey paper we attempted to brieﬂy\
    \ report on the basic steps and\nmethods of indicative solutions that span across\
    \ different disciplines and research areas, and as a result\ncover quite diverse\
    \ research directions. From the above analysis and presentation it should have\n\
    been obvious by now that most presented methodologies and scenarios are based\
    \ on both traditional,\nwell-established computer science algorithms and techniques,\
    \ that are currently being adapted to\nwork on the newly acquired agricultural\
    \ data, as well as innovative, new aspects, enabled by modern\ntechnologies, such\
    \ as drones and satellites, whose usage and exploitation were not available until\
    \ the\nvery recent years. Thus, the overall conclusion drawn may be summarized\
    \ in the following quotation:\nWhen dealing with intelligent agricultural information\
    \ and data, computing applications and systems,\nresearchers should in principle\
    \ initially target more ﬂexible and rather generic approaches and then\ntry to\
    \ identify additional but inherent sources of meaningful information to boost\
    \ and enhance their\nﬁndings in a qualitative manner. Since smart agriculture\
    \ is now becoming widely accepted to have\nmany forms and depictions, the era\
    \ of extremely focused and domain-speciﬁc applications and systems\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 3278\n19 of 23\nis considered to be quite over. By integrating the\
    \ herein brieﬂy presented works and by providing\na short discussion and interpretation\
    \ for each identiﬁed group, we deem and, at the same time,\nanticipate that the\
    \ herein instigated classiﬁcation will be used by both fellow academics and people\n\
    involved in almost all steps of the agricultural production chain towards a bouquet\
    \ of meaningful\nresearch directions.\nWithin this review work we presented several\
    \ studies, focusing on intelligent agricultural\ninformation handling methodologies,\
    \ for improving and/or gaining insight into a multitude of\ndifferent tasks within\
    \ the agricultural domain. We organized the aforementioned studies into three\n\
    major categories, namely data sources and collection, machine learning methodologies\
    \ for agricultural\ndata, and ﬁnally, intelligent knowledge acquisition. We believe\
    \ that the economic importance of\nagricultural industry worldwide demands the\
    \ development of innovative methodologies for precision\nand optimal farming.\
    \ Irrespectively of the geographical region at hand, the harvest varies from year\n\
    to year due to soil conditions, disease, pests, climate and variation in yield\
    \ management practices.\nThese factors make the production of high quality produce\
    \ a rather challenging task. Still, traditional\nand innovative computational\
    \ methodologies, such as image analysis, remote monitoring and Machine\nLearning\
    \ have the potential to provide an inexpensive, non-destructive way of capturing\
    \ precise\ninformation about the crop. From the analysis of the herein included\
    \ research works it is rather evident\nthat the particular problems identiﬁed\
    \ within most agricultural learning applications are focused on\nthe speciﬁc models\
    \ and frameworks employed, the sources, the actual nature and pre-processing of\n\
    data used, and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics deployed\
    \ for each research\nwork. Agricultural monitoring provide data and knowledge\
    \ for deep learning and other existing\npopular computational techniques, in respect\
    \ to differences in classiﬁcation or regression performance.\nConsidering the\
    \ impact and applicability of Machine Learning, our motivation was to identify\
    \ the main\nrecent trends within this particular application domain, in order\
    \ to facilitate a better understanding of\nthe speciﬁc ﬁeld for future studies.\n\
    Overall, a clear trend is to be identiﬁed and this may be summarized into the\
    \ active utilization of\nMachine Learning methodologies for a multitude of agricultural\
    \ tasks. Our future plans include the\nexamination of innovative areas of smart\
    \ agriculture in narrower, yet trending, application domains,\nlike speciﬁc popular\
    \ social networks (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.), so as to be able to monitor\
    \ evolving\ntrends in agricultural data utilization and identify potential new\
    \ emerging data models in the process.\nClearly, it is not possible to tackle\
    \ all aspects of modern agricultural-related computing in a single paper\nnor\
    \ discuss all expressions in the process and consequently several open remaining\
    \ issues are to be\nidentiﬁed by the experienced reader as food for thoughts.\
    \ The latter should also take into account not\nonly the researchers’, but also\
    \ the developers’ point of view on the matter. Developers are encouraged\nto take\
    \ this survey’s observations into account, but at the same time they would need\
    \ to do so without\nsacriﬁcing the required usability or without increasing the\
    \ related computational complexity of their\napplications in the process. All\
    \ these remarks are considered to be crucial for enabling sufﬁcient\nand innovative\
    \ agricultural information distribution in wide-area, real-life deployments, both\
    \ within\ncurrent and future informatics’ applications, system and scientiﬁc research.\n\

  explanation: 'The following paper aims to explore how automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management can be optimized through the integration of IoT and machine
    learning technologies. Specifically, the study focuses on the relevance of a specific
    point in the irrigation management pipeline, where a heterogeneous network of
    IoT sensors is deployed to collect real-time data on soil moisture (e.g., capacitive,
    tensiometric), temperature (e.g., thermocouples, thermistors), humidity (e.g.,
    capacitive, resistive), and plant health (e.g., sap flow, leaf wetness). The paper
    assesses the potential benefits of deploying a machine learning model to analyze
    the collected data and dynamically adjust irrigation schedules in order to optimize
    water usage and enhance agricultural productivity.


    The specific point in the irrigation management pipeline that the study focuses
    on is real-time sensing and machine learning-based irrigation management. This
    point involves the use of IoT sensors to collect data on various soil and plant
    parameters, and the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze the

    a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • SLR is conducted using PRISMA
    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    The surge in global population is compelling a shift toward smart agriculture
    practices. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources, limited availability
    of arable land, increase in unpredictable weather conditions makes food security
    a major concern for most countries. As a result, the use of Internet of Things
    (IoT) and data analytics (DA) are employed to enhance the operational efficiency
    and productivity in the agriculture sector. There is a paradigm shift from use
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) as a major driver of smart agriculture to the
    use of IoT and DA. The IoT integrates several existing technologies, such as WSN,
    radio frequency identification, cloud computing, middleware systems, and end-user
    applications. In this paper, several benefits and challenges of IoT have been
    identified. We present the IoT ecosystem and how the combination of IoT and DA
    is enabling smart agriculture. Furthermore, we provide future trends and opportunities
    which are categorized into technological innovations, application scenarios, business,
    and marketability. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 5,

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has found its application in several
    areas, such as connected industry, smart-city [1], [2], smart-home [3] smart-energy,
    connected car [4], smart-agriculture [5], connected building and campus [6], health
    care [7], logistics [8], among other domains. IoT aims to integrate the physical
    world with the virtual world by using the Internet as the medium to communicate
    and exchange information [9]. IoT has been defined as a system of interrelated
    computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people
    that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over
    a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. A
    key area of interest in this paper is the application of IoT in agriculture. The
    world population is estimated to be about 9.7 billion in 2050, as such there will
    be great demand for food. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources,
    arable land, unpredictable weather conditions make food security a major concern
    for most countries. The world is turning to the use of IoT combined with data
    analytics (DA) to meet the world’s food demands in the coming years [10]. It is
    predicted that IoT device installations in the agriculture sector will increase
    from 30 million in 2015 to 75 million by 2020. The use of IoT and DA will enable
    smart agriculture which is expected to deliver high operational efficiency and
    high yield [11], [12]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

  explanation: The proposed framework, MiFarm-CSA, is a reference architecture for
    deploying automated systems for real-time irrigation management that can contribute
    to the efficient use of water resources and enhance agricultural productivity
    to meet the growing demand for food. The framework offers a layered approach,
    consisting of an Integrated Data Collection Network (IDCON), Social-Ecological
    Conceptual Framework (SECF), Mixed Farming as a Service (MFaS), and an Evidence-based
    Assessment Methodology (EVAM). The IDCON layer gathers data from a wide range
    of IoT sensors, devices, gateways, and servers, as well as UAVs and FANETs, to
    provide big volumes of data in near real time. The SECF layer aims to support
    sophisticated capabilities such as forecasting and optimization of crop management,
    while the MFaS layer provides a set of advanced and efficient user applications
    and services destined to farmers and stakeholders. The EVAM layer includes the
    SCOPE methodology for framing and creating dynamic process maps, a social license
    to operate (SLO) concept, the behavioral decision-making (BDm) concept, and a
    Behavioral Intervention Engine (BIE) to influence farmers to adopt environmentally
    suitable practices.
  extract_1: The Integrated Data Collection Network (IDCON) layer exploits a wide
    range of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, devices, gateways and servers, UAVs
    and FANETs, which are capable of covering large-scale areas for providing big
    volumes of data in near real time, such as information about the temperature,
    humidity, pressure, wind speed, pH, dissolved oxygen levels, temperature, conductivity,
    etc.
  extract_2: As a result, MiFarm-CSA architecture is able to boost feed efﬁciency,
    increase food quality, mitigate risks regarding the animal loss, decrease the
    stakeholder’s expenses and increase his income.

    Abstract: Climate change is emerging as a major threat to farming, food security\
    \ and the livelihoods\nof millions of people across the world. Agriculture is\
    \ strongly affected by climate change due to\nincreasing temperatures, water shortage,\
    \ heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity\nof excessive climatic\
    \ events such as ﬂoods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by\n\
    developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming\
    \ at lower intensity\nand occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems\
    \ constitute a promising solution, as they can\nlower reliance on external inputs,\
    \ enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efﬁciency.\nIn this\
    \ context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising\
    \ solution to\nsecure the resources for the growing world population under climate\
    \ change conditions. This work\nproposes a CSA architecture for fostering and\
    \ supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as\nMixed Farming Systems (MFS),\
    \ by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of\ncrop–livestock-=forestry\
    \ combinations towards sustainable, efﬁcient and climate resilient agricultural\n\
    systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and\
    \ processing, along\nwith fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors\
    \ and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\nthe proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA,\
    \ aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests\nand crops, while mitigating\
    \ the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual\nframework.\n\

    \ Introduction\nStarvation is one of the biggest threats we are facing as humanity\
    \ in the 21st century.\nThe global demand for food is increasing, with recent\
    \ studies forecasting that the global\npopulation will reach 9.5 billion people\
    \ by 2050 [1], and more than 80% of available land\nis already cultivated [2].\
    \ Global demand for farming products is expected to increase\nby 70% for food\
    \ production [3] and double for livestock products by 2050 [4]. However,\nagricultural\
    \ production is strongly affected by the changes in climate conditions, such as\n\
    rising temperatures [5], changing rainfall regimes [6] and variations in the frequency\
    \ and\nintensity of extreme climatic events such as ﬂoods and droughts [7]. The\
    \ estimated impacts\nof the climate change indicates that the yield loss could\
    \ be up to 35% for rice, 20% for\nwheat, 50% for sorghum, 13% for barley and 60%\
    \ for maize [8], and livestock production\nwill be also negatively affected [4].\n\
    Both farmers and breeders need to ﬁnd efﬁcient and affordable methods in order\
    \ to\nstrengthen the resilience of agriculture and livestock farming against climate\
    \ change. The\nTelecom 2021, 2, 52–74. https://doi.org/10.3390/telecom2010005\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom\nTelecom 2021, 2\n53\nconcept of Climate-Smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSA) reﬂects an ambition to improve the resilience\nof agricultural\
    \ systems against climate change [9–11]. The Food and Agriculture Organiza-\n\
    tion (FAO) of the United Nations deﬁnes CSA as agriculture that enhances productivity,\n\
    improves resilience, reduces greenhouse gases (GHG) and facilitates the achievement\
    \ of\nnational food security and development goals [9]. The CSA includes both\
    \ traditional and\ninnovative approaches; and technologies that promote agricultural\
    \ productivity, increase\nthe stability at the farm level and foster the sustainability\
    \ of the relevant value chains [11].\nA system that adopts the concept of CSA\
    \ is expected to increase its resilience against\nﬂuctuating climate conditions\
    \ and therefore offer increased food production in the face of a\nchanging climate\
    \ and increased climate variability, while improving nutritional outcomes\nand\
    \ reducing the carbon cost of farming and its contribution to GHG emissions [12–15].\n\
    It includes three major pillars: (a) increasing agricultural productivity; (b)\
    \ increasing\nadaptive capacity at multiple scales (from farm to nation); and\
    \ (c) reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions [12]. While there is a consensus on the\
    \ potential of the CSA to support\nglobal food and nutritional security in less-favored\
    \ conditions [11–13], CSA scholars have\ndifferent perspectives when approaching\
    \ the scaling of CSA options.\nIntegrated systems can combine crop production,\
    \ livestock and forestry, supporting\nthe production of at least three types of\
    \ product from the same land area over a deﬁned\nperiod [16–18]. These systems,\
    \ based on inter-cropping, succession and/or rotation, can\noptimize the biological\
    \ cycling of nutrients between plants and animals, and maintain long-\nterm soil\
    \ fertility [19–21]. According to the FAO, Mixed Farming Systems (MFS) are deﬁned\n\
    as farming systems managed by households and/or enterprises where crop cultivation\
    \ and\nlivestock rearing together form integrated components of a single farming\
    \ system. MFS\noffer a lot of advantages, such as efﬁcient use of resources by\
    \ using crops and grassland to\nfeed animals and fertilize their ﬁelds with manure\
    \ from the animals, complementarities\nbetween crops and livestock and a ﬂexibility\
    \ that allows the adjustment of crop/livestock\nratios in anticipation of risks,\
    \ opportunities and needs [19,22,23]. Such context-relevant\nintegration of crops\
    \ and animals in the same system appears to support a biological,\necological\
    \ and economic sustainability in the global food production chain [17,18,23].\n\
    Nevertheless, MFS is not a universal panacea. The economic results of MFS are\
    \ not as\noptimal as those of dedicated systems, especially considering the remuneration\
    \ of labor.\nThis is the reason why MFS are usually established in less-favored\
    \ areas, e.g., mountains or\nsloppy areas, rough landscapes and heterogeneous\
    \ terrains, where conventional farming\nor breeding does not usually take place\
    \ [24]. In order to achieve a satisﬁed level of sustain-\nability under these\
    \ conditions, MFS should be able to effectively monitor the farm area, the\nanimals\
    \ and the grasslands. That is a difﬁcult task, as MFS are extremely complex systems\n\
    that include interactions between climate and weather, surface and sub-surface\
    \ soil, crops,\npastures, animal production and human management with economic\
    \ components [25].\nCritical features such as income stability and sustainability\
    \ need special quality dimensions,\ncriteria and indicators for the evaluation\
    \ of trans-disciplinary processes [26]. Moreover,\nthe climate, through weather\
    \ patterns, as time progresses, play a decisive role, as rainfall\nand temperature\
    \ drive the productivity, proﬁtability and environmental health of the\nsystem.\
    \ In addition, there is a need for reducing the energy needed to maintain the\
    \ MFS\noperation. Another challenge is related to the role of research on MFS\
    \ and the need for\nmulti-disciplinary knowledge integration. A lack of integration\
    \ between the research of\ndifferent disciplines, such as agronomists, veterinarians\
    \ and social scientists, limits the\nnecessary integral vision and makes MFS difﬁcult\
    \ to implement [27]. Moreover, science\nlacks inﬂuence mainly because of biases\
    \ towards academic research rather than practical\napplications [28]. It should\
    \ be noticed, however, that this lack of knowledge integration\nis not always\
    \ the case. There are countries that present signiﬁcant progress in integrated\n\
    farming systems from both practical and research perspectives [18]. The complexity\
    \ of\nusing MFS is increased when combining crop and livestock production due\
    \ to the increase\nof the management demands of organizing multi-tasking activities.\
    \ Considering that\nﬁnding reliable labor with the required skills in specialized\
    \ farming systems is difﬁcult\nTelecom 2021, 2\n54\nenough [29]; the problem becomes\
    \ even more acute in a diversiﬁed farming system that\nrequires the aggregation\
    \ of various kind of knowledge and skills. Additionally, for a mixed\nfarming\
    \ system, the bureaucratic and administrative workload, which requires expertise\n\
    that especially older farmers do not possess [29], is expected to increase compared\
    \ to a\nspecialized farm.\nThe success of MFS depends heavily on the aggregation\
    \ of data, which is either\nproduced by or affects the MFS, given that new technologies\
    \ and solutions are effectively\napplied in order to collect, process and use\
    \ it during decision making [30]. Precision\nagriculture is a method in which\
    \ farmers optimize inputs such as water and fertilizer\nto enhance productivity,\
    \ quality and yield. The fact that farmers are more precise with\nplanting, harvesting,\
    \ fertilizing leads to higher efﬁciency and productivity of the farm while\necological\
    \ standards are respected [31]. Today, mobile applications [32], smart sensors\
    \ [33],\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [34], cloud computing [35] and edge computing\
    \ [31]\nmake precision agriculture possible for farming cooperatives. It goes\
    \ without saying that\nthe implementation of MFS requires extended technological\
    \ features, such as sophisticated\nequipment, extended monitoring range, real-time\
    \ processing capabilities and specialized\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI) models.\n\
    Although precision agriculture is characterized by high complexity and depends\n\
    heavily on cutting edge technologies, it constitutes a method that soon or later\
    \ is going\nbe used across the globe. Developed countries, such as USA, Australia,\
    \ Canada and\nsome European countries, including Germany, Finland, Sweden and\
    \ Denmark, have\nmade signiﬁcant progress towards this area and already show some\
    \ level of adoption\nof precision agriculture [36]. In developing countries instead,\
    \ the acquisition of cutting\nedge technologies and the lack of suitable infrastructure\
    \ constitute major impediments\nto precision agriculture exploitation. Although\
    \ precision agriculture, as it can be found\nin North America, Australia and Europe,\
    \ differs considerably in developing countries,\nthe need for accurate data and\
    \ targeted interventions is actually greater there, due to the\nstronger imperative\
    \ for change and the lack of resources [37]. What is really encouraging is\nthat\
    \ over the past few years there has been considerable effort from developing countries\n\
    to use some kinds of precision agriculture methods in various applications, such\
    \ as yield\nmonitoring and tractor auto guidance [36].\nIn developing countries,\
    \ MFS play an important role, as in some cases they act as\nthe backbone of a\
    \ sustainable agricultural policy, especially for individual farmers or\nsmall\
    \ farming communities [38]. During the last decades, research efforts in various\n\
    developing countries have been redirected to integrated farming systems rather\
    \ than\ndedicated ones, so as to cover several complementary enterprises under\
    \ various agro-\necological situations [39–41]. These efforts revealed that integrated\
    \ farming systems can not\nonly be proﬁtable and productive but also eco-friendly,\
    \ a countermeasure to unemployment\nand provide ﬁnancial stability to the stakeholders\
    \ [42].\nDesigning and applying integrated farming systems has severe constraints.\
    \ Towards\nthe technological direction, a severe constraint is the lack of long-term,\
    \ structured, concrete\ndata [43]. In the best scenarios so far, end users’ actions\
    \ heavily depend on short-term,\nbiased data. As a result, data analytic services\
    \ fail to operate on a larger scale since they\nare highly affected by area peculiarities\
    \ and seasonality [44]. That explains the fact that\ndifferent frameworks and\
    \ assessment schemes result in contradictory outcomes. Examining\nMFS implementations\
    \ in view of the end-user, a new kind of barrier that lies in farmers’\nwillingness\
    \ to cooperate, emerges. This barrier goes beyond technical solutions, adding\
    \ a\nsocio-economic dimension to the widespread exploitation of MFS.\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ architecture aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-\noriented\
    \ architecture, for advancing the current farming system to a smart, resilient\
    \ and\nintegrated/mixed farming ecosystem, aiming at increasing the resilience\
    \ of the underlying\nfarms, crops, livestock and forestry against the negative\
    \ impacts of the climate change.\nMoreover, the proposed architecture envisions\
    \ to foster cooperation between farmers and\nbreeders through the provision of\
    \ a sustainable MFS reference model.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n55\nThe remaining paper\
    \ is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights the current state-of-\nthe-art.\
    \ Section 3 presents the MiFarm-CSA architecture thoroughly; it illustrates the\
    \ four\nlayers of the architecture and delves into them in each of the subsections.\
    \ Section 4 outlines\nthe beneﬁts of the proposed architecture. In Section 5 the\
    \ conclusions are summarized.\n2. Related Work\nCurrent section reﬂects the current\
    \ state of the art in integrated agricultural systems\nfrom technological, economic\
    \ and social perspectives. It also points out current weaknesses\nthat tend to\
    \ be exacerbated due to the high complexity of a MFS.\n2.1. Data Aggregation Systems\n\
    Improving mixed farm productivity is essential for increasing farm proﬁtability\
    \ and\nmeeting the rapidly growing demand for food that is fueled by rapid population\
    \ growth\nacross the world and decreasing demand for energy. Mixed-farm productivity\
    \ can be\nincreased by understanding and forecasting crop and livestock performance\
    \ in a variety of\nenvironmental, social and ecological conditions. Both crop\
    \ and livestock recommendations\nare currently based on data collected in ﬁeld-based\
    \ agricultural studies that capture perfor-\nmance under a variety of conditions\
    \ (e.g., soil quality, diseases, environmental conditions,\netc.). The quality\
    \ of manually collected performance data is very low, because it does not\ntake\
    \ into account earlier conditions that have not been observed by the human operators,\n\
    but it is essential to ﬁlter out collected data that will lead to invalid conclusions.\
    \ Further-\nmore, due to MFS, we must increase the volume of data, the number\
    \ of the sources and the\nenergy demands for efﬁcient communication, consequently\
    \ increasing the complexity of\nthe data gathering process exponentially. To this\
    \ end, the utilization of emerging technolo-\ngies such as IoT devices, ground\
    \ sensors, livestock sensors (collars/ear-tags), multispectral\ncameras and UAVs\
    \ for data gathering purposes, is quite mature nowadays, and they can\nbe used\
    \ to collate vast amounts of environmental and crop-livestock performance data,\n\
    ranging from time series data from sensors, to spatial data from cameras, to human\
    \ obser-\nvations collected and recorded via smart applications [45]. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ their beneﬁts\nare extended in the whole spectrum of the agricultural ecosystem.\
    \ Their deployment\ndecreases the farmer’s labor tasks, facilitating his daily\
    \ routine and making resource alloca-\ntion more efﬁcient. Moreover, the quality\
    \ and quantity of data are improving and being\nenriched respectively, providing\
    \ insights that enhance productivity while sustainable and\neco-friendly processes\
    \ are identiﬁed and fostered. Precision agriculture and data analytics\nare reshaping\
    \ industry and market boundaries and interactions, with precision agricul-\nture\
    \ technologies (data holding, data specialization, data strategy) being a combination\n\
    of: Global Positioning System (GPS), sensors mounted on farm machines or standalone,\n\
    geo-mapping, automatics steering systems, electronic communications and variable\
    \ rate\ntechnologies [46]. Increasing UAVs’ obligations results in a higher energy\
    \ consumption, a\nfact that could disrupt the sustainability and eventually the\
    \ viability of the system [47]. In-\ntelligent devices are deployed to collect\
    \ specialized data and provide valuable information.\nSuch devices are photonics\
    \ which are utilized for monitoring and predicting the ripening\nprocess and quality\
    \ of produce, ear-tags that gather information about animals’ nutrition\nand multi-spectral\
    \ cameras that collect images in different spectrums. The incorporation\nof such\
    \ devices intensiﬁes data diversity, raising concerns about interoperability between\n\
    the physical components, data processing and information integration capabilities\
    \ [48].\nObviously, these new trends on the one hand manage to handle some of\
    \ the MFS concerns,\nbut on the other hand reveal new challenges that need to\
    \ be addressed.\n2.2. Socio-Technical and Socio-Economic Modeling\nModeling and\
    \ simulation tools can help in identifying opportunities for improved\nresource\
    \ management, crop production and farm system sustainability. Modeling tools may\n\
    also be used to predict the longer-term effects of suggested interventions and\
    \ technologies\nand to enhance the understanding of their impacts [49]. One such\
    \ tool developed in the\nTelecom 2021, 2\n56\ncontext of African smallholder farmers\
    \ is the integrated crop-livestock model NUANCES-\nFARMSIM [50]. Agricultural\
    \ Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is the most used\nsimulator for agriculture\
    \ proposes. Since 1990, it has grown from a ﬁeld-focused farming\nsystems framework\
    \ used by a small number of people, into a large collection of models\nused by\
    \ thousands of modelers internationally. In this vein, APSIM Initiative is developing\n\
    the next generation of APSIM [51].\nFRAM and STAMP represent the current state-of-the-art\
    \ for socio-technical model-\ning [52]. Both are deliberately lacking theoretical\
    \ background about socio-technical system\ndynamics. Thus, the structure of modeling\
    \ and inquiry is retrospective [53–55]. They are\nhindered in their utility and\
    \ applicability by this theoretical vacuum. New methods are\nneeded which are\
    \ situated in a well-considered and thought-out theoretical landscape and\nwhich\
    \ are based on evidence [56,57].\nRecent literature suggests that understanding\
    \ and considering the role of behav-\nioral factors in farmers’ adoption of sustainable\
    \ practices can help enrich the traditional\neconomic analysis of farmers’ decision-making\
    \ [58]. Within this literature, there is a bur-\ngeoning stream investigating\
    \ the role of behavioral factors. Pre-testing the impacts of\nthese behavioral\
    \ factors on farmers’ decision making can, in turn, lead to more effective\nagro-environmental\
    \ policies, a crucial challenge in view of the enhanced environmental\nand climate\
    \ ambitions for the future Common Agricultural Policy [59,60].\nMoreover, economic\
    \ experiments can be used effectively to improve the design and\nimplementation\
    \ of agriculture policy and programs. Recent developments have raised\nconﬁdence\
    \ in experiments as a useful tool for economic and policy analysis [61,62]. Beyond\n\
    their role in reshaping how economic research is conducted, social science experiments\
    \ have\nbeen used extensively to inﬂuence the designs of both markets and public\
    \ policies [63–65].\nObservation of behavior in a lab is convenient and affords\
    \ a high degree of control over\nthe environment, but the contexts of the laboratory\
    \ and the participants are in many ways\ndissimilar to those in naturally occurring\
    \ environments [66,67].\n2.3. MFS Integration Analysis and Evaluation\nMFS are\
    \ considered efﬁcient designs for sustainable, ecologically-based farming sys-\n\
    tems. The sustainability of MFS relies on the complementarities between crops,\
    \ livestock\nand forestry, and the exchange of resources within them. Not many\
    \ studies are available\nfrom the last years in integrated systems, especially\
    \ those involving all sectors of crops,\nlivestock and forestry together. Two\
    \ use cases were presented in [68], involving crops,\nanimals and grasslands in\
    \ France and Brazil. In [69] is an integration of crops and livestock\napproach,\
    \ which helps farmers to develop a broader understanding of systemic interactions\n\
    between crop and livestock activities on their farms. In [70] the authors presented\
    \ a compre-\nhensive assessment of all integrated systems identiﬁed in Mato Grosso\
    \ by 2012/13. Despite\nthe beneﬁts associated with MFS, little is known about\
    \ these systems or the challenges of\nimplementing them, and only a limited number\
    \ of farmers have adopted them so far.\n2.4. Knowledge-Based Management System\
    \ in Agriculture\nAlthough some work exists in knowledge-based management and\
    \ information sys-\ntems in the agricultural domain, none of it corresponds to\
    \ Mixed Farming Systems. GECO\nis presented in [71], which allows users formalize\
    \ knowledge in a collaborative manner and\nto make it available to a large community.\
    \ In [72] the authors propose a knowledge-based\nmanagement system for exchanging\
    \ and creating knowledge in organic farming. Smart-\nAKIS [73] is a European network\
    \ mainstreaming smart farming technologies among the\nEuropean farmer community,\
    \ aiming to bridge the gap between practitioners and research\non the identiﬁcation\
    \ and delivery of new smart farming solutions to ﬁt the farmers’ needs.\n2.5.\
    \ MFS Services\nDespite the renewed interest in MFS, these systems are facing\
    \ a number of barriers\nand are still declining worldwide, representing about\
    \ 14% of agricultural systems all over\nTelecom 2021, 2\n57\nthe world. The level\
    \ of specialization depends on economic context, labor availability\nand pedo-climatic\
    \ conditions. Despite their theoretical sustainability performance, MFS\nhave\
    \ been disappearing at the farm level. This could be partly explained by their\
    \ low\neconomic performance and social (work) constraints. First of all, MFS are\
    \ not achieving\nequally good economic results to specialized farms. According\
    \ to Farm Accountancy\nData Network (FADN) [74] data, the average productivity\
    \ of mixed farms, in terms of\noutput/input economic value ratio, is comparable\
    \ to the productivity of all European\nfarms. The efﬁciency in input is comparable\
    \ between mixed farming and all types of\nfarms. Still, the income per worker\
    \ in mixed farms remained below the EU-27 average.\nMoreover, direct payments\
    \ represent a substantial part of farm net value added for grazing\nlivestock,\
    \ and mixed and ﬁeld crop farms, due to their average farm size and the historical\n\
    orientations of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [75].\n2.6. Decision Support\
    \ Systems in Agriculture\nDSS tools are divided into four categories in terms\
    \ of applications: animals and animal\nproducts, land water and environment, crop\
    \ and agribusiness and markets. Examples of\ncrop DSS are MyCrop, ROOTMAP, Yield\
    \ Calculator and SPLAT. For management problems\nin farms, intelligent DSS in\
    \ agriculture have been introduced to monitor and to assist\nfarmers to make decisions\
    \ in a timely manner. However, designing a DSS is quite complex\nand requires\
    \ knowledge from various multidisciplinary areas. Adinarayana et al. [76]\nproposed\
    \ an information, communication and dissemination system called GeoSense. The\n\
    system was designed to help in decision making for precision farming. Other work\
    \ by\nTamayo et al. [77] implemented a DSS for fertilization, crop growth control\
    \ and prediction\nof diseases. Only two types of sensors, temperature and humidity,\
    \ were utilized in their\nsystem. Jiber, Harroud and karmouch [78] focused their\
    \ study on designing a precision\nagricultural monitoring framework. However,\
    \ this study was limited as it did not use test\nbeds to evaluate the performance\
    \ of their monitoring systems. Aiello, Giuseppe et al. [79]\nproposed a methodological\
    \ approach using a majority rule and bioeconomy strategies that\nimplements a\
    \ decision fusion algorithm which allows one to make the decisions about\nthe\
    \ possible risk of pest disease on the basis of the information (dew point temperature,\n\
    leaf temperature, etc.) collected from all sensors of the network. Grigera, Julian\
    \ et al. [80]\npresented three different usability evaluations: a heuristic evaluation,\
    \ a user test and an\nautomated diagnosis, based on 244 farmers and advisors in\
    \ UK, and concluded that the\nmost inﬂuential factor is the “ease to use a DSS”.\n\
    3. MiFarm-CSA Architecture\nMFS is characterized by multiple instances of crops,\
    \ livestock and forestry, which\nmay be in small or large geographical areas.\
    \ Currently, MFS is not characterized by\nintense use of information and communication\
    \ technologies (ICT) and where it exists, it\nis only used separately per farm\
    \ or livestock level. In addition, current approaches are\neither very simplistic,\
    \ omitting important aspect of MFS, or rather complex, making them\nimpossible\
    \ to implement, which generate drawbacks in management and at the economical\n\
    level that prevent farmers from adopting MFS. MiFarm-CSA envisions to constitute\
    \ an\noverall architecture that facilitates data exchange and integration in one\
    \ platform which\nis delivered to the end users as a service, supporting several\
    \ ICT deployments in crops,\nlivestock and forestry, regardless of their geographical\
    \ location. This approach is aiming\nto leverage MFS and improve in economic,\
    \ social and environmental indicators. Figure 1\nillustrates the MiFarm-CSA view\
    \ of MFS against the current state.\nThe proposed architecture follows a layered\
    \ approach since it offers a lot of beneﬁts in\ncomparison with a non-layered\
    \ one. These beneﬁts are summarized below:\n•\nEasier to understand: architecture\
    \ will be easier to understand, not only for the\narchitects who designed it,\
    \ but also for the technicians who are going to build and\nmaintain it and for\
    \ the people who are going to participate in it.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n58\n•\nEasier\
    \ to test: having a layered architecture makes it possible to deﬁne independent\n\
    components much better, which makes component testing easier.\n•\nEasier to extend:\
    \ adding new features or changing current ones is easier in a layered\narchitecture.\n\

    \ MiFarm-CSA concept.\nIn particular, the proposed architecture consists of four\
    \ main layers:\nIntegrated Data Collection Network: In detail, the Integrated\
    \ Data Collection Network\n(IDCON) applies to the area of MFS, to monitor any\
    \ type of crops; livestock and forestry;\nand climate and soil parameters. More\
    \ speciﬁcally, this tier exploits a wide range of Internet\nof Things (IoT) sensors,\
    \ devices, gateways and servers, UAVs and FANETs, which are\ncapable of covering\
    \ large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data in near real time,\nsuch\
    \ as information about the temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, pH, dissolved\n\
    oxygen levels, temperature, conductivity, etc. IDCON encloses four main tools,\
    \ namely,\nthe data capturing and recording system, which includes the smart sensing\
    \ and tracking\nsensors, the aerial sensing systems and the weather and climate\
    \ control systems; the energy\nmanagement and harvesting system (EMHS); the semantic\
    \ middleware and gateways\n(SMG); and cloud-based event and data analytics (CEDA)\
    \ which includes the livestock\nfarm management system and the cloud application.\n\
    The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework: The second layer concerns the MiFarm-\n\
    CSA Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework (SECF) which aims to support sophisticated\n\
    capabilities such as integrated farming to yield forecasts, and optimization of\
    \ crop man-\nagement in terms of fertilization, irrigation and sowing density,\
    \ while at the same time\nTelecom 2021, 2\n59\nproviding social learning modules,\
    \ in a user-friendly way, thinking skills, virtual scenarios,\ncase studies and\
    \ long-term predictions, estimations and business-oriented best practices\nbased\
    \ on the input received from the underlying MiFarm-CSA IDCON layer.\nThe Mixed\
    \ Farming as a Service: The top layer of the architecture is the Mixed Farming\n\
    as a Service (MFaS) which provides a set of advanced and efﬁcient user applications\n\
    and services destined to farmers and stakeholders. More speciﬁcally, the MFaS\
    \ encloses\neight main applications, namely: Resource Managers (ReMa), Integrated\
    \ Irrigation and\nFertilization Application (IFRA), Anomaly and Pest Detection\
    \ Tool (APED), Novel Climate\nService and Application (NCSA), Digital Market Radar\
    \ (DiMaRa), Web-based Knowledge\nExchange Service (W-KES) and Integrated Farming\
    \ Systems Economics (IFSEC).\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology: The last\
    \ layer concerns the MiFarm-CSA\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology (EVAM),\
    \ which serves as an horizontal layer\nthat covers all the other layers, as the\
    \ socio-economic aspects should be taken into account\nduring all steps of the\
    \ development of MFS. EVAM layer includes the SCOPE methodology\nfor examining\
    \ and creating dynamic process maps focusing on process functionality, social\n\
    cohesion and the mediation of collective knowledge and information cycles. A further\n\
    element of this approach is the social license to operate (SLO) concept. This\
    \ concept relates\nto the continued acceptance of a set of business practices\
    \ or operating procedures by a\ncompany’s employees, stakeholders and the general\
    \ public. In addition, in this layer the\nbehavioral decision-making is also taken\
    \ into account as it is a method to inﬂuence the\nfarmers to adopt environmentally\
    \ suitable practices.\nTable 1, provides brief deﬁnitions of the concepts, technologies\
    \ and practices used in\nMiFarm-CSA architecture.\n3.1. Integrated Data Collection\
    \ Network\nThe provision of an advanced data collection network and autonomous\
    \ monitoring is\na major pillar of MiFarm-CSA, which is realized by the IDCON.\
    \ Figure 2 illustrates IDCON,\nwhich aims at designing and deploying the technology\
    \ means that will allow MiFarm-CSA\nto measure data from different farming systems,\
    \ e.g., forests, crops and livestock, and\nto expand the capability of the MFS\
    \ in rough and slope terrains and in large-scale lands.\nIDCON encloses six cutting-edge\

    \ at a low bit rate among things,\nsuch as sensors operated on a battery.\nGeographic\
    \ Information System\nA conceptualized framework that provides the\nability to\
    \ capture and analyze spatial and geographic data.\nInitially, the data capturing\
    \ and recording takes place by using the SST, ASSM and\nWCCF. SST includes electronic\
    \ sensors (passive and active wireless sensor devices) for\nenvironmental monitoring\
    \ (quality of water, soil, air and nutrition concentration), phyto-\nelectronic\
    \ sensors for measuring environmental and soil changes via metabolic changes\n\
    in plants (e.g., pH level and phytohormones) and soil-derived GHG emissions sensors\n\
    that measure the effects of regenerative grazing regime and mixed farming practices\
    \ on\nGHG losses. In addition, low-cost IoT-enabled GHG sensors are utilized for\
    \ measuring\nthe effects of emissions on local and regional levels. Since animal\
    \ tracking is of paramount\nimportance in any MFS, specialized IoT devices (e.g.,\
    \ collars and ear-tags) are also utilized\nfor locating, monitoring and managing\
    \ livestock. Beyond the conventional information\nsuch as (i) location, (ii) motion,\
    \ (iii) temperature and (iv) animal behavior, collars and\near-tags can show (i)\
    \ the areas of the farm that have been most frequently occupied and (ii)\nthe\
    \ history of the areas where the animals have been grazing. As a result, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    architecture is able to boost feed efﬁciency, increase food quality, mitigate\
    \ risks regarding\nthe animal loss, decrease the stakeholder’s expenses and increase\
    \ his income.\nSince the beginning of the development of new generations of UAVs,\
    \ these platforms\nwere considered a well suited tool, under different conﬁgurations,\
    \ in agriculture, livestock\nand forestry because of their potential (size, weight,\
    \ ﬂight speed and altitude) [81]. ASSM\nprovides a sophisticated technology by\
    \ deploying single UAVs or groups of UAVs (FANETs)\nfor implementing several monitoring\
    \ and surveillance activities in the crops, livestock and\nTelecom 2021, 2\n61\n\
    forests [82]. The UAVs can be equipped with (i) multispectral sensors, (ii) hyperspectral\n\
    sensors, (iii) thermal sensors, (iv) cameras and (v) GPS. The information is gathered\
    \ by\nscanning crops, livestock and forest landscapes. In particular, by scanning\
    \ the crops,\nASSM will acquire (i) soil and ﬁeld analysis, (ii) crop monitoring,\
    \ (iii) yield estimation\n(iv) bidirectional reﬂectance properties of plant surfaces,\
    \ (v) health of plants (leaf area\nindex, chlorophyll content, water stress detection,\
    \ photosynthesis soil analysis) and (vi)\nsoil composition in agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ to estimate crop yields based on the computation of\nvegetation indices in farmlands\
    \ [83]. By scanning livestock, ASSM will be able to gather\ninformation related\
    \ to (i) counting animals; (ii) locations of animals; (iii) animal temperature;\n\
    (iv) body condition scoring; (v) number of newly born animals; (vi) disease detection\
    \ and\nanimal identiﬁcation using radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID). Lastly,\
    \ ASSM will be\ncapable of monitoring forests in terms of (i) carbon sequestration,\
    \ (ii) tree canopy analysis,\n(iii) conservation features, (iv) monitoring biodiversity,\
    \ (v) ecological landscape features\nand (vi) plant and tree health. As a result,\
    \ ASSM constitutes a powerful information\ngathering tool, which offers advanced,\
    \ real-time data collection and measurements tool,\nwhile expanding the monitored\
    \ landscape, thereby allowing the development of MFS in\nrough areas. ASSM is\
    \ expected to contribute to the resilience increase through instant\nmacroscopic\
    \ data gathering which enhances decision making, while reducing the cost\n(labor\
    \ cost and data acquiring) of current solutions, e.g., ground surveying. Furthermore,\n\
    based on technological advances such as edge computing, the ASSM can incorporate\n\
    on-board, real-time video analyzers which enable the autonomous and dynamic ﬂight\n\
    control of UAV according to the results of video surveillance output. As a result,\
    \ the time\nneeded for scanning an area will be highly reduced, allowing MiFarm-CSA\
    \ to expand the\nscalability of the monitored landscape.\nWCCF can further extend\
    \ the information provided to the MFS by including satellite,\nmeteorological\
    \ and climate-related information. Satellite-derived measurements are es-\nsential\
    \ inputs to monitor water management and agricultural production for improving\n\
    regional food security [84]. Observations coming from near real-time satellites\
    \ can be used\nto mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme events and promote climate\
    \ resilience.\nMiFarm-CSA architecure can beneﬁt from energy harvesting techniques\
    \ in the op-\neration of SST to reduce the environmental impact of farming. The\
    \ optimal “energy\nmanagement” policy can be deﬁned based on existing machine\
    \ learning (ML) models and\nAI algorithms [85].\nConsidering data storage and\
    \ transfer, middleware software and the necessary hard-\nware gateways and actuators\
    \ are needed for storing and forwarding the captured data.\nThe SMG component\
    \ provides the necessary middleware software and gateway infras-\ntructure to\
    \ support IDCON by gathering all kinds of information from different sources.\n\
    The middleware should able to abstract the heterogeneity and complexity of the\
    \ under-\nlying hardware devices, appliances or unmanned vehicles (data transmission\
    \ formats,\nmanufacturer particular features, operating systems, etc.) and to\
    \ provide inter-operability\namong sensors, robots and smart devices. Reliability\
    \ in communications, real-time data\ndistribution, automatic discovery of entities\
    \ and quality of service (QoS) monitoring is\nguaranteed by the middleware itself.\n\
    The CEDA component provides the data collection and processing system that is\n\
    carried through into distributed computing systems and clusters for real-time\
    \ processing.\nTo this end, robust data analytics, high performance computing,\
    \ efﬁcient data network\nmanagement and cloud computing (CC) techniques are used\
    \ [86]. More speciﬁcally, the\nmain pillars are (i) the integration of data that\
    \ originate from different sources via a\ncommon communication point, and (ii)\
    \ the provision of suitable adaptive algorithms for\neffective, dynamic and autonomous\
    \ decision-making. Taking into account the massive and\nheterogeneous characteristics\
    \ of data, acquiring and processing all of it is inefﬁcient in terms\nof communication\
    \ cost, computing complexity and the utilization of data storage resources.\n\
    For this reason, dimensionality reduction should provide a reduced version (sketch)\
    \ of\noriginal data taking into account the speciﬁc characteristics of the data\
    \ generated.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n62\nThe Panoptis platform consists of hardware\
    \ add-ons (collars and ear-tags) and soft-\nware modules that provide tools to\
    \ livestock farmers so as to locate and monitor livestock.\nThe platform allows\
    \ one to generate many types of enclosures, sub-areas and points of\ninterest.\
    \ This allows one to have records and monitoring of animal behavior in these enclo-\n\
    sures. The challenge in this component lies in the integration of information\
    \ when received\nfrom different sources: (a) IoT devices mounted on animals; (b)\
    \ satellite information about\npastures; (c) weather forecast; (d) soil sensors,\
    \ in a DSS to improve grazing management.\nThe interconnection between the data\
    \ collecting and the data storing can be achieved\nthrough low power wide area\
    \ networks (LPWAN) such as LoRA and Sigfox telecom-\nmunication networks. LoRa\
    \ and Sigfox protocols are widely used for supporting smart\napplications and\
    \ monitoring systems [87].\n3.2. Evidence-Based Assessment Methodology\nEVAM is\
    \ deﬁned as a major pillar of the proposed architecture, for fostering the\ninvolvement\
    \ of end-users in the MFS landscape, consisting of the following components:\n\
    (a) (SCOPE) methodology, (b) the SLO concept, (c) the behavioral decision-making\
    \ (BDm)\nand (d) the Behavioral Intervention Engine (BIE).\nOftentimes in technology,\
    \ development projects the social, behavioral and even hu-\nman aspects of the\
    \ technology play a secondary role to the technological aspects. The\nproposed\
    \ architecture intends to use innovative human factor approaches and method-\n\
    ologies to champion social and behavioral aspects and to prioritize the role of\
    \ the human\nin the development of technology. Doing so will ensure that the implementation\
    \ will not\nencounter barriers relating to user acceptance, usability and other\
    \ human barriers. The\nstarting point involves reﬁning new methods for modeling\
    \ the socio-technical aspects\nof farming systems and to examine the social and\
    \ behavioral aspects of mixed farming\nand agroforestry. The SCOPE methodology\
    \ examines and creates dynamic process maps\nfocusing on three interlocking and\
    \ interdependent levels of analysis: (i) process function-\nality (operational\
    \ processes); (ii) social cohesion (trust and social networks); and (iii) the\n\
    mediation of (i) and (ii) through collective knowledge and information cycles\
    \ [88].\nA further element of this layer is the SLO concept. This concept relates\
    \ to the continued\nacceptance of a set of business practices or operating procedures\
    \ by a company’s employees,\nstakeholders and the general public. The concept\
    \ of social license is closely related to the\nconcept of resilience and sustainability,\
    \ and the work to deﬁne and develop the SLO in this\narchitecture will ensure\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social\nand behavioral\
    \ change.\nAccording to many MFS experts, the problems of the end users, mostly\
    \ farmers,\nare not just about knowledge: it is about building the habit of cooperating.\
    \ Over the\nlast few decades, researchers have increasingly studied the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence farmers’\nadoption of environmentally sustainable practices [89].\
    \ Previous academic attempts to\ntake stock of the factors inﬂuencing farmers’\
    \ adoption of sustainable practices [90] did\nnot speciﬁcally focus on the roles\
    \ of behavioral factors, often resulting in an incomplete\noverview and limited\
    \ theoretical understanding of how and why these factors affect\ndecision-making.\
    \ There have been some efforts in policy circles to make an inventory\nof behavioral\
    \ factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption of sustainable practices, but their\ndisciplinary\
    \ scope was restricted to behavioral economics and communication sciences [91].\n\
    For this reason, MiFarm-CSA architecture introduces BDm which adopts the experimental\n\
    research concept combined with laboratory experiments in parallel. The innovation\
    \ of this\nconcept lies in the following twofold statement: (a) it evaluates ex-ante\
    \ farmers’ choices\nwhen they are faced with voluntary versus mandatory schemes\
    \ and with results based or\ncollective schemes, and (b) it includes experiments\
    \ in the ﬁeld, which are carried out to\ninform agricultural policies by including\
    \ a behavioral component, as the outcome variable\ngenerally consists of decisions\
    \ made by farmers [92,93]. To take a positive step forward,\nthe proposed architecture\
    \ is built on top of BDm the BIE. The latter aims at: (a) predicting\nthe expected\
    \ MFS-related behavior (behavioral intentions) of farmers on the basis of a\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n63\nset of socio-economic factors, (b) facilitating the selection\
    \ and application of appropriate\nstrategies through a number of communication\
    \ tools and channels and (c) driving the\ndesired MFS development widely. The\
    \ main operating elements of the BIE break down as\nfollows: farmers can be clustered\
    \ according to their (socio-demographic) proﬁles, and the\nsuitability of involvement\
    \ strategies is deﬁned both by the user proﬁle and by additional\nsocio-economic\
    \ factors (e.g., country culture). The resulting model will be used by the\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ decision support system.\n3.3. The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework\n\
    The lessons learnt and the experience of farmers stemming from the existing MFS\n\
    are of paramount importance for further development of MFS. The production of\
    \ more\nknowledge on MFS and the knowledge acquisition by farmers are both required\
    \ in order to\ndevelop sustainable, productive, viable and efﬁcient future MFS.\
    \ The SECF component of\nMiFarm-CSA architecture aims to foster core interactions\
    \ among animals, forests and crops,\nwhile mitigating the high complexity of these\
    \ interactions. SECF follows a participatory,\nlearning and technology-oriented\
    \ methodological approach based on knowledge-driven\ntools. This methodological\
    \ approach is deﬁned in ﬁve main pillars, namely, (a) the par-\nticipatory knowledge\
    \ building (PKB), (b) the mixed farming simulator (MFSim), (c) the\nexperimentally-oriented\
    \ co-design process (EC-P), (d) the peer learning network (PLN)\nand (e) decision-making\
    \ engine (D-ME).\nPKB involves the critical knowledge extraction, which encloses\
    \ the most important\nknowledge needed to support sustainable MFS. This knowledge\
    \ can be extracted from\nmeetings, seminars and workshops and recent literature\
    \ ﬁndings. The contributions of\ninternational experts who will analyze and evaluate\
    \ the current knowledge and remaining\nuncertainties about large-scale, commercial\
    \ MFS are crucial. The PLN pillar encourages\ntechnical and organizational innovation;\
    \ it enhances learning options, while reducing the\nisolated position of this\
    \ kind of system in a specialized world. The PLN could address\nMFS, by (a) identifying\
    \ learning issues, (b) supporting the exchange of (tacit) knowledge\nwithin the\
    \ network and (c) organizing access to relevant sources of knowledge outside the\n\
    peer network. The ﬁnal step of the PKB is related to the knowledge-exchange beyond\
    \ the\nPLN. The PLN ensures knowledge exchange among peers; e.g., it could also\
    \ be valuable\nthat experienced farmers and stakeholders organize access for other\
    \ actors (advisors,\nresearch and policy makers) who are interested in MFS. Field\
    \ visits, thematic networks and\ntechnological demonstrations constitute an immersive\
    \ type of learning which can enhance\nsigniﬁcantly the process of knowledge exchange.\n\
    The participatory knowledge building can be enriched with state-of-the-art technolo-\n\
    gies like virtual and augmented reality. Such technology could maximize the participants’\n\
    engagement in the training material, by fostering the motivation of end users\
    \ to be engaged\nto the PKB and the SECF activities in general.\nThe MFSim is\
    \ also introduced as another major pillar of SECF in order to mitigate\nthe complexity\
    \ of MFS. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across\n\
    disciplines and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage\
    \ is set for the\nmajor advances in agricultural systems science that are needed\
    \ for the next generation of\nmodels, databases, knowledge products and decision\
    \ support systems [49,94]. Specialized\nsimulation modeling of crop–livestock\
    \ integration among farms is the basis for achieving\nthe up-scaling process involved\
    \ in integrating beyond the farm level. Furthermore, com-\nputer simulation with\
    \ environmental-economic models at the farm level provide a useful\ntool for integrating\
    \ knowledge and information to predict production efﬁciency, environ-\nmental\
    \ impacts and the effects of management policies on production performance [95].\n\
    The MFSim is introduced as the main modeling and simulation tool of designing,\
    \ testing,\nvalidating and evaluating mixed farming modeling systems and complex\
    \ simulation sce-\nnarios. The aim of MFSim lies in the fact that it allows farmers,\
    \ stakeholders and supply\nchain actors to experiment with diversiﬁed cropping,\
    \ animal and forest systems without\nhaving to invest or risk resources. MFSim\
    \ could also enable stakeholders to (a) model\nTelecom 2021, 2\n64\nand simulate\
    \ different variations of forest-crop-livestock integrated farms, (b) model and\n\
    simulate different use of resources (nutrients, land, manure management, etc.)\
    \ and (c)\nmodel and simulate manure management practices and animal feeding.\
    \ In particular,\nMFSim could provide signiﬁcant insights in (a) simulating livestock\
    \ performance, while\ngrazing grain crops, (b) assessing diversifying crop rotations\
    \ in terms of sale and animal\nfeeding sources, (c) studying and evaluating tactical\
    \ and strategic responses to improve\nthe performance of livestock feed systems,\
    \ (d) modeling and evaluating the implications\nof grazing crops on the livestock\
    \ system as a whole, (e) analyzing and evaluating the\nproduction and economic\
    \ risk mitigation beneﬁts that arise from operating a mix of crop\nand livestock\
    \ systems, (f) evaluating recycling tactics in animal manure to fertilize crops\n\
    and (g) simulating the integration of alternate crops in the crop rotations.\n\
    The EC-P is also introduced as a component of SECF, as its aim is to motivate\
    \ farmers\nto cooperate in the knowledge exchange processes without feeling loss\
    \ of freedom and\nindependence [96,97]. The EC-P engages farmers in laboratory\
    \ and ﬁeld experiments,\nby conducting trials and demonstrations together with\
    \ the experts. In particular, during\nlaboratory experiments, the stakeholders\
    \ and the researchers can work together and see\nhow the technology will be used\
    \ in practice.\n3.4. Mixed Farming as a Service\nThe MFaS is the fourth main pillar\
    \ of MiFarm-CSA whose aim is to deliver a rich suite\nof tools and services to\
    \ the end users (farmers, agricultural companies, decision makers,\nregulators,\
    \ supply chain actors, stakeholders and individuals) in three dimensions, namely,\n\
    (a) environmental, (b) economic and (c) social. MFaS goes beyond than a conventional\n\
    toolkit for farmers; it constitutes the main decision support system of the proposed\
    \ architec-\nture. MFaS serves as an integrated management software that helps\
    \ farmers and growers\nto establish sustainable farm management practices and\
    \ reach proﬁtable crop production,\nby enclosing various applications and services\
    \ related to conventional farming systems.\nThe envisioned MFaS should support\
    \ the following MFS applications and services: (a)\nthe Integrated Farming Systems\
    \ Economics (IFSEC), (b) the W-KES, (c) the APED, (d) the\nIntegrated Irrigation\
    \ and Fertilization Application (IIFA), (e) the NCSA, (f) the Resource\nManagers\
    \ (ReMa) and (g) the DiMaRa.\nIFSEC is a critical component of MFaS, as it provides\
    \ the decision-making compo-\nnent of the proposed architecture. IFSEC analyses\
    \ existing case-studies of well-managed\nMFS; develops a labor-balanced analysis\
    \ based on farm surveys; develops participative\napproaches with groups of farmers\
    \ to consider their management strategies and develop\nscenarios; and identiﬁes\
    \ management tools to assess MFS labor requirements and associ-\nated costs so\
    \ as to facilitate integration between farms. In particular, IFSEC should abe\n\
    considered as completed when it is in such position to provide (a) advanced logistics,\
    \ (b)\nadvanced ﬁnancial management, (c) MFS management and (d) MFS visualizations.\
    \ The\nIFSEC advanced logistics could include (i) labor management, (ii) machinery\
    \ management\nand (iii) inventory management. In general, the end user should\
    \ be able to register a farm\nby adding ﬁnancial information, work task assignment\
    \ per worker and cost per worker.\nAdditionally, economic features for machinery\
    \ can be included, i.e., cost per individual\ncategory task per hour or area unit.\
    \ Reservation for a machine for speciﬁc hours and inven-\ntory management could\
    \ be available as well. The IFSEC advanced ﬁnancial management\ncould include\
    \ the management of (i) sales, (ii) expenses, (iii) assets, (iv) loans, (v) budget\n\
    and (vi) transactions. The end user should be able to register sales invoices\
    \ containing\nmultiple items, while the corresponding quantity per item will automatically\
    \ stored to the\ndeﬁned warehouse. The IFSEC MFS management could involve: (i)\
    \ crop-livestock diversi-\nﬁcation per individual ﬁeld; (ii) week, month, year\
    \ and long-term forecasting, including\ntemperature, wind speed and rainfall (mm).\
    \ Information for pests, weeds and diseases\nwith detailed descriptions and a\
    \ list with active substances which ﬁght or prevent them\ncould be included as\
    \ well. The IFSEC MFS visualizations will bring new dashboards with\nreal-time\
    \ data with predeﬁned templates like usage, productivity, ﬁnances, Key Perfor-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n65\nmance Indicators (KPIs) and ﬁeld analytics, while the MiFarm-CSA\
    \ engine will be featured\nto export a structured report in a user-friendly manner,\
    \ such as tasks, crop production,\nusage, ﬁnances, cost per task, inventory and\
    \ resources.\nThe W-KES applies a collaborative service to share knowledge, experiences\
    \ and\ninnovations among the different people involved in the design and application\
    \ of MFS\nagricultural systems. W-KES is composed by three components: (a) the\
    \ W-KES semantic\nmodel, (b) the W-KES web-based application and (c) W-KES forum.\
    \ The semantic model\nis organized in a set of triplets, “subject”, “predicate”\
    \ and “object” [98], and the triplets\nare interconnected. The main resources\
    \ of the W-KES semantic model are (a) web pages\ncreated in a collaborative manner,\
    \ (b) simulation results conducted by the MFSim, (c) best\npractices formed as\
    \ documents, stemming from the SECF and (d) educational material and\ntraining\
    \ modules coming from the PLN. These resources are associated with certain triplets;\n\
    for example, users can associate the triplet “wheat”, as “can be attacked by”:\
    \ “aphids” in a\nweb page presenting knowledge about wheat. Furthermore, the W-KES\
    \ intends to include\na knowledge search service, which allows users to query\
    \ web pages by keyword, string\nor sentence matching. For example, a user may\
    \ search for manure quality management\nfor MFS and the W-KES web-based application\
    \ will propose related web pages, material\ncontent from the PLN and best practices—extracted\
    \ from the SECF layer. Lastly, the W-KES\nweb-based application incorporates a\
    \ forum, which allows any user to share his opinion; or\nask the community about\
    \ information or a new topic that he cannot ﬁnd in another source.\nThe innovation\
    \ behind this service lies in the fact that it can also enable direct and indirect\n\
    exchange of resources like feed and manure.\nBased on the information collected\
    \ by the IDCON, The APED and the IIFA are en-\nvisaged as smart services for in-ﬁeld\
    \ operations and data analysis. According to the\ncharacteristics of plant pathogens,\
    \ efﬁcient plant disease management requires a high\ndensity of spatial and temporal\
    \ information regarding the condition of any parameter\nrelated to the crop growth\
    \ [99]. Hyperspectral images combined with ground sensors can\nidentify host–pathogen\
    \ interactions at an early stage. This fact can simplify the complexity\nof the\
    \ identiﬁcation and the quantiﬁcation of different kinds of stress factors that\
    \ may result\nin crop anomalies [100]. Moreover, data mining techniques [101]\
    \ (ML methods like artiﬁcial\nneural networks or support vector machines (SVM))\
    \ can be leveraged since they have\nproved to be superior for distinguishing in\
    \ between more than one type of stress factors\nand different diseases [102].\
    \ The integration of ground sensor data provided by SST and\nimage data provided\
    \ by ASSM in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\nand data mining\
    \ techniques will constitute the core of APED services. IIFA services besides\n\
    the integration between ground sensor data provided by SST and image data provided\
    \ by\nASSM will also incorporate data from WCCF. This holistic integration of\
    \ drought-causative\ninformation (precipitation) and drought-responsive information\
    \ (vegetation condition,\ncrop anomaly) aim to develop specialized variations\
    \ of well known vegetation indexes\n(e.g., normalized difference vegetation index)\
    \ (i) for superior drought monitoring and (ii)\nfor early indication of any decrease\
    \ in crop production associated with drought or lack of\nnutrients [103].\nA dashboard\
    \ will be the human–machine interface for delivering the information com-\ning\
    \ from the WCCF, and to make suggestions and recommendations based on the captured\n\
    satellite, meteorological and climate-related information. Concurrently, the dashboard\n\
    could also digest the information stemming from the meteorological stations, which\
    \ are\ninstalled at the ﬁeld, in order to provide short-term predictions and suggestions.\n\
    Recent political priorities in Europe aim to rationalize agricultural production,\
    \ reduce\npollution, upgrade the environment, maintain rural infrastructures and\
    \ meet new societal\nconcerns, such as product quality and animal welfare. For\
    \ example, soil testing has been\nproven to be a valuable tool for evaluating\
    \ the available nutrient status of soil. The soil\ninvestigation is exceptionally\
    \ useful for cultivators to discover which sort of harvests to\nbe developed in\
    \ a speciﬁc soil condition and helps to determine the proper amount of\nnutrients\
    \ to be added to a given soil based on its fertility and crop needs. The intensiﬁcation\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n66\nof livestock operations in the last few decades has resulted\
    \ in increased social concern over\nthe environmental impacts of livestock operations,\
    \ and thus making appropriate manure\nmanagement decisions is increasingly important.\
    \ Animal manure is a valuable resource\nif handled responsibly but a source of\
    \ serious challenges and public health concerns\nif managed inappropriately. Risks\
    \ associated with animal manure handling could be\nrelated to soil, water and\
    \ air quality. A socially acceptable manure management system\nthat simultaneously\
    \ achieves the pressing environmental objectives while balancing the\nsocio-economic\
    \ welfare of farmers and society at large is needed. Manure management\ndecisions\
    \ involve a number of decision makers with different and conﬂicting views of\n\
    what is acceptable in the context of sustainable development. In order to ensure\
    \ that\nthe proposed schema is complete, this kind of resource management can\
    \ not be ignored.\nFor this reason, MiFarm-CSA introduces ReMA includes a series\
    \ of resource managers to\nprovide the optimal and accurate resource allocation:\n\
    •\nThe Soil Manager (SOMA) aims provide optimal decisions, recommendations and\n\
    case studies on how the soil quality will be maximized. While each of these decisions,\n\
    recommendations and case studies represent possible techniques to effectively\
    \ manage\nsoil resources, each practice will be adequately assessed to identify\
    \ possible constraints\nor drawbacks.\n•\nThe Manure Manager (MAMA) aims to provide\
    \ optimal decisions, recommenda-\ntions and case studies on the manure management\
    \ in Mixed Farming Systems. The\nutilization of livestock manure to add nutrients\
    \ back to the soil is one of the key crop-\nlivestock interactions in MFS. Manure\
    \ when used as a soil amendment can beneﬁt the\nsoil, resulting in crop production\
    \ and resilience beneﬁts for smallholders via increased\nnutrient supply to crops\
    \ and improved soil structure and water holding capacity.\nManure has well-documented\
    \ impacts on soil chemical and physical properties.\n•\nThe Water Manager (WAMA)\
    \ will be able to make optimal decisions on the water\nmanagement on the MFS.\
    \ Improving water use efﬁciency and water management\non mixed farms is arguably\
    \ the most important and high potential improvement\nfor farmers to be climate-smart.\
    \ Optimal water management strategies increase net\nreturns and purchasing power\
    \ parity of households much more than any other and\nperhaps presents the only\
    \ viable pathway to help transition smallholder farmers out\nof poverty.\nDue\
    \ to the withdrawal of market intervention policies, market volatility has increased,\n\
    causing high income risk for specialized farms. Given that both global agricultural\
    \ markets\nand agricultural policies enhanced efﬁciency in producing more of a\
    \ same product, e.g.,\nfavouring economies of scale through intensiﬁcation, enlargement\
    \ and specialization,\nDiMaRa’s goal is to assist MFS to have the ﬂexibility to\
    \ face uncertain climate and market\nconditions. As a service, the DiMaRa should\
    \ be able to gather market-oriented data from\nseveral sources, while compiling\
    \ it using big data analytics for transforming it to knowledge\nand recommendations.\
    \ The purpose of DiMaRa lies in three axes:\n•\nAggregate accurate and timely\
    \ climate and market information (weather, demand,\nsupply and prices);\n•\nProcess\
    \ and analyze it in a way such that it will be transformed into usable knowledge\n\
    (intelligence) using big data analytics;\n•\nDisseminate it to mixed farming stakeholders\
    \ through web and mobile applications.\nData aggregation could encompass (i) data\
    \ from WCCF, (ii) information about the\nprices of commodities which are directly\
    \ or indirectly related to mixed farming ecosys-\ntems [104], (iii) data from\
    \ Agriculture Market Information Services (AMIS), which consti-\ntute another\
    \ source of interest with rich agriculture-related data [105] and (iv) data coming\n\
    from Google marketing tools such as Google Trends and Google Keyword Tool, which\
    \ will\nbe utilized to capture near-real time data for trends in the ﬁeld of agriculture.\n\
    Moreover, the complete MiFarm-CSA architecture with the four layers and their\n\
    interconnections is illustrated in Figure 3.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n67\nIntegrated\

    4. The Expected Beneﬁts of Mifarm-CSA Architecture\nCSA addresses the challenges\
    \ which climate change poses to agricultural production.\nMiFarm-CSA constitutes\
    \ an efﬁcient CSA-driven architecture which forms a user-oriented,\nsocial-aware\
    \ and ecological platform, deployed as a service. Its main beneﬁts are outlined\n\
    as follows:\n•\nIncreasing agricultural productivity and income while also enhancing\
    \ resilience or\nadaptation of livelihoods and ecosystems towards climate extremes.\
    \ Through the\nIDCON, SECF and MFaS layers, the proposed architecture exploits\
    \ multi-disciplinary,\non-ﬁeld and off-ﬁeld data, to train the novel DSS, thereby\
    \ enabling it to make optimal\ndecisions, which are expected to boost MFS productivity\
    \ and stakeholders’ incomes.\nMoreover, through DiMaRa, MiFarm-CSA is anticipated\
    \ to provide MFS the ﬂexibility\nto face uncertain climate and market conditions.\n\
    •\nIncreasing synergies among different farming systems by adopting new data collection\n\
    and monitoring technologies, such as smart sensors, robots, UAVs, advanced tracking\n\
    systems, long-range IoT-enabled sensors, middleware and gateways. The IDCON\n\
    layer provides the cutting-edge technologies for applications in MFS: IoT sensors,\n\
    devices, modern UAVs and FANETs, which aspire to be fully autonomous and multi-\n\
    collective, supporting, advanced processing and integration functionalities and\
    \ are\ncapable of covering large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data\
    \ in near real\ntime. The autonomy is twofold: the energy autonomy will be accomplished\
    \ by\nTelecom 2021, 2\n68\ndeploying energy harvesting techniques for recharging\
    \ sensors and UAVs and by\ndeﬁning a pilot-sensitive energy-budget approach for\
    \ each data collection technology.\n•\nSpeeding up the establishment of a community\
    \ of practice and dynamic methodology\nin designing, developing and evaluating\
    \ mixed and integrated farming systems.\nMiFarm-CSA adopts innovative human factor\
    \ approaches and methodologies to\nchampion social and behavioral aspects and\
    \ to prioritize the role of the human in the\ntechnological development. By exploiting\
    \ SCOPE in the proposed architecture, the\naim is to facilitate a comparison between\
    \ the current ways in which mixed farming\nand agroforestry are conducted and\
    \ future ways which better account for the socio-\ntechnical system as described\
    \ by SCOPE. This whole approach enables MiFarm-CSA\nto assess the inadequacies\
    \ of the current treatment of social and behavioral issues\nand ensure that the\
    \ emerged outcomes are built around the identiﬁed social and\nbehavioral aspects\
    \ of mixed farming and agroforestry. CoP will involve a multi-actor\nand trans-disciplinary\
    \ group of end users. SLO relates to the continued acceptance\nof a set of business\
    \ practices or operating procedures by a stakeholders. Moreover,\nSLO ensures\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social and\nbehavioral\
    \ change.\n•\nForming a basis for the creation of a conceptual framework to analyze\
    \ crop-livestock\nintegration by fostering core interactions among animals, grasslands\
    \ and crops, de-\nveloping metabolic analysis of material ﬂows, devising a biodiversity\
    \ approach for\nthe development of integrated crop-livestock systems and promoting\
    \ social resources\nand stakeholder interactions.\n•\nPrescribing a rich suite\
    \ of user-friendly MFS applications and services for fostering the\noptimal combination\
    \ of production, accurate climate change estimations and optimal\ndecisions on\
    \ local and national levels.\n5. Case Study\nThe proposed architecture envisages\
    \ upgrading, in terms of sustainability, areas where\ndifferent agricultural systems,\
    \ such as crops, livestock and forestry, coexist. For the purpose\nof the paper,\
    \ a case study was considered in the area of the Western Macedonia, Greece for\n\
    evaluating the components of MiFarm-CSA architecture.\nThe area of interest is\
    \ located in a region of Western Macedonia in Greece, called\nGrevena. It is a\
    \ mountainous area which is surrounded by a forest and includes a wide\nvariety\
    \ of ﬂora, including fruit trees, grapevine, berries and vegetables. Nearby the\
    \ forest,\nthere is rich livestock activity by local farmers. The main challenges\
    \ raised in this area are\nsummarized as follows:\n•\nClimate change has affected\
    \ the biodiversity of the area, having negative impacts on\nthe yield production\
    \ and the soil quality.\n•\nHigh operational and labor costs (energy needs, animal\
    \ feeding) add a lot of pressure\nto farming businesses.\n•\nThe extensive use\
    \ of chemical inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) has negatively affected\nthe\
    \ water cycle.\n•\nThe animal waste management is not sufﬁcient, leading to negative\
    \ environmental\neffects and waste of resources.\n•\nThe lack of forestry woodland\
    \ management results in high risks of things such as\nwildﬁres.\n•\nLow cooperation\
    \ between local farming businesses due to a poor local market.\n•\nA wide skill\
    \ gap between each kind of system, deteriorating the objective of collabora-\n\
    tion considerably.\n•\nTechnological deﬁciencies, as farmers are not aware of\
    \ modern monitoring and surveil-\nlance methods to reduce their labor costs.\n\
    •\nAbsence of local professional groups in MFS rules out the possibility of combining\n\
    local agricultural and livestock practices.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n69\nThese challenges\
    \ hinder the local farmers and stakeholders from further extending and\nutilizing\
    \ their resources. In addition, farmers and stakeholders are quite skeptical towards\n\
    changing—and therefore increasing their proﬁts and sustainability—to a collaborative\n\
    farming scheme such as MFS.\nWithin MiFarm-CSA, the cooperation between the forest,\
    \ the local farms and the\nlocal stakeholders will be fostered by applying the\
    \ EVAM methodology in integrating\nsustainable agriculture, livestock and forestry\
    \ combinations. The rationale behind this lies\nin products’ attractiveness (high\
    \ nutritionally valuable products, longer shelf life of dairy\nproducts), Protected\
    \ Designation of Origin (PDO) products and livestock welfare (animal\nimmunological\
    \ status enhancement and efﬁcient animal breeding systems). Through the\nIDCON\
    \ layer a variety of combinations of mixed farming solutions will be monitored,\n\
    resulting in providing valuable data that can be further analyzed to reveal interesting\n\
    correlations that would be impossible to discover otherwise. Moreover, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    using SECF and MFaS, is expected to reduce the environmental footprint of the\
    \ system,\ndecrease input and management costs and increase the system’s overall\
    \ productivity. In\ndetail, it is expected to contribute to the decrease of atmospheric\
    \ CO2 pollution and to\nthe mitigation of global warming, through the carbon sequestration\
    \ process. In order\nto achieve it, the proposed architecture will exploit forestry\
    \ and managed woodland\nin-between the cultivation and grazing lands and the livestock\
    \ wastes so as to increase\ncarbon sequestration. Moreover, an additional increase\
    \ of the total volume of woodland\nbiomass will further increase the carbon sequestration.\
    \ Furthermore, weed management\ncost is expected to decrease with the use of animal\
    \ grazing, which leads to a reduction\nof machine hours required as an indirect\
    \ measurement of fossil fuel consumption, and\nthe use of mulched woodland material\
    \ can decrease the evaporation of soil water and\nconsequently reduce the irrigation\
    \ water volume. Last but not least, the animal waste usage\nin crop cultivation\
    \ will increase its quality, decrease use of chemicals and also decrease\ntransportation\
    \ costs. Through SECF and MFaS, the mixed treatments will aim to rationalize\n\
    agricultural production; reduce pollution and protect the environment; maintain\
    \ rural\ninfrastructure; and meet emerging social concerns, such as product quality\
    \ and animal\nwelfare. Besides the increases in animal feed supply and system\
    \ productivity, which lead,\non the one hand to income increase, and on the other\
    \ hand to decreases in operational\ncosts, a positive side-effect of this collaboration\
    \ is that job opportunities are expected to\nincrease, since more disciplines\
    \ will be required to handle the system’s complexity.\n6. Conclusions\nThe food\
    \ supply chain is a key strategic sector globally, from both economic and labor\n\
    perspectives. This sector is also critical to meet the great societal challenges\
    \ of sustainable\nfarming, food security, food safety and healthy nutrition, now\
    \ and in the future, which\nconstitute without a doubt the most important priorities\
    \ for both citizens and policy makers.\nNevertheless, agriculture is at a crossroads\
    \ on a global level. The increasing digitalization\nof agricultural practices\
    \ makes it possible to produce plant and animal products with ever\nhigher efﬁciency\
    \ and ever lower environmental impact. Therefore, the agri-food sector\nis expected\
    \ to become more and more data-driven by the use of ICT, while the need for\n\
    AgTech-enabled innovation will become greater than ever. A number of technologies\n\
    not traditionally used in the agri-food sector are now starting to play a key\
    \ role in what\nis perceived as an AgTech revolution. Automation, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ drones, big\ndata and cloud analytics offer us the opportunity to further our\
    \ mastery of agriculture.\nThe Industrial Revolution 4.0 is expected to generate\
    \ disruptive changes in agricultural\npractices and pave the way for new innovative\
    \ ideas that aspire to obtain market share\nfrom a billion dollar market. This\
    \ ICT-revolution is expected to further advance and evolve\nsmart farming/smart\
    \ agriculture, including CSA and precision agriculture.\nIn this work, a multi-actor\
    \ architecture introduced as a reference for the innovative\nconcept of CSA was\
    \ applied in integrated agricultural systems, such as MFS. The proposed\narchitecture\
    \ aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-oriented architec-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n70\nture, enhanced with models, tools, frameworks and cutting-edge\
    \ solutions, for advancing\nthe current farming system to a smart, resilient and\
    \ integrated/mixed farming ecosystem,\naiming at increasing the resilience of\
    \ the underlying farms, crops, livestock and forestry\nagainst the negative impacts\
    \ of the climate change. The next step of this work is to conduct\na qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of the performance of the proposed architecture in\n\
    the two pilots, based on speciﬁc KPIs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\
    needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines\
    \ in providing\nbuildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger\
    \ population have altered the\nurban climate into unhealthy living conditions.\
    \ This situation threatens the demand for\nthe basic needs of urban dwellers for\
    \ a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a\nlarger urban population\
    \ also demands a fresh and good quality food supply [4]. Urban\nsmart vertical\
    \ farming (USVF) is one of the potential solutions to help societies meet this\n\
    elevated demand without additional farmland [5–7]. Figure 1 shows the statistical\
    \ data\nabout the use of vertical farming (VF) market in the world 2019 and 2025\
    \ respectively. In\nrecent years, the global VF market has been increasing steadily\
    \ as population sizes grow\nand urban living becomes more common in urban cities.\
    \ The VF industry reached some\n$4.4 billion in 2019, but the market size is estimated\
    \ to rise to $15.7 billion by 2025. The\nopportunity to utilize vertical space\

    \ use of the vertical farming market in the world.  \nAgriculture is humanity’s\
    \ oldest and most important economic activity, p\nus with essential food, fiber,\
    \ feed, and fuel [9,10]. As the world’s population con\nrise while land resources\
    \ remain constant, there is an increasing need to impro\ncultural productivity,\
    \ which can be achieved by a smart agriculture implementa\nproach [11–13]. Each\
    \ crop is unique and has its requirement for growth. The \nquirements for the\
    \ crops grown are suitable temperature, humidity and soil m\ncontents [14,15].\
    \ So it becomes a repetitive process for farmers to provide an id\nronment for\
    \ the crop chosen. \nNowadays, automation plays a vital role in every field of\
    \ life. Some exam\nmanufacturing, transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense,\

    \ oldest and most important economic activity, providing\nus with essential food,\
    \ ﬁber, feed, and fuel [9,10]. As the world’s population contin-\nues to rise\
    \ while land resources remain constant, there is an increasing need to improve\n\
    agricultural productivity, which can be achieved by a smart agriculture implementation\n\
    approach [11–13]. Each crop is unique and has its requirement for growth. The\
    \ basic\nrequirements for the crops grown are suitable temperature, humidity and\
    \ soil moisture con-\ntents [14,15]. So it becomes a repetitive process for farmers\
    \ to provide an ideal environment\nfor the crop chosen.\nNowadays, automation\
    \ plays a vital role in every ﬁeld of life. Some examples are\nmanufacturing,\
    \ transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense, facility operation [16,17].\
    \ The\nbeneﬁts of automation can be applied in water and wastewater, oil and gas,\
    \ electric power\nand telecommunication systems. Automation is generally used\
    \ in many ﬁelds because it\nreduces human effort, is easy to handle, and is more\
    \ effective and efﬁcient. By the name of\nagriculture, farm automation can automate\
    \ most of the agriculture ﬁelds’ processes, such\nas controlling watering systems\
    \ or ﬂow control and moisture control [18,19]. Similarly, it\ncan build a robot/drone\
    \ for spraying pesticides and plowing [20]. Harvesting machinery\nis also used\
    \ for such purposes: a user-friendly farm automation system, easy user control\n\
    for a layman, control water, plant health condition, and crop production [21].\n\
    In terms of human health, the World Health Organization estimates that more than\n\
    half of the world’s farms still use untreated animal waste as fertilizer, which\
    \ attracts ﬂies\nand may contain weed seeds or diseases that can be transmitted\
    \ to plants. VF has the ability\nto produce crops throughout the year, with greater\
    \ control over food safety and biosecurity,\nwhile also lowering inputs such as\
    \ water, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers [7]. Food\nprotection is a major\
    \ concern of our day, as there have been several incidents of events\naround the\
    \ world resulting in food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases, resulting\n\
    in billion-dollar losses. After the crop has been picked, the washing of ﬁeld-grown\
    \ items\nposes a further risk of infection from various bacteria and pathogens.\
    \ This stage, on the\nother hand, has the potential to contaminate the entire\
    \ manufacturing process [22]. While\nthe whole world is badly affected by COVID-19,\
    \ the terrible clutches of natural disasters\nstill plague many people worldwide.\

    \ climate chaos, and global epidemics; COVID-19 might be the latest\nmanifestation\
    \ of this, which has pointed to the horrible meaning of ‘global economy crisis\n\
    emergency’. Since COVID-19 will have a long-term impact, now is the time to prepare\
    \ to\nintroduce USVF.\nUSVF should become an opportunity for urban dwellers to\
    \ producing their food,\ndespite the limited agricultural land in the city center.\
    \ Integration of any available potential\nspaces inside and outside the building\
    \ by adaptive reuse and retroﬁt as part of the urban\nfarming (UF) technology\
    \ should be taken seriously and fully utilized. The design should\nconsider less\
    \ human intervention in operation due to the hectic life of urbanites. An appli-\n\
    cation of the Internet of things (IoT) can be incorporated into monitoring and\
    \ controlling in\nthe USVF system [23,24]. Thus, the UF technology can have bigger\
    \ involvement and contri-\nbution of urban dwellers. Besides producing their foods,\
    \ it contributes to the improvement\nin a healthy living environment and on urban\
    \ microclimate. UF offers an once-in-a-lifetime\nchance to grow food on already\
    \ built soil, maximize domestic food production, and reduce\nfood travel distances.\n\
    This study will include an in-depth examination of the philosophy of USVF as a\
    \ means\nof enhancing efﬁciency, including its forms, topologies, technologies,\
    \ control structures,\nsocial acceptance, and beneﬁts. This review concentrated\
    \ on a variety of issues, challenges,\nand recommendations related to the system’s\
    \ growth, vertical farming management, and\nmodern technology approach. The importance\
    \ of USVF how it plays a vital role in the\neconomy serve as the starting point\
    \ for this review. As the world’s population is growing\nday by day, there is\
    \ a need to modify those orthodox agriculture methods to fulﬁll the\nincreasing\
    \ demand for food. This modiﬁcation can be done by automating the agriculture\n\
    farm. This idea of agriculture farm automation wants to control water consumption,\
    \ the\nmoisture level of soil and water ﬂow, topologies, technologies, control\
    \ systems, social\nacceptance and enables an agricultural business to be more\
    \ productive, efﬁcient and\nproﬁtable.\n2. Types, General Structure and Materials\
    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\
    \ out in urban\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n4 of 40\nareas. However, this paradigm\

    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\

    \ The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,\nagriculture, manufacturing,\

    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\
    \ an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped,\
    \ quadrotor\nUAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application\
    \ to detect\nheight, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main\
    \ advantage of such sensors\nin SF is that they are stable, perform well, have\
    \ small defects, are easy to adapt to new\ntechnology, and they have a simple\
    \ operation.\nFigure 11 shows the smartphone applications in agriculture and the\

    4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming\nWith the development of technology and knowledge-science,\
    \ human thought-\nconsciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing.\
    \ The revolutionary\ndevelopment of life and human thought in the world over the\
    \ last few decades is far more\nexemplary than the changes in the previous few\
    \ centuries. The transformation of the\nagricultural sector, like all other sectors,\
    \ is much more pronounced. Information-driven\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n19\
    \ of 40\nadvances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the\
    \ improvement of the IoT\nand may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come\
    \ of farming [146–148]. All modern\nmethods are now being followed to ensure more\
    \ production on less land to meet the needs\nof the age, for example, IoT technology\
    \ in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT\na very modern technology\
    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\
    \ framework consists\nof six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network\
    \ layer, middleware layer,\nservice layer, analytics layer, and user experience\
    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    \ buzzer is one kind of sensor when sound is appalled, and it produces voltage.\
    \ They are utilized in many ﬁelds such as\nenergy harvesting, low power sensors,\
    \ and also SF. Its application in SF to run low-power sensors reduces the dependency\
    \ on the battery.\nElectronic speed control\n[21,194]\nConventional electronic\

    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n27 of 40\nAgriculture operates somewhat differently today than\
    \ it did a few decades before,\nprimarily due to technical advancements such as\
    \ sensors, processors, robots, and informa-\ntion technology. Agriculture now\
    \ routinely makes use of emerging technology, including\nrobotics, temperature\
    \ and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced\ntechnologies,\
    \ precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more\n\
    proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet\
    \ of things\nis to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices\
    \ such as GPS, remote\nsensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser\
    \ scanners, and networks in or-\nder to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global\
    \ things. IoT can refer to millions\nof networked embedded smart devices capable\
    \ of accumulating data about themselves,\ntheir world, and other connected smart\
    \ devices and linking this data to other devices and\nsystems through the ubiquitous\
    \ Internet [195].\nAmbient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity\
    \ are all control-\nlable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical\
    \ columns, the ambient\nparameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating\
    \ the use of a separate collection\nof sensors for each vertical stack. These\
    \ sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-\ning the use of an effective\
    \ data management system. Numerous automation techniques\nare used to maximize\
    \ resource use, including the integration of actuation by automated\nirrigation\
    \ systems, as well as wireless monitoring via IoT in the VF, which is capable\
    \ of\nmanaging sensor data effectively, identifying duplicate sensor readings,\
    \ and visualizing it\nthrough web-based applications.\n4.5. Secure Cloud on Smart\
    \ Vertical Farming System\nThe growth of a country’s population and massive industrial\
    \ development, mainly in\nurban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems,\
    \ including housing, food demands,\nschooling, health, and poverty. A new farming\
    \ technique that utilizes minimal land\narea while producing a large crop with\
    \ a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the\nauthors addressed a two-factor\
    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\
    \ system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget\n\
    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\
    \ using a 2FA mechanism. It starts\nwith the device module’s controller demanding\
    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\
    \ access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst\nauthentication\
    \ order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.\n\
    The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation\
    \ to\nthe customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before\
    \ the farming\nmodule can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order\
    \ if approved, at which\npoint TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before\
    \ the controller explicitly stops\nit. If the customer fails to authenticate,\
    \ the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics\nmodule controller is informed\
    \ of the request’s denial.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n28 of 40\nElectronics\

    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\

    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO) based\nin [107,108].\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original draft preparation,\

  explanation: "The study's purpose was to determine the effects of integrating automated\
    \ systems into the olive oil industry with IoT technology, with a specific focus\
    \ on how these systems could enhance the performance of the supply chain. \n\n\
    The authors took a methodological approach that involved data collection and analysis.\
    \ They utilized a questionnaire survey to collect data from industry experts and\
    \ respondents with knowledge of IoT integration in the industry. The data was\
    \ then analyzed using a combination of clustering and decision tree techniques.\n\
    \nThe analysis revealed that the implementation of IoT in the olive oil industry\
    \ had a positive impact on the supply chain's performance. Specifically, there\
    \ was a direct relationship between supply chain improvement through IoT implementation\
    \ and the performance of olive oil companies. The study also found that improvements\
    \ in demand planning, manufacturing, transportation, customer service, warehousing,\
    \ and inventory management all contributed to better supply chain performance.\n\
    \nThe study's authors conclude that IoT implementation is crucial for improving\
    \ supply chain performance in the olive oil industry and that it can be achieved\
    \ through enhancements in various aspects of the supply chain, including demand\
    \ planning, manufacturing, transportation, customer service, warehousing, and\

    \ the application of digital innovations to enable a company to\nmake large advancements\
    \ and to inﬂuence all aspects of clients’ and customers’ lives [1,2].\nThe ability\
    \ of businesses to participate in the so-called industrial revolution 4.0, deﬁned\n\
    by the convergence of digital, physical, and biological technology, may determine\
    \ their\nchances of surviving and competing in the global market in the medium\
    \ term [3]. At\nthe organizational level, digital transformation focuses on innovative\
    \ tactics that leverage\ndigital technology to improve and boost corporate operations\
    \ [4].\nUsing digital tools for business and process management, the manufacturing\
    \ industry\nhas experienced a digital revolution in the last few decades [5–7].\
    \ The Internet of the future\nwill be based on heterogeneous devices that will\
    \ further expand the boundaries of the\nworld’s physical and virtual entities\
    \ [8]. As a result, human intervention is not required\nto transmit these data\
    \ via computers through a network. They can form an interface with\nother operators\
    \ or machines to make the operation more efﬁcient and easier. Technology\nhas\
    \ evolved as the backbone of the industrial sector in today’s technologically\
    \ advanced\nand diverse globe. The IoT or Internet of Things is widely recognized\
    \ as a new information\ntechnology revolution, producing a paradigm shift in various\
    \ industries, including the\nentire production of supply chain management [9,10].\
    \ The IoT refers to networked comput-\ning devices, both digital and mechanical,\
    \ that use sensors linked to people and machines to\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11010271\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n2 of 22\ngenerate unprecedented volumes of valuable and\
    \ precise data about processes in order to\nimprove them [11].\nAccording to previous\
    \ research, today’s global food supply chains are highly dis-\npersed and complex,\
    \ spanning a large geographical range, involving complex operational\nprocesses\
    \ and involving many stakeholders [12,13]. Researchers claim that this complexity\n\
    leads to numerous issues with operational efﬁciency, quality management, and public\n\
    food safety. In the food supply chain, the IoT, which collects data through sensors,\
    \ has\nsigniﬁcantly affected the normal operations of supply chains [12,14].\n\
    Utilizing IoT in the food industry’s supply chain has enabled the measurement\
    \ and\nmonitoring of numerous sustainability indicators such as water efﬁciency,\
    \ crop produc-\ntivity, and the amount of fertilizer used [15,16]. The IoT has\
    \ been utilized extensively to\nfacilitate the interconnection of objects regardless\
    \ of their location to share data through-\nout the supply chain [17,18]. Perishable\
    \ food items can be tracked using radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation or RFID in the\
    \ food supply chain, including temperature monitoring during\nstorage and shipping\
    \ and the determination of shelf life. Livestock, quality control, cold-\nchain\
    \ monitoring management, supply chain management, and food traceability are other\n\
    RFID applications.\nAdopting and effectively utilizing IT is likely to increase\
    \ a company’s efﬁciency.\nWorkers must change their abilities to more analytical\
    \ and computational abilities in\nan organization. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),\
    \ machine learning, and the IoT all work together\nto support a company’s overall\
    \ growth strategy. Market organization has beneﬁted from\ntechnological advancements\
    \ because they have made it more convenient.\nAs a result, rather than changing\
    \ a single component, the entire process must be up-\ndated to achieve the result\
    \ desired from the technology. The organization must concentrate\non a competitive\
    \ strategy to avoid disruptions to the current business model. As a result\nof\
    \ technical improvements, business organizations have grown tremendously, and\
    \ these\nimprovements help to improve existing company processes and work practices.\
    \ Technolog-\nical innovation has led to the discovery of a new and more efﬁcient\
    \ manner of conducting\nbusiness, enabling companies to function more efﬁciently,\
    \ rapidly, and easily. According to\nFord, humans must also learn about the talents\
    \ of automation in order to beneﬁt from its\ncheaper costs and faster performance.\n\
    Because of the wide variety of sensors that are currently accessible, as well\
    \ as the\neven greater availability of tools based on AI solutions to analyze\
    \ the large number of\ndata collected, the possibilities for IoT applications\
    \ in the olive oil industry are almost\nlimitless. It is possible to improve supply\
    \ chain processes and control at all levels, from\nraw materials within a plant\
    \ to the distribution of products to businesses, by using IoT\ntechnologies in\
    \ agri-food industries [15,16], such as the olive oil industry. It also streamlines\n\
    the data-collecting process, assisting the olive oil sector in maintaining greater\
    \ levels of\nsafety and traceability throughout the whole supply chain, as well\
    \ as reducing costs, waste,\nand even risks.\nIt is widely accepted that the IoT\
    \ can signiﬁcantly affect industry performance from\ndifferent perspectives, such\
    \ as supply chain performance, ﬁnancial performance, and\nenvironmental performance\
    \ [19]. However, although previous studies have investigated\nthe impact of the\
    \ IoT on the performance of industries [20,21], this issue has yet to be\nexplored\
    \ in the olive oil industry. In addition, most previous studies have used old-style\n\
    mythologies to assess the IoT’s contributions to industries’ performance. Machine\
    \ learning\ntechniques have rarely been explored and implemented to ﬁnd the relationship\
    \ between\nsupply chain improvement and olive oil companies’ performance. This\
    \ problem was\ninvestigated in relation to olive oil companies in this study.\
    \ To understand the role of the\nIoT in olive oil company performance, in this\
    \ study, we aimed to develop a new model\nto investigate the factors inﬂuencing\
    \ supply chain improvement in olive oil companies.\nIn addition, through the use\
    \ of a model, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between\nsupply chain improvement\
    \ and olive oil companies’ performance. Demand planning,\nmanufacturing, transportation,\
    \ customer service, warehousing, and inventory management\nProcesses 2023, 11,\
    \ 271\n3 of 22\nwere the main factors incorporated into the proposed model. Accordingly,\
    \ a new method of\ndata analysis using machine-learning techniques was developed.\
    \ Clustering and decision\ntrees were employed in the development of the method.\
    \ The proposed model used several\nfactors discovered through a literature review.\
    \ The data for this study were collected from\nrespondents with knowledge of the\
    \ integration of new technologies into the industry. Self-\norganizing map (SOM)\
    \ clustering and decision trees were employed in the development\nof the method.\
    \ SOM has been an effective technique for data clustering. In addition, the\n\
    decision tree technique is robust for output prediction from a set of input variables.\
    \ The\nhybrid combination of these techniques was believed to accurately predict\
    \ the relationship\nbetween supply chain improvement and olive oil companies’\
    \ performance. We present the\nabbreviations used in this study in Table 1.\n\

    \ Oil Industry\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture, or IoT-based smart\
    \ agriculture, refers to\na network in which the physical components of the system\
    \ (plants and animals, production\ntools, environmental elements, and various\
    \ virtual objects) are connected to the Internet\nthrough the use of equipment\
    \ for agricultural information management under certain\nprotocols to exchange\
    \ information within different components [22,23]. Sensors made\nusing new technologies\
    \ based on the IoT are constantly being developed in the agricultural\nsector\
    \ for different purposes, driven by the development of the Internet, digital technology,\n\
    and sensing technology [24]. These sensors are moving in the direction of being\
    \ embedded,\nintegrated, intelligent, and miniaturized. The United States, Japan,\
    \ and Germany currently\nhold leading positions in relation to sensor technology\
    \ and manufacturing methods. The\nroles of agricultural sensors are becoming increasingly\
    \ diverse and now include weather,\nwater, soil, and plant sensors. These sensors,\
    \ which can be used to identify a wide range of\nitems, provide invaluable assistance\
    \ in collecting agricultural production data [25]. Indus-\ntrialized countries’\
    \ agricultural IoT applications are becoming more efﬁcient as information\ntechnology\
    \ progresses. Monitoring and intelligent management can be used with artiﬁcial\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n4 of 22\nintelligence technologies to maximize sensor\
    \ data utilization. When utilized in conjunction\nwith expert systems, the Internet\
    \ of Things in agriculture helps planters improve their\nplanting experience while\
    \ conducting accurate crop management. The IoT has been widely\napplied to many\
    \ elements of agricultural production, including environmental monitoring\nin\
    \ agricultural product production, farmland irrigation, and product safety traceability.\
    \ It\nhas also been utilized in veterinary medicine, aquaculture, and agricultural\
    \ planting.\nThe applications of the IoT in agri-food can be divided into three\
    \ categories depending\non their functions: tracing, tracking, and monitoring\
    \ for precision agriculture, agricul-\ntural machinery, and greenhouse applications\
    \ [25,26]. Growing plants in a controlled\nenvironment is known as greenhouse\
    \ growing or greenhouse gardening. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) are used to\
    \ monitor the conditions that allow for increased efﬁciency,\nenergy savings,\
    \ and the need for minimal human interaction [27]. Precision agriculture\ninvolves\
    \ the control of farm variables such as uniform equipment and labor availability,\n\
    cost, crop maturity, weather, and air and soil quality. Precision agriculture\
    \ refers to the\ncontrol of agricultural variables. Precision agriculture is made\
    \ possible using Internet of\nThings sensor nodes in conjunction with BDA [28,29].\
    \ Machines connected to the Internet of\nThings can be operated on autopilot,\
    \ decreasing losses and increasing production. Tracking\nagri-food goods allows\
    \ the client to understand the product’s history better. RFID provides\na data\
    \ capture process that is visible to all parties involved in the process. Internet-of-\n\
    Things-based solutions can be implemented to properly monitor animal farming,\
    \ crop\nfarming, forestry, and aquaponics operations [30,31].\nThe IoT makes it\
    \ feasible to monitor and measure several sustainability indicators\nin the agri-food\
    \ supply chain, such as fertilizer use, crop yield, and water efﬁciency. IoT-\n\
    based devices enable items to be interconnected regardless of their location,\
    \ allowing for\ninformation sharing throughout the supply chain [26]. Both RFID\
    \ and WSN enable the\ncollection of data, as well as the dissemination of data\
    \ and information. RFID is frequently\nused in the food industry’s supply chain\
    \ to monitor temperature during storage and transit\nand to estimate and calculate\
    \ shelf life [32]. Other RFID uses include quality control, supply\nchain management,\
    \ cold-chain monitoring, livestock management, and food product\ntraceability.\
    \ For example, devices measuring pressure, acceleration, humidity, temperature,\n\
    and light are frequently used in monitoring, transportation, and food storage\
    \ applications.\nIt is vital to detect and measure sustainability indicators to\
    \ develop a sustainable agriculture\nand food supply chain [33]. The fact that\
    \ agricultural sustainability indicators are always\nchanging makes measuring\
    \ and monitoring them difﬁcult. In order to evaluate and monitor\noverall sustainability\
    \ in agriculture, high levels of skills are required, in addition to the\nability\
    \ to adapt to change. IoT technology is justiﬁed in its application to the construction\
    \ of\na sustainable agriculture and food supply chain when combined with the ability\
    \ to gather\nand send data, scalability, and ﬂexibility. One of the most important\
    \ components is the\ndata collected by smart agriculture sensors. This information\
    \ can be used to monitor the\nstate of the company, as well as the performance\
    \ of the workforce and the efﬁciency of the\nequipment. When it comes to planning\
    \ for better product distribution, having the ability to\npredict the output of\
    \ production is essential.\nThe owners of farms can collect data regarding their\
    \ livestock’s location, well-being,\nand health by utilizing wireless applications\
    \ for the IoT. This information not only helps\nto stop the spread of disease\
    \ but also reduces the amount of money spent on labor.\nA climate-controlled smart\
    \ greenhouse built with the assistance of the Internet of Things\neliminates the\
    \ need for human involvement by intelligently monitoring and controlling\nthe\
    \ environment. Predicting crops is extremely important since it enables farmers\
    \ to better\nplan for the future in terms of the production of the crop, as well\
    \ as its storage, various\nmarketing strategies, and risk management. The artiﬁcial\
    \ network uses the information\ngathered by sensors on the farm to make production\
    \ rate predictions for the crop. The\ncharacteristics of soil, temperature, pressure,\
    \ rainfall, and humidity are all included in this\nreport. The dashboard or mobile\
    \ application that the farmers have speciﬁcally designed\ncan provide them with\
    \ reliable data related to the soil.\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n5 of 22\n3. Related\
    \ Works\nThere have been several studies on the use of IoT in the olive oil industry.\
    \ In one\nstudy [34], the authors examined the use of an IoT blockchain-based\
    \ framework to certify\nthe extra virgin olive oil supply chain. The authors developed\
    \ a blockchain-based system\nfor the traceability and certiﬁcation of the extra\
    \ virgin olive oil supply chain. In another\nstudy [35], the authors developed\
    \ a tool to reveal the efﬁciency of an open-source visible\nand near infra-red\
    \ spectrophotometer for the assessment of the geographical origin of\nolive oil.\
    \ They used an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) to classify extra virgin olive oil.\
    \ In\nanother study [36], the authors studied the relationship between competitive\
    \ advantage\nand the use of a blockchain in the olive oil industry. They found\
    \ that the use of a blockchain\ncombined with IoT devices could signiﬁcantly improve\
    \ visibility and avoid fraud in the\nolive oil quality, which led to a competitive\
    \ advantage in the industry. In [37], the authors\npresented a multi-sensor traceability\
    \ system using the IoT. The authors aimed to enable the\nimplementation of a supply\
    \ chain system in the industry that would allow for tracking the\nroute of olive\
    \ oil from the producer to the customer via the oil factory. In [38], the authors\n\
    focused on traceability in the olive oil production chain and indicators of its\
    \ quality, as\nwell as environmental and social sustainability indicators. They\
    \ used smart contracts and\nblockchain technology to solve this issue.\n4. Proposed\

    \ \nIn this study, we aimed to develop a model to measure the performance of olive\
    \ oil \ncompanies by improving their supply chains using the IoT. The proposed\
    \ model is \nillustrated in Figure 1. Demand planning, manufacturing, transportation,\
    \ customer \nservice, warehousing, and inventory management were the main factors\
    \ incorporated into \nthe proposed model. The model was based on the factors used\
    \ in previous studies [39–\n43]. The relationship between these factors and the\
    \ supply chain was investigated in the \nfirst stage, and the relationship between\
    \ the supply chain and olive oil companies’ \nperformance was investigated in\
    \ the second stage. \n \nFigure 1. Proposed model. \n1. \nDemand planning: Demand\
    \ planning is the linchpin of an effective supply chain and \nis a component of\
    \ supply chain management that involves forecasting future demand \nand tailoring\
    \ company output to meet those projections [44,45]. An effective supply \nequilibrium\
    \ is one in which store inventories contain only the number of products \nrequired\
    \ by the demand and no more or less than that number [46]. The delicate \nFigure\
    \ 1. Proposed model.\n1.\nDemand planning: Demand planning is the linchpin of\
    \ an effective supply chain and\nis a component of supply chain management that\
    \ involves forecasting future demand\nand tailoring company output to meet those\
    \ projections [44,45]. An effective supply\nequilibrium is one in which store\
    \ inventories contain only the number of products\nrequired by the demand and\
    \ no more or less than that number [46]. The delicate\nbalance between having\
    \ enough and too much can be difﬁcult to achieve. The primary\nconcern in demand\
    \ planning, aside from the ongoing effort to help shape demand\nthrough the effective\
    \ use of promotions, is to maintain this delicate balance at all\ntimes [47].\
    \ For effective demand planning, it is typically necessary to employ demand\n\
    forecasting techniques that accurately predict demand trends. This has additional\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n6 of 22\nbeneﬁts, including increased company efﬁciency\
    \ and customer satisfaction. Thus,\nin this study, we assumed that demand planning\
    \ would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the\ncompany supply chain in the olive oil industry\
    \ (H1).\n2.\nManufacturing: Manufacturing refers to the creation of products using\
    \ equipment,\ntools, labor, and biological or chemical processing or preparation\
    \ [48,49]. According\nto this deﬁnition, manufacturing can either refer to the\
    \ large-scale development\nand transformation of raw materials into completed\
    \ goods or the development of\nmore intricate objects through the selling of basic\
    \ goods to manufacturers to produce\nitems such as home appliances, vehicles,\
    \ and airplanes [50,51]. The manufacturing\nprocess, often known as manufacturing\
    \ engineering, is the process through which\nraw materials are turned into completed\
    \ goods. This operation is carried out by\nstarting with the design of the product\
    \ and the selection of materials [52,53]. The raw\nmaterials are turned into the\
    \ ﬁnished product throughout the manufacturing process.\nFabrication is a word\
    \ used by some manufacturers to describe the several intermediate\ntechniques\
    \ utilized to construct the components of a ﬁnal object in today’s highly\nsophisticated\
    \ manufacturing environments [54]. Manufacturing is strongly associated\nwith\
    \ engineering and the design of industrial processes [55]. Thus, in this study,\
    \ we\nassumed that the manufacturing would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the company supply\n\
    chain in the olive oil industry (H2).\n3.\nTransportation: The movement of people\
    \ and goods is the focus of the transporta-\ntion industry, which is a signiﬁcant\
    \ part of the economy and an important industry\nsector [56]. Companies that fall\
    \ within this category include airlines, trucking en-\nterprises, railroads, and\
    \ shipping and logistics businesses, as well as companies\nthat supply the infrastructure\
    \ for various modes of transportation. The availability\nof transport eases the\
    \ burden of the immobile components of production, and the\ntransport industry’s\
    \ growth encourages increased labor and capital mobility. The\nmovement of people\
    \ from one location to another can be facilitated when there is\nan effective\
    \ network of transport services [57]. The transportation and logistics sector\n\
    is experiencing signiﬁcant disruption, including digital transformation, new market\n\
    entrants, and shifting customer expectations, and new business models are still\
    \ devel-\noping. For the economy to generate products and services, transportation\
    \ products\nmust ﬁrst be manufactured from a variety of services and must then\
    \ be combined\nwith other inputs. As an intermediate good, transportation has\
    \ a “derived demand”,\nalso known as a “derived market”. The theory of production\
    \ can help direct our\nthinking about how to manufacture transportation products\
    \ efﬁciently and how to\nuse transportation to produce other things effectively\
    \ [58]. Thus, in this study, we\nassumed that transportation would signiﬁcantly\
    \ inﬂuence the company supply chain\nin the olive oil industry (H3).\n4.\nCustomer\
    \ Service: Customer service is the assistance and direction that a company\nprovides\
    \ to individuals before, during, and after purchasing a product or service from\n\
    that company [59]. This assistance and direction can be offered before, during,\
    \ or after\nthe transaction. There is a direct correlation between satisﬁed customers,\
    \ continued\nloyalty to a company’s brand, and increased sales of the company’s\
    \ products or\nservices [60]. When running a successful business, ensuring the\
    \ pleasure of one’s\nclientele has always been an important factor, but in today’s\
    \ world, this factor is more\nimportant than it has ever been in the past. The\
    \ market is ﬂooded with various options\nto meet the high expectations that consumers\
    \ place on brands. Service needs to be\nan integral part of every stage of the\
    \ customer’s journey, beginning with the very ﬁrst\ninteractions and continuing\
    \ for a signiﬁcant amount of time after the point of purchase.\nCustomer service\
    \ is essential to the customer lifecycle and loyalty in an economy\nthat prioritizes\
    \ digital transformation. In order to reduce customer churn, sales and\ncustomer\
    \ service must be able to coordinate their efforts in real time, efﬁciently share\n\
    information about individual customers in a protected environment, and use this\n\
    information better to understand their needs and expectations [61]. Thus, in this\
    \ study,\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n7 of 22\nwe assumed that customer service would\
    \ signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the company supply\nchain in the olive oil industry (H4).\n\
    5.\nWarehousing: The process of storing physical inventory in preparation for\
    \ sale or\ndistribution is known as warehousing [62]. Warehouses are utilized\
    \ by a wide variety\nof businesses, and their primary purpose is to temporarily\
    \ store products in large\nquantities before either transporting them to other\
    \ locations or selling them individu-\nally to ﬁnal customers [63]. For instance,\
    \ many e-commerce businesses buy products\nin bulk from their suppliers, who then\
    \ ship the products to the business’s warehouse,\nwhere they are stored. After\
    \ that, when an end customer places an order through the\ne-commerce site, the\
    \ company—or its third-party fulﬁllment provider—selects, packs,\nand ships the\
    \ product to the customer directly from the warehouse. The warehousing\nindustry\
    \ as a whole has been accelerated by the growth that has been driven by\ne-commerce.\
    \ The market has more than doubled over the past decade due to substan-\ntial\
    \ investments made by companies located worldwide in their respective supply\n\
    chains [64]. These investments were made to deliver goods to customers and other\n\
    businesses. This is not exclusive to businesses involved in online commerce. Most\n\
    businesses that engage in physical retail have limited space in their stores to\
    \ store\ntheir inventory, despite the fact that they still need to keep up with\
    \ demand. Even if\ntheir suppliers are located in other countries, and it takes\
    \ a long time to produce and\nship new products, they will be able to restock\
    \ their stores during high-volume times\nlike the holidays if they have additional\
    \ inventory available in nearby warehouses.\nThis helps ensure that they will\
    \ always be able to meet customer demand. Thus, in\nthis study, we assumed that\
    \ warehousing would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the company\nsupply chain in the olive\
    \ oil industry (H5).\n6.\nInventory management: The management of inventories\
    \ enables businesses to deter-\nmine which stocks to order, how much of each,\
    \ and when to place their orders [65].\nIt involves keeping track of the inventory\
    \ from the time of purchase until after the\ngoods have been sold. This practice\
    \ identiﬁes trends and reacts to them so that there\nis always enough stock to\
    \ fulﬁll customer orders and that they are given an adequate\nwarning if there\
    \ is a shortage. Inventory turnover is one metric that can be used to\nevaluate\
    \ how well an organization manages its stock. Inventory turnover is a measure-\n\
    ment used in accounting that indicates how frequently stock is sold during a given\n\
    time [66]. It is not ideal for a company to have more inventory than it sells.\
    \ A low\ninventory turnover rate can result in deadstock, another name for unsold\
    \ stock [67].\nInventory management is essential to the success of a business\
    \ because it helps to\nensure that there is never an excessive amount or insufﬁcient\
    \ amount of stock on\nhand, thereby reducing the likelihood of stockouts and inaccurate\
    \ records. Inventory\nmanagement aims to gain a comprehensive understanding of\
    \ stock levels and the\nlocation of stock within warehouses. The ﬂow of products\
    \ from the supplier through\nthe production process and to the customer is monitored\
    \ using software designed for\ninventory management. Inventory management keeps\
    \ track of all activities that occur\nin the warehouse, including stock receipts,\
    \ picking, packing, and shipping [68]. Thus,\nin this study, we assumed that the\
    \ management of inventories would signiﬁcantly\ninﬂuence the company supply chain\
    \ in the olive oil industry (H6).\n7.\nSupply chain:\nBusinesses increasingly\
    \ look to their supply chains or SCs for\na competitive advantage. The goal of\
    \ studying supply chain management is to\nincrease a company’s value by using\
    \ its resources in the best way. A company’s\nsupply chain comprises all the processes\
    \ that add value and connect the provider\nto the end-user. The fundamental SC\
    \ activities are receiving input from the ﬁrm’s\nsuppliers, adding value to that\
    \ input, and then delivering the improved product or\nservice to the ﬁrm’s customers.\
    \ The supply chain refers to all of the organizations and\nindividuals who play\
    \ a role, however indirectly, in meeting a customer’s demand.\nThe supply chain\
    \ includes producers, distributors, shippers, warehousing facilities,\nretailers,\
    \ and consumers. The SC refers to the entire sequence of steps taken within\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n8 of 22\nan enterprise, such as manufacturing, to fulﬁll\
    \ a customer order. This category in-\ncludes developing new products, promotion,\
    \ ﬁnancing, distribution, operation, and\ncustomer service. In order to create\
    \ and maintain a competitive advantage in their\nproducts and services, businesses\
    \ require efﬁcient supply chain management. Thus,\nin this study, we assumed that\
    \ the supply chain would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the\ncompany’s performance in the\
    \ olive oil industry (H7).\nThe methods adopted for data analysis are provided\
    \ in the following sections. Clus-\ntering and decision trees were employed in\
    \ the method’s development. The data for this\nstudy were collected from business\
    \ leaders with knowledge of the integration of new\ntechnologies into the business,\
    \ as well as IoT experts. Data were clustered, and decision\ntrees were implemented\
    \ to forecast the performance of the olive oil companies based on\nseveral factors.\n\

    \ \n5. Materials and Methods \n5.1. Background Work \n5.1.1. SOM Clustering \n\
    There are 2 layers in an SOM: the input and output [69,70]. The output layer is\
    \ also \ncalled the Kohonen layer. The SOM’s overall architecture is depicted\
    \ in Figure 2. Many \nneurons in the output layer are completely connected to\
    \ the input neurons. As shown in \nFigure 2, the output space is 2-dimensional.\
    \ The learning algorithm utilized to train the \nSOM is based on unsupervised\
    \ and competitive learning. \n \nFigure 2. SOM architecture. \nThe following provides\
    \ a brief overview of the SOM training process. The SOM’s \ninput pattern can\
    \ be represented by the following equation [71]: \nFigure 2. SOM architecture.\n\
    The following provides a brief overview of the SOM training process. The SOM’s\n\
    input pattern can be represented by the following equation [71]:\nx = [x1, x2,\
    \ xM]T\n(1)\nwhere x is the input pattern and M represents the size of x.\nAccordingly,\
    \ synaptic weight vectors (SWVs) [72] of neurons in the output layer are\nindicated\
    \ by:\nwj =\n\x02\nwj1 , wj2, wjM\n\x03T\n(2)\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n9 of 22\n\
    where the SWVs of neuron j are indicated by wj, j = 1, 2, . . . , p, and p is\
    \ the Kohonen\nlayer’s total number of neurons.\nAt the start of the training\
    \ process, the SWVs are initialized with small random\nnumbers. This serves as\
    \ a starting point for the training process in the self-organizing map.\nThis\
    \ is identiﬁed as competitive learning in self-organizing maps because the network’s\n\
    neurons in the system compete with one another to ﬁnd which neuron will be activated\n\
    and therefore become the winning neuron in this competition. Neurons compete to\
    \ see\nwhich one has the greatest degree of similarity between their SWVs and\
    \ input patterns.\nThese SWV similarities are utilized to decide which neuron\
    \ will win the competition. As\na result, the following equation can be used to\
    \ ﬁnd the winning neuron:\ni(x) = arg min ∥x − wj∥, j = 1, 2, . . . , p\n(3)\n\
    where ∥ · ∥ represents the Euclidean distance and i(x) indicates the neuron closest\
    \ to x.\nThus, the Euclidean distance is calculated by:\n∥x − wj∥ =\nq\n∑\nM\n\
    i=1\n\0xi − wji\n\x012, j = 1, 2, . . . , p\n(4)\nThe Euclidean distance is considered\
    \ a typical comparison metric to compare two items.\nA smaller ∥x − wj∥ indicates\
    \ greater proximity between the input pattern x and the SWV\nwj. As a result,\
    \ the winning neuron is selected by calculating and comparing the distances\n\
    from the current point x in the network to all output neurons. The winning neurons\n\
    are those with the shortest distance from the current input pattern. Finally,\
    \ the lateral\ninteractions between a triumphant neuron and the others around\
    \ it are investigated. The\nwinning neuron’s impact on its neighbors is computed\
    \ through the use of the topological\nneighborhood function. A topological representation\
    \ of the area is a neighborhood function.\nhji(x)(t) = exp\n \n−\nd2\nj,i\n2σ2(t)\n\
    !\n(5)\nIn the above equation, t = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, dj,i indicates the Euclidean\
    \ distance between\nthe neighboring neuron j and the winning neuron i and σ (t)\
    \ indicates the topological\nneighborhood’s width at time t. In this equation,\
    \ hji(x)(t) indicates the topological neigh-\nborhood at time t. This is accomplished\
    \ by means of the following equation, which is used\nto alter the values of synaptic\
    \ weights based on changes in input patterns [73]:\nwj(t + 1) = wj(t) + η(t)hjj(χ)(t)\n\
    \0x − wj(t)\n\x01\n(6)\nIn the above equation, wj(t + 1) indicates the SWV of\
    \ neuron j at time t + 1 and η(t)\nindicates the learning rate at time t. The\
    \ learning rate in the learning process will decrease\nwith time according to\
    \ the following equation:\nη(t) = η(0) exp\n\x10\n−\nr\n1000\n\x11\n(7)\nin which\
    \ the initial learning rate is indicated by η(0). When the operation is repeated,\
    \ the\nwinning neuron and its neighboring neurons grow in a similar manner to\
    \ the relevant input\npattern. After the completion of network learning, a trained\
    \ SOM is obtained.\n5.1.2. Decision Trees (DTs)\nDT is a predictive learning approach\
    \ that combines observations of a phenomenon\nwith judgments about the target\
    \ value of the issue under investigation. Learning, in this\ntechnique, is performed\
    \ to discover a DT from the dataset. This technique is widely utilized\nin spatial\
    \ data mining applications [74]. Each internal node in the DT includes a variable\n\
    from the data, and each edge corresponds to a child [75]. Each leaf in the DT\
    \ indicates\na target variable’s value, depending on the input variables’ values.\
    \ A DT can be discovered\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n10 of 22\nby subdividing a\
    \ source set and observing the results of an attribute value test. It is critical\n\
    to repeat this method for each derived subset. Recursion is completed when splitting\
    \ is no\nlonger necessary or when a single categorization can be implemented for\
    \ all samples in the\nresulting subset, whichever comes ﬁrst. DTs provide human-readable\
    \ rules that describe\nthe relationships in a dataset and can be utilized for\
    \ prediction and classiﬁcation. This\nmachine-learning technology is widely used\
    \ in a variety of disciplines, including disease\ndetection [76], security [77],\
    \ business [78], and education [79]. It is important to note that\nthe obtained\
    \ DT structure must be as simple as possible. For DTs to be effective, they must\n\
    be able to reliably discover the knowledge learned from the dataset to predict\
    \ new data.\nBy adding new training data, most DTs can be augmented, which means\
    \ that the DT can\nbe modiﬁed.\nThere are various kinds of DTs. Some DTs produce\
    \ an output consisting of a set of\nvalues of a discrete nature. These types of\
    \ trees are referred to as categorization trees.\nClassiﬁcation and regression\
    \ trees, or CARTs, produce both classiﬁcation and regression\nresults. In this\
    \ study, we used the CART method to analyze the data to discover the decision\n\
    rules. The ﬁrst node (the root node) contained all the information in the CART\
    \ model. The\nsplitter variable from the data with the best purity and homogeneity\
    \ in each branch was\nthen employed in the ﬁnal step of the process to construct\
    \ a split in the root according\nto each branch’s splitter variable. At tree branches,\
    \ the classiﬁcation of variables was\nperformed until the data in the corresponding\
    \ node had become sufﬁciently homogeneous\nto fall into a speciﬁc classiﬁcation.\
    \ These were the result classes, which were represented\nby leaf or terminal nodes.\
    \ The internal nodes were the nodes that lay between the terminal\nnodes and the\
    \ root node of a network. In order to select the splitter variable, many different\n\
    indices can be used. The Gini index (GI) [80] was used in this investigation.\
    \ The greatest\nGI value, on the other hand, was obtained when all of the data\
    \ in a node belonged to every\ncategory. When all of the data for a corresponding\
    \ node belonged to a single category, the\nnode was produced with the utmost purity\
    \ possible, and the GI would be 0. When all\nvariables of a corresponding node\
    \ were determined, the GI was calculated for each variable,\nand the variable\
    \ from the dataset with the lowest GI value was chosen as the splitter. The\n\
    GI used in CART was deﬁned according to the following equation:\nGINI(P) =\nn\n\
    ∑\ni=1\npi(1 − pi) = 1 −\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(pi)2\n(8)\nin which\npi\nrepresents the\
    \ likelihood that a given object will be placed in\na speciﬁc category.\n6. Results\n\
    In this study, we collected the data using a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire\n\

    \ Most respondents were male (78.3%: 432; see Table 2). The majority of the\n\
    respondents also had Ph.D. degrees (48.4%: 267; see Table 3). The category related\
    \ to\nrespondents’ employment in the industry showed that most of them had full-time\
    \ employ-\nment (see Table 4). The demographic information demonstrated that the\
    \ respondents were\ngreatly familiar with the use of IoT devices in the industry\
    \ (see Table 5).\nTo implement the method, we used a personal laptop with an Intel(R)\
    \ Core(TM) i7-\n6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2592 MHz, four Core(s) and eight Logical\
    \ Processor(s) with 8 GB\nof memory running the Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating\
    \ system. All experiments were\nperformed using a 10-fold cross-validation. We\
    \ used SOM for data clustering. η(0) = 0.01\nwas considered in the SOM. The SOM\
    \ was performed to detect similar preferences in\ndifferent groups. We used different\
    \ map structure for SOM as: SOM 1 × 3, SOM 2 × 2,\nSOM 1 × 5, SOM 1 × 3, SOM 2\
    \ × 3, SOM 1 × 7, SOM 2 × 4, SOM 3 × 3, SOM 2 × 5, SOM\n1 × 11, SOM 3 × 4. Accordingly,\
    \ a different number of clusters was generated by SOM,\nas shown in Table 6. In\
    \ this study, we used the silhouette coefﬁcient [81] to identify the\noptimal\
    \ number of clusters. The results are presented in Table 6. We found that the\
    \ optimal\nnumber of clusters was 5 (i.e., SOM 1 × 5).\nThe results of data clustering\
    \ are presented in Tables 7–9 and A1. In Table 7, we\npresent the centroids of\
    \ the discovered clusters. This table shows that there was a signif-\nicant relationship\
    \ between demand planning, manufacturing, transportation, customer\nservice, warehousing\
    \ and inventory management, and supply chain performance. In ad-\ndition, the\
    \ results show a direct relationship between supply chain performance and the\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 271\n12 of 22\nperformance of olive oil companies. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ it can be observed that when the supply\nchain performance was at a low level,\
    \ the company’s performance was also at a low level.\nFurthermore, with a high\
    \ level of supply chain performance, a high level of company\nperformance was\

    \ increase in the population has increased the demand for additional\nfood. Agricultural\
    \ advancements are critical to the development of our sedentary human\ncivilization.\
    \ Consequently, the agri-food sector is still regarded as one of the most important\n\
    sectors in the world today. Most agricultural businesses continue to rely on traditional\n\
    farming practices despite their decreasing use. To meet this requirement, agricultural\
    \ ﬁrms\nare changing their approaches to IoT applications to gain greater capabilities.\
    \ Based on\nIoT technologies, smart farming enables farmers and growers to enhance\
    \ productivity and\nreduce waste. This can be measured in various ways, from fertilizer\
    \ use to the number\nof journeys made by farm vehicles. Smart farming also enables\
    \ the efﬁcient utilization of\nresources such as water, electricity, and other\
    \ things. An IoT smart farming solution is\na system built to monitor crop ﬁelds\
    \ with the help of sensors (crop health, temperature,\nhumidity, light, soil moisture,\
    \ etc.) and an automated irrigation system. These sensors\nmonitor light, humidity,\
    \ temperature, and crop health. Farmers can monitor the ﬁelds’\nconditions from\
    \ any location. They can also choose between manual and automated\nprocesses to\
    \ carry out the necessary actions in response to the data. Compared to traditional\n\
    farming methods, precision agriculture is signiﬁcantly more productive.\nThe IoT\
    \ has played a critical role in increasing production and expanding agricultural\n\
    product markets. Investigating the IoT’s impact on companies’ performance is a\
    \ critical\ntask. Because of the wide variety of sensors that are currently available,\
    \ the possibilities\nfor IoT applications in the olive oil industry are almost\
    \ limitless. The IoT has played\na critical role in increasing production and\
    \ expanding agricultural product markets. In the\nolive oil industry, it is possible\
    \ to improve the supply chain process from raw materials\nwithin a plant to product\
    \ distribution to customers and businesses using IoT technologies.\nPrevious studies\
    \ have investigated the impact of the IoT on the performance of industries,\n\
    but this issue has not been explored in the olive oil industry until now.\nIn\
    \ this study, we proposed a model based on seven hypotheses. The results of the\n\
    data analysis, conducted using the supervised learning technique, conﬁrmed all\
    \ of the\nhypotheses. A direct relationship between the input variables and the\
    \ output variables\nwas discovered. The results demonstrated a direct relationship\
    \ between the supply chain\nimprovement caused by the implementation of the IoT\
    \ and company performance in the\nolive oil industry. Furthermore, increasing\
    \ demand planning, manufacturing, transporta-\ntion, customer service, warehousing,\
    \ and inventory management improved supply chain\nperformance. Thus, IoT implementation\
    \ is critical for improving supply chain perfor-\nmance in the olive oil industry\
    \ through improvements in demand planning, manufacturing,\ntransportation, customer\
    \ service, warehousing, and inventory management.\nMoreover, in the olive oil\
    \ industry, various processes can be employed by IoT tech-\nnologies in the transformation\
    \ of raw products into food products. The best results are\nobtained by taking\
    \ into account both efﬁciency and the desired quality of the ﬁnal food\nproduct.\
    \ The production of high-quality extra virgin olive oil, for example, necessitates\
    \ the\noptimization of various production steps such as olive handling and harvesting,\
    \ milling,\nand the use of modern IoT technologies to control process conditions.\
    \ To avoid process\nfailures and maintain the highest possible quality in the\
    \ ﬁnal olive oil products, a high\nlevel of control by IoT technologies over standard\
    \ operating conditions can be signiﬁcant.\nIn addition, the duration of malaxation\
    \ and temperature can have an impact on olive oil\nquality [87]. Thus, IoT-based\
    \ technologies can be used to enhance extra virgin olive oil\nproduction without\
    \ having an adverse effect on the quality indicators.\nProcesses 2023, 11, 271\n\

    \ oil industry. We developed\na new method to investigate the IoT’s role in improving\
    \ olive oil companies’ performance.\nThe method was developed using clustering\
    \ and decision trees. The data for this study were\ncollected from respondents\
    \ with knowledge regarding the integration of new technologies\ninto the industry.\
    \ The data were clustered, and decision trees were implemented to predict\nthe\
    \ olive oil companies’ performance according to the factors inﬂuencing the supply\
    \ chain.\nThe model was implemented in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the models\
    \ learned how to\nﬁnd the relationships between demand planning, manufacturing,\
    \ transportation, customer\nservice, warehousing and inventory management, and\
    \ supply chain performance. The\nrelationship between supply chain performance\
    \ and company performance was evaluated\nin the second stage. The method was evaluated\
    \ in these two stages and compared using\ndecision trees, an ANN, and an ANFIS.\
    \ The methods were compared using RMSE, MAE,\nand the coefﬁcient of determination.\
    \ The results showed that the SOM + decision trees\nmethod outperformed the other\
    \ machine learning techniques in terms of the RMSE, MAE,\nand coefﬁcient of determination.\n\
    Limitation and Future Work\nThis study has some limitations. First, the method\
    \ was developed using SOM clus-\ntering and decision trees without an optimization\
    \ technique. The SOM method can be\ndeveloped with optimization techniques such\
    \ as particle swarm optimization (PSO) [88] to\ndiscover the clusters in the data\
    \ more effectively. In addition, ensemble-learning approaches\ncan improve the\
    \ efﬁciency of decision trees [89]. Second, in this study, we investigated the\n\
    relationships between supply chains and olive oil companies’ performance. The\
    \ model\ncould be further improved by including other factors, such as competitive\
    \ advantages and\nﬁnancial aspects of performance. Furthermore, the results could\
    \ be further developed to\naccount for the barriers to implementing IoT in olive\
    \ oil companies, speciﬁcally, the barriers\nin the context of privacy and security\
    \ related to the implementation of the IoT by olive\noil companies.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a major component of\
    \ \ncontemporary societies and the next stage of the Internet’s development. Its\
    \ \napplications have touched several aspects of our lives, including health,\
    \ \neconomy, technology, education, environment, and transport. In addition, \n\
    recent research shows that interest in the IoT is increasing, driven by the \n\
    potential benefits that it brings, such as improving efficiency and \nproductivity,\
    \ saving time and effort, staying connected, better health services \nand care,\
    \ improved safety and security, automation and control among other \nbenefits.\
    \ However, despite these advantages and due to the infancy of the \nIoT, research\
    \ around this topic is still evolving, and more needs to be done to \nunderstand\
    \ this paradigm of technology. This paper aims to review current \napplications\
    \ and challenges associated with its adoption. It provides insights \ninto current\
    \ applications of the IoT in different domains, including smart \ncities, health\
    \ care, smart agriculture, smart water management, retail, logistic \nand product\
    \ lifetime management, smart living, public safety and \nenvironmental monitoring,\
    \ and the IoT for physically challenged persons. \nConcerning the challenges,\
    \ the study discusses issues related to \nconfidentiality, security, and privacy,\
    \ data management, machine-to-machine \ncommunication, interoperability, reliability,\
    \ availability and robustness, \ntechnological architecture issues, and standardization.\

    \ \n \n1. Introduction \n*The Internet is defined as a network of connected \n\
    computers that communicate by linking entities and \nproducing information. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) \nis the next generation of the Internet that integrates\
    \ \ndifferent ranges of technologies such as sensory, \ncommunication, \nnetworking,\
    \ \nand \nintelligent \ntechnologies for the purpose of handling and \nprocessing\
    \ information (Li et al., 2016). The power \nof the IoT does not only consist\
    \ of remote control. \nAnother important benefit of connecting objects is \nthe\
    \ possibility for smart objects to access any kind of \ninformation through the\
    \ Internet, information that \ncan be exploited to improve the service offered\
    \ to \nend-users (Husein, 2019; Righetti et al., 2018). The \nnetworking giant's\
    \ latest mobile Visual Networking \n                                         \

    \ domains of IoT \nThe number of IoT applications is progressively \ngrowing and\
    \ promises to bring immense value to our \nlives. With newer wireless networks,\
    \ superior \nsensors, and revolutionary computing capabilities, \nthe IoT could\
    \ be the next frontier in the race for a \nshare of the wallet. The following\
    \ is a discussion of \nthe potential applications of the IoT that can be \napplied\
    \ in many areas. \n2.1. Smart cities and urbanization \nThe number of IoT applications\
    \ for smart cities is \ngradually increasing. Progressively more cities are \n\
    installing sensors and actuators to hypothetically \nimplement all the actions\
    \ that are voted for in the \ncity. Such strategies classically connect using\
    \ end to \nend wireless connections and generate a kind of \npassageway system\
    \ saturating the city. Eco-friendly \nobserving, traffic monitoring, smart parking,\
    \ smart \nfollowing, and hands-on sensing are some of the \nunbiased collection\
    \ applications previously applied \nin many cities. A brief summary of these applications\
    \ \nis provided below, emphasizing their benefits for the \npopulace but also\
    \ highlighting their possible fears. \nDue to space limitations, a limited number\
    \ of \napplications are mentioned (Kumar et al., 2019). \nAccording to Sodhro\
    \ et al. (2018), IoT provides an \nessential aspect of the elegance of cities\
    \ and \nimproving their overall structure. Some aspects of \nthe utilization of\
    \ the IoT in constructing industrial \ncities consist of industrial construction,\
    \ traffic \njamming (Woznowski et al., 2016; Soomro et al., \n2018), waste management\
    \ (Mahmud et al., 2018), \nindustrial transportation systems (Woznowski et al.,\
    \ \n2016), industrial lighting, industrial car parks, and \ntown maps. These may\
    \ comprise seemingly different \nfunctionalities, for instance, observing existing\
    \ car \npark spaces inside the town, observing phenomena \nand the measurable\
    \ conditions of links and \nEducation\n \nInternet of Things \nTransport\n \n\
    Energy\n \nHome\n \nOthers\n \nEarth\n \nBusiness\n \nIndividual Networks \nConnected\
    \ Together \nWith Security, Analytics, and management \nShakir Khan, Mohammed\
    \ Altayar/International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages:\
    \ 104-113 \n106 \n \nbuildings, placing rigorous checking devices in \nhouses\
    \ in sensitive parts of cities, and detecting \nnumbers of walkers and means of\
    \ transportation. An \nartificial intelligence (AI) collective using the IoT has\
    \ \nthe ability to report on important challenges \nmodeled by some city groups,\
    \ which consist of traffic \norganization, healthcare, energy disasters, and \n\
    several other issues. This can improve the lives of \nthe residents and businesses\
    \ in a smart city. Before \ndiving into the joining part, let us discover some\
    \ of \nthe mechanisms of smart cities. A smart town has \ncountless use cases\
    \ for AI-driven IoT supported \ntechnology, \nfrom \nconserving \nan \nimproved\
    \ \nenvironment \nto \nenhancing \ncommunity \ntransportation and security. The\
    \ application of the \nIoT to accomplish smart cities would require \nsystematic\
    \ radio-frequency identification. According \nto Husein (2019), being equipped\
    \ with interrelated \ndevices and actuators is a component of a machine \nthat\
    \ is responsible for moving and controlling a \nmechanism or system to observe\
    \ any activity inside \na building. Most actions will be computerized based \n\
    on data collected by sensors and/or inclinations \ncommunicated by the user or\
    \ concluded by the \nclassification itself. \n2.2. Medical care \nThe IoT healthcare\
    \ network or the IoT network \nfor health care (hereafter ‘the IoThNet’) is one\
    \ of the \nmain components of the IoT in health care. It \nsupports access to\
    \ the IoT’s strengths, facilitates the \ncommunication and treatment of medical\
    \ data, and \nenables \nthe \nuse \nof \nhealthcare-tailored \ncommunications.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 2, this section \ndiscusses the IoThNet topology, architecture,\
    \ and \nplatform (Zhu et al., 2010). It should be seen that the \nplanned architectures\
    \ in Grønbæk (2008) and Dagar \net al. (2018) can be well-thought-out as a good\
    \ \nstarting point for a growing understanding of the IoT \nnetwork. \nHealthcare\
    \ \norganizations \nin \nseveral \ncountries are not capable, in their resources\
    \ and \ntraining, and can make mistakes. This can efficiently \nbe transformed\
    \ with the application of smart \nstrategies that can be computerized and upgraded\
    \ \nthrough \nequipment. \nFurther, \nequipment \nthat \nsimplifies processes\
    \ effortlessly, such as reporting \non the distribution of people and area, record\
    \ \nprotection, and distributing medicines, would go a \nlong way in altering\
    \ the medical field. \n \n \nFig. 2: IoT healthcare network (IoThNet) (Čolaković\
    \ and Hadžialić, 2018) \n \nIoT devices tagged with sensors are utilized for \n\
    tracking the real-time position of the medical \napparatus, \nsuch \nas \nwheelchairs,\
    \ \nnebulizers, \ndefibrillators, oxygen pumps, and other observing \nequipment.\
    \ The placement of medical staff at diverse \nlocations can also be examined in\
    \ real-time (Sodhro \net al., 2018). The use of the IoT in healthcare allows \n\
    for the automation of processes that have previously \ntaken time; these processes\
    \ previously allowed \nhuman \nerror. \nFor \nexample, \nnowadays, \nmany \nhospitals\
    \ use connected devices to control the \nairflow and temperature in operating\
    \ theatres. The \nadvantages of IoT in healthcare are seemingly \nendless, but\
    \ these are just a few of the major \nbenefits. The improvements in the IoT and\
    \ the \nInternet of Everything are, moreover, being drawn \nout slowly, as shown\
    \ by the emergence of the \nInternet of Nano-Things (IoNT) (Husein, 2019; Miraz\
    \ \net al., 2018). As the label suggests about the concept \nof the IoNT, is actuality\
    \ planned by incorporating \nnano-sensors in different substances (things) to\
    \ \nmake up nanonetworks. Healing deployment, as \ndisplayed in Fig. 3, is one\
    \ of the first motivations for \nthe development of the IoNT. \n2.3. Agriculture\
    \ sector  \nSmart agriculture is the application of several \ntypes of machinery\
    \ and devices such as the Internet, \ncloud, and IoT devices (Kamienski et al.,\
    \ 2018a). As \nthe population of the world is growing and it is \nexpected to\
    \ be around 9.7 billion by 2050, to nourish \nthose billions of people, we must\
    \ advance the \nproduction of food. On the other hand, the farmed \nland is being\
    \ reduced because of various issues, \nincluding mechanization, commercial markets,\
    \ and \nhousing construction taking place on farmland. \nHowever, to feed those\
    \ billions, we require an \nincrease in agriculture, and this can be accomplished\
    \ \nby using the IoT. Smart agriculture is also known as \nprecision agriculture.\
    \ The current farming situation \nis not appreciated by agriculturalists for many\
    \ \nreasons, including pest attacks, plant sickness, lack \nof knowledge of vital\
    \ supplements for the yields, and \nTopology\n \nArchitecture\n \nPlatform\n \n\
    IoT Healthcare Network\n \nPhysical configuration, application \nscenarios, activities\
    \ and use cases\n \nSoftware organisation of system as a \nwhole and hierarchical\
    \ model reflecting \n Library, framework and environment\nShakir Khan, Mohammed\
    \ Altayar/International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages:\
    \ 104-113 \n107 \n \nnumerous other difficulties. In order to remove these \n\
    difficulties and make agriculture more profitable, \nsmart, and approachable for\
    \ agriculturalists, they \nneed high-tech advancement. \n \n \nFig. 3: The internet\
    \ of nano-things (Husein, 2019) \n \nOld-style agriculture and precision agriculture\
    \ \nare different from each other in every way. Old-style \nagriculture practices\
    \ the old and outdated methods \nof cultivation, employing those ancient devices\
    \ for \nwork and planting regular crops without any \nevaluation of difficulties\
    \ in the market, rates, or \nclimate reports. Smart farming uses innovative \n\
    technologies, including smart connected devices, IoT \ndevices, the Internet,\
    \ communication, and the \nperiodical evaluation of many factors, such as the\
    \ \nbest circumstances for vegetables to grow, what \nnutrients are required,\
    \ soil excellence, and water \nsuperiority \nchecks. \nSmart \nagriculture \n\
    makes \nagriculture easy and inexpensive (cost-effective), \nreduces labor costs,\
    \ increases harvest yields, and \ndelivers healthier production. As discussed\
    \ by \nHusein (2019) and Veena et al. (2018), the IoT has \nthe capability of\
    \ supporting the improvement of the \nagricultural sector by investigating soil\
    \ humidity \nlevels and, in the case of wineries, observing the \nstem diameters.\
    \ The IoT would enable agriculturists \nto maintain and control the number of\
    \ vitamins set \nup in farming yields and to control microclimate \ncircumstances\
    \ in order to create the best growth and \nexcellence of root vegetables and fruits.\
    \ Additionally, \nconsidering the current climate circumstances, the \nIoT would\
    \ allow for the prediction of incoming rain \nor snow, deficiencies, and wind\
    \ variations, thus \nallowing for temperature and moisture levels to be \nadjusted\
    \ to stop fungus and other microbial \npollutants. \n2.4. Smart water management\
    \ \nA water shortage is the absence of adequate \nexisting water resources to\
    \ meet the requirements of \nwater usage inside a province, which is, according\
    \ to \nthe \nUnited \nNations \nDevelopment \nProgramme, \nproduced mostly by\
    \ unsuccessful management of \nresources, disturbing around 1.2 billion individuals\
    \ \nin various parts of the world. The IoT, as a system, \ncomprehends countless\
    \ possibilities to resolve \nsevere problems in numerous aspects of our \neveryday\
    \ life, including water shortages, via smart, \ninstantaneous, and expected management.\
    \ In each \npart of the water cycle, the IoT can be useful to make \nwater \n\
    resources \nhealthier \nand \nachieve \nwell-\norganized and optimal outcomes.\
    \ \nAs clarified by Husein (2019), Veena et al. (2018), \nKamienski et al. (2018b),\
    \ and Kor et al. (2016), \nmoreover, a town can be smart when they have \nhomes\
    \ that are also smart in terms of waste \ncontrolling, energy preserving, water\
    \ preserving, \nand environment preserving. IoT equipment also has \nadvantages\
    \ in developing the maintenance and \ncontrol of pumps on a systematic basis for\
    \ correctly \ncontrolling the use of water. The SWAMP project \nprogresses IoT-based\
    \ methods and tactics for smart \nwater control in the precision irrigation domain\
    \ and \nguides them in Italy, Spain, and Brazil. IoT and other \ntechnologies\
    \ are the accepted choice for smart water \ncontrol applications, and the SWAMP\
    \ project is \npredicted to verify the suitability of IoT in actual \nsurroundings\
    \ with the arrangement of on-site pilots. \n2.5. \nSupply \nchain, \nretail, \n\
    and \nproducts \nmanagement  \nAn \noriginal \nsignificant \nillustration \nof\
    \ \nan \nindustrialized IoT submission is managing the \nstrategy and inventory\
    \ series. RFIDs can be allocated \ntowards substances besides recycled to recognize\
    \ \nsupplies and belongings, including clothes, fixtures, \napparatus, foodstuff,\
    \ and water (Villanueva et al., \nShakir Khan, Mohammed Altayar/International\
    \ Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n108 \n\
    \ \n2012; Borgia, 2014). Their usage supports efficiency \nin warehouses and trades\
    \ and streamlining records \nby giving precise facts of the present record while\
    \ \ndecreasing record mistakes. The whole lifecycle of \nsubstances can be followed\
    \ (Cai et al., 2014; Borgia, \n2014). For instance, RFID readers connected in\
    \ the \nmanufacturing plant enable the screening of the \nmanufacturing procedure,\
    \ and the tag can be marked \nout all over the whole inventory sequence (e.g.,\
    \ \nwrapping, shipping, loading, sale to the consumer, \nthrowing away). Forward-thinking\
    \ IoT systems, self-\npossessed of RFID-furnished substances and shrewd \ndevices\
    \ tracing substances in actual, may help by \nsubstantially decreasing unwanted,\
    \ thus reducing \ncosts and enlightening turnover restrictions for both \nmerchants\
    \ and producers. According to Borgia \n(2014), an estimated 8.3% drop in sales\
    \ has been \npredicted if drops keep on partly allowed of goods. \nInadequate\
    \ production and excessive production \nmay decrease radically by using an accurate\
    \ \nevaluation of desired substances, which can be \nconditional by investigating\
    \ data composed by \nshrewd tags (Gruen et al., 2002). Additionally, the \nreal-time\
    \ investigation by sensors permits the \nclassification of product decline procedures\
    \ for \nfoodstuff and water with dynamic significance. Such \nas confirming the\
    \ bloom of decayable (e.g., fruits, \nroot vegetables, icy food), devices may\
    \ endlessly \nscreen heat plus moisture privileged storage \ncontainers or freezers,\
    \ and controllers may adjust \nthese, creating ideal management of the enclosed\
    \ \nfood. In addition, product reliability may be \nimproved \nwith \nRFID \n\
    founded \nvalidation \ndevelopments. Supplementary fascinating IoT bids \nare\
    \ smart supermarket run coordination. Such \nsystems observe operators’ buying\
    \ behaviors by \ntracing their portable phones and direct them in \nfactories/superstores/malls\
    \ to reduced items or \nservice in loose expense processes (e.g., spontaneous\
    \ \ncheck-out exhausting bionomics) (Borgia, 2014). \nUsing the IoT also supports\
    \ repairs and renovations \nbecause engineers can be sent to homes that forecast\
    \ \ntool failures and, at the same time, periodic repairs \ncan be automatically\
    \ scheduled before there is an \nequipment malfunction. This can be attained through\
    \ \nthe installing of tags in classified equipment or \ntechnology to screen performance\
    \ and occasionally \nguide information (Borgia, 2014; Tadejko, 2015). \n2.6. Smart\
    \ living  \nA smart living will incorporate the following: \nsmart \nhome \ncomputerization,\
    \ \nprotection, \nand \nsecurity. Smart sensors can be employed to bring \ntogether\
    \ important data about the home. For \ninstance, smart sensors could save data\
    \ about \ntenants and landowners’ temperature choices, \nfollowed by applicable\
    \ variations. Samsung has \nlaunched the Smart Home Ecosystem, which \nconnects\
    \ \nhome \ndevices \n(e.g., \nTV \nset, \nhome \nappliances, and smartphones)\
    \ by means of a single \nincorporated platform. These devices can be \norganized\
    \ by users with an application that connects \nthe devices in a household. Samsung\
    \ SmartThings \nStarter Kit offers the whole setup required to make a \nsmart\
    \ home. It is iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile \nfriendly. The SmartThings Starter\
    \ Kit offers the \nfollowing functionalities: (i) home observation from \neverywhere;\
    \ (ii) home control with an app; (iii) \nhome safety and security from loss and\
    \ threat; and \n(iv) scalability by developing hundreds of well-\nmatched \nsmart\
    \ \ndevices \nto \nboost \nhome \ncomputerization. Its components include a pivot\
    \ to \nattach smart sensors, decorations, locks, cameras, a \ngesture sensor to\
    \ observe effort in the home, a multi-\nsensor to observe whether doors, frames,\
    \ drawers, \nor garages are exposed or locked, an occurrence \nsensor to recognize\
    \ when individuals, animals, and \ncars come to or leave home and a power channel\
    \ to \nrheostat lights, electronics, and small appliances. The \nSmart Home Cloud\
    \ API (Dastbaz et al., 2017) offers \napproaches to switch and display Samsung\
    \ Smart \nHome operations. Through this Smart Home Control \nService, a partner’s\
    \ product can unite with numerous \ndevices and provide better services to their\
    \ \npurchaser. This service functions from end to end \nwith cloud-to-cloud incorporation\
    \ between the \npartner cloud and the Smart Home cloud. This is \nenabled by the\
    \ running of numerous REST APIs by \nSamsung for associates, so they are able\
    \ to \ncoordinate with the Samsung Smart Home cloud. The \nbody of the REST API\
    \ utilizes a standard JSON \ncertificate (called Smart Home Data), which means\
    \ \nthat associate developers are required to know the \nJSON document (Dastbaz\
    \ et al., 2017). Besides this, \nsmart homes are expected to evolve significantly\
    \ and \nwill be able to anticipate and meet the needs of their \nowners or occupants,\
    \ even without being asked. For \nexample, the AI devices will be able to know\
    \ what \nmusic a person wants to hear at a certain time of the \nday and play\
    \ it for them and will check their daily \ntask schedule and reset the alarm daily\
    \ according to \nthis schedule. When the person wakes up, the \nbathtub will be\
    \ prepared and filled with water that \nmatches the person's body temperature.\
    \ Also, Smart \nHome applications as one of the elements of smart \ncities \n\
    are \nindividually \nthe \nmost \ndemanded \napplication without question. Moreover,\
    \ washing \nmachines can permit one to monitor laundry \ndistantly. Additionally,\
    \ an extensive range of kitchen \nappliances can be reached via a smartphone,\
    \ hence \nmaking it conceivable to regulate temperature, as in \nthe case of a\
    \ microwave. Microwaves that have a \nself-cleaning component can be checked easily\
    \ as \nwell. In terms of household security, the IoT can be \nuseful for alarm\
    \ arrangements, and cameras can be \nmounted to display and discover when windows\
    \ or \ndoors are opened, thereby stopping trespassers \n(Husein, 2019; Miraz et\
    \ al., 2018). \n2.7. Public safety and environmental monitoring \nThe \nobjective\
    \ \nof \nNative \nand \nnation-wide \ngovernments is to form a protected culture\
    \ by \nensuring community security and by designing crisis \ncontrol precisely.\
    \ The community sanctuary facilities \nShakir Khan, Mohammed Altayar/International\
    \ Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n109 \n\
    \ \ncomprise the preservation of community order, the \navoidance and defense\
    \ of nations, and the protection \nof the community and private belongings. Disaster\
    \ \norganization supports the people in planning for and \nhandling natural or\
    \ artificial tragedies, such as \nbiological leaks, torrents, storms, earthquakes,\
    \ \ncyclones, floods, and the loss of the electrical power \nnetwork \nsupply\
    \ \nto \nan \nend-user. \nThe \nIoT \ncompromises \nelucidations \nfor \nobserving\
    \ \nplus \nundertaking such disaster situations (Borgia, 2014). \nStatistics combined\
    \ from security cameras placed \ninside the town and on individual legal resident’s\
    \ \nstrategies permit continuous cinematic observation \nand defensive observation\
    \ facilities even though \nserving the forces as a mechanism for community \n\
    direction in the circumstance of sporting occasions, \nharmonious shows, and politically\
    \ aware gatherings. \nThe security of isolated, in addition, community \nconstructions\
    \ (e.g., malls, workshops) can be \nprotected with the use of device technology\
    \ that will \nactivate during disturbances. Crisis processes can be \nvalue-added\
    \ \nand \nreinforced \nby \ncustom \nIoT \ntechnologies. Presently, the emergency\
    \ system is \ndeficient in exact facts about disaster sites. Devoted \ndevices\
    \ and smart camcorder along with GPS and to \ncommunicate without using cables\
    \ and wireless \ntechnologies providing real-time localization and \ntracking\
    \ can be used to form a complete map of the \nevent to forecast its trends (e.g.,\
    \ direction and/or \nspeed of fire spread, major risk areas), and thus to \nestablish\
    \ a dynamic emergency plan to coordinate \nthe rescue operations. Let's take an\
    \ example of an \nintensity in an office block somewhere the entry is \nprearranged\
    \ over and done with e-cards. If \nindividuals have to put-down their individual\
    \ access \ncards to cross the threshold of the building, the \nladder man will\
    \ identify the precise digit of persons \nin the construction and anywhere they\
    \ are located (if \nthe structure has a localization scheme) and are \nintelligent\
    \ to escort people in the direction of the \nclosest escape road or to escort\
    \ firefighters to except \nstuck people. Furthermore, records from wireless \n\
    cinematic cameras and other equipment installed on \nthe firefighters’ helmets\
    \ will deliver real-time \nstatistics on the fire development to estimate the\
    \ \nfinest seepage routes and/or construction downfall \ntime. Agitations are\
    \ caused by habiliment sensors on \nfirefighters (Borgia, 2014). \n2.8. IoT for\
    \ physically challenged persons \nIoT can be fantastically helpful for resolving\
    \ the \ndifficulties of physically or specially challenged \npeople in their everyday\
    \ life. Innovative IoT-built \nInternet or network managed applications can be\
    \ \nplanned while observing the strategies of the \nDepartment of Empowerment\
    \ of Persons with \nDisabilities (DEPwD) [Ministry of Social Justice and \nEmpowerment],\
    \ which has an ongoing Reachable \nIndia Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan), a\
    \ cross-\ncountry movement to recognize universal suitability \nfor \nPhysically\
    \ \nChallenged \nand \nPersons \nwith \nDisabilities (PwDs) (Chaudhary et al.,\
    \ 2019). Fig. 4 \nshows Figurative Depiction of Applications of IoT for \nPhysically\
    \ Challenged Persons. \n \n \nFig. 4: Figurative depiction of applications of\
    \ IoT for physically challenged persons (Chaudhary et al., 2019) \n \n3. IoT challenges\
    \ \nThe use and adoption of the IoT are likely to \nresult in a number of challenging\
    \ issues that need \nconsideration. This is due to a number of factors, \nincluding\
    \ the mushrooming number and type of \ndevices and sensors, the vast amount of\
    \ sensitive \ndata generated by people and smart objects, and the \ngrowing number\
    \ of emerging products and services \naffecting people’s daily lives (Dixit et\
    \ al., 2015). \nResearchers have addressed various challenges and \nShakir Khan,\
    \ Mohammed Altayar/International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1)\
    \ 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n110 \n \nproblems associated with the IoT. The following\
    \ is a \ndiscussion of these issues. \n \n3.1. Confidentiality, security, and\
    \ privacy issues \nSecurity gaps that occur in traditional IT systems \nare likely\
    \ to be present in the IoT environment but \nnot addressed very well. Since IoT\
    \ devices generate, \ncollect and distribute a huge amount of data, and \npart\
    \ of this data is about users and their behaviors, \ninteractions, and habits,\
    \ it is not surprising to find \nthat security and privacy are some of the most\
    \ \nimportant issues that need consideration (Dixit et al., \n2015; Padyab and\
    \ Ståhlbröst, 2018; Xu et al., 2018; \nHusein, 2019). The adoption of new business\
    \ models \nand applications that are based on the IoT requires \nrobust security\
    \ and privacy measures (Chaudhary et \nal., 2019). This is because the IoT is\
    \ based on the \nexisting wireless sensor networks (WSN); therefore, \nit inherits\
    \ the common security and privacy issues \nassociated with WSN (Husein, 2019).\
    \ According to \nWeber (2010), four broad areas related to security \nand privacy\
    \ requirements must be addressed, \nincluding resistance to attacks, data authentication,\
    \ \nand access control, and client privacy. Similarly, \nother researchers have\
    \ reported a number of \nsecurity and privacy issues, including identification,\
    \ \nconfidentiality, \nintegrity, \nnon-repudiation \nauthentication and authorization,\
    \ cryptographic \nsecurity services, trustworthiness, and the message \nintegrity\
    \ (Vermesan and Friess, 2013; Chaudhary et \nal., 2019; Husein, \n2019). Furthermore,\
    \ \nsome \nresearchers have addressed security and privacy \nissues from a legal\
    \ perspective and suggested that \ndata collection, sharing, and distribution\
    \ via IoT \nsensors, applications, and networks must be \nconducted within existing\
    \ policies, laws, and \nregulations, as there is a lack of laws at national and\
    \ \ninternational levels that govern IoT practices \n(Weber, 2010; Ahlmeyer and\
    \ Chircu, 2016; Ma et al., \n2018). \n3.2. Data management \nThe nature of the\
    \ IoT is dynamic and consists of \ndifferent devices, \nsensors, \nplatforms,\
    \ \nand \napplications that operate across various networks. In \naddition, it\
    \ generates, collects, stores, processes, and \ndistributes huge amounts of data\
    \ across different \nnetworks, \nwhich \nrequires \ndata \nmanagement \nframeworks\
    \ (Borgia, 2014; Padyab and Ståhlbröst, \n2018; Gruen et al., 2002; Alam and Al\
    \ Riyami, 2018). \nThus, the IoT requires dedicated data management \ntechniques\
    \ that fit with its nature. This is because \ntraditional database management\
    \ techniques lag and \nmay not satisfy the complex nature and needs of an \nIoT\
    \ environment that can span global networks \n(Gruen et al., 2002; Husein, 2019).\
    \ At present, most \nframeworks \napply \nan \nintegrated \nsystem \nfor \noffloading\
    \ data and information that conducts \ncomputationally intensive tasks on a worldwide\
    \ \ncloud platform. Thus, several researchers have \nproposed some IoT data management\
    \ frameworks \nfor different purposes. Gruen et al. (2002) have \ndeveloped a\
    \ distributed data management scheme \nfor storing data in an industrial IoT environment.\
    \ \nFurthermore, (Gruen et al., 2002) provided a data \nmanagement framework that\
    \ focuses on three key \nfunctions of handling data: data collection, data \n\
    storage, and data processing. Moreover, Rao and \nShorey (2017) have developed\
    \ a data aggregation \nmodel based on device-to-device data transmission. \nAnother\
    \ issue related to data management is the \navailability of data center technologies\
    \ to manage \ndata. According to Padyab and Ståhlbröst (2018), \nthere is a greater\
    \ need for different aggregate kinds \nof data generated by loT sensors and devices\
    \ in \nsmaller, multiple, distributed data centers so that \ninitial processing\
    \ can be conducted to provide \ncapture and response values in real-time. These\
    \ \ninclude big data centers, distribution data centers, \nand micro data centers.\
    \ \n3.3. Machine-to-machine communication and \nmessaging \nThe nature of the\
    \ IoT requires constant \ncommunication between different kinds of devices \n\
    and other communication systems, which is very \nchallenging (Borgia, 2014; Alam\
    \ and Al Riyami \n2018). In addition, there is no standard for an open \nIoT communication\
    \ protocol, which may further \ncomplicate the communication process (Husein,\
    \ \n2019). Communication protocols are key elements \nfor IoT devices, sensors,\
    \ and applications as they \nrepresent the main support for data flow and traffic\
    \ \namong internal and external networks (Husein, \n2019). Basically, research\
    \ has been focussed on two \nbroad categories related to M2M: The routing issues\
    \ \nand the end to end reliability (Borgia, 2014). While \nseveral MAC protocols\
    \ have been proposed for \ndifferent types of domains with frequency division\
    \ \nmultiple access, carrier sense multiple access, and \ntime division multiple\
    \ access for small traffic \ncompetence that is accident-free, more integrated\
    \ \ncircuits in nodes are correspondingly essential \n(Husein, 2019). Borgia (2014)\
    \ reviewed and \ndiscussed the M2M communications challenges in \nthe context\
    \ of the IoT thoroughly. \n3.4. Interoperability \nThe interoperability issue\
    \ has been widely \nreported \nin \nthe \nIoT \nliterature \n(Padyab \nand \n\
    Ståhlbröst, 2018; Vermesan and Friess, 2013). In the \nIoT environment, interoperability\
    \ among different \nkinds of data, networks, applications, and services is \n\
    a requirement (Borgia, 2014; Díaz et al., 2016). The \nnature \nof \nthe \nIoT\
    \ \nis \nvery \ncomplex, \nand \ninteroperability is a key challenge (Gubbi et\
    \ al., \n2013; Borgia, 2014; Shin and Park 2017). This is due \nto the fact that\
    \ IoT operation requires large and \nvarious devices at different levels; thus,\
    \ it must have \nthe ability to communicate and exchange data \nbetween these\
    \ devices (Padyab and Ståhlbröst, \nShakir Khan, Mohammed Altayar/International\
    \ Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences, 8(1) 2021, Pages: 104-113 \n111 \n\
    \ \n2018; Díaz et al., 2016). In general, there are four \ntypes \nof \ninteroperability:\
    \ \nTechnical, \nsyntactic, \nsemantic, \nand \norganizational \ninteroperability\
    \ \n(Čolaković and Hadžialić, 2018). Another challenging \nissue is how interoperability\
    \ can be achieved across \nlegacy systems, achieving consistent integration and\
    \ \ninteroperability \nof \nvirtual \nand \nreal \nsensors \n(Vermesan and Friess,\
    \ 2013). \n3.5. Reliability, availability, and robustness \nThe reliability and\
    \ availability of an IoT service is \na significant challenge. It depends upon\
    \ the \nconsistency and obtainability of the communication. \nNodes in the IoT\
    \ might experience problems and \nfailure for various reasons, including software\
    \ bugs, \nlimited energy, hardware failure, and malicious \nattacks. Thus, the\
    \ reliability and robustness of \nservices are an important and challenging issue\
    \ \n(Alam and Al Riyami, 2018). The consequence of any \nloss of communication\
    \ may be enormous financial \nfatalities, or it may even risk lives, in the case\
    \ of \nIndustry 4.0 and an intelligent transportation \nsystem, respectively.\
    \ This problem may occur due to \ntwo reasons, either device failure or link failure.\
    \ For \nlink failure, there may be different solutions, but the \nprovision of\
    \ buffering or caching and the use of \ndynamic spectrum access are the prominent\
    \ ones \nthat can be pursued. In the case of device failure, \nredundancy in devices\
    \ can be introduced. This \ncalculation and placement must be done during the\
    \ \nplanning phase (Islam et al., 2015). The same \nsolution can also help in\
    \ the mobile maintenance of \nthe services. The modern IoT as a challenge for\
    \ \nhigher education (Khan, 2018) is the acceptance of \nthe IoT in the industry\
    \ (the so-called Industry \nInternet of Things [IIoT]) and the requirements for\
    \ \nhigher education in the period of the fourth \nindustrial revolution. ‘IIoT’\
    \ is similar to another \nterm, ‘Industry 4.0’. \n3.6. Technological architecture\
    \ issues \nThe IoT is still an evolving practice, and in order \nto utilize it\
    \ effectively, there is a need to develop, \nmaintain and integrate a robust technological\
    \ \narchitecture, including cloud computing, wireless \ntechnologies, artificial\
    \ intelligent sensors, machine \nlearning, blockchain, big data analysis techniques,\
    \ \nserver technologies, and data center technologies, \nwhich is very challenging\
    \ (Borgia, 2014; Čolaković \nand Hadžialić, 2018; Alam and Al Riyami, 2018). IoT\
    \ \nsystems should be developed within open IoT \ntechnological \narchitecture\
    \ \nthat \nensures \nthe \nintegration \nof \nvarious \ntechnologies, \nmobility,\
    \ \nscalability, \ninteroperability, \nopenness, \nand \nmodularity in a heterogeneous\
    \ environment and \nservice continuity (Čolaković and Hadžialić, 2018). \nOverall,\
    \ the technological architecture that needs to \nbe addressed is related to general\
    \ architecture, \nprocess architecture, software architecture, and \nhardware/network\
    \ architecture (Whitmore et al., \n2015; Čolaković and Hadžialić, 2018). \n3.7.\
    \ Standardisation \nTo improve the IoT’s efficiency, it needs to rely on \nunified\
    \ standards, and this is very challenging due to \nthe difficulty in making one\
    \ single standard for the \nIoT around the world (Whitmore et al., 2015). This\
    \ is \nbecause the IoT is a complex system that requires \nthe \nconnection \n\
    and \ninterconnection \nof \nheterogeneous sensors, devices, actuators, software,\
    \ \nsystems, and networks, all of which have their own \nunique protocols to communicate,\
    \ exchange and \nshare data. Although there has been some progress \nregarding\
    \ the development of some standards, for \nexample, Open loT Stack for Java by\
    \ Eclipse's \nfoundation, the ongoing standardization initiative at \nETSI and\
    \ oneM2M, there is still a lack of common \nstandards, which is one of the main\
    \ challenges faced \nby the IoT (Padyab and Ståhlbröst, 2018; Aloi et al., \n\
    2017). According to Gubbi et al. (2013), key \nstandardization bodies such as\
    \ W3C, ITU, ETSI, IETF, \nIEEE, OneM2M, OASIS, and NIST are involved in the \n\
    development of the IoT standards. \n4. Conclusion \n \nIoT is an emerging technology\
    \ that promises to \ndeliver unique services that will impact different \naspects\
    \ of our lives. The multifaceted nature of the \nIoT and its wide dependence on\
    \ a large number of \nvarious devices, objects, technologies, and platforms \n\
    has made it possible to be utilized in different \ndomains and areas of contemporary\
    \ society. This \npaper \nintroduced \na \nreview \nof \nthe \npossible \napplications\
    \ of IoT and its associated challenges. It \nwas \nintended \nto \nprovide \n\
    researchers \nand \npractitioners with some knowledge of the current \nthinking\
    \ about this emerging topic (IoT applications \nand challenges). Since several\
    \ governments around \nthe globe have shown interest in the idea of the IoT \n\
    by providing further funding to the topic that \nenables further investigation,\
    \ several future research \nareas can be outlined. One possible area is how the\
    \ \nIoT can be used in the different areas mentioned in \nthis study. \nAnother\
    \ research avenue could focus on one of \nthe challenging issues associated with\
    \ IoT adoption \nand utilization. Moreover, since IoT applications are \na relatively\
    \ new phenomenon, more research is \nneeded to address how it can be applied in\
    \ different \nareas of our lives, as well as researching challenges \nin different\
    \ countries around the world, such as \nsecurity and privacy issues, data management,\
    \ \nmachine-to-machine \ncommunication, \ninteroperability, \nreliability \nand\
    \ \navailability, \ntechnological \narchitecture \nissues \nand \nstandardization.\

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\

    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\
    \ literature.\nTable 4. Smart farming routing protocols.\nRouting Protocols\n\

    \ to route data packets.\n4.2. The Encapsulation Layer\nMost of the current agro-environmental\
    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ access them remotely from\nany geographical location.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n14 of 25\n6. The Application Layer\nBased on the proposed precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    \ less \ntech-savvy or have limited exposure to digital tools. \n10 \nInequality\
    \ and \nSocioeconomic \nDivides \nTechnology-based \nvalue \ncreation \ncan \n\
    exacerbate \nexisting \nsocioeconomic divides. Customers with limited access to\
    \ technology or \ndigital skills may be left behind, unable to fully benefit from\
    \ the \nconvenience and opportunities provided by technology. This can \nperpetuate\
    \ inequalities and create a digital divide between different \ncustomer segments.\
    \ \n \nThus, technology-based value creation in business organizations brings\
    \ about disadvantages for \ncustomers, including a lack of personal interaction,\
    \ technical issues, privacy concerns, information \noverload, limited control,\
    \ digital exclusion, standardization, social disconnect, learning barriers, and\
    \ \nsocioeconomic divides. Recognizing and addressing these disadvantages is important\
    \ for businesses \nto ensure inclusive and customer-centric approaches to technology\
    \ implementation. \n \n8.8 Disadvantages of Technology based Value creation in\
    \ Business Organizations from \nOrganizations Point of view: \nWhile technology-based\
    \ value creation in business organizations offers numerous benefits, there are\
    \ \nalso some disadvantages from an organizational point of view. Some of the\
    \ prominent disadvantages \nare listed in Table 18.  \n \nTable 18: Disadvantages\
    \ of technology based value creation from Organizational point of view \nS. \n\
    No. \nKey Issue \nExplanation \n1 \nHigh Initial \nInvestment Costs \nImplementing\
    \ technology-driven solutions often requires a significant \nupfront investment.\
    \ Businesses need to invest in hardware, software, \ninfrastructure upgrades,\
    \ and employee training. The costs associated \nwith acquiring and implementing\
    \ technology can strain the \norganization's budget, particularly for small or\
    \ resource-constrained \nbusinesses. \n2 \nComplexity and \nIntegration \nChallenges\
    \ \nAdopting new technologies can be complex and challenging for \norganizations.\
    \ Integration with existing systems and processes can be a \ntime-consuming and\
    \ complicated task. The need to reconfigure \nworkflows and align technology with\
    \ business objectives may disrupt \noperations and require significant effort\
    \ to ensure seamless integration. \n3 \nDependency on \nTechnology and \nVulnerability\
    \ \nOverreliance on technology can create vulnerability for organizations. \n\
    Technical failures, cyber-attacks, or system outages can bring \noperations to\
    \ a halt, resulting in financial losses and reputational \ndamage. Organizations\
    \ need contingency plans and backup systems to \nmitigate risks and minimize disruptions\
    \ caused by technology failures. \n4 \nSkills Gap and \nWorkforce \nReskilling\
    \ \nTechnology-driven solutions often require specialized skills and \nexpertise.\
    \ Organizations may face challenges in finding employees with \nthe necessary\
    \ technical knowledge or may need to invest in reskilling \nexisting employees.\
    \ Bridging the skills gap can be time-consuming and \ncostly, especially if the\
    \ technology landscape rapidly evolves. \nInternational Journal of Applied Engineering\

    \ \nPAGE 273 \n \n \n \n5 \nData Privacy and \nSecurity Risks \nThe collection,\
    \ storage, and processing of customer data present \nsignificant privacy and security\
    \ risks. Organizations must invest in \nrobust cybersecurity measures and comply\
    \ with data protection \nregulations to protect sensitive information. Failure\
    \ to safeguard \ncustomer data can result in legal liabilities, financial penalties,\
    \ and \nreputational damage. \n6 \nResistance to \nChange and \nEmployee \nMorale\
    \ \nIntroducing technology-based solutions may face resistance from \nemployees\
    \ who fear job displacement or feel overwhelmed by new \ntechnologies. Resistance\
    \ to change can impact employee morale, job \nsatisfaction, and productivity.\
    \ Organizations need to manage change \neffectively, provide adequate training\
    \ and support, and communicate \nthe benefits of technology adoption to gain employee\
    \ buy-in. \n7 \nSystem \nComplexity and \nMaintenance \nAdopting technology-driven\
    \ solutions often leads to increased system \ncomplexity. Multiple software applications,\
    \ integrations, and \ndependencies can make it challenging to manage and maintain\
    \ the \ntechnology infrastructure. Regular updates, troubleshooting, and \ntechnical\
    \ support are necessary to ensure smooth operations, which can \nstrain IT resources\
    \ and budgets. \n8 \nOveremphasis on \nEfficiency over \nHuman \nInteraction \n\
    Technology-driven solutions may prioritize efficiency and automation, \npotentially\
    \ diminishing the importance of human interaction. \nCustomers may feel disconnected\
    \ or frustrated when they cannot access \npersonalized assistance or when their\
    \ interactions are solely with \nautomated systems. This can impact customer satisfaction\
    \ and loyalty. \n9 \nRapid \nTechnological \nObsolescence \nTechnology evolves\
    \ at a rapid pace, making investments in technology \nsusceptible to obsolescence.\
    \ Businesses must continually monitor and \nassess emerging technologies to remain\
    \ competitive. Outdated \ntechnology can become a hindrance, requiring additional\
    \ investments \nto upgrade or replace systems. \n10 \nEthical \nConsiderations\
    \ \nand Social \nImpact \nTechnology-based value creation can raise ethical considerations\
    \ and \nimpact society at large. Organizations must navigate the potential \n\
    consequences of their technological choices, such as the impact on \nemployment,\
    \ privacy, and social equity. Failing to address these ethical \nconsiderations\
    \ can lead to backlash from customers, employees, and the \npublic. \n \nThus,\
    \ technology-based value creation in business organizations brings about disadvantages\
    \ from an \norganizational point of view, including high initial investment costs,\
    \ complexity and integration \nchallenges, dependency and vulnerability, skills\
    \ gap, data privacy and security risks, resistance to \nchange, system complexity\
    \ and maintenance, overemphasis on efficiency, rapid technological \nobsolescence,\
    \ and ethical considerations [298]. Understanding and effectively managing these\
    \ \ndisadvantages is crucial for organizations to maximize the benefits of technology\
    \ and mitigate \npotential drawbacks [299]. \n9. CONCLUSION :   \nThe role of\
    \ twelve ICCT Underlying Technologies including AI, Blockchain, Business intelligence,\
    \ \nCloud computing, Cyber security, 3D printing, IoT, Quantum computing, Mobile\
    \ marketing, \nInformation storage technology, Ubiquitous education technology,\
    \ and VR & AR for Business Value \nCreation like Innovation and Differentiation,\
    \ Customer focus, Operational efficiency, Strategic \nPartnerships and Alliances,\
    \ Talent Management, Effective Marketing and Branding, Financial \nPerformance\
    \ and Growth, Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, and Adaptability\
    \ and \nAgility are discussed. The advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages\
    \ of Technologies based \nValue creation from various stakeholders’ point of view\
    \ are analysed. The impact of ICCT underlying \ntechnologies on business value\
    \ creation in organizations are also determined using relevant \ninformation collection\
    \ & evaluation. New knowledge and interpretation are presented on how to create\
    \ \nbusiness value for long time sustainability by organizations in every industry.\

    deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional agriculture,
    the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture, has come.
    Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation.
    However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development of
    agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three typical
    development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture,
    and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications
    are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications,
    6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving,
    blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management,
    physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and
    discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed
    and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information
    technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment
    as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based
    on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that
    agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies
    (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management
    system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
    security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research
    directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica

    Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry in the world,
    and it plays an important role in social stability and economic development [1].
    Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion and the limited
    grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number of studies on smart
    agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both the improvement in
    productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress of science and
    technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is used to help readers
    understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture development
    (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the traditional
    agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human and animal
    resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of operation.
    • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century), the
    main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era of
    high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the main
    issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart agriculture
    (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is mainly marked
    by the use of modern information technology to both serve agriculture and develop
    it intelligently. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

  explanation: 'The paper you are reviewing focuses on the importance of deploying
    heterogeneous networks of IoT sensors to collect data in support of automated
    irrigation systems. The evaluation metric used in this paper is "relevance," as
    it pertains to the outline point provided.


    The use of IoT sensors is discussed in the section of the paper titled "7.2 Advanced
    Monitoring Techniques for Automated Irrigation Systems." The authors of this paper
    explicitly mention that one IoT application is to collect real-time data from
    environmental sensors. These sensors can measure soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and plant health, and the data can be used to adjust irrigation schedules in real-time.
    This supports the necessity to deploy a heterogeneous network of IoT sensors,
    as different sensors are used to collect different types of data, and this paper
    focuses on the overall use of IoT sensors for collecting environmental data related
    to irrigation system management.'

    \a\nAbstract: It took some time indeed, but the research evolution and transformations\
    \ that occurred\nin the smart agriculture ﬁeld over the recent years tend to constitute\
    \ the latter as the main topic\nof interest in the so-called Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) domain. Undoubtedly, our era is characterized\nby the mass production\
    \ of huge amounts of data, information and content deriving from many\ndifferent\
    \ sources, mostly IoT devices and sensors, but also from environmentalists, agronomists,\n\
    winemakers, or plain farmers and interested stakeholders themselves. Being an\
    \ emerging ﬁeld,\nonly a small part of this rich content has been aggregated so\
    \ far in digital platforms that serve as\ncross-domain hubs. The latter offer\
    \ typically limited usability and accessibility of the actual content\nitself\
    \ due to problems dealing with insufﬁcient data and metadata availability, as\
    \ well as their quality.\nOver our recent involvement within a precision viticulture\
    \ environment and in an effort to make\nthe notion of smart agriculture in the\
    \ winery domain more accessible to and reusable from the\ngeneral public, we introduce\
    \ herein the model of an aggregation platform that provides enhanced\nservices\
    \ and enables human-computer collaboration for agricultural data annotations and\
    \ enrichment.\nIn principle, the proposed architecture goes beyond existing digital\
    \ content aggregation platforms\nby advancing digital data through the combination\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence automation and creative\nuser engagement, thus facilitating\
    \ its accessibility, visibility, and re-use. In particular, by using\nimage and\
    \ free text analysis methodologies for automatic metadata enrichment, in accordance\
    \ to the\nhuman expertise for enrichment, it offers a cornerstone for future researchers\
    \ focusing on improving\nthe quality of digital agricultural information analysis\
    \ and its presentation, thus establishing new\nways for its efﬁcient exploitation\
    \ in a larger scale with beneﬁts both for the agricultural and the\nconsumer domains.\n\

    \ agriculture sector has evolved tremendously towards the bridging\nof two separate\
    \ worlds: information technologies and primitive agriculture. In this framework,\n\
    smart agriculture followed the general tendency and became part of the so-called\
    \ digital evolution in\nthe form primarily of massive digitization, as well as\
    \ annotation, activities, along with actions towards\nmultimedia content generation\
    \ from all possible sources. The latter resulted into an obvious problem\nof our\
    \ epoch, i.e., the one of information overload. Initiatives to aggregate the digital\
    \ content resulted\nin the solution of the so-called traditional digital platforms.\
    \ Typically, such a traditional platform\noperates as a cross-domain hub, making\
    \ the content accessible to its users, independently on whether\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 149; doi:10.3390/info10040149\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/information\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 149\n2 of 27\nthe latter are considered to be content producers (e.g.,\
    \ farmers or smart agriculture stakeholders) or\nconsumers (e.g., the general\
    \ public). Among the characteristics of the platform is the fact that data and\n\
    information are made available for search and study. Additional applications and\
    \ web services may\nreuse and re-purpose the data, whereas the main strength of\
    \ such platforms lay in the vast number of\ncontent items they contain.\nOf course,\
    \ not all issues are tackled efﬁciently by such a traditional digital platform.\
    \ In most cases,\nthey offer limited usability and accessibility due to their\
    \ insufﬁcient data and metadata quality. As it is\nthe case with many information\
    \ technology sub-domains, there is a variety of factors that affects the\nquality\
    \ of smart agriculture data and metadata:\n•\nlack of structured and rich descriptive\
    \ metadata;\n•\ncomplex, heterogeneous, and multi-channel aggregation workﬂows;\n\
    •\npossible shortcomings in the data providing process (surpassing manual quality\
    \ control of\nautomatic metadata generation in digital repositories);\nThese are\
    \ some of the main causes that result in poor information descriptions. This drawback\n\
    highly affects the accessibility, visibility and dissemination range of the available\
    \ digital content. It also\nlimits the potential of added-value services and applications\
    \ that re-use the available resources in\ninnovative ways, also limiting the overall\
    \ user experience in the process. On top of that, metadata\nquality improvement\
    \ usually faces another important problem, i.e., the problem of scale, since\n\
    improving the metadata quality coming from different sources often requires a\
    \ huge amount of\ntime, effort, and resources that aggregators cannot afford.\n\
    In this framework, metadata enrichment services through automated metadata processing\
    \ and\nfeature extraction, possibly along with crowd-sourcing annotation services,\
    \ available in a centralized\nway through a dedicated platform can offer a remarkable\
    \ opportunity for improving the metadata\nquality of digital smart agriculture\
    \ content stored in such typical platforms, while at the same time\nengaging users\
    \ and raising awareness about smart agriculture assets. In this work, we focus\
    \ on a\nviticulture-friendly (Figure 1), cooperative, content sourcing, publication\
    \ platform, aiming to enrich and\nimprove metadata quality, facilitate the exploration,\
    \ visibility, and promote digital content reprocessing\nthrough various smart\
    \ farming applications. Our project targets various types of users from the\n\
    viticulture domain with different levels of expertise and, in addition, offers\
    \ enriched capabilities\nbased on present resources deploying the platform’s existing\
    \ interfaces. The platform offers metadata\nmanagement and organization in collections\
    \ and introduces the concept of spaces, deﬁned to enable\ndata visualization based\
    \ on various intuitive levels of aggregation. Through linked data principles and\n\
    automated metadata processing services that aim to amend acquirable web resources,\
    \ while improving\nthe quality of metadata. Finally, it offers the possibility\
    \ to interested stakeholders to launch ad-hoc\ncrowd-sourcing campaigns with measurable\
    \ results, thus mobilizing and engaging users to execute\nuseful tasks for the\
    \ enrichment and validation of selected smart agriculture metadata (e.g., by adding\n\
    annotations such as semantic tagging, image tagging, geo-tagging, or by validating\
    \ existing annotations\nthrough up-voting or down-voting within user-friendly\
    \ and engaging ways).\nFinally, the rest of this paper is structured as follows:\
    \ Section 2 provides an overview of the\nsmart agriculture domain by illuminating\
    \ some related pioneer works, as well as illustrating the\noverall precision viticulture\
    \ domain. Section 3 focuses on the design and architecture of the enhanced\nplatform\
    \ and its constituent parts. It also provides a detailed description of the data\
    \ management\napproach in terms of semantic heterogeneity handling (Section 3.1),\
    \ content search and aggregation\nworkﬂow (Section 3.2), including the organization\
    \ and management of content in terms of collections\nand spaces, as well as content\
    \ metadata generation and enrichment methodologies adopted in the\nplatform (Section\
    \ 3.3). Finally, Section 4 concludes the work and addresses a couple of future\
    \ works\nwith respect to the platform’s evolution over time.\nInformation 2019,\

    \ Overview\nOver recent years, big data technologies have pushed high-performance\
    \ computing in the\ndirection of implementing machine learning (ML) for the further\
    \ development of data science\nin multi-disciplinary agri-technologies. Thus,\
    \ several ML models have been deployed within the\nagricultural production systems,\
    \ with their main focus being on approaches dealing mostly with\ncrop management\
    \ through artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) [1]. Smart agriculture, in the form\
    \ of\nmachine learning to sensor data, has evolved into an automated decision\
    \ making under the scope of\nproduction improvement [2]. The correlation of agricultural\
    \ data is based mainly on feature extraction\nrelated to the domain of study and\
    \ deﬁnes the use of proper ML tool and consequently rule setting.\nConsequently,\
    \ ML applications in agriculture tend to require indispensable tools and methods\
    \ that\nmeet the speciﬁcations of the data model that will be deployed in a speciﬁc\
    \ case study.\n2.1. Pioneer Works on Smart Agriculture/viticulture\nNew and emerging\
    \ technologies and methodologies,\nsuch as cloud computing and\ncrowd-sourcing,\
    \ aid today’s farmers towards an overall better performance of their owned farming\n\
    resources. In this framework, the notion of precision agriculture, in general,\
    \ and precision viticulture—\nwhen focusing solely on vineyards—in particular,\
    \ is precision farming applied to optimize the overall\nperformance, while minimizing\
    \ environmental impacts and risk [3]. In viticulture, for instance,\nthis is accomplished\
    \ by measuring local variation in factors that inﬂuence grape yield and quality\n\
    (i.e., soil, topography, micro-climate, vine health) and applying appropriate\
    \ viticulture management\npractices (i.e., trellis design, pruning, fertilizer\
    \ application, irrigation, timing of harvest) [4,5]. Precision\nviticulture is\
    \ based on the premise that high in-ﬁeld variability for factors that affect vine\
    \ growth\nand grape ripening warrants intensive management customized according\
    \ to local conditions. In this\nmanner, Morais et al. [6] studied the effect on\
    \ the quality of the wine of various barrel types during\naging. They developed\
    \ a control protocol for monitoring the chemical composition and quality of\n\
    the produce. The hardware part of the project was implemented through an array\
    \ of sink nodes\nbased on Raspberry Pi model 2, and the software related to the\
    \ development of a prediction model\nwas implemented using the mySENSE IoT platform.\
    \ Morais et al. focused on oxygen consumption\nduring the wine aging process,\
    \ through the discovery of substantial differences between wood barrel\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 149\n4 of 27\ntypes. Remote sensing is a very useful tool for analyzing\
    \ the impact of agro-environmental factors\nin the quality of vine yields. They\
    \ employed satellite-derived prescription maps (PM) from aerial\nimagery through\
    \ the analysis of intra-vineyard variability for vine color (vigor). Normalized\
    \ difference\nvegetation index (NDVI) maps offer surveying capabilities for the\
    \ optimization and further control in\nwine production along with ﬁeld data acquisition.\
    \ They presented a monitoring system that improves\nthe distinctive capability\
    \ for agronomic applications.\nAn application of a real-time monitoring platform\
    \ in viticulture is presented in the work of\nCanete et al. [7]. Their research\
    \ emphasized the control of structural health and ullage of wine\ncasks on the\
    \ wine aging process through detection system for possible crevices on the cask’s\
    \ surface.\nThey managed to gather information from inside the aging containers\
    \ with the introduction of the\nprototype “Smart Cork”, which provides the capability\
    \ to real-time monitor and resolve any issues.\nMore speciﬁcally the sensing device\
    \ was based on IoT technologies and supported by a cloud platform\nand a control\
    \ interface for on-site warning in order to evaluate the suitability of the aging\
    \ process in\nreal time.\nInsular environmental monitoring is a research subject\
    \ was studied by Naumowicz et al. [8].\nThey implemented an IoT platform that\
    \ based on deployed wireless sensor network for three years\ndesign on the scope\
    \ of monitoring seabirds on Skomer Island (UK National Reserve, West Wales).\n\
    Although their application was not speciﬁc to agriculture their research focused\
    \ on the particular\ncharacteristics of insular areas. Their sensory arrangement\
    \ consists of a real-world deployable sensor\nnetwork based on battery powered\
    \ sensor nodes to investigate the habitat of the Manx shearwater\n(Pufﬁnus pufﬁnus)\
    \ seabird.\nMuangprathub et al. [9] proposed an optimization system for water\
    \ supply in agricultural crops.\nThey developed a wireless sensor network infrastructure\
    \ under the scope of controlling and managing\ndata and operations remotely. Furthermore,\
    \ the deployed nodes provided concrete and use full data\nfor irrigation while\
    \ increasing agricultural productivity.\nFinally, to conclude this brief overview\
    \ of related research literature, we should stress the fact\nthat the herein discussed\
    \ approach differs from all the aforementioned depicted in Table 1, in the\nsense\
    \ that it combines on-site soil and atmospheric monitoring based on integrated\
    \ equipment of\nweather instruments. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that\
    \ its gathered data are employed within\na semantic structure for smart viticulture\
    \ through integrated data handling on the scope of current\nstate-of-the-art artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence [10].\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n5 of 27\nTable 1. Overview of\

    \ viticulture is a specialized ﬁeld of smart agriculture aiming at maximizing\
    \ the\noenological potential of winegrape yield. High-quality production areas\
    \ demand the adoption\nof spatially aware management systems that assist the optimization\
    \ of wine quality and yield.\nAdditionally, technological innovations allow specialized\
    \ vineyard management that promotes high\nquality and reduction of environmental\
    \ impact. Furthermore, further advancements on the ﬁeld\nof applied geography\
    \ and information communication technologies (ICT) enhance the probability\nof\
    \ scientiﬁc leaps in precision viticulture. Novel optimized solutions provide\
    \ a plethora of tools\nfor advanced monitoring and control in vine growth. In\
    \ conclusion, smart viticulture aims at the\nexploitation of methods that identify\
    \ high-resolution spatial variability on vine ﬁelds that provide a\nrecommendation\
    \ basis for improved quality, yield, and sustainable management.\nAgricultural\
    \ impact on the environment is reduced through sustainable and efﬁcient practices\n\
    derived from smart farming that permits the management of various agricultural\
    \ factors along with\nenvironmental preservation. It is based on a management\
    \ approach that estimates the localized needs\nof the vineyards, based on heterogeneous\
    \ structural factors of the yield. The managerial requirements\nevolve around\
    \ the variability on the physiological response, strongly related to grape quality,\
    \ which\nin terms of agronomy it will satisfy the efﬁciency and quality of crop\
    \ production. Vineyard spatial\nvariability directs the development of specialized\
    \ tools that assist monitoring and control vine growth\nthrough. These technological\
    \ solutions are based on remote and proximal sensing sensors that monitor\nvineyard\
    \ status, namely water and nutrient availability, plant health and pathogen attacks,\
    \ or soil\nconditions. More speciﬁcally precision viticulture exploits the widest\
    \ range of available sensory\nobservations to interpret high-resolution spatial\
    \ variability within the vineyard, and assist the efﬁcient\nyield management efﬁciency\
    \ in relation to quality, production, and sustainability.\nThe rise of machine\
    \ learning and artiﬁcial intelligence has offered novel tools for vineyard\nmanagement,\
    \ early pest detection, growth stage and the potential quality of vine grapes\
    \ estimation.\nUnmanned aerial vehicles equipped with red-green-blue (RGB) and\
    \ near infrared (NIR) cameras are\ncommonly used in precision viticulture to acquire\
    \ image data that are used to extract color information\nin terms of various indices\
    \ (e.g., excess green index, excess red index, color index of vegetation\nextraction,\
    \ etc.) that are often used to segment the green vegetation regions in remote\
    \ sensing images.\nComputer vision techniques can be applied on remote sensing\
    \ images to extract various color, shape\nand size related features and vegetative\
    \ indices, to estimate canopy features in the ﬁeld, to estimate\ncluster morphology\
    \ which not only impact the cluster architecture and compactness (leading to looser\n\
    or tighter clusters), but are also considered as indicators of grape and wine\
    \ quality. Machine learning\ntechniques combined with machine vision technology\
    \ has been widely used and studied in agriculture\nto identify and detect plants\
    \ (crops and weeds). In viticulture, machine learning approaches are used\ntypically\
    \ for grape and foliage detection, classiﬁcation of early-stage grape yield estimation,\
    \ whereas\nneural networks are used to classify wine samples into different varieties,\
    \ locations, and years of\nproduction. In the following two subsections, we shall\
    \ investigate further research with respect to two\nimportant traits of precision\
    \ viticulture, namely soil management and yield/quality estimation.\n2.3. Utilization\
    \ of Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nOne of the most important and studied sub-ﬁelds of\
    \ the above is soil management because it\nheavily affects the production and\
    \ outcome of the vineyard. One of the ﬁrst integrated works on\nthe subject is\
    \ from Mehdizadeh et al. [12]; the authors investigated the performance of equations\n\
    and soft computing approaches, implementing 16 empirical equations from temperature-based,\
    \ mass\ntransfer-based, radiation-based, and meteorological parameters-based categories.\
    \ More speciﬁcally\nthey calibrated different types of used empirical equations\
    \ and evaluated their performances in\nestimating ETo (reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (mm day−1)). Thereafter, they addressed the capabilities\nof soft computing\
    \ approaches, including multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), support\n\
    vector machines (SVM) and gene expression programming (GEP) and in result they\
    \ conducted a\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n7 of 27\ncomparative analysis between\
    \ empirical equations and the soft computing approaches. Their ﬁndings\nconcluded\
    \ that precise estimation of ETo is required in many ﬁelds related to water and\
    \ aquatic domain,\nwhile testing the effectiveness of the empirical equations.\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence provides a plethora of methodologies on modeling continuous\
    \ and variable\nenvironmental factors. Feng et al. [13] developed an estimation\
    \ model for daily ETo based on\ntemperature data that introduced two models along\
    \ with extreme learning machine (ELM) and\ngeneralized regression neural network\
    \ (GRNN). They gathered data from six meteorological stations\nfrom the Sichuan\
    \ basin (SW China) and thereafter compared them using the ELM and GRNN models\n\
    along with the temperature-based Hargreaves (HG) model. Their data sequence corresponded\
    \ to a\ncalibrated version considering FAO-56 Penman–Monteith ETo as the benchmark,\
    \ that produced two\ndata management scenarios: (1) the models were trained and\
    \ tested using the local data of each station\nand (2) the models were trained\
    \ using the pooled data from all the stations and tested in each station,\nwhich\
    \ were compared against to the well-known empirical Hargreaves models.\nThe development\
    \ of Artiﬁcial Intelligence models for daily ETo estimation solely with temperature\n\
    data was addressed by Feng et al. [13]. More speciﬁcally they introduced two models\
    \ along with ELM\nand GRNN in six meteorological stations from the Sichuan basin,\
    \ in southwest China, and compared\nthe proposed ELM and GRNN with the corresponding\
    \ temperature-based Hargreaves (HG) model\nand its calibrated version considering\
    \ FAO-56 Penman–Monteith ETo as the benchmark. In relation to\nthe implementation\
    \ of the above they considered that the models’ training was based on local weather\n\
    station data and derived data from the all of the stations in total, compared\
    \ altogether against the\nempirical Hargreaves models. Furthermore, the authors’\
    \ research showed the great capabilities for\nETo estimation of ELM and GRNN models,\
    \ mainly because they performed much better than the\noriginal models. In conclusion,\
    \ Feng et al. [13] stated that ELM and GRNN provided a slight better\nperformance\
    \ than the local ELM and GRNN, they render a better ﬁt for ETo estimation methodology\n\
    based on incomplete local meteorological data.\nPrecise estimation of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial for accurate crop-water estimation by\nimplementing machine learning\
    \ (ML) techniques, such as artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs).\nSpeciﬁcally, the\
    \ estimation of weekly reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) was assessed by\
    \ Patil\nand Deka [14] by developing an improved extreme learning machine (ELM)\
    \ algorithm. The authors\nattempted to model the process of evapotranspiration\
    \ in arid regions of India under limited data\nscenario through the evaluation\
    \ of the capabilities of ELM to model the process of evapotranspiration\nand input\
    \ selection. They concluded that the proposed ELM model performed better than\
    \ the\nHargreaves and ANN model, as the best to estimate weekly evapotranspiration\
    \ at Jodhpur and Pali\nweather station, based less human intervention to select\
    \ the optimum model parameters. In addition\nto that the effectiveness of using\
    \ such extrinsic inputs is proved by the evaluation of suitability of\nusing (ETo)\
    \ values from various weather stations modeling the process of evapotranspiration.\n\
    Prediction of daily dew point temperature was studied by Mohammadi et al. [15]\
    \ by proposing an\nextreme learning machine (ELM)-based model. The effectiveness\
    \ of ELM was validated against SVM\nand ANN based on the case studies of daily\
    \ averaged measured databases for two stations in Iran\nwith different climate\
    \ conditions by focusing on the input elements of the physical factors inﬂuencing\n\
    the formation of dew, ﬁve widely available parameters, average air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity,\natmospheric pressure, vapor pressure, and horizontal global\
    \ solar radiation. More speciﬁcally they\ndeployed statistical indicators to provide\
    \ a statistical comparison between the predicted and measured\ndata for three\
    \ modeling techniques to address that the ELM model is superior over SVM and ANN\n\
    for the predictions of daily dew point temperature. In conclusion, the ELM was\
    \ found better to\npredict the nonlinear variations of daily dew point temperature\
    \ in its different ranges by estimating\nthe probability of occurrence of predicted\
    \ values compared to measured data revealed that for both\nstations the probability\
    \ distribution of the predicted values.\nIn principle, it is a rather challenging\
    \ task to perform accurate yield prediction, estimation\nand quality control [16],\
    \ because such factors are affected by environmental variables. Still, many\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n8 of 27\napproaches for enhanced vineyard management\
    \ techniques are introduced, which involve automatic yield\nestimation [17–19],\
    \ grape quality evaluation [20], and grapevine variety identification [21]. In\
    \ a relevant\napproach, Ramos et al. [22] proposed a method of calculating the\
    \ number of fruits on a coffee branch in the\nfield. Their system categorized\
    \ fruits as either harvestable or non-harvestable through identifying their\n\
    number, weight, and maturation percentage non destructively. They were based on\
    \ data obtained from\nmobile devices and image processing algorithms along with\
    \ the development of a dedicated detection\nmethod of masking occluded from un-occluded\
    \ fruits from field images. Ramos et al. produced estimation\nmodels based on\
    \ assessing determination coefficients higher than 0.93 and exploiting direct\
    \ measurements\ncapable of higher coefficient rate, comparable to similar models.\n\
    Taking this a step further, the scope of a machine vision system for automated\
    \ harvesting\nwas studied by Amatya et al. [23] through branch detection used\
    \ morphological features including\norientation, length, and thickness of partially\
    \ visible segments. The authors aimed at detecting cherry\ntree branches during\
    \ full foliage season that support automated cherry harvesting operation using\n\
    mechanical shaking of limbs. Furthermore, they deployed RGB images of cherry tree\
    \ canopies using a\nBayesian classiﬁer for the identiﬁcation of the segmentation\
    \ branch pixels, in which they managed a\nclassiﬁcation accuracy of 89.6%. They\
    \ also implemented noise ﬁltering and grouping techniques of\nthe same branch\
    \ in a speciﬁed neighborhood, along with curve ﬁtting method was then used to\
    \ ﬁt\nan equation through detected branch segments, providing overall accuracy\
    \ in detecting individual\nbranches was by 89.2%. In conclusion, their study showed\
    \ promising results in detecting branches of\nsweet cherry trees during harvest\
    \ season in the presence of full foliage and fruit on their study sample.\nOne\
    \ of the worth-noting works in the ﬁeld is the one by Radhika and M. Shashi [24],\
    \ where they\nexploit support vector machines (SVMs) for the task of predicting\
    \ the maximum daily temperature.\nMoreover, as a baseline, they use a multi-layer\
    \ perceptron (MLP) trained through back-propagation.\nTo accomplish the aforementioned\
    \ prediction task, they rely on weather data provided by the\nUniversity of Cambridge\
    \ for the time period of 2003–2007. Through their experimental ﬁndings, the\n\
    authors showcase that the SVM-based approach, is able to achieve signiﬁcant results,\
    \ thus showcasing\nits suitability for this particular prediction problem.\nSimilarly,\
    \ Gill et al. [25] develop an SVM regression model, in order to predict the moisture\
    \ of soil.\nIn particular, the authors utilize both meteorological, and soil moisture\
    \ data, from 11 weather stations\nfrom the Oklahoma region in the United States,\
    \ for training and testing their prediction model. Finally,\nby comparing their\
    \ proposed model against an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), they showcase its\n\
    efﬁciency. Huuskonen and Oksanen [26] presented a methodology in relation to remote\
    \ soil sampling\nwhile presenting the results on the augmented reality platform.\
    \ Their work intended to reproduce a top\nsoil map with management zones for precision\
    \ farming based on the gaming experience. They deployed\na UAV on pre-destined\
    \ sampling sites in order to create soil maps. The maps feed a platform with content\n\
    that enhances user experience in order to assist agricultural research.\nLastly,\
    \ another novel approach in agriculture was implemented by Fuentes et al. [27]\
    \ in which they\nemployed machine learning models for the categorization of cultivars.\
    \ They used morpho-colorimetry\nand NIR spectroscopy in grapevine leaves in order\
    \ to assess the main differences between cultivars, and\ntheir according levels\
    \ of water stress. The researcher employed automated image analysis under the\
    \ scope\nof morphological and color feature extraction from scanned vine leaves\
    \ along with an AI-based model\n(ANN) for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive ampelography/cultivar\
    \ classification. Fuentes et al. method\nproved to be highly accurate in recognizing\
    \ different cultivar classes in a large sample of vine leaves.\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a brief comparative overview of the above fundamental research efforts. As it\n\
    was the case with previous Table 1, Table 2 includes six columns: The ﬁrst contains\
    \ each work’s\nbibliographic reference number; the second describes the main task\

    \ it should have been made obvious by the previous analysis that through the use\
    \ of\ninnovative new technologies, farmers may be supported in activities related\
    \ to the management of\ntheir crops so that they can achieve higher yields and\
    \ better quality while at the same time they apply\nthe exact amounts of inputs\
    \ (e.g., irrigation water, fertilizers, and pesticides) needed by their crops.\n\
    This not only improves the ﬁnancial beneﬁt of farmers (thanks to the minimized\
    \ production costs),\nbut also minimizes the impact of agriculture on the environment.\
    \ Within this challenging framework,\nthe main motivation behind the creation\
    \ of a viticulture-friendly platform is to utilize different data\nrepositories\
    \ in unison and promote the digital content by enhancing its accessibility and\
    \ discoverability,\nand provide artiﬁcial intelligence based services for further\
    \ analyzing available data (e.g., images\nof various modalities, multi-source\
    \ measurements, sensor data, historical data). Thus the discussed\nplatform can\
    \ be viewed as a complete ecosystem that offers enriched services, aggregates\
    \ content from\nmultiple sources, resolves interoperability issues by performing\
    \ automatic mappings in the back-end,\nimproves metadata quality through linked\
    \ data principles and automated free text and image analysis\nservices where applicable,\
    \ and mobilizes and engages its users (i.e., farmers, winemakers, stakeholders,\n\
    the general public) to execute useful tasks for the enrichment and validation\
    \ of selected metadata,\nas well as the provision and extraction of new information.\
    \ In its core, it is a platform especially\ndesigned with a focus on human-computer\
    \ collaboration with application in the area of viticulture.\nThe latter offers\
    \ a set of services such as content integration, management, retrieval, and curation,\n\
    automatic metadata enrichment, information retrieval and extraction, and inserts\
    \ the human being in\nthe loop in order to accommodate human expertise and intelligence.\n\
    The main characteristics, as well as beneﬁts from the introduction and utilization\
    \ of such a\nplatform may be summarized in the following, whereas a diagrammatic\
    \ overview of the proposed\nplatform is illustrated in Figure 2:\n•\nViticulture\
    \ data are aggregated from multiple repositories and published;\n•\nViticulture\
    \ data are translated into usable information consumable for decision-making purposes;\n\
    •\nHeterogeneous data are translated into the same form using a common data model;\n\
    •\nThe data model is able to actually evolve, so as to include additional requirements,\
    \ data sources\nand other models;\n•\nData can be made more accessible to a wide\
    \ range of users, such as data scientists, business\nanalysts, etc., by granting\
    \ a uniﬁed access to knowledge from multiple sources, thus promoting\nthe viti-cultural\
    \ content;\n•\nData can be queried and queries may be asked in multiple ways that\
    \ haven’t been anticipated\nwhile modeling the data;\n•\nBack-end processing can\
    \ be initiated to extract useful information from translated data;\n•\nViticulture-related\
    \ information is retrieved, stored, extracted and sustained for future use;\n\
    A more descriptive architectural ﬂowchart of the proposed implementation is illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 3. The information ﬂow starts on the left, where related content\
    \ providers (e.g., user archives\nor even libraries of related content) and corresponding\
    \ aggregators provide their content metadata\ndescriptions to the developed platform.\
    \ In principle, this ﬁrst inaugural part of the process tends to be a\nrather\
    \ difﬁcult task, mainly due to the heterogeneity of the various available content\
    \ metadata formats.\nUsing the proposed modular system, the metadata transformation\
    \ module maps and transforms\nthe uploaded data to elements through an automatic\
    \ transformation process. The outcome of this\nmodule remains a transformed version\
    \ of the content metadata. Continuing, translated metadata are\nrepresented as\
    \ KB expressions by exploiting the semantic enrichment module and are then stored\n\
    in the semantic repository module on the upper right corner of the ﬂowchart. It\
    \ is worth noting at\nthis point that all metadata elements are represented within\
    \ the semantic repository as entities of\nthe terminological knowledge. This knowledge\
    \ has the form of an ontology, which is related to both\nvarious popular ontology\
    \ metadata standards, such as Dublin Core or LIDO, as well as to more speciﬁc\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n11 of 27\nterminological axioms providing details about\
    \ crop varieties, categories of agricultural crops, physical\nproperties, numerous\
    \ interrelations, and other important agricultural features. Content providers\n\
    and aggregators develop this type of knowledge in the form of so-called thematic\
    \ terminologies.\nThe exploitation of such knowledge types is then expected to\
    \ happen within the semantic query\nanswering module, responsible for the semantic\
    \ enrichment of the available content metadata, as well\nas for the implementation\
    \ of meaningful reasoning tasks so as to extract efﬁcient related results.\nFigure\
    \ 2. Platform overview.\nFigure 3. Platform architecture ﬂowchart.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 149\n12 of 27\nOur system as a whole is available to test and use\
    \ online (http://withculture.eu/#/custom/ev\ninos) and currently addresses numerous\
    \ kinds of users from various ﬁelds of the viticulture domain\nthat are interested\
    \ in exploiting, analyzing and creatively reusing content through smart tools\
    \ and\napplications. It serves as a multipurpose platform with varying level of\
    \ functionality abstraction\ndepending on the user’s level of expertise. More\
    \ speciﬁcally:\n•\nFor end users: wine lovers, viticulture, enthusiasts, winemakers\
    \ and producers etc., the platform\nserves as an outlet for the breakthrough of\
    \ content and interfaces bonded to propagated\nrepositories. Users can potentially\
    \ create customizable multi-source content (e.g., searched\nthrough multiple viticulture\
    \ repositories), on the scope of further enrichment of dissemination for\nviticulture.\
    \ Customized collections will create a virtual aggregation of data related to\
    \ viticulture\nallowing a straightforward method of presenting popular narratives\
    \ in a web-based environment.\nFurthermore, the platform offers collaborative\
    \ content creation and modiﬁcation within registered\ngroups of users.\n•\nFor\
    \ specialized professionals (from viticulture, agriculture domain, etc.), the\
    \ platform offers the tools to\nsynthesize and construct eclectic collections,\
    \ for the enrichment, optimization, and development\nof specialized semantic knowledge.\n\
    •\nFor viticulture content holders, i.e., winemakers and producers, it offers\
    \ an easy to use content &\nmetadata repository and management system, that can\
    \ ensure interoperability with standards,\nbest practices, and guidelines. Winemakers\
    \ are able to upload their historic data from a speciﬁc\nvineyard, like for instance\
    \ soil data, management data, meteorological information, and actual\nyields per\
    \ season. Data can be stored in the platform’s repository and then plugged into\
    \ the\nsystem’s machine learning models to predict the yield from the coming season,\
    \ even from the\nearly stages of growth.\n•\nFor organizations, the platform offers\
    \ the notion of spaces, i.e., a novel way to organize and promote\ncontent and\
    \ improve its metadata, as well as engage with users through campaigns.\n•\nFor\
    \ aggregators, it provides the MINT (Metadata INTeroperabillity, http://mint.image.ece.ntua.gr\n\
    /redmine/) [28,29], open source, web-based platform. It offers full implementation\
    \ of workﬂows\non the scope of ingestion, formal mapping, transformation, and\
    \ aggregation of metadata records.\n•\nFor developers, it provides a back-end\
    \ toolset for digital content re-usability, employing a fully\nfunctional API\
    \ (api.withculture.eu/assets/developers-lite.html) that disseminates the total\
    \ of the\navailable data and services to anyone willing to utilize for further\
    \ exploitation.\nAbove depiction of the main possible utilization of the platform\
    \ by the aforementioned kinds of\nviticulture users’ expertise depicts the expansion\
    \ capabilities and potential of the proposed system,\nbeing a modular platform\
    \ with varying levels of granularity. The latter may be deﬁned as the lesser or\n\
    greater extent in the description of the expected behavior of the platform, according\
    \ to its functional\nspeciﬁcations and the particular goal associated with its\
    \ requirements and allows for its great impact\nwith respect to making agriculture\
    \ smart using traditional, computer-aided automation, and artiﬁcial\nintelligence\
    \ (AI) based and Internet of things (IoT) technologies.\nThe basic underlying\
    \ system architecture, as already illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, mainly depicts\n\
    the user involvement in the data services of the platform; the latter is designed\
    \ based on an innovative\nhuman-in-the-loop approach, to target the advancement\
    \ of data quality and organization, to offer\ndata services that users can employ\
    \ in order to better manage, retrieve, enrich, and promote their\ndata. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ with the aid of metadata aggregation, collection management, and spaces management\n\
    services, viticulture users can upload, collect, and organize content from several\
    \ sources and also\ncreate interesting data views and presentations and store\
    \ them in the platform’s underlying database.\nMoreover, using the AI-enabled\
    \ metadata extraction services that integrate automatic or semi-automatic\nannotation\
    \ tools (like automatic text analysis, image annotation, etc.), users may select\
    \ interesting ways\nto analyze the relevant content, extract knowledge and develop\
    \ and store new content descriptions.\nFinally, by initiating and managing crowd-sourcing\
    \ campaigns, users may involve other users in\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n13 of\
    \ 27\nrecognition tasks that are difﬁcult for machines to perform (e.g., wine\
    \ variety recognition from a grape\nroe picture), thus further improving the available\
    \ data content descriptions.\nBased on the above system architecture, the platform’s\
    \ user involvement may be summarized\nin four interactive processes, as depicted\
    \ in Figure 4. The content search and the content management\nprocesses that enable\
    \ users to collect content and organize content, as well as the Metadata enrichment\n\
    and the crowd-sourcing processes that enable users to advance content descriptions,\

    \ next subsections, we shall focus on these\nmain processes, providing further\
    \ technical details and use-case examples where applicable.\nFigure 4. User involvement\
    \ in the proposed platform.\n3.1. Handling of Metadata Semantic Heterogeneity\n\
    As the world becomes full of sensor networks producing information, smart viticulture\
    \ enters the\nsomehow “foreign” ﬁelds of data processing, storage and retrieval\
    \ at a fast pace. Through various\nsources of information derived from a wide\
    \ data spectrum (e.g., geo-information, soil measurements,\nweather forecasts,\
    \ chemical analyses, to mention just a few data streams), grapevine-powered\n\
    stakeholders are in a position to grow an extremely rich system of integrated\
    \ Internet of things data to\npower more informed decisions. The main challenge\
    \ lies in the high heterogeneity of data types in the\nagricultural/viticultural\
    \ sector. Agriculture makes use of various data (e.g., research, meteorological,\n\
    soil, ﬁnancial/economic, statistical, satellite/remote sensing, administrative,\
    \ germplasm, crop\nexperiments, and ﬁeld trials, to name a few) and for each data\
    \ type, there are numerous standards\nused. These standards are not always linked\
    \ between each other or at least with the most prominent\none of the sector.\n\
    In principle, all data collected from a viticultural object (i.e., a vineyard,\
    \ parcel, etc.) are stored\nin metadata records. The records are an important\
    \ aspect for documenting and maintaining the\nsemantic interrelations among various\
    \ sources of information. These types are used in querying\nrelevant data like\
    \ viticulture historical data, over long periods of time. It is worth mentioning\
    \ that\nstandardized descriptive metadata enhances the overall search experience\
    \ and render reliable the\nretrieval techniques within or across multiple collections.\
    \ Information management is assisted by\ndescriptive, administrative, technical,\
    \ and preservation metadata, which they ensure data intellectual\nintegrity. Furthermore,\
    \ the primary sector in the now has employed ICT research groups under the\nscope\
    \ of disseminating knowledge related to smart agriculture. Inter-operability introduces\
    \ itself\nas an important factor for management and aggregation of digital resources\
    \ among proprietary\ndata structures. As an effect, many types of software applications\
    \ have evolved implementing\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n14 of 27\nexisting methodologies\
    \ such as crosswalks, translation algorithms, metadata registries, and specialized\n\
    data dictionaries.\nIn the ﬁeld of smart viticulture, in particular, the crosswalk\
    \ provides a mapping of metadata\nentities within various schemata. Metadata deﬁnition\
    \ is highlighted as the precise interpretation\nfor implemented the required framework.\
    \ Furthermore, common elements are hardly distinguished\namong different schemata\
    \ due to existing incompatible records. Tables of equivalent elements serve\n\
    the purpose of crosswalks and, even though the equivalences may be inexact, they\
    \ represent an\nexpert’s judgment on the matter of software processes. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ the conceptual differences are\nimmaterial to the software’s operation that\
    \ involves records encoded in the two models. Therein-after,\nretrieval mechanisms\
    \ support querying capabilities among different data sources that wholly support\n\
    the desired semantic inter-operability of viticulture schemata.\nAn additional\
    \ important factor on the adoption of crosswalks is the support to convertibility\n\
    among data formats. Apart from single point of access or cross-domain searching\
    \ capabilities, the\naggregation of metadata records among varied from viticulture\
    \ sources (e.g., vineyards located in quite\ndistinct geographical areas or producing\
    \ different wine types) presumably creates conﬂicting results.\nIn the case of\
    \ automatically generated metadata, organizations or individuals that did not\
    \ follow best\npractices or standard thesauri and controlled vocabularies in the\
    \ process, provide mapping metadata\nelements from different schemas under the\
    \ scope of cross walking. Furthermore, datatype registration\nand formatting address\
    \ the capabilities of semantic interoperability in relation to the values included\
    \ in\nthe metadata elements (e.g., rules for recording wine types or encoding\
    \ standards for dates) assessing\nthe local authority ﬁles for adopted terminologies.\n\
    As a solution to this issue, we introduce a novel adaptation of the MINT-mapping\
    \ tool that\nprovides an aggregation mechanism on critical activities, such as:\n\
    •\nharvesting and aggregating metadata inputs, created under shared community\
    \ standards or\nproprietary metadata schemata,\n•\nmigrating from providers’standard\
    \ or local models to a reference model,\n•\ntransforming records among intermediate\
    \ standards to pan-European (Europeana Semantic\nElements and the Europeana Data\
    \ Model [30,31]).\n3.2. Content Search and Management\nContent search and management\
    \ is divided into two distinct, yet collaborating parts, namely\ncontent aggregation\
    \ and content collection and spaces management. In the following subsections,\
    \ we shall\ntry to provide a brief overview, together with an illustrative example\
    \ case of their interchangeability.\n3.2.1. Content Aggregation\nThe content aggregation\
    \ task is mainly accomplished through searching in external agricultural\ndigital\
    \ repositories and libraries. In the herein proposed framework, the utilization\
    \ of WITH tool allows\nus to mash-up APIs from different digital resources and\
    \ provide a single, yet powerful, service, which\ngives access to a large set\
    \ of heterogeneous multimedia items (e.g., images, text, different metadata\n\
    schemata, videos). The tool supports a variety of different data models (e.g.,\
    \ EDM, LIDO, etc.)\nand formats (e.g., XML, JSON-LD), and thus resolves most of\
    \ the aforementioned interoperability\nissues. The latter is achieved by integrating\
    \ the tool in the proposed architecture of fully implemented\nworkﬂows or the\
    \ ingestion, formal mapping, transformation and aggregation of viticulture records\
    \ in\nthe back-end through the proposed open-source metadata web-based platform.\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n15 of 27\nThe user interface (UI) of the knowledge\
    \ base platform (http://withculture.eu/#/custom/evinos)\noffers federated and\
    \ faceted search services, which enable its user to apply multiple search criteria\n\
    in different combinations based on the metadata of search results, navigate through\
    \ the results via\ndifferent presentation views and retrieve more information\
    \ about items of interest (see Figure 5).\nOne of the system’s provisions is the\
    \ parallel query into all of the selected repositories, based on a\nspeciﬁc search\
    \ term or phrase, in order to create facets to be used for narrowing down results.\
    \ As most\ndigital data in external repositories are accompanied with rich metadata,\
    \ the user may choose from a\nvariety of specialized ﬁlters such as rights, creator,\
    \ media type and dates, resulting in the desirable\nobjects among thousands of\
    \ others. Figure 6 indicates the improved adaptability that offers the search\n\
    results and facets are accessed through the API, so other developers can include\
    \ the query features\ninto their customized applications.\nFigure 5. User data\
    \ collection.\nFigure 6. Selected item from the collection.\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 149\n16 of 27\nIt worth mentioning that the required data model is based\
    \ on the imported records following\nthe paradigm of major repositories. More\
    \ particularly, the model demands extensions for fulﬁlling\ncompatibility issues\
    \ among various data models. The proposed platform is compliant with Europeana\n\
    data model (EDM) [30,31] and supports two-way transformation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ any\ntype of data amendment is possible to be implemented through its two-way\
    \ transformation\ncapabilities. Regarding the matter of its application programming\
    \ interface, we introduced a common\nsupport framework on serialization types\
    \ (JSON, XML, and RDF). This enhanced share-ability and\nexport-ability of data\
    \ among similar platforms worldwide.\n3.2.2. Collections and Spaces Management\n\
    As a next step, platform users are able to create collections that become available\
    \ under their\nspeciﬁc proﬁle. Data management is implemented through an internal\
    \ data model that assesses record\nimports and transformations in the platform,\
    \ under the scope of collection enrichment through user\ninputs. Particularly\
    \ the system keeps intact the users’ original records in the form of an accessible\n\
    backup and while allowing the amendment of data into their custom collections.\
    \ Along with collections,\nplatform users may organize their content, which was\
    \ either uploaded or collected from external\nrepositories, into exhibitions that\
    \ provide enhanced and more playful visualization features.\nThe platform also\
    \ provides thematic content organization in the so-called spaces. Spaces is a\n\
    concept that corresponds to speciﬁc, access-based views of stored data, enables\
    \ the organization of\ndigital content in different thematic categories and views,\
    \ and allows different ways of interaction\nwith the end-user (e.g., users are\
    \ able to re-use the provided content, comment and share). This added\nfeature\
    \ enables interested wine professionals to design and host custom web spaces in\
    \ order to promote\ntheir content and engage with users. Furthermore, devoted\
    \ expansions of content holder serve the\npurpose of visualizing and disseminating\
    \ on the web digital collections, exhibitions and stories, in\naddition to content\
    \ access and use capabilities made to the public by the platform. Alternatively,\
    \ linked\nopen data (LOD) are published by the means of speciﬁc structures, namely\
    \ the spaces. For the sake\nof efﬁcient organization, content access within a\
    \ space (collections and exhibitions, etc.) is limited\nto speciﬁed user groups.\
    \ The scope of the search engine in each space can be customized as well,\nfor\
    \ example to exclude some sources or, to only search for speciﬁc type of sources,\
    \ such as pictures,\netc.. Individual customization of the individual front-end\
    \ (e.g., descriptive texts, images, CSS) is also\navailable within each space.\n\
    As a case in point, let’s introduce Yorghos, a wine enthusiast fascinated by Greek\
    \ wines of the\nIonian Islands region, who wants to explore and discover relevant\
    \ viticulture artifacts and build,\norganize and contextualize his own related\
    \ library. The ﬁrst thing for Yorghos to do within the\nplatform is to create\
    \ a user proﬁle and to initialize an empty collection, where all the assets will\
    \ be\nsaved in the following. Let us assume that Yorghos owns content from Greek\
    \ wineries, so he uploads\nand curates it by providing some initial metadata,\
    \ such as name, description, and rights. To enrich his\ncollection and add more\
    \ assets, he uses the platform’s search service to look for traditional Greek\
    \ wine\ntypes of the Ionian Islands geographical region, like “Avgoustiatis” and\
    \ “Moschato”. Yorghos collects\nassets from worldwide repositories, such as the\
    \ Digital Public Library of America, Europeana, and the\nEuropean Wine Database\
    \ (http://www.eu-vitis.de/index.php), and further ﬁlters the results by setting\n\
    the preferable rights and mime type illustrated in Figure 7a. From a set of 15\
    \ items returned containing\n“Avgoustiatis”, he opens the ones he is interested\
    \ in, as shown in Figure 7b, reviews related images,\ninspects the accompanying\
    \ metadata and collects the items he wants. Collected items are automatically\n\
    transformed into the platform’s data model, an excerpt of which, is shown in Algorithm\
    \ 1. Yorghos\nmay then observe and manage his collection shown in Figure 7c.\n\

    \ and interlink viticulture data that in principle come from a\nplethora of different\
    \ sources (e.g., sensors, IoT devices), we utilize the platform’s characteristics.\n\
    In particular, the viticulture information that is collected and aggregated in\
    \ the platform initially\ncontains the original metadata that are provided directly\
    \ by the various smart viticulture information\nsources. These are stored in the\
    \ respective representation of each item using the described data model.\nTo allow\
    \ enrichment of these metadata with additional, either manually or automatically\
    \ generated,\nmetadata, the developed platform supports the use of annotations.\n\
    To facilitate annotation creation, retrieval, management, and interoperability,\
    \ the platform includes\na thesauri manager that is responsible for importing,\
    \ through an ofﬂine process, the Linked Data\nvocabularies and datasets that make\
    \ up the pool of potential annotation resources. The thesauri\nmanager converts\
    \ the imported vocabularies from their source format (e.g., SKOS thesauri, OWL\n\
    ontologies, N-triples datasets) to a common model, stores them in the platform’s\
    \ thesauri database\nand indexes them to allow fast search and retrieval. In all\
    \ the above vocabularies and datasets, each\nresource is always accompanied by\
    \ one or more textual labels, possibly in more than one language.\nThese labels\
    \ provide textual representations for the speciﬁc resource and are used for indexing\
    \ the\nresources and facilitating look-up.\nThe herein utilized annotation model\
    \ is based on W3C’s Web Annotation Model [32], which\nis a structured model and\
    \ format to enable annotations to be shared and reused across different\nhardware\
    \ and software platforms. In brief, an annotation consists of an id, a list of\
    \ annotators, a body,\na target, and a list of scores. An annotation may be generated\
    \ either automatically by a content analysis\nsoftware, a web-service etc., or\
    \ manually by a human annotator. Thus, the list of annotators contains\nall relevant\
    \ information about the origins of each annotation. The core part of the annotation\
    \ is its\nbody which identiﬁes the relevant Linked Data resource. The target of\
    \ an annotation identiﬁes the\nitem, or the part of an item, which the particular\
    \ annotation relates to the body resource.\nBased on the above annotation model,\
    \ the platform provides a number of tools for the manual\nand automatic generation\
    \ of annotations. The latter are based on natural language processing,\nstring\
    \ matching, dictionary look-up tools, as well as three supervised learning models,\
    \ namely\nk-nearest neighbors, linear and random forest regression to analyze\
    \ the existing textual metadata\nof records in order to detect in them occurrences\
    \ of named entities and terms that belong to the\nunderlying set of vocabulary\
    \ and dataset resources; an indicative illustration of the latter is included\n\
    in the Appendix A of the manuscript. In the case of the manual annotation process,\
    \ the user has\nto directly choose a resource from the underlying thesauri database\
    \ and add it as annotation for a\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n19 of 27\nparticular\
    \ item. The user starts typing in a keyword and the user interface assists him\
    \ through an\nauto-complete functionality (shown in Figure 8), which consults\
    \ the underlying thesauri index, and\nsuggests to the user resources having textually\
    \ matching labels. The user can restrict the scope of\nauto-complete suggestions\
    \ by selecting only speciﬁc vocabularies.\nAn important part of the manual annotation\
    \ tools forms the geo-tagging tool, which allows the\ngeneration of annotations\
    \ with a geo-URI in their body, so as to represent geographical locations.\nTo\
    \ generate such an annotation, the user of the platform may click on the desired\
    \ points of the provided\nmap. In conclusion, the automatic annotation tools are\
    \ aimed to provide textual and visual metadata\nanalysis. Textual metadata are\
    \ the main descriptive metadata of the items, namely their title and\ndescription\
    \ ﬁelds. Textual item data can also be used to automatically generate annotations\
    \ through\nthe dictionary look-up tool that is implemented in the platform. Beyond\
    \ the scope of the current\npublication, the deployment of further services is\
    \ implemented by the extraction of textual and image\nrelated metadata that assist\
    \ the enforcement of automated tools on image annotation tasks.\nFigure 8. Manual\
    \ annotation paradigm.\n3.4. Case Study: The Zakytnhian Variety Selection\nThe\
    \ herein discussed platform has been successfully utilized in farms across the\
    \ Ionian Islands.\nAmong the ﬁrst venues involved was a large winery in Zakynthos,\
    \ Greece. The installation of the\nenvironmental monitoring system in Zakynthos\
    \ focuses on the basic characteristics of the cultivation\nthat is found in the\
    \ “Klima Grampsa” estate on the island. The entire unit consists of a vineyard\
    \ and a\nwine production station. In addition, the company manufactures typical\
    \ Zakynthian varieties of wine,\nsuch as Avgoustiatis and Goustolidi, maintaining\
    \ complete production characteristics. The cultivation\nis located in a lowland\
    \ area surrounded by farmland and residential environments in south-west\nZakynthos\
    \ island and the ﬁeld of study refers to the wider area of the Gramsa estate near\
    \ the village\nLagopodo (see Figure 9) belonging to the municipal unit of Artemision.\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 149\n20 of 27\nFigure 9. Map of Klima Grampsa installation.\n\
    The vineyard owners immediately embraced the initiative and contributed practically\
    \ and\ntheoretically to the project, aiming to increase conversions and product\
    \ revenue for their clients\nvia upgraded quality and optimized production. They\
    \ used the platform to collect, organize, analyze,\nand publicize winery data\
    \ on behalf of their winery products. By looking at the interests and behaviors\n\
    of the people engaged most with their varieties, they were able to feed these\
    \ insights back into the\noverall company planning to inform their strategy on\
    \ how to best reach these consumers.\nAs a ﬁrst step, the owners provided multimedia\
    \ content (mostly photos and textual data) of their\nland, premises, plants and\
    \ products (see Figure 10). This formed the so-called Grampsas collection in the\n\
    knowledge base.\nFigure 10. Grampsas collection.\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n\
    21 of 27\nAs a second step, detailed information about the individual items of\
    \ the collection were provided.\nThese included descriptions of the produced varieties,\
    \ such as Avgoustiatis, Goustolidi, and Kakotrygis,\nas well as the respective\
    \ wines produced by each variety (e.g., Avgoustiatis Red, see Figure 11).\nFigure\
    \ 11. Grampsas knowledge base item collection.\nInitially the vineyard owner provided\
    \ a recent high resolution photo of the item under\nexamination. So, for instance\
    \ in the case of the Avgoustiatis variety, Figure 12a depicts its overview.\n\
    Continuing, the entries of the knowledge base were ﬁlled up with data. The Info\
    \ tab (Figure 12b)\ncontains information about the rights of the multimedia item\
    \ uploaded, the item’s Uniform Resource\nLocator (URL) and the actual knowledge\
    \ base record’s source. The latter is typically the user who\nuploaded the actual\
    \ content item. The second tab Related presents similar to the uploaded content\n\
    items that are already included in the knowledge base. In the case of a photo,\
    \ given the single uploaded\nimage, it retrieves similar images from the knowledge\
    \ base and depicts them. The platform is also\nable to suggest tags that may be\
    \ attached to the original uploaded image (Figure 12c). The Comments\ntab (Figure\
    \ 12d) enables the public to participate in the process because it provides a\
    \ fully functional\ncomments section based on the popular Disqus (https://disqus.com/)\
    \ service. Disqus is a networked\ncommunity platform used by hundreds of thousands\
    \ of sites all over the world. By incorporating the\nDisqus functionality, the\
    \ platform gained a feature-rich comment system complete with social network\n\
    integration, advanced administration, and moderation options.\nTab Sharing (Figure12e)\
    \ deals with social media integration of the platform and allows its visitors\n\
    to quickly associate, post, or comment about the knowledge base items on their\
    \ favorite social media\nsites. This is of crucial importance because social media\
    \ is nowadays integrated in almost every aspect\nof the people’s everyday life,\
    \ and at the same time forms a great way to leverage the power of social\nmedia\
    \ to increase awareness of the owners of the vineyards marketing efforts. Lastly,\
    \ tab Annotations\n(Figure 12f) offers the ability to the content uploader to\
    \ provide important annotations describing\nthe actual content uploaded by either\
    \ inserting them manually during the process or by allowing the\nplatform to process\
    \ them and add them in a semi-automated way during an ofﬂine post-processing\n\
    step. Finally, it is also worth mentioning that at this point, after the initial\
    \ stage of content uploaded\nmainly by the vineyard owners has been concluded,\
    \ any interested stakeholder may now use the\nplatform to add new, edit or delete\
    \ existing information; the latter two actions are subject to the\nadministrator’s\
    \ approval, of course. This allows for a great user participatory approach to\
    \ smart\nviticulture, actively involving all stakeholders in the process to help\
    \ ensure the results meet their needs\nand are rather exploitable.\nInformation\

    As a ﬁnal, not yet implemented, step, vineyard owners will be able to use machine-learning\n\
    tools that predict the likelihood of a customer to engage with a speciﬁc wine\
    \ variety product,\nand automatically adjusts the target customers with those\
    \ ﬁndings. The overall feedback we are\ngetting so far from them is that they\
    \ were able to signiﬁcantly increase conversions using the\nplatform’s technology.\n\
    4. Discussion and Conclusions\nIn this paper, we presented a collaboration platform\
    \ based on linked data and machine principles\nwith unique features, such as automatic\
    \ metadata enrichment and services, speciﬁcally aimed for the\nviticulture domain.\
    \ We provided a detailed description of the workﬂow and the user engagement in\
    \ the\nplatform and illustrated its basic principles, alongside with a respective\
    \ real-life case study paradigm.\nThe platform forms an evolving, ﬂexible, and\
    \ interconnected integrated information system. It follows\na modular design and\
    \ implementation that allows it to efﬁciently adapt over time over numerous\n\
    distinct tasks. For instance, new knowledge base repositories may be aggregated,\
    \ new knowledge base\nspaces may be created and new platform features and services\
    \ may constantly be designed, deployed\nand utilized within the proposed architecture.\
    \ It was designed and developed aiming at strengthening\ncooperation of the interested\
    \ stakeholders within the viticulture domain, initially within the Region of\n\
    Ionian Islands and beyond.\nThe herein proposed part of the platform aims to propose\
    \ innovative solutions for the\nimprovement of smart viticulture/agriculture services,\
    \ their efﬁcient management, including all\nInformation 2019, 10, 149\n23 of 27\n\
    key stakeholders, by providing incentives for the role of vineyard owners and\
    \ consumers of viticulture\nproducts.\nMoreover, it aims at involving the wisdom\
    \ of the crowd, in order to ensure wider\ndissemination of the achieved results.\
    \ This, of course, remains a work in progress for our research\nteam, in the sense\
    \ that among our future goals are the extension of the current platform to include\
    \ data\nform other than viticulture application sub-domains of the general smart\
    \ agriculture domain, as well\nas the introduction of enhanced features for the\
    \ already implemented viticulture one.\nAmong the technical improvements of the\
    \ platform that we plan to implement in the near\nfuture lies an automated tag\
    \ extraction service, based on speciﬁcally trained deep convolutional\nneural\
    \ networks (CNNs), to be included in the tabular knowledge base item approach\
    \ (Figure 12a).\nThis service will be used to provide automated tags that will\
    \ be fed to users for veriﬁcation and\nvalidation and then will be included in\
    \ the training set. In addition, we plan to exploit the provided user\nannotations\
    \ of knowledge base items for the training of new, or improving the existing,\
    \ ML algorithms,\ntowards an enhanced promotion of digital agriculture data from\
    \ various sources. Analytics of\nuser-generated data or data simply derived from\
    \ private sources, coupled together with huge amounts\nof publicly available data\
    \ from large-scale organizations (e.g., the Hellenic National Meteorological\n\
    Service) will allow the utilization of new types and combinations of data that\
    \ were never available\nbefore. For instance, data on farming production costs\
    \ (i.e., seeds, fertilizer, labor and yield levels) for\nvarious crops collected\
    \ directly from farmers, combined with spatial, weather and commodity datasets,\n\
    as well as insights like cost curves, may be successfully analyzed by machine\
    \ learning algorithms, so\nas to predict market prices of agricultural products\
    \ with a reliable degree of accuracy.\nSo, ﬁnally, with respect to the marketing\
    \ part of our initiative, we plan to initiate deeper wine\ncustomer connections\
    \ to drive better marketing results for the vineyard owners by utilizing existing,\n\
    or developing from scratch, analytics solutions. The goal is to obtain reliable\
    \ data from large numbers\nof real-world people, process them in a single framework,\
    \ where we may identify peoples’ insights,\nwhat actions should be implemented\
    \ and towards which audience, how it is performing, and make\nchanges almost in\
    \ real-time. Taking this a step further, we intend to transform the system into\
    \ an\nintegrated agriculture analytics platform used to predict the acceptance\
    \ of products by the market and\ntheir economic performance in economic terms,\
    \ as well as forecast crop yields with increased accuracy.\nWe believe that the\
    \ data revolution currently happening in agriculture has huge implications for\
    \ both\nsociety and related business models, and the impact will be colossal in\
    \ the years to come. Consequently,\nour ultimate goal is to develop an integrated\
    \ platform infrastructure for further assessment and\nutilization in the directions\
    \ of data analysis in smart agriculture, supported by artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    tools and methodologies. Additionally, the exploitation of statistical processing\
    \ methods and even\nsemantic analysis (automatic metadata deduction), will lead\
    \ our research to the implementation of a\nuniﬁed platform for analytics, smarter\
    \ marketing and better results in the agricultural domain.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    • Technology is an integral component of many of the proposed mitigation measures.
    • There exists an urgent need for education on e-waste impact on the environment.
    • Greater focus is needed on responsible digitalization to engender sustained
    change. • Alignment of smart initiatives to SDGs is an underdeveloped research
    area. • Greater awareness is needed on lived in realities of environmental tradeoffs.
    Abstract The UN COP26 2021 conference on climate change offers the chance for
    world leaders to take action and make urgent and meaningful commitments to reducing
    emissions and limit global temperatures to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels
    by 2050. Whilst the political aspects and subsequent ramifications of these fundamental
    and critical decisions cannot be underestimated, there exists a technical perspective
    where digital and IS technology has a role to play in the monitoring of potential
    solutions, but also an integral element of climate change solutions. We explore
    these aspects in this editorial article, offering a comprehensive opinion based
    insight to a multitude of diverse viewpoints that look at the many challenges
    through a technology lens. It is widely recognized that technology in all its
    forms, is an important and integral element of the solution, but industry and
    wider society also view technology as being part of the problem. Increasingly,
    researchers are referencing the importance of responsible digitalization to eliminate
    the significant levels of e-waste. The reality is that technology is an integral
    component of the global efforts to get to net zero, however, its adoption requires
    pragmatic tradeoffs as we transition from current behaviors to a more climate
    friendly society. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Climate

    Development Goals (SDGs) 1. Introduction The 2021 United Nations (UN) Climate
    Change Conference (COP26) held in Glasgow UK, brings together many of the worlds’
    leaders to address the critical aspects of global warming. The conference aims
    to gain commitment for sustained progress towards the Paris Agreement and UN framework
    convention on climate change, by limiting increased global temperatures to 1.5
    °C above pre-industrial levels (COP26, 2021). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change (IPCC) identified in its 2018 report that global emissions would need to
    be at net zero by at least 2050 to retain a “high confidence” level of limiting
    temperature increases to sustainable levels (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). In
    her speech at the conference, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that -
    “rising to this challenge will require the wholesale transformation of our carbon-intensive
    economies," and that "addressing climate change is the greatest economic opportunity
    of our time." (COP26, 2021). The transition toward net zero requires significant
    changes at a societal and industrial level and governments, as well as corporations,
    are increasingly turning to technological innovations to meet net zero emission
    targets (Miller, 2020). Digital technologies offer the potential to deliver sustained
    solutions to many of the seemingly intractable societal challenges relating to
    climate change (George, Merrill, & Schillebeeckx, 2021). The World Economic Forum
    (WEF) in its - Harnessing Technology for the Global Goals report, jointly authored
    with PwC, identifies the significant role that digital technology can play in
    improving resilience to global warming related, natural hazards, reducing emissions
    and enhancing the ability for humans to take the necessary steps to realize net
    zero. The WEF report identifies how digital technologies can help to automate
    and significantly improve the efficiency of industrial, manufacturing and agricultural
    processes and that Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems could contribute
    to a reduction of 4% in global emissions by 2030 (World Economic Forum & PwC,
    2021). Although advancements in technologies are closely associated with offering
    solutions to global warming, the digital discourse also highlights the negative
    impacts of the widespread use of technology in the context of waste products,
    resource usage and CO2 emissions. The widely reported impact of vast bitcoin mining
    farms in various parts of the world and their appetite for significant energy
    consumption - 121.36 terawatts hours per year (CBECI, 2021) – illustrates the
    dichotomy of rapid technological advancement and potential barriers to net zero
    by 2050 (Mora et al., 2018). The debates surrounding the convergence of the digital
    and net zero imperatives are beginning to gain traction within the academic literature,
    where studies have started to focus on the role of digital technologies through
    a positive contribution lens, but also a reflective perspective, recognizing some
    of the negative aspects of the rapid adoption of technology (George et al., 2021,
    Merrill et al., 2019). What is clear is that, whilst the emerging diverse and
    disparate discourse has offered insight to many of the significant challenges
    and barriers to net zero from the digital perspective (George et al., 2016, Luo
    et al., 2016), there exists a limited contribution from a wider and more informed
    multiple perspective context. This study contributes to the digital technology
    and climate change discourse, via the individual discussions on a multitude of
    interrelated sub-topics. Each invited expert has offered their own unique insight
    to the myriad of complexities and dependencies to attaining net zero by 2050.
    The remaining sections of this article are organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    a brief review of existing literature in this space. Section 3 presents the experts’
    perspectives related to core themes surrounding information management (IM)/information
    technology (IT)/information systems (IS) and climate change. Section 4 - presents
    an overview of the key perspectives from the submitted full opinion articles.
    The main discussion section is presented in Section 5, where we assess the significant
    challenges and key contributions from the invited expert submissions. Section
    6 concludes the paper by discussing implications for both research and practice.
    2. Background literature review The primary database used for the literature search
    was Scopus. Keywords such as “information systems” or “information technology”
    or “IT sector” were combined (AND operator) with keywords “environment”, “sustainability”,
    “sustainable” and “climate”. The search taxonomy retrieved articles that had the
    combination of keywords in the article title, author keywords, or abstract. Via
    a process of filtering to eliminate non-relevant studies, a total of 372 articles
    remained. These articles were evaluated via their abstract to assess their suitability
    against the following two research questions. • RQ1: Does the digital technology
    and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment and how can it be reduced?
    • RQ2: How can digital technology and IS/IT be utilized to mitigate the causes
    and impact of climate change? After a further process of scanning of the title
    and abstract for the relevance of the article to the research questions, 88 articles
    remained. Additionally, ScienceDirect and Web of Science were also used, following
    similar approaches which resulted in 16 additional articles. 2.1. (RQ1) Does the
    digital technology and IS/IT sector have a negative impact on the environment
    and how can it be reduced? Despite the contribution of the IS/IT industry toward
    the economic and social welfare of society, IS/IT has often been criticized for
    having a negative environmental impact. Concerns surrounding the adverse effects
    both hardware and software have on the environment date back to the Y2K era which
    led to the massive adoption of enterprise systems (Miyamoto, Harada, & Fujimoto,
    2001). These negative impacts include high levels of energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions and toxic disposal of IS/IT systems (Muregesan, 2008). The disposal
    of electronic waste (e-waste) while following recycling processes has been widely
    viewed as not being environmentally friendly, especially the impact of fossil
    fuels or respiratory inorganics (Barba-Gutiérrez, Adenso-Diaz, & Hopp, 2008).
    Refurbished ICTs are often used in developing countries where devices tend to
    have a short life-span and subsequently create environmental damage during disposal
    (Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). Studies have argued that electricity is a major cause
    of climate change, as many power stations throughout the world still rely on fossil
    fuels to generate electricity (Asongu et al., 2020, Tamburini et al., 2015). Energy
    hungry technologies such as applications of blockchain in the form of bitcoin,
    has been widely criticized for producing over 22–29 million metric tonnes of carbon
    dioxide emission each year. These figures are comparable to the carbon dioxide
    production of entire countries such as Jordan and Sri Lanka (Marr, 2018, Stoll
    et al., 2019). Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and
    actuators have a shorter lifespan which leads to increased waste in the environment
    (Chakraborty and Gupta, 2016, Chakraborty et al., 2014, Nižetić et al., 2020).
    Digital transformation initiatives such as smart cities have concerns surrounding
    ICT waste management, energy management and emission management which needs to
    be addressed for achieving long term sustainability and viability (Ismagilova,
    Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019). From an IS/IT perspective, IoT and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) could potentially offer solutions for reducing the impact of
    technology projects (Salam, 2020). High ICT-driven initiatives need to plan for
    sustainability by thinking from the perspective of social welfare and e-waste
    impact (Kar, Ilavarasan, Gupta, Janssen, & Kothari, 2019). Wireless communication
    technologies need adaptations so that emissions can be further reduced. AI can
    operate with such technologies to enhance the usage of bandwidth and energy consumption
    to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the telecom sector Ullah et al.
    (2020). Similarly, AI integrated with blockchain has been found to positively
    impact water management and climate control (Lin, Petway, Lien, & Settele, 2018).
    AI can manage and reduce energy consumption within smart cities (Şerban & Lytras,
    2020). Studies have identified that blockchain applications can improve sustainable
    practices in supply chain management and agricultural practices (Kshetri, 2021).
    Similarly, within nano-technology applications, AI has provided benefits through
    better precision in agricultural water distribution delivering positive impacts
    on efficient use of natural resources. The communication of sustainability related
    messages within social media has greatly increased during the pandemic (Grover
    et al., 2019, Grover et al., 2021, Yadav et al., 2021). The literature has highlighted
    that during crisis periods IS research can provide “signposting” for sustainability
    actions through improved digital monitoring, tackling information flow and paranoia,
    and orchestrating data ecosystems for improved decision making (Pan & Zhang, 2020).
    The focus towards renewable energy has increased dramatically. The IRENA (2021)
    report indicates that jobs in sustainability and cleaner energy are increasing
    exponentially year on year, especially in solar and wind energy. This shift towards
    greener energy consumption is common across industries producing and consuming
    technology products and services. There is evidence that if stakeholders are convinced
    about energy management, their engagement in Green IS/IT programs will increase
    (Nyberg, 2018). The literature highlights the use of theories such as: Institutional
    Theory, Resource Based View, Technology Organization Environment framework, Theory
    of Planned Behavior and Motivational Theory as the dominant models used in the
    IS literature (Asadi & Dahlan, 2017). Lesser used theoretical lenses such as:
    Upper Echelon Theory, Self Determination Theory, Green Theory, Norm Activation
    Model, Elaboration Likelihood Model, Dynamic Capability Theory, Actor-Network
    Theory and Expectancy Theory. could be used to explore future research relating
    to environmental impacts of technology. (Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. Snapshot

    and impact of climate change? As early as 2008, Murugesan (2008) provided directions
    towards a greener IS/IT strategy. A holistic focus towards Greener IT entails
    reducing the energy consumption of computational devices. It also gives directions
    on reuse, refurbish and recycling of IS/IT products. Such a focus requires an
    organizational imperative as indicated by Butler (2011), whereby the study draws
    on institutional theory to explain the multitude of forces acting on organizations
    from the institutional, environment and organizational fields for environmental
    sustainability. Reduction of carbon based energy consumption directly leads to
    reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The study by Simmonds and Bhattacherjee
    (2012) indicates that existing IT infrastructure, alignment of business strategy
    and relative advantages of green IT initiatives, have an overall positive impact
    on the adoption of IT initiatives within firms. Recent IT/IS literature indicates
    that technology can be a solution for better environmental management and sustainability.
    For example, Wang X. (2015), Wang Y. (2015) highlights that IS/IT competence enables
    the integration of technology within the environmental management processes to
    improve performance. The same study demonstrated the positive impact of IT competence
    on IT-environmental management integration. The research by Jnr (2020) indicates
    that there is a significant relationship between integrated technologies and Green
    IS/IT innovation. The study by Ojo and Fauzi (2020) indicates that environmental
    awareness and leadership commitment positively impacts engagement in Green IS/IT
    practices. Further Marques et al. (2019) highlight that universities now consider
    emissions and Green IT principles to reduce the adverse impacts on the climate,
    while designing their curriculum. Audits in Green IT in enterprises help to enhance
    focus towards maintaining environmental orientation and better impacts on climate
    (Patón-Romero et al., 2021). These audits offer a view on the organization''s
    position along the green IT capability maturity model from ISO/IEC 15504 to ISO/IEC
    33000. Within workplace infrastructure management, sensors and actuators are often
    being used for water management and energy consumption in smart buildings (toilet
    management, ventilation and air quality management) and smart devices (like air
    conditioners and lighting systems). These technologies have been observed to have
    brought in wide positive impacts on the climate within the existing literature
    (Zarindast, Sharma, & Wood, 2021). For example, blockchain applications are not
    always energy hungry, and often applications in different use cases such as SolarCoin
    and VerdePay may actually help in reducing carbon footprints (Howson, 2019). Applications
    of analytical models for information management enables more efficient energy
    management in smart cities (Gellert, Florea, Fiore, Palmieri, & Zanetti, 2019).
    Blockchain applications may enable a more efficient IoT ecosystem and thereby
    reduce energy consumption (Sharma et al., 2020). AI technologies such as deep
    learning together with big data analytics have been used for image mining for
    underwater environment management and air quality management (Kushwaha et al.,
    2021, Nair et al., 2021). Driven by the pandemic, working from home has significantly
    increased, which has drastically reduced travel to workplaces, thereby reducing
    the carbon footprint from travel and maintaining office infrastructure. This change
    toward a work from home culture has been facilitated using video conferencing
    and collaboration systems enabled through ICTs (Chakraborty and Kar, 2021, Galanti
    et al., 2021, Richter, 2020). A recent review on AI and its possible impacts towards
    sustainability argue that AI will play a critical role beyond enabling better
    consumption of energy, water, and land usage, and it will facilitate environmental
    governance with greater effectiveness (Nishant et al., 2020). Whilst the literature
    has exhibited an emerging focus on Green IS and sustainability within the information
    management literature, there is still tremendous scope for impactful research
    on many aspects of the use of technology to combat climate change. 3. Multiple
    perspectives from invited contributors This section, in alignment with the approach
    set out in previous studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021a, Dwivedi et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), develops a set of
    unique expert contribution narratives that explore many of the key topics related
    to digital and IS technologies and climate change. This topic has numerous threads
    and interdependencies as many of the invited experts offer their own perspectives
    and viewpoints on the topic. The expert contributions are largely presented in
    an unedited form, as expressed by each of the contributors. The perceived unevenness
    of the logical flow inherent with this approach is countered by the capturing
    of the distinctive orientations of the expert perspectives related to the chosen
    topic (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015). The list of contributions is provided in

    Johan Olaisen 3.1. Behavior and attitudes 3.1.1. Contribution 1 – Climate change
    and information technology – Professor Robert M. Davison 3.1.1.1. Some issues
    I think that IM/IT/IS has a profoundly negative impact on the environment in ways
    that are largely invisible. For instance, the devices that we use, particularly
    batteries, require the inclusion of rare earth elements, notably tantalum. This
    is mined from Coltan. Major deposits of coltan are found in DR Congo (Wikipedia,
    2021) where open cast mines blight the landscape. In addition, hundreds of small
    scale independent miners look for their own spoils. The impact on the environment
    is considerable, and this includes the local wildlife that used to live in the
    area, notably the Eastern Mountain Gorilla. Militias are often employed to protect
    the mines and their all-too valuable minerals, but these militias may abuse the
    local people, wildlife and more (YouTube, 2017). At a more visible level, the
    devices that we use require huge amounts of electricity, whether for the extraction
    and refinement process, the manufacturing process or the simple use of the end
    products. Where does the electricity come from? Well, that depends on where you
    live. You might be fortunate enough to live in a country that depends to a large
    extent on renewable energy resources (or at least gives you the option to source
    your electricity from such sources) – solar, hydro, wind, geothermal or wave for
    instance. But you might also live, as billions of people do, in a country that
    relies on coal or oil for energy production. Thus, to operate your devices, you
    are directly contributing to the coal economy and to further global warming via
    the CO2 that is emitted when coal is burned. How can the negative effect be reduced?
    The answer is simple but painful: we need to keep our existing devices in use
    for much longer than we currently do. We need to avoid the temptation to update
    our devices as soon as the next version is available. Here devices include: phones,
    tablets, notebooks, cameras, electric cars and any other device with significant
    battery use. We can’t eliminate the negative effects but we can reduce them. 3.1.1.2.
    Research agenda I think that a valid research agenda has to include the concept
    of sustainability. Tan B. (2021) are currently editing a special issue of the
    ISJ on IS and Sustainable Development. They note that the 2015 UN Agenda for Sustainable
    Development includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 associated
    targets to be achieved by 2030 (United Nations Department of Economic & Social
    Affairs, 2015). These goals and targets constitute a research agenda in their
    own right, though not all are immediately applicable to IM/IS/IT. Meanwhile, Walsham
    (2012) argues that there is a need to undertake IS research that demonstrates
    how we can make the world a better place. To provide some other context, however,
    Clarke and Davison (2020) noted that almost no IS research, at least as published
    in the Association for Information Systems’ basket of eight journals (EJIS, ISJ,
    ISR, JAIS, JIT, JMIS, JSIS, MISQ), included the environment as a key stakeholder
    or treated the environmental perspective as a matter of importance. Thus, the
    track record in IS is not particularly rosy. We have a long way to go. 3.1.1.3.
    Education I teach Green IS issues to my MBA students: we identify and discuss
    issues concerning how green IS really is, including many of the issues raised
    in this editorial. We look at the topic from a policy perspective and consider
    what actions organizations can take to ensure that they genuinely adopt a green
    culture and implement green measures. This is particularly relevant to corporate
    social responsibility and the triple bottom line (Elkington, 1997). 3.1.2. Contribution
    2 – digital platforms in combating climate change: user engagement tools and digital
    traces of climate footprints – Professor Ioanna Constantiou and Professor Morten
    Thanning Vendelø In spite of the increasing awareness about the consequences of
    climate change, many individuals continue to fail in adjusting their behaviors
    and lifestyles in order to lessen their impact on the climate. While mottos like
    “think globally, act locally” urges people to consider the health of the entire
    planet and to take action in their own communities and cities, they do not seem
    to significantly contribute to combating climate change. Many individuals appear
    to experience difficulties in understanding how their behavioral patterns and
    choices affect the climate of the planet, although the most recent UN Climate
    Report shows that with no changes in greenhouse gas emissions the increase in
    the global temperatures will rise to 2.7 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100
    (United Nations Environment Programme, 2021). Hence, alternative means of influencing
    consumer behavior are required. Digital technologies can support individuals in
    developing connections between their behavioral patterns, and the ongoing changes
    in the global climate as well as identify and choose alternatives to these behavioral
    patterns (Schroder, Prockl, & Constantiou, 2021). Digital platforms can support
    combating climate change by providing marketplaces where transactions can be made
    in more cost efficient and climate friendly ways, promote sustainable product
    innovation or inform consumers about their climate footprints. The abundance of
    data available to digital platforms can be used for activities that promote sustainable
    options and motivating climate friendly behaviors. For example, applications tracking
    user physical activity can quantify climate impacts and thereby nudge users to
    consider more sustainable options of public transportation (e.g., based on CO2
    emissions of different means of transportation). Another area of interest is reduction
    of food waste. A number of digital platforms have recently emerged with related
    visions. Building on the logic of collaborative consumption and social entrepreneurship
    (Schroder et al., 2021), digital platforms such as Eat Grim provide a marketplace
    for selling vegetables and fruits that do not match industry standards based on
    appearance to consumers. Their aim is to change the consumers’ perceptions of
    appearance related quality standards of what is edible and nudge their users to
    eat vegetables and fruits by focusing on other criteria such as freshness, or
    nutrition value of the vegetables and fruits. By redistributing these products
    to their consumers from restaurants or other retail shops, they reduce food waste.
    Another example is the digital platform Too Good To Go that connects customers
    to restaurants and stores, mainly bakeries, that have unsold food surplus. The
    surplus food is sold to consumers at discounted prices instead of being wasted.
    Finally, Plant Jammer is another platform that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    and fight climate change through sustainable cooking and plant-based food. Consumers
    reduce waste in their home by using ingredients that would normally be wasted
    due to lack of knowledge on how to combine through recipes in their daily meals.
    These platforms provide multi sided marketplaces (Parker, Van Alstyne, & Choudary,
    2016) governed by loose control mechanisms and apply pricing structures for cost
    compensation, hence display low intensity of competition (Constantiou, Marton,
    & Tuunainen, 2017). Based on the data they collect they can develop new mechanisms
    to engage users. Customer engagement, is a multidimensional tool, rooted in marketing
    and social psychology, and described as “the level of an individual customer’s
    motivational, brand-related and context-dependent state of mind characterized
    by specific levels of cognitive, emotional and behavioral activity in direct brand
    interactions’’ (Hollebeek, 2011, p. 790). These dimensions cover three key activities
    that can support consumer transition to more climate friendly behaviors. Techniques
    displaying a quantified climate footprint based on the individual behaviors that
    are tracked by platforms, could stimulate cognitive activities towards combating
    climate changes, for example considering the impact of specific food choices,
    e.g., daily consumption of meat. This can lead to behavioral changes when multisided
    platforms make more environmentally friendly options easily accessible and economically
    attractive as observed with platforms combating food waste. Finally, gamification
    or other nudging techniques that stimulate emotions, either positive or negative,
    can reinforce consumer engagement with different platforms combating climate changes.
    The success of such mechanisms is reliant on increasing levels of user engagement
    with the platform where user behaviors can eventually be replaced with more climate
    friendly ones. 3.1.3. Contribution 3 – faith and climate change – Dr. Iyad Abumoghli
    While the world''s religious and spiritual traditions did not traditionally face
    climate change in the way society has come to know it since the mid-20th century,
    peoples throughout history have always lived through and had to deal with extreme
    and erratic weather events. Comparable notions of climate change have been expressed
    in the world’s different religions through their texts and teachings. There is
    no singular perspective or monolithic view of climate change within highly diverse
    faith and religious traditions. Within the same religion, adherents may hold different
    views and perspectives on climate change and humanity''s relationship with nature.
    However, there are general perspectives developed in consultation with adherents
    of represented faith groups. Naturally, they are taken from those who accept the
    scientific consensus on climate change. The Buddhist perspective on climate change,
    for example, is presented as the ecological consequences of our own collective
    karma. Therefore, it is not just an ecological crisis, but a spiritual one too.
    Within the broad sphere of Christianity, Pope Francis’ encyclical Laudato Si,
    provides a high-level perspective on Catholicism’s views on climate change. He
    argues that climate change is a global problem and that humanity has a moral obligation
    to address it at all levels of society (UN News, 2015). Climate change can be
    explained through the Daoist concepts of Ying and Yang. The carbon balance between
    the earth and sky is off balance causing instability and disasters. Thus, climate
    change can be viewed as a manifestation of humanity’s failure to maintain harmony
    with nature. The Hindu Declaration on Climate Change states that “today we call
    on all Hindus to expand our conception of dharma (duty). We must consider the
    effects of our actions not just on ourselves and those humans around us, but also
    on all beings. Addressing climate change from an Islamic perspective, is about
    assuming the role as trustee or steward (khalifa) of creation that God bestowed
    upon humanity. This trusteeship applies to all life forms and ecosystems, in their
    full diversity and richness, reflecting the glory of their creator. Today, the
    balance (mizan) of nature has been disturbed by human activity and choices which
    have resulted in overconsumption, overexploitation and overuse of resources, ultimately
    leading to environmental degradation and climate change. Climate change is already
    manifesting itself in highly localized contexts, directly impacting Indigenous
    ways of life. Therefore, climate change does not just represent an abstract scientific
    issue, but rather a very real and dangerous threat to livelihoods and culture.
    Adherents from all the world’s religions and faith traditions agree that climate
    change represents an immense threat that must be overcome, for the sake of humanity,
    the environment and all living beings we share Earth with. This common understanding
    has led to an increase in faith, intrafaith and interfaith efforts to address
    it. These serve as an acknowledgment of the overwhelming scientific evidence that
    climate change is indeed human-induced. Faith actors can play a crucial role here
    given that faith permeates into all areas of life and can inspire the behavioral
    changes necessary to address climate change. As a testament to growing faith engagement,
    in the lead-up to COP21, held in Paris at the end of 2015, many Faith leaders
    and organizations called on governments to take climate change seriously and commit
    to addressing it. This formed part of a much broader global advocacy movement
    that helped lead to the creation of the Paris Agreement and the climate measures
    contained within it. In October 2021, in the lead up to COP26, more than 40 faith
    leaders met at the Vatican and submitted a Faith Appeal to the president of COP26
    linking Faith to Science and calling upon nations to increase their ambitions
    and committing their organizations to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.
    This process has been only effective in engaging faith leaders over a period of
    seven months through information technology systems and online capabilities of
    applications. UNEP’s Faith for Earth Initiative was founded to accelerate and
    solidify precisely this spirit of interfaith collaboration, ensuring that faith
    actors had a voice at the highest level of environmental governance and greater
    access to the UN system. The interfaith initiative introduces the cultural, spiritual
    and ethical dimensions of sustainable development that faith actors bring into
    the implementation of the SDGs, particularly those related to the environment.
    Since its founding Faith for Earth has hosted and participated in multiple interreligious
    conferences, workshops, webinars and events, encouraging faith actors to come
    together and tackle common issues of climate change and environmental degradation.
    Faith actors can play an important role by providing a moral voice to the climate
    change crisis. Combining spiritual ethics with climate knowledge and science can
    serve to drive behavioral change amongst adherents, more than either one can alone.
    Substantial and widespread changes in public attitudes are essential to tackle
    climate change. Given that faith permeates into all areas of life, authoritative
    faith voices can be strong drivers in motivating people for action. Indeed, given
    that many religions already advocate environmentally friendly behaviors as part
    of their core values such as living with fewer material luxuries, caring for creation
    or dietary restrictions, there are strong traditions to draw upon. Faith groups
    across the globe are bringing religious teachings into thousands of projects on
    the ground to protect people and nature from the effects of climate change and
    pollution. By leading by example, FBOs can inspire positive action in communities
    to begin the transformation to a carbon-neutral sustainable society from the bottom
    up. Faith-based organizations have been using information technology to communicate
    with the world and pass their messages online, either directed to their congregations
    or to others through mainly social media and networks. Sharing publications, articles
    and courses has become easier for the faith communities. Climate change campaigns
    are among the most active ones among the faith communities. 3.1.4. Contribution
    4 – the pros and cons of IM/IT/IS on climate change and future directions – Professor
    Bhimaraya Metri 3.1.4.1. How the IM/IT/IS sector is having a negative impact on
    the environment and how it can be reduced The IS/ICT sector is a net source of
    global greenhouse gas emissions. The data centers used to power digital services
    now contribute approximately 2% of global GHG emissions – on par with the aviation
    sector (UNFCCC, 2016). The digital technology industry is one of the least sustainable
    and most environmentally damaging industrial sectors in the modern world (Junior,
    Majid, & Romli, 2018). If we are aiming to utilize technology as a mitigating
    factor for climate change we need to reform the way technology is used at different
    sectors, causing substantial damages: 3.1.4.2. Replacement rather than repair
    A consistent shift in the consumption pattern which pushes replace over repair
    is causing huge overheads on the environment. Companies like Apple are systematically
    discouraging self-repairs or repair at affordable prices thus pushing for replacement.
    3.1.4.3. Software upgrades pushing hardware replacements Innovation and upgradation
    in the technologies sector are simultaneously pushing the hardware upgrades. These
    upgrades often leave the legacy hardware unusable leading to e-waste. 3.1.4.4.
    E-waste Increasing digitalization is giving rise to the problem of e-waste. Much
    e-waste contains concentrated amounts of potentially harmful products, and this
    shows little sign of abating. In the absence of clear policy on e-waste flow management
    (Frazzoli, Orisakwe, Dragone, & Mantovani, 2010), the world produces about 50
    million tonnes of e-waste, with only 20% of it being dealt with sustainably (UN
    report, 2019, WEF report, 2019). 3.1.4.5. Technology driving electricity demand
    The overall demand for electricity from the digital technology sector is growing
    rapidly (Jones, 2018). It is further predicted that ICT networks could use about
    20% of the world’s electricity by 2025. The World Economic Forum (WEF, 2021) report
    stated, “by 2020, Bitcoin mining could be consuming the same amount of electricity
    every year as is currently used by the entire world”. Currently at the start of
    2020, Bitcoin alone has a carbon footprint of 34.73 Mt CO2 (equivalent to the
    carbon footprint of Denmark), it consumes 73.12 TWh of electrical energy (comparable
    to the power consumption of Austria), and it produces 10.95 kt of e-waste (equivalent
    to that of Luxembourg). Future projections relating to Smart Cities, 5 G and the
    Internet of Things give rise to additional concerns over energy demand Carroll
    and Heiser (2010). The negative outcomes of IT on the environment are further
    going to be increased with the advent of these new technologies. Even proliferation
    of Satellite Constellations could be a challenge (David, 2017). 3.1.4.6. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change Recent reports have
    highlighted that IT/IS can lead to a more efficient and sustainable energy consumption
    using smart grids, smart housing and smart logistics. Statistics suggest a possible
    fifteen percent reduction in the emission of green-house gases- close to the annual
    emissions of China. There are many initiatives to reduce energy consumption and
    carbon emissions. Japan’s $32 million Green IT Project promotes highly energy
    efficient ICTs in three areas. It aims to reduce energy consumption of network
    components and data centers by more than 30%. And Japan is experimenting with
    organic light-emitting diodes to cut the power consumption of displays by 50%
    (GZR, 2020). Technology can also offer cost-effective market-driven solutions,
    using sensors, software and networks. Technologies can also help monitor and evaluate
    climatic conditions and change and may help mitigate natural disasters. We also
    need to have supported policies and regulations for green energy. Supporting demand
    for green technologies is only one step. Certain pacts undertaken by regulatory
    bodies such as the European commission and united nations, also pave the way to
    regularize sustainable technology development. One such pact is the European Green
    Digital Coalition between the European Commission and United Nations Environment
    Programme. We have to ensure that new technology development is cognisant of impending
    climate changes. One of the ways to enable technology development that conforms
    to environment and sustainability goals is for governments to penalize technology
    developers that fail to adhere to global warming constraints. Leaders in the IT
    sector need to ensure that new technology developments and innovations are guided
    by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prescribed by the UN. Further, government
    and regulatory authorities may promote climate friendly IT innovations by prescribing
    the necessary guidelines and incentives for better e-waste management and lower
    energy demands. 3.1.4.7. A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS
    and climate change Climate-change mitigating technology is a wide research area
    where researchers are attempting to gain more insights into the technology portfolio
    which can be utilized to mitigate the climate changes such as carbon emission,
    energy consumption and e-waste (McLaren and Markusson, 2020, Wang et al., 2018).
    Some of the other relevant research areas are. • Reuse/ recycle and sustainable
    manufacturing • Closed supply chain and e-waste removal • Reducing waste and efficient
    consumption using technology • Monitoring of natural disasters using technology.
    • Zero power ICT solutions • e-waste management • Circular economy • Green IT
    • Energy Management for data centers and telecommunication networks • Leveraging
    data science and Artificial Intelligence for predicting climatic changes and natural
    disasters 3.1.4.8. How IS/IT education should reflect this There is a need for
    including the impact of IT/IS on climate change in the curriculum across all disciplines
    (Perkins et al., 2018). There is a severe lack of awareness around the topics
    of climate change and how it connects to digitalization and technology transformations.
    There is a very swift adoption of new courses such as industry 4.0, blockchain
    technologies and IoT across premier educational institutions. However, courses
    discussing the flip side of these technologies in the context of climate change
    and sustainability are scarce. In addition to this, courses that introduce climate
    change mitigation technologies can be a good addition to start a conversation
    around climate change issues. 3.1.5. Contribution 5 – the role of online communities
    in supporting digital activism on climate change – Professor Niki Panteli COP26
    gives us the opportunity to reflect on our role as IS researchers on how IS/IT
    can support climate change. I draw on my personal interest and knowledge of online
    communities and digital platforms, to posit that IS has an enabling and empowering
    role in the promotion of climate change. My position in this editorial was triggered
    by an article in which the Swedish teenager and activist Greta Thunberg wrote
    in the Guardian (Thunberg, 2021), where she criticized world leaders for being
    in denial over the climate crisis. Indeed, there seems to be a catastrophic myopia
    among world leaders on current and emerging environmental threats and the challenges
    that climate change is causing to our planet. Instead of government and officials
    leading these debates, transparency of the challenges that humanity faces has
    been achieved by school children, teenagers and young adults around the world.
    The role of IS has been invaluable in providing a platform for these young activists
    to be heard, to form a community, to grow a collective voice and ultimately to
    lead on debates and protests and increase awareness on the climate crisis. A notable
    example of an IS-enabled climate change movement is the “School Strike 4 Climate”
    which was initiated and led by Greta Thunberg. Boulianne, Lalancette, and Ilkiw
    (2020) studied one of the school strikes in 2019 which was linked to this specific
    social movement and found that the online media in particular Twitter were used
    to share diverse sets of information such as local events, tactics for protesting,
    and opinions of climate change and blame of governments and other institutions
    for inaction and compliance on issues related to climate change. According to
    the same study, online platforms are transforming political engagement whilst
    offering the younger generation the means to express their ideas and voice their
    concerns to a global audience. Activism has been portrayed as a collective action
    (Landzelius, 2006), which can be orientated towards challenging the status-quo,
    and putting pressures on world leaders, corporations, communities, groups and
    individuals to make much needed changes. Digital activism can maintain activism
    traditional characteristics namely its collective nature and transformational
    purpose (George & Leidner, 2019), whilst its dynastic feature is that it relies
    on the use of online media and digital platforms with the purpose of reaching
    global audiences and mobilizing large-scale protests worldwide (Askanius & Uldam,
    2011). Online communities (OCs) offer the ground for breeding activism as they
    provide opportunities for individuals who regardless of their location voluntarily
    form a social aggregation through an online platform for sharing interests, knowledge
    and experiences (Rheingold, 1993). OCs can be used for providing a shelter for
    their members (Vaast & Levina, 2015) and a sense of place where members feel empowered
    to freely express themselves and get involved in stimulating discussions (Panteli,
    2016). The growth and sustainability of these communities depends on members’
    involvement. Mutual understanding among members (Ma & Agarwal, 2007) as well as
    group attachment and identification (Panteli and Sivunen, 2019, Ren et al., 2007)
    have been found to be crucial for OC success. In our research on digital activism,
    we studied the case of MedicineAfrica, an online health community (see Chamakiotis,
    Petrakaki, & Panteli, 2021), which had the aim to provide medical education and
    improve clinical practices in fragile, post-war countries. Findings showed that
    it is not so much the technological affordances of digital platforms—namely to
    inform, to network and to organize (Tim, Pan, Bahri, & Fauzi, 2018)—but it is
    primarily their potential to set up an online collective of like-minded individuals
    that allows this form of digital activism to succeed. Similarly, Cardoso, Boudreau,
    and Carvalho (2019) posited that though digital platforms can be used to organize
    collective action, the extent to which these are successful depends on the capacities
    and intents of their members, which the authors referred to in their study as
    resourcefulness and agency. It is not surprising therefore that IS researchers
    have shown an interest in OC members’ behaviors and practices, and how OC users
    interact with and influence each other within this online setting. Founded by
    passionate and enthusiastic individuals, OCs can be used to develop networks of
    support as a way for responding to emergencies (e.g. Nan & Lu, 2014); indeed climate
    change is not just a phenomenon that deserves to be understood, but an emergency
    that requires immediate action. With an understanding that OC knowledge flows
    travel beyond the community itself (Mozaffar & Panteli, 2021), there is a need
    to explore the direction and distance of the knowledge flows generated within
    OCs on climate change, and the impact that these are making on individuals, groups,
    organizations and governments worldwide. Further, digital climate activism offers
    the opportunity to study cross-generational differences on the use of online platforms
    and within OCs. Cross-generational differences have been evident in the use of
    social media platforms (Panteli & Marder, 2017) and a study on these differences
    is particularly relevant and topical with the increasing number of young digital
    activists globally. Research therefore on the interactions within OCs founded
    and led by teenagers and young adults should fall part of the agenda for future
    IS research. This should shed further light on who is indeed leading the climate
    crisis!. 3.2. Education, awareness and changed working practices 3.2.1. Contribution
    6 – Climate change and the emergent role of IS: an agenda for IS against the background
    of COP261 – Dr Rohit Nishant and Dr Thompson S.H. Teo Climate change is an existential
    threat facing humanity today.2 The recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought
    an important realization that humanity needs to be prepared for impending challenges
    such as climate change. Leaders from different countries assembled at the 2021
    United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, between October
    31, 2021- November 12, 2021. Political leaders as well as business leaders are
    expected to commit to ambitious goals and targets relating to emissions reduction.
    This COP26 comes after the recent working group report titled “Climate Change
    2021: The Physical Science Basis” as a part of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)
    of the United Nations (UN) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The
    report has been described as the starkest warning of irreversible and inevitable
    climate change (Harvey, 2021). The report is a call to humanity to come together
    and face this challenge, and academia also needs to focus on climate change. The
    role of IS has become more pronounced due to the increasing digitalization of
    our society, accelerated by COVID-19 pandemic. Exponential technologies such as
    AI and ML have the potential to combat climate change (George et al., 2021). However,
    the success of any technology is dependent on the people and processes surrounding
    the technology. IS, being at the intersection of people, process, and technology,
    is therefore well poised to play a key role in combating climate change. IS research
    has been focusing on socially relevant issues as well as examining green IS (Nishant
    et al., 2017, Watson et al., 2010). These researches have highlighted both the
    positive and negative aspects associated with IS. Nevertheless, recent conversations
    surrounding climate change offer new opportunities and avenues to IS research
    to contribute to this fight against climate change. These conversations and development
    surrounding COP26 are on specific goals and targets, economic models and recognition
    of specific areas as critical in our fight against climate change. Companies and
    different nations are increasingly talking about “Net Zero” where the addition
    of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the environment is nullified by equivalent reduction
    of GHGs from the environment. Companies such as Microsoft are showing their commitment
    to net zero by paying for the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However,
    net zero also faces several challenges including measurement (Joppa et al., 2021)
    as net zero requires precise, consistent, and automated measurement. IS research
    can contribute to this endeavor by focusing on how IT used for automated measurement
    can help companies achieve the goal of net zero. It can focus on processes that
    increase the effectiveness of IT as well as the design of IS that facilitates
    automated measurement. Another related development is the Science Based Targets
    initiative (SBTi), which helps companies to set emissions reduction targets in
    line with scientific assessment in order to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement
    (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial level and focus
    on efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degree Celsius).2 Over 1000 companies are working
    with SBTi.3 IS research can focus on understanding the role that the intersection
    of people, processes and IT is playing in SBTi. It can also focus on developing
    an understanding of conditions under which IT is effective in helping companies
    implement SBTi as well as challenges in leveraging IT. Another development is
    the increasing focus on the circular economy as a new economic model. The inherent
    objective is to minimize waste as much as possible relative to a linear economy,
    where products ultimately end up as waste. IS research has started to focus on
    the circular economy, but the focus has been primarily on the potential of IS
    to facilitate circular material flows (Zeiss, Ixmeier, Recker, & Kranz, 2021).
    As data increasingly flows through the digital economy, data flow has its own
    carbon footprint and the proliferation of data can lead to redundant data. IS
    research can focus on how the idea of circular economy affects data generation
    and data flow, and how IS research can help minimize the carbon footprint of IS
    artifacts. Data also forms an essential component of AI/ML. As our society increasingly
    uses AI/ML and other exponential technologies, their own carbon footprint cannot
    be ignored. IS research can help companies and societies to redesign processes
    such that these technologies can be used effectively without damaging the environment.
    In terms of recognition of specific areas as important in the fight against climate
    change, there is also an increasing emphasis on biodiversity. In fact, the COVID-19
    pandemic has brought out an important realization that deforestation and loss
    of biodiversity can trigger new pandemics (Tollefson, 2020). Climate change can
    also facilitate zoonotic spillover (Rodó, San-José, Kirchgatter, & López, 2021).
    IS research has generally not focused on issues relating to biodiversity. Nevertheless,
    projects such as Half-Earth Project Map, that maps biodiversity exemplifies how
    IT can play a key role in conserving biodiversity. IS research can focus on the
    design of IS artifacts that support biodiversity. It can also focus on IS use
    for biodiversity conservation by companies, government, and different agencies
    and explore the factors that contribute to the success of such initiatives. Besides
    research, the IS community can contribute by making students aware of issues relating
    to climate change. Other disciplines such as management are increasingly focusing
    on climate change related issues.4 The IS community has contributed to increasing
    awareness of issues related to climate change through courses on green IS and
    IS for sustainability. The current debates surrounding climate change provide
    an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment. Students are increasingly interested
    in courses on data analytics, AI, and ML. We can make students aware that data,
    AI, and ML also have a carbon footprint, and thus they should be used in an optimal
    manner such that their carbon footprint does not diminish the benefits realized
    from them. In summary, we see that IS research and teaching can make a strong
    contribution to our fight against climate change through a focus on issues that
    have become topical due to COP26 and increasing digitalization of society. 3.2.2.
    Contribution 7 – dematerialization is so material! The contrasting impacts of
    IT on the environment and climate change – Professor Yves Barlette 3.2.2.1. How
    the IM/IT/IS sector contributes to a negative impact on the environment and how
    it can be reduced IT and IS correspond to dematerialization, but only to some
    extent. If we create digital copies of documents and save paper (and trees), we
    still have to store the data we create. Moreover, data which was stored on our
    devices (smartphones and computers) or on DVD/Blu-Rays, USB sticks (e.g., movies
    and music) or just broadcasted (radios and TV), are now increasingly decentralized
    ‘in the cloud’, i.e., data centers. Data exchanges also involve emails, texts,
    and all that we exchange using social media. Even if emails seem “old-fashioned”
    today, some companies can send the same message including 10 MB of attached files
    to 1500 employees, generating 15,000 MB, which will never be deleted for most
    of us. If these are ‘dematerialized’ and almost ‘virtual’ documents, they require
    storage, and instead of removing old data, the size of our mailboxes keeps on
    increasing and is measured today in GB. Hence, streaming and data exchanges have
    become the norm. Instead of waiting for broadcasting by TV channels and watching
    a movie, or by radio listening to a song, each of us can separately obtain the
    content on-demand and stream the same song over and over. The Korean series “Squid
    Game” from Netflix generated such a huge demand, that SK broadband sued Netflix
    over the resulting surge in network traffic (Campbell, 2021). The rollout of 5
    G will multiply by 100 the traffic capacity offered by 4 G and will in turn increase
    the volumes of exchanged data. Although the climate impact of streaming and data
    exchanges may have been overrated, they nevertheless remain significant (Kamiya,
    2020). To solve these problems, education seems to be the main solution, however,
    a tax related to bandwidth consumption could be created for streaming and cloud-based
    companies. This would in turn increase cost for users. Options such as a tax for
    other kinds of companies or even a tax on the users themselves could be created,
    specific to bandwidth consumption and/or storage volume. Storage rationalization,
    also known as “Green storage”, is also a possibility. Google is able to show its
    users their carbon footprint within the cloud (Lardinois, 2021). However, these
    data exchanges and distant storage of data require data centers and data transmission
    networks: First, company IT infrastructures, data centers and data transmission
    networks, including computers and storage, that must be manufactured. The manufacturing
    of computers requires a large amount of fossil fuels, chemicals, and raw materials.
    The mining of raw materials for electronic products includes copper, lead, and
    gold and contributes to increased environmental problems. For example, gold mines
    are the leading source of mercury air pollution in the U.S. (Gerson, Wadle, &
    Parham, 2020). Mining also pollutes the water of surrounding communities. When
    the various devices are discarded, they are sent to landfills overseas in Africa,
    China, India, Vietnam and the Philippines. Computers contain heavy metals like
    lead and toxic chemicals that pollute the soil and contaminate groundwater when
    they are dumped into landfill. Some solutions to mitigate these issues include
    (1) increasing recycling, (2) stopping greenwashing that includes cessation of
    waste recycling to countries that cannot actually recycle and (3) mitigate planned
    obsolescence and increase the reparability of devices. Second, IT devices, data
    centers and data transmission networks need power to operate thereby generating
    significant levels of heat. Several possibilities have been tested, for example
    underwater data centers and data centers located in northern countries. This does
    not reduce the heat generated but at least reduces the required energy for cooling.
    Even if the problem related to heat is not addressed, the use of carbon-free but
    polluting energies such as nuclear, must also be solved. 3.2.2.2. How IM/IT/IS
    can be utilized to improve situation regarding climate change I see several aspects:
    • IT/IS permits the use of more efficient products and designs that save raw materials
    and energy. For example, digital twins can help to better design improved products,
    e.g., car batteries (Merkle, Pöthig, & Schmid, 2021). • Processes can be more
    efficient and supply chains can be improved, reducing energy used during manufacturing,
    reducing fuel requirements and food waste during transportation. • Big data analytics
    offer possibilities for precision agriculture, reducing water waste, use of fertilizers,
    pesticides and other pollutants. • Work-from-Home possibilities, reducing business
    trips, encouraging ‘virtual’ companies. • Super calculators allow us to improve
    weather models and offer insights on what factors are the most important to regulate
    climate change. • The solution to controlled thermonuclear fusion power, could
    solve the energetic component of IT/IS impact on climate change. Fusion is only
    possible when scientists are able to compute the shape of magnetic confinement
    devices of Tokamaks and Stellarators (Klinger, 2021) or to perform simulations.
    3.2.2.3. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change • Improving methodological
    innovations in greenhouse gas emissions calculations. • Improving weather models
    to mitigate climate change and risks related to this change. • Development of
    awareness campaigns dedicated to mitigating our personal and professional environmental
    impacts related to IT and IS. • Increasing the conception and use of new big data
    analytics tools to mitigate the impacts of our society on climate change. • Developing
    charters in companies including best practices (see below). • Developing tools
    for smart buildings (lighting, heating, ventilation) and energy management (statistics,
    diagnostics). 3.2.2.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this IS/IT education
    could act in several ways: • Disseminate knowledge and create awareness-raising
    campaigns about the negative impacts of IT/IS on environment and how they can
    be reduced by adopting best practices including for example: • Automatic sleep
    mode and turning of the devices during nights and weekends. • Workers and home
    users should know that ‘dematerialization’ and ‘virtualization’ does not exist
    and that data is always ‘materialized’ somewhere. • Future CIOs and members of
    IT staff should be offered during their education awareness-raising campaigns,
    including the same as above plus IT/IS-specific elements: for example, the fact
    of checking that all audiovisual devices are turned off every evening. The same
    for all the laser printers in a company, even if some monitoring is deactivated.
    Turning off the monitors of their computers, even if some systems must always
    run. 3.2.3. Contribution 8 – emerging technologies to mitigate supply chain disruption
    due to climate change – Professor Manoj Kumar Tiwari Climate change has become
    one of the most important concerns in recent years at nearly all tiers of decision-making.
    Climate change is a set of worldwide phenomena caused mostly by the burning of
    fossil fuels that release greenhouse or heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere
    such as methane, carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, and nitrous
    oxide. These factors have resulted in changing global weather patterns, with frequent
    occurrence of hurricanes, droughts and rising temperatures causing habitats to
    vanish, and altering ecosystems. Climate change has a worldwide impact. As a result
    of such calamities, homelessness is on the rise, putting vulnerable communities
    at risk of food insecurity, disease, and civil upheaval. Climate change, as a
    result of global warming, is a universally acknowledged reality that affects human,
    industry, business, and the environment in a variety of ways. Supply chain and
    Logistics providers among all the industries being aware of the consequences of
    climate change are most conscious about the deterioration happening due to variation
    in weather patterns, storms, altered sea routes, and environmental changes will
    all have a significant impact on their operations, forcing them to alter conventional
    business models and trading routes. If logistics companies are on the front lines
    of climate change, they are also huge contributors to the crisis. Transportation
    industry accounts for nearly 25% of all CO2 emissions from fuel combustion around
    the world (IEA, 2019). While value addition to the product as it passes through
    the supply chain, each SC link causes environmental deterioration, especially
    climatic pollution, via GHG emission. In return, each channel in the supply chain
    faces opportunities and risks in the form of severe occurrences such as waterlogging
    or windstorms, higher temperature, soil erosion, rising sea levels, storms, impact
    on local weather conditions, increased storm frequency and intensity, drought,
    and so on. As a consequence, both climate change and supply chain activities are
    simultaneously impacted. Mitigation (cutting emissions) and adaptation (preparedness
    for inescapable circumstances) are two aspects of dealing with climate change.
    Both of these challenges are multidimensional. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
    changes are required in power grids, buildings, transportation, land use and industry.
    Given a better knowledge of climate and catastrophic occurrences, adaptation necessitates
    disaster management and resiliency. Presently, Machine learning (ML) has gained
    popularity as a versatile tool for technological advancement. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and ML techniques can contribute to reduce emissions in several ways such
    as by speeding up the development of low-carbon technologies, better demand predictions,
    reducing system waste, remote sensing, improving energy efficiency, vehicle emission
    estimation from smartphone GPS traces, single building optimization, identifying
    behavioral patterns, and planning and operating low-carbon infrastructure. The
    impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is becoming more essential
    as people become more aware of climate change and its obvious implications. It
    provides simple and faster problem resolution using simulations and a large variety
    of different options. Climate change concerns can be monitored, mitigated, and
    adapted with the use of ICTs. Some inventions of ICTs are Wireless Sensor Networks,
    Satellite Technology, GIS, Remote Sensing, Mobile Technology, and Web-based applications.
    Climate change mitigation and adaptation can be more efficient and successful
    with the use of ICTs, if integrated strategically; it contains knowledge centers,
    mobile phones, and interactive media. By educating and raising awareness at the
    community level, sharing theoretical and practical knowledge, and empowering people
    to have access to knowledge and relevant data, it can assist vulnerable populations
    in reducing the risk of climate change. Micro-sensor Wireless Network is among
    the most prominent technologies in the twenty-first century, with a wide range
    of applications. Commercial or human-centric applications, robotics, military
    applications, and environmental monitoring are all using the applications of wireless
    sensor networks. Sustainable Environmental Management Information System (IS)
    can maintain the decision-making process for supportable climate control and develops
    Earth-friendly design. Emergence of big data and AI/ML techniques allows climate
    solution research to design policy and its implementation at the building and
    household scale, street, urban areas, modified to specific circumstances but scalable
    to worldwide mitigation possibilities. Furthermore, the wide application of ICTs
    also adds to the depletion of limited energy supplies and the increase in greenhouse
    gas emissions. It is one of the causes contributing to rising CO2 levels for producing
    ICT machinery and devices, energy usage, and electronic waste recycling. We are
    living in a phase of rapid transformation, where technological advancements are
    transforming the way of our living, at the same time directing us to face several
    challenges in the form of climate change and resource scarcity. Although these
    technologies contribute to greenhouse gas emissions to some extent, they aid in
    the reduction of considerably larger amounts released by all other industries.
    By establishing smarter cities, industrial processes, electrical grids, transportation
    systems, and energy savings benefits, ICT can cut CO2 emissions on a worldwide
    scale. ICT may be used to investigate and manage natural resources in a variety
    of ways, both locally and worldwide. As a result, information and communication
    technologies constitute a critical component in combating climate change and mitigating
    its effects. Some ICT tools used to mitigate climate change are: • Computer-controlled
    devices are used in a variety of ways to reduce energy consumption in the home,
    at work, and in manufacturing; • Telecommunications are critical in response to
    natural calamities caused by climate change; • Sensor networks can be used to
    monitor vulnerable or dangerous environments. • Satellite observations give critical
    information on climate and vegetation trends. Oceans and land can be monitored
    by sensors either on the ground or remotely through satellite. The state of the
    atmosphere can be examined for wind currents and greenhouse gas emissions that
    may indicate the impending arrival of a storm. Data on tsunamis and sea-level
    changes can be communicated via satellite via ocean buoys. • Geographic information
    systems can understand and visualize data. • Better study and modeling of complex
    environmental and climate systems are possible due to increased computing capability
    and innovative techniques. • Distributed (grid) computing helps scholars to dig
    deeper into themes. Natural catastrophes affect around 200 million people each
    year, according to United Nations figures. ICT plays a critical role in providing
    early warnings for natural disasters. It provides essential data on the effects
    of climate change that might lead to disasters, in addition to the usage of sensor
    networks to monitor hazards such as active volcanoes. Among these include increasing
    sea levels, depleting freshwater resources, deforestation, and ecosystem concerns.
    The Famine Early Warning System Network is one example of how ICT may help. Its
    goal is to reduce the possibility of food shortages by alerting people to early
    warning signals of famine. The system monitors and analyses data about climate
    and weather, as well as their impact on crops, utilizing information technology.
    The data is subsequently delivered to decision-makers in the form of monthly food
    security updates, predictions, and alarms, as well as assistance with emergency
    preparedness and long-term policy decisions. A variety of sensor systems created
    for weather monitoring (ocean buoys) and earthquake detection are used in tsunami
    warning systems (seismic sensors). Data is collected and delivered into real-time
    analysis and detection systems via satellite. Grid computing makes it possible
    to share data in order to do in-depth analysis. The Global Earth Observation System
    is available for all policymakers to get access to the data. There are free programs
    that allow us to zoom in on satellite photos that map the world. Geographic information
    systems (GIS) are one of the most powerful — and extensively used — tools for
    visualizing environmental data. Overall, using technology into climate change
    assessment, prevention, and adaptation can help save the ecosystem from damage
    and degradation. 3.2.4. Contribution 9 – facing the negative environmental digital
    impact: time to change values? Professor Frantz Rowe To examine whether and how
    the IT sector can have a negative impact on the environment, following the evolution
    of our awareness of the issues, I will address first the aspect of the question
    which concerns how the use of IT products is affecting the environment, before
    turning to the issue of IT production itself. The world has drastically changed
    since the end of the last century. In the 1980s, the first oil crisis was just
    behind. Society, including researchers with my transportation engineering and
    my economics background, saw enormous benefits in telecommunications to reduce
    transportation negative impacts on the environment such as pollution and CO2 emissions.
    Our first studies on the use of the telephone in households, that had been adopted
    lately in France in the 1970s, demonstrated some substitution effects on urban
    trips. However, the main lesson was that, at the scale of a large city, a) the
    net substitution effect was low since the telephone also induced some trips, and
    b) the main effect of telephone-transportation interactions was an accompanying
    or “management” effect (Claisse & Rowe, 1993). Unless we take and accept restrictive
    measures on our liberties to move, like the recent lockdowns, the effects of new
    communication tools such as video conferencing meetings, will not reduce transportation
    demand. This is notably due to an induction effect linked to the opportunities
    and more largely to a “digital rebound” effect (Coroama & Mattern, 2019), whether
    for business or social life, generated by interactions with communication technology.
    Hence my spontaneous answer to the question - how can (the) IT (sector) have a
    negative impact on the environment? - is that, unless we voluntarily reduce our
    activity and do less, the only significant gains from IT use will occur if we
    can reduce the negative impacts related to the efficiency of transportation systems.
    This means that we should design transportation systems so that their use is more
    environmentally efficient, i.e. they pollute less than others when used and have
    the best possible environmental footprint (for instance in terms of CO2 emissions)
    when produced (Teubler, Kiefer, & Liedtke, 2018). Typically IS researchers can
    contribute to such “green” designs for “greener” use by examining how IT/IS can
    help support the use of such transportation systems and more generally support
    more environmentally efficient supply chains. We looked at this, studying how
    Carrefour had redesigned its supply chain, but gains were not spectacular (Antheaume
    et al., 2018, de Corbière et al., 2016). This revision of the supply chain is
    what we would call a " second order " revision. It involved using IT based solutions
    to improve the use of trucks and supply chain restructuring with an additional
    layer of consolidation centers. It did not involve “first order” transportation
    modes improvements such as the use of trains, or river-boats which generate fewer
    GHG emissions per t.km but may be more expensive, at least to start with. This
    is because what corporations seek is to be more efficient economically, while
    ideally showing that they are environmentally conscious. However, in the large
    retailing industry for instance, becoming environmentally efficient is not their
    main concern. Unless they are forced to do so, they will not really optimize CO2
    emissions or other environmental indicators. A set of interviews on the impact
    of e-commerce on retailers supply chains shows that senior managers just want
    to be politically correct (de Corbière, Durand, & Rowe, 2010). However, we believe
    that the potential of information systems to reduce pollution is very large. Here
    again, we can distinguish between first order and second order changes. First
    order changes might be, for example: “combined truck-train transport, where for
    long distances trucks will travel on train carriages (as is done in Switzerland),
    or assisting with local manufacturing solutions, based on 3D printing, rather
    than subcontracting to a third party in another country. These first order changes
    also involve challenges which IT can help resolve. Second order changes might
    be, for example, to control cargo or to optimize vehicle routes regardless of
    the type of transportation mode considered. Regularly, containers are lost at
    sea and cargo and ships can be better controlled before their cargo falls overboard.
    Satellites, RFID technologies and web portals can be important to support these
    aims. There are many other avenues for improvements in that direction. But again,
    the issue is not just about what type of digital technology we should invest in
    to help traditional businesses reduce their environmental impact; what counts
    is to find appropriate production solutions and institutional mechanisms so that
    firms really aim at reducing harmful emissions in a significant manner and not
    always put profitability first. Like the retail or transportation industry, the
    problem is that the IT sector itself is engaged in a worldwide competition where
    profitability and convenience innovations for the consumer are key. Typical of
    these innovations the smartphone is only 14 years old, but its appearance also
    has very negative implications simply because it needs to be produced and incorporates
    rare materials that are extracted in terrible conditions in some African and Asian
    countries. In short, the ecological imprint of IT may be negative because IT products
    also have drastically changed: by becoming “smart”, and more precisely due to
    the introduction of manipulable screens, our telephones have also become very
    destructive of scant resource (Ritthof, Rohn, & Liedtke, 2002). In parallel the
    speed at which we renew corresponding infrastructures such as 5 G and soon 6 G
    won’t help. Our dream of the world being cleaned from pollution by an immaterial
    economy was just a very naïve dream. Many other examples abound such as servers
    farms for the cloud and other data centers that demonstrate huge environmental
    costs. Worse than that with the internet of things, machine to machine communication,
    automated vehicles and bots in finance may make environmental pollution uncontrollable
    or at least many times superior to that created with human-controlled processes.
    For instance, researchers recently demonstrated that training an artificial intelligence
    could explode CO2 emission costs (Strubell, Ganesh, & McCallum, 2019). Not only
    are we exhausting resources, but there are huge geopolitical implications related
    to the sometimes unique locations of these resources on the planet and related
    to where chips or materials for certain of our digital equipment are produced
    (to the extent that children’s lives are destroyed as in Congo, see Lebrun, 2020).
    These geopolitical risks may in turn generate other ecological risks because we
    unfortunately know that wars are never clean. Unless we take and accept measures
    to get sober in what we consume and what we produce, digitization alone may not
    be such a good solution for saving our environment. This goal implies making value
    choices (Rowe, 2018) and requires rethinking the design of our activities at multiple
    levels in an interdisciplinary and systemic manner (Nishant et al., 2020). 3.2.5.
    Contribution 10 – from cradle to grave – impact of IT on climate change and the
    relevant research agenda – Professor Ramakrishnan Raman 3.2.5.1. How the IM/IT/IS
    sector is having a negative impact on the environment and how it can be reduced
    IT and its applications have made business processes efficient, but the rapid
    growth of technology and its applications has also negatively impacted the environment.
    Whilst green IT practices have advocated to minimize the negative impact of IT
    on the environment, there is still a huge scope for changes to be brought into
    manufacturing, logistics and operations, usage and disposal of information technology
    equipment, which can make every process sustainable and environmentally-friendly.
    Manufacturing of Information technology products can be environmentally-friendly
    if the production adopts environmentally friendly processes. Process innovation
    is needed which can help in creating products which use fewer natural resources
    and also reduce pollution. Recycling and reuse of material and zero emission should
    be the goal of every IT manufacturing process. IT manufacturing can become environmentally
    friendly by using energy from renewable sources and also by focusing on energy
    efficiency. Innovation in business processes that can help in achieving zero pollution,
    remove greenhouse gas emissions and also eliminate waste. Focus on conserving
    natural resources can help in making manufacturing of Information technology products
    environmentally-friendly. Logistics and supply chain processes used by the IT
    sector cause hazardous air emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Logistics and
    operations can be environmentally-friendly if manufacturers shift to green suppliers
    and partners who provide green logistics and supply chain processes and also handle
    reverse logistics. If organizations focus on consolidated shipments and reduce
    packaging by redesigning products, it can immensely help in reducing the negative
    impact on the environment. IT products have an impact on the environment even
    during the ‘use’ stage of their life cycle. The energy consumed by the product,
    the lifetime of the product, the heat dissipated and the digital frequency noise
    have a negative impact on the environment. Creating products that are more durable
    and reusable can help the environment. Less resource intensive gadgets which work
    with low power and solar power and IT gadgets will not only help protect the planet
    but also will help in the well-being of all. Responsible and environmentally friendly
    disposal of IT products can help the environment. In several developing nations
    the practise of disposing IT waste in landfills is the most popular disposal method,
    which has a colossal negative impact on the environment. Stringent regulations
    applicable for every end consumer, which mandates safe disposal of e-waste to
    certified e-waste recyclers can help in reducing the negative impact of IT disposal
    on the environment. 3.2.5.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized to improve situation
    regarding climate change Application of IT can immensely help in managing climate
    change. Use of IT while developing smart cities can help reduce annual global
    greenhouse gas emissions. For example, smart energy meters and smart electric
    systems help in managing climate change by optimal use of energy consumption.
    This in turn can also help in smart electric grid management which helps in reducing
    the losses. This is a simple example to showcase the use of smart IT systems which
    can help utility companies, end-users and society at large and also help also
    in managing climate change. Internet and Internet technologies are a force to
    reckon with for managing climate change. IT can infuse intelligence in transportation
    and logistics and make them smart. The Internet of Things (IoT) can make the supply
    chain smart and agile and hence can help in reducing the emission of greenhouse
    gases. Internet and Internet technologies can also help in monitoring the environment
    to reduce energy use in real time. IT can be used to harness and create green
    homes, green industries and hence can help in managing climate change. 3.2.5.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change Information
    Technology and Internet of Things (IoT) are vital in confronting climate change
    problems and help in managing the threats posed by climate change. IT and IoT
    are part of the solution as their applications are being used to cut greenhouse
    gas emissions and they help countries manage climate change. IT and IoT are needed
    for precipitous transfer of information concerning risks of climate change. In
    this context a few questions which need deeper research include - How can information
    needed for decision making be collected and disseminated in an efficient manner
    which can help to advance the integration of climate risks into plans and policies,
    which can be useful for those who need it most? How can a low-cost IoT infrastructure
    be created in the urban and rural areas of developing countries which can enable
    authentic and speedy dissemination of real time data related to greenhouse gas
    emissions? How can IT and IoT be used to enable countries to adapt to climate
    change? 3.2.5.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Education is vital in
    enabling people to understand the impact of climate change on life on this planet.
    Educating and creating awareness can help to change the attitude and behavior
    of people. Education alone can help in ensuring that people start adopting a sustainable
    lifestyle and also develop skills that can help in managing climate change. Education
    can not only inspire people to change their attitudes and behavior, but also helps
    them to make informed decisions which can have an impact on climate change. A
    deep-seated shift in pedagogy is needed for IT and IoT to enhance teaching and
    learning for sustainability. Teaching about climate change needs an interdisciplinary
    and cross disciplinary approach to synthesize diverse ideas. The information about
    climate change and its impact must be introduced within the school curriculum.
    IT must be used to create interactive activities on climate change which can help
    students to understand and learn in a better fashion. Projects related to sustainable
    development and climate change must be introduced at the high school level. IT
    tools which can help measure carbon emission must be taught along with practical
    application of the same. Teaching and learning which has hands-on experiences
    with technology must be emphasized. At the undergraduate and graduate level, educating
    and giving opportunities to students to work on environmentally sustainable projects
    to attain sustainability objectives using IT and IoT technologies can immensely
    help in bringing out of the box solutions to climate change problems. 3.2.6. Contribution
    11 – How has the IT sector negatively influenced the environment? Remedies, role
    of IT education and future research agenda – Professor Nripendra P. Rana 3.2.6.1.
    How information management (IM)/information technology (IT)/information systems
    (IS) sector have any negative impact on environment and how it can be reduced?
    The IT sector is constituted of companies that produce software, hardware or semiconductor
    equipment or the companies that provide Internet or related services (Miller,
    2021). Technological advancement has transformed the way we live our lives. Many
    would argue that the growth of the number of electronic devices such as laptops,
    desktops, high performance computing servers, and other most powerful data-intensive
    computing solutions (e.g., supercomputers) have brought us numerous benefits,
    there is no denying that the proper and continuous functioning of these technologies
    have come at a cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The heavy use of these
    devices present concerns when it comes to resource use, energy use, carbon footprint
    and waste. The negative impact of the IT sector on the environment could well
    be traced right from the manufacturing of these devices as a large proportion
    of materials come from finite natural resources and precious metals. Procuring
    raw materials and precious metals for manufacturing technological devices and
    electronic equipment comes with a high carbon cost usually powered by fossil fuels,
    deforestation, landscape degradation, water pollution and the release of vast
    quantities of carbon dioxide into the air (Mensah et al., 2015). For example,
    silicon, plastic, iron, aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, barium are
    some of the most important materials used for manufacturing the technological
    equipment for which the mining of these poses serious threats to our environment
    (Williams, 2010). Similarly, manufacturing of these equipment requires massive
    energy to convert them into complex and sophisticated technological products.
    Subsequently, the transportation of these finished products also comes with a
    high carbon cost. Finally, massive servers and data warehouses that enable these
    technologies to work also consume a vast amount of energy and this threat does
    not stop there. These products also pose setback at the end of their lifespan
    and globally we throw away electronic waste (e-waste) of approximately $62.5 billion
    every year and only one-fifth of the electronic waste generated globally is currently
    formerly recycled, which undoubtedly an enormous threat to the environment (Amos,
    2020, Okafor, 2020). It is therefore very evident that the entire lifecycle of
    technological evolution to disposition adversely affects the environment and technological
    companies are largely responsible for this threat. This negative impact of the
    IT sector on the environment could be reduced to a certain extent by adopting
    the responsible practices of the circular economy, which signifies reusing some
    of the raw materials of the disposed equipment for a more sustainable approach
    to consumption. The governments and local authorities also have the larger responsibilities
    by legislating the circular economy model, promoting eco-friendly manufacturing
    and by adopting a responsible way of sustainable consumption. This could be achieved
    by implementing effective laws and regulations on e-waste (Geissdoerfer, Savaget,
    Bocken, & Hultink, 2017). 3.2.6.2. How can IM/IT/IS be utilized to improve climate
    change? Technological developments – particularly the discovery of use of fossil
    fuels, have contributed to climate change. Rising temperatures are essentially
    blamed by scientists for human-generated gases (primarily CO2), concentrations
    of which have been enhanced by almost 50% since the industrial revolution started.
    Innovations such as carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies are being
    used to reduce CO2. During the time of the Coronavirus pandemic, many office jobs
    were being done from home resulting in reduced emissions of CO2 from transport
    and office buildings (Sky News, 2021). The technological innovations to support
    remote working has been swiftly embraced as businesses endeavored to manage the
    effect of Covid-19. Greater use of data centers and cloud computing services by
    some of the leading technology giants including Amazon, Google and Microsoft are
    also an example of energy efficient services. With many of the latest technology
    efficient products such as smart LED light bulbs, smart outlet and power adapters,
    smart thermostat, etc. responsible for reducing energy consumption available in
    the market not only help households to save decent amounts of money in their annual
    bills but also reduce the CO2 emissions (Oberhaus, 2019). 3.2.6.3. A brief discussion
    on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change? Although the technology
    improvement with an environmental attribute reduces overall CO2 has been discussed
    in the prior research, how the role of technology change in lowering carbon emission
    intensity needs to be further researched for the overall reduction of CO2 (Li
    & Wang, 2017). While the low-carbon energy technologies contribute toward mitigating
    climate change (Schmidt & Sewerin, 2017), there is a need for further research
    on how social-psychological factors, lifestyles, behavioral patterns, etc. will
    help organizations and individuals to adopt such technologies that can reduce
    the CO2 emission and serve toward the climate change. The future researchers could
    also look to explore the adoption of such technologies in different contexts for
    both well-aware and less aware consumers about using such technologies for the
    purpose of supporting climate change action. Future research can also explore
    individuals'' pro-environmental behavior toward using such technologies. 3.2.6.4.
    How IS/IT education should reflect this? Information technology education could
    be a key component of raising awareness of climate change mitigation and adaptation.
    One suggested solution could be the collaboration between the scientists and the
    students at the pre- and post-college levels to make them aware of how modern
    emerging technologies could help reduce hazardous emissions and reduce the threat
    of global warming. The pre-college school system is the right place to disseminate
    such scientific information on the key global climate change issues. School teachers
    should be provided with the necessary advanced level of educational and hands-on
    training from scientists from local research bodies on climate change and governments
    should take the necessary steps to make it a part of the curriculum. Climate change
    is not only the knowledge that should be taught to children right from an early
    age, but they should also be made aware of how to responsibly use technologies
    in a way that helps reduce carbon emissions becoming ambassadors for sustainable
    living. 3.2.7. Contribution 12 – technology, information systems and sustainability:
    a public interest research agenda – Professor Katina Michael and Dr Roba Abbas
    3.2.7.1. The negative impact of technology and information systems on the environment
    The coupling of natural and human systems is defined by highly integrated and
    complex system dynamics resulting from human-nature interactions (Liu et al.,
    2007). This has presented significant global challenges and wicked problems (Buchanan,
    1992, Brown et al., 2010) that require immediate attention in view of sustainability,
    particularly given the centrality of technology and information systems (IS) to
    these interactions. A multifaceted feature of the natural system that is integral
    to all forms of life is biodiversity, which can be considered at three levels:
    genetic diversity, species diversity and ecosystem diversity (Chapin III et al.,
    2000). Biodiversity is both implicitly and explicitly linked to health and wellbeing,
    in addition to sustainable development programs (Naeem et al., 2016, World Health
    Organization and Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2015).
    Human actions, notably decisions concerning technology and information systems,
    increasingly impact biodiversity. In line with the 26th UN Climate Change Conference
    of the Parties (COP26) Sustainability Governing Principles, there is a pressing
    need to engage in deliberate management of potential environmental impacts to
    encourage inclusivity, health and sustainability (UN Climate Change Conference
    UK 2021). Adverse impacts on the natural world resulting from existing and emerging
    technologies and IS can be described as negative externalities (Dasgupta and Ehrlich,
    2013, Perrow, 1991). The field of environmental economics, among other things,
    involves the study of externalities that generate tangible and intangible costs
    to the physical environment and its inhabitants (Cropper & Oates, 1992). It is
    often difficult to quantify these costs given the reach of an incident, and the
    extent of its irreversible impact. For example, significant oil spills cause major
    externalities that cannot readily be measured, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil
    spill, which was estimated to have spilled 4,900,000 barrels of crude oil into
    the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Beyer, Trannum, Bakke, Hodson, & Collier, 2016). There
    are two main types of negative externalities; the first refers to negative production
    externalities that can cause, for example, air or water pollution through manufacturing
    plants powered by technology and other forms of engineering; and the second denotes
    negative consumption externalities that can cause for instance, traffic congestion
    and noise pollution that are generated by systems (Biglan, 2009). Externalities
    caused by technologies and IS may be unanticipated, unintended, and even paradoxical
    (Pringle, Michael, & Michael, 2016). Unanticipated externalities refer to those
    incidents and system failures that were not factored into scenario planning and
    risk management processes during systems design and development, such as the Fukushima
    Daiichi nuclear disaster whereby a substantial wave surged over defences and flooded
    reactors causing major radiation leakage (von Hippel, 2011). Unintended consequences
    of technologies and IS are those that were discounted as potential outcomes of
    a respective system, but nonetheless transpired (Ash, Berg, & Coiera, 2004). An
    example is the use of irrigation systems for crops, which subsequently contributes
    to soil erosion and increased soil salinity (Khan, Tariq, Yuanlai, & Blackwell,
    2006). Conversely, paradoxical externalities emerge from attempts to use technologies
    and IS for advantage and benefit, but where the result is a negative outcome on
    another aspect of the environment. An example is the introduction of Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices to monitor energy systems to lower consumption that requires
    the devices to be powered and over time to be replaced, causing often toxic and
    non-biodegradable e-waste that is disposed of in landfills (Mukhopadhyay & Suryadevara,
    2014). A common element underpinning these types of negative externalities is
    the impact on public resources that are shared by communities (Pigou, 1920). These
    include the ocean and its fisheries and clean drinking water, amongst others,
    leaving individuals and communities vulnerable, potentially compromising their
    health and wellbeing. Furthermore, these undesirable impacts extend to the natural
    system and environment. These impacts can be linked to technologies and IS that
    do not suitably consider socio-ecological and socio-technical considerations,
    and that fail to recognize the value of design, testing and validation, with sustainability
    and people in mind (Chen et al., 2008, Trist, 1981). The mitigation of the undesirable
    consequences of existing and emerging technologies and IS necessitates intervention
    in the form of sustainability transitions (Loorbach et al., 2017, Smith et al.,
    2005), moving beyond the existing multi-level perspective (Geels, 2004, Geels,
    2011) toward transdisciplinarity. At the heart of these transitions is the establishment
    and socio-technical (re)design of higher education frameworks resulting in new
    forms of knowledge production, allowing for the design and redesign of human-centered
    socio-technical systems for sustainability, and consequently for human benefit
    (Geels, 2010, Verbong and Geels, 2010). The proposed socio-technical intervention
    would require commitment to a series of stages or flows, as depicted in Fig. 1,
    which we define as the Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle. These include:
    (i) establishing a detailed understanding and conceptualization of the tightly
    coupled natural and human systems in context and in view of interactions and feedback
    loops; (ii) implementing the appropriate sustainability transition through a process
    of socio-technical (re)design; (iii) measuring the effect of the design over time
    in view of the degree to which negative externalities are reduced or mitigated;
    (iv) assessing the impact on human health and wellbeing, in addition to environmental
    sustainability; and (v) iterating to ensure continual evaluation of the tightly
    coupled system given its evolving nature. It should be noted that despite this
    proposed cycle, there will be cases in which paradoxical externalities occur,
    which is an inherent and unavoidable characteristic of tightly coupled systems.
    This occurs for two reasons: (i) events in nature are not always predictable no
    matter how “controlled” the socio-technical transitions are through, for example,
    regulation and policy mandates (Smith et al., 2005), and (ii) interventions themselves
    are a form of “technology” that are subject to independent and autonomous forces
    that are “uncontrollable” (Winner, 1978). Download : Download high-res image (251KB)

    cycle. 3.2.7.2. Sustainability transitions through transdisciplinarity The proposed
    model suggests that our global challenges and significant problems require a transdisciplinary
    lens, beyond a multi-level perspective, in which design interventions are required
    in the form of sustainability transitions. Within this model, the information
    systems discipline has a significant and mediating role given its socio-technical
    orientation and appreciation of the open systems paradigm (Scott and Davis, 2015,
    von Bertalanffy, 1950, Watson et al., 2010). For instance, step (ii) in Fig. 1
    would markedly involve a redefinition of technological and information system
    design and development processes (Schoormann, Stadtländer, & Knackstedt, 2021),
    characterized by the emergence of a supportive human-centered, transdisciplinary
    educational framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015) oriented toward a public interest
    technology (PIT) research agenda (Abbas et al., 2021a, McGuinness and Schank,
    2021, Michael and Abbas, 2020). Transdisciplinarity, in the context of the proposed
    sustainability transitions, typifies trans-institutional, trans-sectoral and trans-national
    frameworks bringing together at a minimum industry, government and academia toward
    the production of knowledge (Crow & Dabars, 2017, p. 474; Hadorn, 2008). This
    involves recognition that while all problems are local and community focused,
    their impacts are increasingly global, given the age of entanglement we now live
    in (Hillis, 2016 as cited in Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 381), and the tight coupling
    of natural and human systems, as described above. In considering sustainability
    transitions more specifically, the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design
    Cycle would promote Public Interest Technology (PIT) research, empowering citizens
    and communities (Pitt, Michael, & Abbas, 2021). It would additionally emphasize
    the importance of directing attention to highly integrative basic and responsive
    (HIBAR) research (Crow & Dabars, 2020, p. 376), which is still lacking internationally,
    despite the creation of globally oriented goals such as the United Nations Millennium
    Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (World Health
    Organization, 2015). In transitioning to HIBAR research and practice that requires
    PIT processes and innovations, we are seeking to recognize negative externalities
    and to continually strive to reduce them by introducing alternative socio-technical
    design options in each selection environment (Nelson & Winter, 1977, pp. 61–70).
    3.2.7.3. A public interest technology research agenda for sustainability A preliminary
    phase in operationalising the proposed design cycle and implementing sustainability
    transitions is the strategic realignment of IS, and/or the higher education system
    to proceed toward the production of knowledge and socio-technical innovations
    that are purpose driven and in the public interest (Abbas & Michael, 2021), facilitating
    an integrated and responsive approach to addressing our global challenges and
    key problems (Melville, 2010). Capturing first principles from foundational theories
    and frameworks across disciplines, including IS, and merging them to form a transdisciplinary
    lens will allow for the creation of models and simulations that afford a high-level
    view or conceptualization of existing major forces and counterforces (Frodeman,
    2014, Scholz, 2020). Achieving such a capability commands stakeholder engagement
    in the provision of data to an emergent knowledge system, encapsulating multi-level
    perspectives (local-national-global) within socio-cultural, business, techno-economic
    and institutionally-relevant policy contexts (Köhler et al., 2019). We suggest
    that the role of emerging technologies and IS, as they relate to this knowledge
    system, be embedded within a PIT framework (see Abbas, Pitt, & Michael, 2021,
    Fig. 1), represented as a complex, open socio-technical ecosystem that is informed
    by the landscape of technological and IS developments. The framework also acknowledges
    the corresponding application areas and the link to financing models, stakeholder
    engagement (balancing lived experience and professional expertise), transdisciplinary
    theorizations/conceptualizations and operationalisation to achieve the goal of
    sustainability toward human health and wellbeing (Abbas et al., 2021). 3.2.7.4.
    The role of IS/IT education The subsequent and corresponding phase in operationalising
    the proposed Socio-Technical Sustainability Design Cycle relates to the elimination
    of disciplinary silos in higher education institutions, that have existed since
    scientific endeavor was acknowledged as the foundation of the Age of Enlightenment.
    Through the deliberate reconfiguration or redesign of university structures, new
    transdisciplinary agendas can be positioned to respond to global challenges (Crow
    & Dabars, 2015, ch. 5; Gholami, Watson, Hasan, Molla, & Bjorn-Andersen, 2016).
    In order to ensure our long-term sustainability as a species and a planet, university
    design must undergo a rapid rethink, becoming more adaptive and agile but also
    closely aligning to public and planetary challenges (Crow & Dabars, 2020). The
    transition to transdisciplinarity, even interdisciplinarity, remains fraught with
    risk principally with respect to forming meaningful ties between Computing, Informatics,
    Business (including Information Systems) and Engineering schools in addition to
    other non-STEM domains of knowledge. A harmonization is required not only within
    the STEM disciplines, but going beyond traditional collaborative fields to incorporate
    action-oriented endeavors through the creation of Schools dedicated to Sustainability
    or Life Sciences (Tejedor, Segalàs, & Rosas-Casals, 2018). Here the traditional
    research university is challenged to apply itself to real-world problems. However,
    irrespective of the inevitable difficulties, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated
    the importance of solidarity toward collective action, harnessing the knowledge
    produced from both professional expertise/practice and the lived experience. The
    IS discipline is in a prime position to offer information and knowledge management
    expertise to support transdisciplinarity, and it is our obligation to actively
    implement sustainability transitions and responsible systems design (Monson, 2021),IS
    research (Pan & Zhang, 2020) and innovation (Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten, 2013)
    in the interest of sustainable futures (Hadorn et al., 2006, Hess and Ostrom,
    2007). 3.3. Impact on people and communities 3.3.1. Contribution 13 – promoting
    IT innovation to improve the global environment: towards establishment of global
    co-creation & co-evolution models – Professor Mitsuru Kodama 3.3.1.1. IT innovation
    through convergence The leading core technologies in the cutting-edge technology
    fields of IT, energy, automobiles, electronics, semiconductors, biotechnology,
    pharmaceuticals and materials science, etc. have become dispersed among individuals,
    companies and organizations across the globe. The integration of these superior
    core technologies is a source of innovation of new products and services. (e.g.,
    Kodama, 2007). Across various fields in society, IT innovation is changing working
    practices, lifestyles, the way products are made and resources are used in production
    activities. IT technology is being incorporated into a variety of advanced devices
    and contributing directly and indirectly to the reduction of CO2 emissions. IT
    innovation is driving energy-efficient manufacturing by promoting energy-saving
    investments and measures. Such IT innovation will bring about “convergence” -
    the fusion and integration of different technologies and services and the building
    of business models across different industries. Meanwhile, with the adoption of
    the Paris Agreement, a new international framework for the reduction of greenhouse
    gas emissions and other measures from 2020, all participating countries, including
    those that are developed, emerging and developing, are strongly urged to take
    measures to combat global warming. Specifically, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
    and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been trending globally in recent years while
    collaboration and fusion of the IT industry with various other industrial fields
    is transforming various businesses, social activities and the lives of people.
    Backing the evolution of these innovative technologies is the convergence of IT
    and electronics technologies, including sensing and location information technologies,
    energy management systems (HEMS, BEMS, FEMS, etc.), energy-saving devices and
    data utilization. Furthermore, smart communities such as smart towns and smart
    cities, into which many countries are currently pouring efforts, are attracting
    attention as next-generation social systems that connect homes, buildings, and
    transportation systems with IT networks to make effective local use of energy.
    IT solutions including energy management systems such as HEMS, BEMS and FEMS to
    optimize operation smart meters, renewable energy and EVs, etc., and CEMS to integrate
    the management of those as well as transportation systems such as ITS are becoming
    indispensable in smart communities. The development of these innovative technologies
    will greatly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and enable a dramatic
    increase in energy reduction benefits. Furthermore, XR technology, which has a
    promising future, will contribute directly and indirectly to global environmental
    issues by minimizing the physical resources generated, utilized, and consumed
    in various processes in social, economic, and management activities. Therefore,
    IT industries in every country need to contribute to global society by further
    strengthening technological and business partnerships with various industries,
    supply chains and venture businesses to promote new technologies and businesses
    through convergence strategies that will open up the future while understanding
    environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures. To date, the
    advances of IT have shortened the time and space in business processes and supply
    chains across a whole range of industries, accelerated decision-making and raised
    business efficiency, and have given birth to new business models that transcend
    and converge dissimilar industries (Kodama, 2020, Kodama, 2021). IT innovation
    promotes industry-wide co-creation & co-evolution to improve the global environment
    and increases the possibility of forming dynamic “global ecosystems” as new value
    chains (see Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (897KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global IT innovation through IT- leadership. Through such
    convergence, what actions should companies, public bodies, government organizations,
    and a country as a whole take in terms of strategy building and organizational
    reform to create new business models that integrate different technologies and
    create IT innovations across industries? What kind of national leadership and
    management is required to achieve this? These are just a few of the many practical
    issues facing many stakeholders around the world, including those in academic
    research. 3.3.1.2. Research agenda related to IM/IT/IS While individual industries,
    companies, and governmental organizations in each country have their own strategies,
    the key concept of organizational behavior to adapt to (or create) the convergence
    worldview is new “strategic knowledge integration” at the global level. Organizational
    platforms that support such global strategic knowledge integration are global
    IT community formations. Global IT communities are important organizational platforms
    for evolving the core knowledge in one’s own country while at the same time actively
    exploring and integrating the best knowledge from around the world with the core
    knowledge of one’s own country (see Fig. 2). To drive global strategic knowledge
    integration, the most crucial issue is not only to integrate the diverse knowledge
    of different organizations within a company, but also to form global IT communities
    with superior stakeholders including customers around the world and integrate
    the best knowledge in the external environment, an ecosystem consisting of globally
    dispersed knowledge, with the knowledge in the organizations within a company.
    The key word to accelerate such global knowledge integration inside and outside
    an organization is “IT collaboration”. In forming global IT communities across
    the world, “collaborative dynamic capabilities” (Kodama, 2018) to appropriately
    generate, evaluate, and use common knowledge (i.e., lexicon, meaning, and interests)
    (Carlile, 2004) regarding environmental contributions such as global warming countermeasures
    among diverse stakeholders, are a trigger to realize IT collaboration. In addition,
    the “IT-leadership” of national leaders is crucial to accelerate new strategic
    knowledge integration through IT collaboration through the formation of global
    IT communities across a wide range of countries. For this purpose, “holistic leadership”
    (Kodama, 2017) through the holistic thinking and actions of world leaders will
    be a particularly important factor of management. However, existing studies in
    the IM/IT/IS fields have shed little light on the details of the theoretical concepts
    and practical processes of global IT community formation. Furthermore, there is
    very little accumulated research on IT collaboration. The holistic IT-leadership
    of leaders will play a role in forming and developing the organizational platforms
    of global IT communities. Hence, the cultivation of such leaders will become a
    pressing issue going forward. 3.3.2. Contribution 14 – smart city initiatives
    to maximize information value for sustainability – Professor Brenda Scholtz The
    growing population, particularly in urban areas, has put pressure on researchers
    and society to address challenges surrounding the global lack of scarce resources
    and the negative impact on the environment (Khatoun and Zeadally, 2016, Kumar
    et al., 2020). The technological footprint of companies and individuals has exacerbated
    this problem since technologies are mainly reliant on fossil fuel, thus the more
    technology used, the more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, creating
    global warming. Technology manufacturers and implementers therefore need to consider
    adopting practices of environmentally sustainable computing. This phenomenon can
    be viewed as sustainability in technology or Green IT, where the priority must
    be to reduce the negative impact of an organization’s technological footprint.
    On the other hand some argue that providing individuals and organizations with
    access to information and technology can assist people with living more conveniently
    and easily; for example reducing travel and our carbon footprint. This phenomenon
    can be referred to as sustainability by technology, whereby we need to reduce
    the negative impact of companies and their value chains by enabling sustainability
    use cases or initiatives. The interplay of sustainability in technology and by
    technology must therefore be addressed by all stakeholders in industry and academia.
    One solution to achieving this interplay is to utilize the capabilities of information
    management (IM) and the related field of information systems (IS), which are reliant
    on the acquisition of information, the custodianship and distribution of that
    information to those who need it, and its ultimate disposal through archiving
    or deletion thereof. However, valuable information can only be provided to users
    if access to data is available. The Economist has described data as “the oil of
    the digital era”. However, others, such as the Centre on Regulation in Europe,
    argue that this “often-used analogy between data and oil is misleading.” Their
    argument is that data, unlike oil, is not scarce and therefore it cannot be likened
    to oil (MacCarthy, 2018). One thing that everyone agrees on, is that the digital
    economy cannot live without data and that it remains an immeasurably valuable
    and unexplored asset. More than 90% of the world’s data has been created in the
    last two years – more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. We are experiencing
    an information explosion. Herbert Simon, the Nobel prize-winning psychologist
    and economist, stated way back in 1971 that “In an information-rich world, the
    wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever
    it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious:
    it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates
    a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among
    the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” (Bélanger, Van
    Slyke, & Crossler, 2018). The potential value of data, information flow and technology
    to address the effective management of scarce resources has been the driver of
    the Smart City concept (Ismagilova et al., 2019). According to Albino, Berardi,
    and Dangelico (2015): “A Smart City is based on intelligent exchanges of information
    that flow between its many different subsystems. This flow of information is analyzed
    and translated into citizen and commercial services. The city will act on this
    information flow to make its wider ecosystem more resource-efficient and sustainable.
    The information exchange is based on a Smart Governance operating framework designed
    to make cities sustainable”. The promotion of a Smart Environment is one of the
    core dimensions of a Smart City (Van der Hoogen, Scholtz, & Calitz, 2020). The
    success factors that are linked to this dimension are the attractiveness of natural
    conditions, environmental protection policies, having a sustainability strategy
    for resource management, and making sure that a city is ‘future proof’. A sustainability
    strategy should enable an integrated view of socio-economic, political and environmental
    visions; thus focusing on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United
    Nations. Future-proof refers to the ability of something that allows it to continue
    to be of value into the distant future such that the item does not become obsolete.
    Another core dimension for a Smart City is that of Smart Policy, meaning that
    any Smart City initiative should align with the strategy of the city, the country
    (government laws), intergovernmental agreements and of course global policies
    (Garg et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). Policies here include environmental policies
    and those related to information governance and therefore IM. The privacy of personal
    data and information is causing much concern and therefore acts and regulations
    are important in the context of a Smart City. In South Africa the Protection of
    Personal Information Act (POPIA) was implemented in 2013 to protect the information
    and privacy of people, but was only enforced on 1 July 2020 (POPIA, 2020). The
    General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European equivalent to the POPIA
    for South Africa (GDPR, 2018). In addition to these acts, companies are also pushed
    to have their own information governance and management policies and guidelines.
    Another dimension that is closely linked to climate change issues is that of Smart
    Mobility. This dimension focuses on factors that involve sustainable, innovative
    and safe transport systems that are accessible locally, nationally and internationally
    (Calderón et al., 2017, Yadav et al., 2017). IoT is an integral part of Smart
    Mobility and is regarded as an enabling technology of big data (Bibri, 2019).
    However, big data is only valuable once quality data is produced, which is required
    for intelligent decision making to contribute to sustainable smart cities. The
    Smart City definition illustrates the importance of information exchange within
    a Smart City and therefore the importance of the provision of open data and the
    creation of open data hubs. Smart Technology and ICT-infrastructure is considered
    a support dimension of a Smart City since it is integral to all the other dimensions.
    It refers to the different types of smart technologies that are used in a Smart
    City and since these technologies produce and utilize data, it also involves relating
    all the data in smarter ways. Some of the opportunities for smart cities are that
    the data is in a digital format through IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    machine learning technologies, making real-time collection, processing and sharing
    easier and therefore, decision making and solution development is becoming faster
    and more advanced (Allam & Dhunny, 2019). Providing access to quality data through
    the related strategy of information governance is becoming more and more critical.
    Information governance is the overall strategy for information and provides a
    balance between the risks of the information with the value that this information
    can provide. Data quality forms part of governance, since it is focused on the
    integrity and value of the information itself. When the factors of a Smart City
    concept are integrated, such as ICT, urban infrastructure, open data with data
    governance, and stakeholder participation, equitable and sustainable solutions
    can be developed to face city challenges (Yadav et al., 2017). Stakeholder participation
    is emphasized in the Smart People dimension of a Smart City and it is here that
    the importance of skills, qualifications and education is addressed. The lack
    of skills lies in the areas of IT/IS and Computer Science graduates in general,
    but in particular with regard to Data Science, AI and machine learning competencies.
    Higher education has started addressing the need for these competencies in the
    recent IS2020 curricula guidelines (IS2020, 2020). Competencies related to sustainability
    and environmental issues are also included in the IS2020 guidelines as social
    and ethical considerations. In Germany and South Africa modules related to Green
    IT, and environmental information systems have been introduced in recent years.
    So whilst some progress has been made, much more effort and investigations need
    to take place to introduce more competencies regarding sustainable technologies,
    data management, data analytics and data science into IS/IT and CS degree programs.
    Much research has been done on the topics of smart cities, Green IT and ICT for
    sustainability. However, reported empirical studies on IS for meeting the SDGs
    are still considerably low, particularly with regard to sustainable management
    of water and sanitation (SDG 6); access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and
    modern energy for all (SDG 7); and conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas
    and sustainable behavior (SDG 14). In Africa and other developing countries these
    three SDGs are far from being met, where access to clean water and energy are
    major problems for the vast majority of the population. There is also a lack of
    valuable information and empirical research regarding emerging smart cities, especially
    in developing countries (Backhouse, 2015, Estevez et al., 2016). This lack of
    information prevents stakeholders from making informed decisions, such as how
    to manage the city resources more efficiently or how to attract potential investors.
    3.3.3. Contribution 15 – wider issues in IS research on climate change – Professor
    Rahul De’ In The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, noted
    writer Amitav Ghosh (2018) points to the absence of writing on the destruction
    of nature and habitats through the devastation wrought by Imperialism and the
    rise of industrial capitalism. He calls this absence in the canon of English literature
    the ‘great derangement’ where thinkers and intellectuals are oblivious to the
    plainly visible damage done to the planet. This neglect of climate change continued
    in writings in history and politics. Ghosh calls for an awakening to recognize
    and give voice to the scale of the ‘unthinkable’ impact of this phenomenon. Ghosh’s
    call resonates in IS research, where this phenomenon is recognized as a ‘critical
    challenge’ for researchers and practitioners (Gholami et al., 2016; Eliot and
    Webster, 2017). The call is for more extensive research on climate change and
    its impact on the world, where ‘grand challenges’ require a wider understanding
    of the phenomena and a scoping that includes ideas and concepts outside of current
    disciplinary concerns (Winter & Butler, 2011). Following this reasoning, three
    possible issues are presented in this brief essay that can address the scale of
    climate change concerns, and, which also resonate with prior IS research. These
    ideas have to do with engaging with issues of the postcolonial condition; a focus
    on the impact of climate change on ordinary people; and its impact on women. 3.3.3.1.
    Focus on postcolonial condition Prior research in IS has examined the postcolonial
    condition prevailing in former colonies of large imperial nations of the West,
    which includes most of the developing and less-developed world (Lin et al., 2015,
    Ravishankar et al., 2013). This condition essentially refers to the power asymmetry
    between former rulers and the ruled, and defines the cultural and political practices
    of both, even though there is no present-day colonial presence. The postcolonial
    condition is perpetuated largely through multinational corporations and global
    agencies. Global actors, such as large multinational corporations and multilateral
    agencies (like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund), have a massive
    and disproportionate effect on world affairs. Their beliefs, policies, and practices
    affect millions of people directly and indirectly, as they influence governments
    and the actions that governments take. These institutions have a strong influence
    on the uptake of information technology in many nations, through efforts such
    as electronic governance, ICT for development, and spread of technologies to reduce
    the digital divide (De, Pal, Sethi, Reddy, & Chitre, 2018). They also have a strong
    influence on industrialization, deforestation, energy consumption patterns, and
    the overall adoption of modern technologies. Prior research has shown that many
    “development” projects ultimately harm subaltern people, who are the poor and
    marginal groups, rather than benefit them (Ferguson, 1994), and scholars often
    doubt the very benefits of development in such situations and contexts (Escobar,
    2011). Green IS research that is concerned with recording and analyzing the impact
    of climate change (Melville, 2010) must also document the postcolonial conditions
    and the impact of multilateral agencies. When agencies fund, say, construction
    of roads or dams or massive irrigation projects, the impact on the environment
    must be documented and the particulars of local politics, struggles, and contestation
    must be recorded. Crowd-sourcing technologies may be used to both record the different
    perspectives of people, and also to arrive at a possible consensus (Malone & Klein,
    2007). 3.3.3.2. Focus on people Though there is considerable work on Green IT
    and Green IS from the perspective of organizations and how they can manage their
    consumption and production patterns (Dedrick, 2010, Khuntia et al., 2018, Melville,
    2010), the emphasis must also include the manner in which ordinary people in urban
    and rural areas, in remote mountainous regions, on isolated islands, and in forests
    are affected, and how they are using IT to both learn about and counter the effects
    of climate change (Watson et al., 2021). The focus can be on local and indigenous
    approaches to adapting to climate change, and how digital technologies can support
    those, with information and feedback. One problem that can be addressed through
    both design science and action research is that of measuring the changes that
    are slowly and inevitably happening, and how people are adapting to them. These
    changes are in local climate conditions, in soil composition, in levels of water
    tables and aquifers, and in the extent and survival of local flora and fauna.
    These changes may be viewed from multiple perspectives of resource depletion for
    businesses or from that of people’s livelihood, and the impact on local sustainability
    (Clarke & Davison, 2020). 3.3.3.3. Focus on gender Theorizing about climate change
    around issues of mitigation and impact cannot be “gender blind” (Pearse, 2017).
    In rural areas, the brunt of droughts, flooding, soil degradation, river erosion,
    salinization, and loss of food crops, is felt largely by women (Alston, 2015).
    With these drastic and adverse changes in agricultural conditions, there follows
    shortages in food, nutrition deficiency for both women and children, loss of livelihood,
    and increase in debt (Chandra, McNamara, Dargusch, Caspe, & Dalabajan, 2017).
    Though both men and women suffer the consequences of extreme climate events, it
    is women who are worse off as national policies do not fully account for them,
    and relief measures are not easily accessible to them. When climate change events
    force populations to migrate, women are worse off as they lose their local social
    networks, are subject to abuse, and are unable to secure livelihoods on foreign
    soil. The gender imbalances are exacerbated and become entrenched (Alston, 2015).
    Prior research in IS has established the imbalanced access that women have to
    both ICT devices and facilities in developing regions (Rashid, 2016). As they
    are most prone to adverse effects of climate change, research has to both reveal
    these deprivation issues, and find ways to address them. 3.3.3.4. Conclusion IS
    research has an opportunity to sidestep the great derangement in literary culture
    by both exposing the causes and consequences of climate change, and finding ways
    and means to address them. Some work has already started on understanding concerns
    of postcolonial dominance, identifying issues of ordinary people, and understanding
    the particular challenges faced by women. Future research will likely build on
    this. 3.4. Responsible digitalization 3.4.1. Contribution 16 – corporate digital
    responsibility: the powerful offspring of sustainability and digitization – Professor
    Michael Wade 3.4.1.1. Two dominant trends Two of the most significant global business
    trends over the past several years have been sustainability and digitization.
    Sustainability revolves around the natural world, most notably humanity’s impact
    on our planet. Digitization, by contrast, focuses on the virtual world. Without
    obvious common roots, these two megatrends have largely developed independently
    of one another (Naujok, Fleming, & Srivatsav, 2018). I recently had a conversation
    with the Chief Sustainability Officer of a consumer goods company and when I asked
    him about digital and sustainability, he looked back at me blankly. However, this
    is likely to change. If we expand the definition of sustainability to include
    responsible and ethical practices of all kinds, not just those that impact the
    planet, we see plenty of intersection points. Examples include cyber-security,
    data privacy protection of employees and customers, digital diversity and inclusion,
    ethical algorithms including AI, technology component recycling, right to repair,
    ethical gig economy practices, and there are many others. Unfortunately, our research
    suggests that most organizations today are unprepared to effectively respond to
    these challenges. If they do so at all, it is in a fragmented manner. This opens
    up new and interesting avenues for research. 3.4.1.2. A new field of corporate
    digital responsibility It is time to bring these disparate and fragmented elements
    together under a single umbrella so that they can be addressed in a consistent
    and complementary manner. We refer to this new consolidated focus as Corporate
    Digital Responsibility (CDR) (Lobschat et al., 2021). CDR can be regarded as a
    subset of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), an already established entity
    in many organizations. Corporate digital responsibility is defined as a set of
    practices and behaviors that help an organization use data and digital technologies
    in a way that is socially, economically, and environmentally responsible (Wade,
    2020). 3.4.1.3. Each CDR sub-categories contains a number of areas Social Corporate
    Digital Responsibility revolves around an organization’s relationship to people
    and society. The important topic of data privacy protection of customers, employees,
    and other stakeholders is included here. It also incorporates aspects of digital
    diversity and inclusion, such as bridging an increasing divide between digital
    haves and have nots across geographies, industries, social classes, and age. There
    are also societal impacts of inaccurate A.I. decision-making algorithms that can
    lead to unfair or discriminatory practices, as has been noted among many recommendation
    engines (Noriega, 2020). Other technologies can also have harmful effects on society.
    Facebook, among others, banned so-called deep fake videos that realistically apply
    false or misleading statements to real people. Economic Corporate Digital Responsibility
    relates to the responsible management of the economic impacts of digital technologies.
    Much has been said about the replacement of human jobs by robots and other digital
    technologies, and this is certainly a relevant part of economic CDR. Yet, it also
    relates to the creation of new jobs in a digital world that are enriching, purposeful,
    and interesting. There is emerging evidence to suggest that the so-called gig
    economy creates jobs that are often uninteresting, repetitive, and underpaid (Tan
    Z.M., 2021). There are also questions regarding the sharing of the economic benefits
    of digitization with society through taxation of digital work, and fair compensation
    of data monetization to the original owners. Finally, Environmental Corporate
    Digital Responsibility concerns the link between digital technologies and the
    physical environment. There are many issues here, including the responsible recycling
    or disposal of old computer equipment. The extension of obsolescence cycles by
    one year, for example, can have an enormous impact on the environment.5 There
    are also issues regarding the limiting of power consumption, including reducing
    the use of electricity to support bitcoin mining. 3.4.1.4. A call for a multi-disciplinary
    focus on CDR Many organizational processes, practices, and projects exist to address
    digital aspects of social, economic, and environmental responsibility. Yet, they
    are rarely coordinated or optimized. Some, like cybersecurity, tend to be the
    responsibility of IT departments, others, like workforce automation, may fall
    under the purview of operations, and yet other elements may sit with HR, legal,
    engineering, R&D, or particular lines of business. Without effective coordination,
    organizations leave themselves open to risks, and may miss out on rewards. Research
    too, is required to better understand the dynamics of CDR from both theoretical
    and empirical perspectives. This research will need to be multi-disciplinary since
    CDR covers aspects of many different fields, including IS (the coordination of
    technology and people), IT (the ethical design of technologies themselves), operations
    (the development of systems and practices to embed CDR in organizational processes),
    organizational design (how to set up structures to effectively govern CDR activities),
    strategy (how to align CDR with other organizational objectives), and OB (how
    to train people to act in responsible ways). In summary, as the sustainability
    and digitization trends continue to grow, Corporate Digital Responsibility will
    become increasingly relevant for organizational performance, both to mitigate
    risks as well as find new sources of advantage. As researchers, we need to get
    ahead of this trend not only to better understand it, but to influence its development
    through the creation and dissemination of tools, frameworks and best practices
    to practicing managers. 3.4.2. Contribution 17 – digitalization and the myth of
    sustainability: some critical reflections – Professor Suprateek Sarker Digitalization
    is all around us, and we are all well aware of the value digitalization brings
    to help improve many facets of human existence. Indeed, when we think about digitalization,
    most of us see the positive impacts digitalization has had, and can potentially
    have, on the environment. After all, in digitizing business processes, we drastically
    reduce, even eliminate the consumption of paper, which saves trees, and in turn
    contributes to better environmental outcomes. We also think of how, through metering,
    we are able to encourage consumers to consume less electricity, which again contributes
    to better environmental outcomes (e.g., Wunderlich, Veit, & Sarker, 2019). Perhaps
    a more high-profile example that we can all relate to pertains to the new generation
    of automobiles, that have been described as “computers on wheels” (Wade, 2016).
    Digitalization vehicles can help to optimize fuel and/or battery usage, and hence
    result in less pollution of the environment. Furthermore, metaphors like ‘cloud’
    imply something floating and delicate” and green, and add to our sense that digitalization
    is at the heart of our battle to save the environment (Crawford, 2021, p. 41)
    and can have a significant role in addressing climate change. Yet, many argue
    that the above represents a grossly biased picture, and is a consequence of the
    largely pro-digitalization, “digital utopia” narrative which includes the myth6
    of digitalization’s contribution to sustainability, that is promoted by tech companies,
    sections of the business press, and those fascinated by the wonders of digitalization.
    Crawford (2021), among others, provides a critical commentary on the “mineralogical
    layer” (p. 32) underlying digital technologies and AI that made me acutely aware
    of the environmental effects associated with digitalization. She notes that “seventeen
    rare earth elements,” that are part of virtually every digital device/technology
    surrounding us, have to be extracted from mines. Mining of such minerals is not
    only associated with slavery, conflicts, and human exploitation very often, but
    also results in dangerous waste. Specifically, she quotes David Abraham who writes
    “. 99.8% of earth removed in rare earth mining is discarded as waste… that are
    dumped back into the hills and streams” and this leads to “pollutants like ammonium…”
    (pp. 36–37). Particularly alarming is the estimate by the Chinese Society of Rare
    Earths that refining one ton of these elements “produces 75,000 liters of acidic
    water and one ton of radioactive residue” (p. 37). The amount of consumption of
    water and electricity by data centers and other components of the digital infrastructure
    is also shocking, but is largely hidden from view or consciousness of the average
    consumer or decision-maker, who is led to believe that digitalization is “clean”
    and a key part of the solution for the environmental crisis (pp. 42–45). Along
    similar lines, Wade (2016) suggests that in addition to batteries and their deleterious
    environmental impacts, “rare metals are sprinkled throughout vehicles, mostly
    in the magnets that are in everything from the headlights to the on-board electronics.
    But those rare metals come from somewhere—often, from environmentally destructive
    mines… and processed in less-than-green ways.” The point of highlighting the above
    issues is not that digitalization needs to stop. The point is to make people aware
    that there are environmental trade-offs that we are implicitly making when we
    use digital technologies. Indeed, by many accounts, the clean paperless image
    has been carefully cultivated, and it distorts the assessment of environmental
    impacts in one direction, in favor of further digitalization. As IS researchers
    who embrace the sociotechnical view (e.g., Sarker, Chatterjee, Xiao, & Elbanna,
    2019), we are aware that the need for efficiency, effectiveness, and economic
    value needs to be balanced with a consideration of humanistic outcomes. Given
    the critical role that the environment, especially in the form of climate change,
    is seen to play in shaping human wellbeing (even threaten survival), we need to
    consider environmental outcomes as an undeniable aspect of humanistic outcomes
    of digitalization. While outlining a research program is not feasible in a short
    editorial segment, there are a few points I would like to make, that may have
    implications for research and teaching: As researchers and teachers, we need to
    develop and communicate a balanced picture of digitalization, and not unreflectively
    perpetuate the “digital utopia” narrative. We must reflect on the culture that
    our societies have developed, of technology infusion in human processes as a natural
    course of development of organizations, economies, and societies. We need to develop
    frameworks and metrics that will help managers and technology consumers assess
    the economic value and convenience with respect to the true costs. Just as we
    have metrics to capture the economic value of digital technology implementation,
    we need to develop and incorporate the use of environment-related criteria and
    metrics as part of the proposal and justification process for any significant
    digitization initiative. At a very basic level, we need to ask why we need digital
    technology infusion in a certain aspect of life, and whether it is warranted when
    a holistic assessment is done. And, we need to develop conceptual and analytic
    tools to be able to carry out such assessments, even if such analysis is initially
    far from perfect. Obviously, the environmental damage resulting from the harnessing
    of digital technologies is a systemic issue involving many different stakeholders,
    and IS scholars cannot solve the problems themselves, but we need to actively
    consider how we may be part of the solution. We need to become aware of the issues,
    make the environmental costs transparent in our communication with stakeholders,
    conduct revelatory studies of the hidden environmental costs of certain technologies
    that are extolled, create models that incorporate benefits and costs including
    environmental costs, and, most importantly, make our students aware of the one-sidedness
    of the pro-digitalization narrative. We need to incorporate environmental impact
    analysis of digitalization initiatives as part of the IS curriculum, and foster
    an environmental consciousness among the students with respect to digitalization.
    Undoubtedly, a lot of research will be needed to enable decision makers to link
    environmental costs to a particular decision pertaining to digitalization. Many
    of us talk about responsible AI – here, my objective is to encourage responsible
    digitalization, and the responsibility is regarding environmental impacts of digitalization.
    As we set out on this path, I reiterate that our goal will not be to single-mindedly
    promote or oppose digitalization, but to “right-size” the extent of digital infusion
    in any initiative, after careful consideration of benefits and costs, where costs
    will not only consider the immediate tangible financial implications but also
    environmental costs over time that humanity will be left to bear. 3.4.3. Contribution
    18 – systems for sustainable growth – Professor Maung Sein and Dr Leona Chandra
    Kruse “Stark realities, critical choices […] Years, or even decades, of progress
    have been halted or reversed.” These alarming statements began this year’s Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) report, underlining the gloomy consequences of COVID
    19 related crises. The prospect, however, is not all doom and gloom. Digital transformation
    has been accelerated in various governmental and business sectors, and we need
    to continue harnessing the potentials of information systems to address key societal,
    economic, and ecological issues. Supported by well-designed information systems,
    researchers, economic actors, policymakers, and civil society can join forces
    to rebuild a more resilient and sustainable future. Perhaps no issue is more crucial
    now than the threat of climate change. This is not just an isolated threat: it
    directly challenges our conceptualization of sustainable growth and sustainability
    itself. We view sustainability as a synergy across people, planet, and profit,
    following the SDGs. We place a particular emphasis on a holistic view of information
    systems (IS) for sustainability which entails the study of designing, engineering,
    using, and disposing of information systems in order to minimize their environmental
    impact as well as to promote sustainability-related practices. This holistic view
    embraces different initiatives across various computing and informatics disciplines
    in the spirit of transdisciplinarity and multilateralism. In the following, we
    will delve into the role of IS in this crucial discourse on the threat of climate
    change. We will first set the scene by providing our perspective on IS and sustainability.
    We will then propose specific approaches that the IS research community can take
    to address the issues we raise. We will conclude our editorial segment by discussing
    issues related to evaluating the initiatives and frameworks aimed at meeting sustainability
    challenges. 3.4.3.1. Setting the scene The thirteenth SDG persuades us to “take
    urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts,” and this year’s report
    continues to urge us on how “rising greenhouse gas emissions require shifting
    economies towards carbon neutrality” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 20). For us,
    this urging means exploring new and alternative approaches to minimize the environmental
    impact of information systems, in addition to our ongoing measures. We observe
    several ongoing transdisciplinary movements to this end. One of them, computing
    within limits, aims to reshape computing research by acknowledging a need for
    limits (LIMITS, 2021). This movement is guided by three core ideas: aiming for
    a steady-state economy and acknowledging the limit of growth, considering models
    of scarcity in order to promote resilience, and reducing energy and material consumption
    while avoiding the rebound effect (Nardi et al., 2018). Rethinking the status
    quo in our design and computing assumptions can help us shape the way forward.
    Minimizing the environmental impact of information systems, however, concerns
    not only the design and use period. We need to anticipate what happens in the
    post-use period, that is, minimizing and managing e-waste. This is echoed by the
    twelfth SDG: “ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” However,
    this year’s report shows that “electronic waste continues to proliferate and is
    not disposed of responsibly [.] Each person generates about 7.3 kg or e-waste,
    but only 1.7 kg was recycled” (United Nations (UN), 2021, p. 19). 3.4.3.2. Design
    science research for sustainability What can the IS community do to meet the enormous
    challenges posed by the threat of climate change in particular and to sustainability
    in general? The simple answer is that research needs to make this a key area to
    address. Understanding the phenomenon, explaining the mechanisms of climate change
    and predicting its consequences are agendas that continuously engage researchers
    from across the disciplines. We propose that the IS community can significantly
    contribute to these ongoing initiatives through designing artifacts (systems,
    prototypes, methods or frameworks). While designing systems in a way to best accomplish
    a particular purpose (combating climate change in our case here), lies at the
    very core of what we do in our discipline, our call here is to take a design science
    research (DSR) approach in our research. DSR aims at creating new prescriptive
    knowledge through building methods and artifacts to improve the world in some
    way, however incremental. The DSR paradigm is fundamentally a problem solving
    paradigm. It is not atheoretical tinkering – artifacts are developed based on
    theoretical and conceptual foundations, drawing upon the knowledge base for explanation
    research – and in the process creates theoretical and conceptual knowledge that
    are of prescriptive nature such as design principles that are transferable to
    other contexts. While care is taken to ensure rigor, the very fact that the artifacts
    developed through DSR are to solve problems faced by the society makes it relevant
    by definition. 3.4.3.3. Sustainability as value for design DSR is perfectly placed
    to meet the threats to sustainability. Among the papers and prototypes presented
    in the 2021 edition of the premier conference of the DSR community (Design Science
    Research in IS Technology – DESRIST), one is an excellent illustration of what
    the IS community can do. Hillebrand and Johannsen (2021) developed a chatbot called
    KlimaKarl “to Promote Employees’ Climate-Friendly Behavior in an Office Setting”.
    The App can be classified under “persuasive technology” that has been used successfully
    in the health sector to promote healthy living (e.g. weight management) through
    behavior change. Obviously such systems cannot force behavior change but can definitely
    informate users. A system of this genre can prove to be useful in the particular
    case of wind powered energy in Norway. While there is a broad support for developing
    green energy, many localities vehemently oppose constructing windmills in their
    areas. Systems can be effective in helping citizens see a balanced view and hopefully
    reduce opposition to windmills. DSR, like any research approach, is not value
    free (Iivari, 2010) and consequently, “the values of DSR should be made as explicit
    as possible” (p. 44). The burden of explicating the value of the designer and
    his/her goal in designing the artifact is essential to help the user understand
    the possible deleterious outcome or the unintended dark side of the technology.
    This is a particular sensitive issue with the use of persuasive technology in
    a debated issue such as sustainability. 3.4.3.4. Green practices within DSR Finally,
    environment-friendly practices such as green computing and green coding can be
    incorporated in the design of artifacts, whether as a DSR project or routine design.
    These practices help to minimize the environmental impact of the resulting information
    systems. The IS research community is also a user of IT. We need to be mindful
    of the potential e-waste of our research endeavor and ingrain e-waste management
    in our daily behavior. Some of the points in this editorial indeed represent critical
    choices which must be made in the face of the stark climate realities. 3.5. Role
    of data, technology and IS governance 3.5.1. Contribution 19 – climate change
    and role of information technologies – Professor Babita Gupta 3.5.1.1. Information
    technologies and climate change Information technologies require energy at every
    stage of its life-cycle and contribute to the carbon footprint. However, IT is
    also helping reduce net carbon emissions in various industry sectors. Technology-enhanced
    working using the video conferencing and cloud-based collaboration that has accelerated
    during the COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be a double-edged sword (Frontier technologies,
    2020). While these technologies helped the environment by significantly reducing
    the impacts of travel and commuting, they also increased carbon emissions since
    the backend infrastructure, such as massive data centers, is enormously energy-intensive.
    Current estimates of information and communication technology (ICT) impact range
    from 1.4% to 3.9% of global CO2 emissions, highlighting the need for accurate
    data on ICT’s impact on the environment (Cunliff, 2020, Murugesan, 2021, Robertson,
    2021). Several information technologies are poised to play a critical role in
    monitoring, managing, and mitigating climate change-related phenomena and increasing
    environmental resiliency. For example, artificial intelligence and robotics are
    being utilized for automated detection and monitoring of environmental hazards,
    remote sensing to track deforestation activities and marine life, monitoring biodiversity,
    traffic flow optimization, estimating real-time precipitations, and managing flood
    risks and emergency planning. Increasing occurrences of extreme weather events
    are affecting food production and distribution globally. Advancements in information
    technology utilizing multi-source spatial and temporal data, robotics, drones,
    Internet-of-Things (IoT), etc., are being explored in the agriculture and transport
    industry. For example, precision agriculture technology is an environmentally
    sustainable strategy for optimizing water input, weed control, disease eradication,
    pest reduction, and yield enhancement to avert water and food insecurity and optimize
    the food production chain. Data centers are the backbone for managing big data,
    cloud computing, AI, blockchain, and IoT. They also have massive power consumption
    needs contributing to climate change. Researchers and innovators are exploring
    novel technologies such as liquid cooling that improve heat-dissipation efficiency
    and reduce their impact on the environment to reduce the carbon footprint of data
    centers and other IT infrastructure. 3.5.1.2. Role of higher education in building
    environmental resiliency Higher education institutions can provide knowledge and
    resources to the learners and create awareness, inspiring the next generation
    to navigate the complexities of climate change. Education and training can encourage
    learners to think about technological and behavioral changes to reduce and mitigate
    environmental impact within their local sphere of influence and macro level. Institutions
    offering information systems and related programs are beginning to incorporate
    pedagogical practices in their curriculum that engage students to reflect on organizations’
    sustainable and responsible technology adoption and use practices. Educational
    institutions can create partnerships with community stakeholders to accelerate
    carbon-neutral business practices and build environmental resiliency. Several
    universities are forming coalitions committed to climate action, such as the University
    Climate Change Coalition, to leverage scientific knowledge and expertise for climate
    change solutions. In addition, universities are offering programs that emphasize
    environmental justice and equity, such as responsible business MBA and hospitality
    and sustainable management. 3.5.1.3. Research agenda and climate change The estimates
    for carbon dioxide levels in the year 2021 are at 417 parts per million. Bringing
    it down to the safer threshold of 350 parts per million would require the removal
    of about 2000 gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere over the next century (Fork
    and Koningstein, 2021, Frontier Technologies to Protect the Environment and Tackle
    Climate Change, 2020). This reversal of climate change would require everyone’s
    effort, including researchers in the IT, information systems, and related areas,
    to develop a robust and practical research agenda: Methodologies to assess the
    sustainability of ICT Infrastructure. • Develop an actionable set of metrics that
    can measure the reliable and precise impact of an information technology infrastructure,
    an IT project, or a portion of the cloud in terms of its carbon budget and footprint
    • Develop reporting mechanisms, models, and infrastructure that would make it
    easy for companies to evaluate their as well as their supply chain partners’ emissions
    and environmental impact. Sustainable, greener technologies. • Strategies grounded
    in organization behavior and culture that persuade companies to shift from fossil-fuel-based
    electricity to using cleaner, renewable energy solutions in their IT projects,
    technology infrastructure, and data centers • Creating mechanisms for designing
    sustainable technologies compliant to be carbon-neutral in the ICT industry by
    2050 • Models for integrating disparate data and prediction models and forecast
    systems for weather, traffic, demand, patterns of consumption, and real-time inventory
    that companies can use to optimize their supply chain and reduce waste and carbon
    footprint • Best practices to make the entire life cycle of IT greener, including
    energy-efficient hardware and software that has reusable code and is optimized
    for the green hardware. Resource recovery and reducing e-waste. • Research on
    e-waste management and strategies for e-waste prevention, smart recycling, and
    resource recovery, without shifting the e-waste burden to still-developing economies.
    Use of behavioral theories to engage stakeholders in climate change solutions.
    • Research on the role of social media and models grounded in behavioral theories
    that can prevent or at least reduce the impact of misinformation on public perception
    of climate change • Strategies to empower consumers so that the collective consumer
    sentiment about climate change imperative can incentivize companies to pursue
    carbon net-zero more actively as a goal • Research on digital and social media
    best practices to increase consumer awareness of the impact of their purchasing
    choices and decisions on environmental sustainability and design strategies that
    nudge consumers to adopt behavior that reduces their carbon footprint. Role of
    governance in climate change innovations. • Research on the role of governments
    in enabling effective guidelines, policies, legislation, incentives, R&D collaborations,
    and regulations about emission standards versus companies setting voluntary targets
    for achieving carbon neutrality within the critical time frame. • Research on
    the role of policy governance within the organizations when implementing IT projects
    and the evaluating impact on the environment. • Research on the role of social
    media and other digital tools to influence leaders in government and businesses
    to embrace sustainable consumption and production. 3.5.2. Contribution 20 – climate
    crisis response: climate crisis response: complex information governance for social
    sustainability – Professor Deborah Bunker "Climate change is destroying our path
    to sustainability. Ours is a world of looming challenges and increasingly limited
    resources. Sustainable development offers the best chance to adjust our course."
    – Ban Ki-moon (2012). We are amid an existential climate crisis which has been
    building since the onset of the industrial revolution (Jonsson, 2012). Information
    systems (IS) scholars continue to debate our contributions to tackle climate change
    and sustainability. In response to the global climate crisis, we are being called
    upon to “develop suitable theoretical frameworks to underpin the investigation
    of complex phenomena and complex problems” on a societal level (Hasan, Smith,
    & Finnegan, 2017, p. 298). In response to any crisis, however, we know that to
    develop and deploy resources effectively, an IS must produce an accurate, reliable,
    and trustworthy assessment of the situation at scale (Bunker, 2020). The key to
    achieving this ''situational awareness'' is the development and implementation
    of an accepted approach to complex information governance for response to societal
    problems and crises (Bunker, 2020, Smith and Stirling, 2008, Nüttgens et al.,
    2011). How the value, authenticity; accuracy; reliability; and legality of information
    is determined, controlled, and assured through acceptable governance mechanisms,
    is at the heart of how information is represented and used to develop situational
    awareness and support sustainability goals for climate action ". the ways in which
    these representations are articulated into knowledge that structure our overall
    understandings" (Smith & Stirling, 2008 - p. 2). Complex information governance
    has, however, been shown to be difficult to assure as seen in the financial market
    failures of 2001 and 2008 and more generally in the response to the current COVID-19
    pandemic. Information governance is defined as "a collection of competences or
    practices for the creation, capture, valuation, storage, usage, control, access,
    archival, and the deletion of information and related resources over its life
    cycle" (Mikalef, Bourab, Lekakos, & Krogstie, 2020). IS research on information
    governance, however, has mainly focussed on big data analytics and organizational
    innovation for formal IS. Far less is known about information governance in complex
    scenarios where formal IS and informal social IS might combine to jointly produce
    situational awareness on which to frame a response. Yet we know of many cases
    where trusted situational awareness, dynamic organizational collaboration and
    multi-stakeholder decision support have been produced by combining formal and
    informal IS. These include adoption and use of: – a cloud-based, freely available
    IS used by environmental non-government organizations (ENGO), for eco-collaboration
    activities in a structurally dynamic manner based on the NGO national context
    i.e., Thai, Lebanese, Australian (Aoun, Vatanasakdakul, & Bunker, 2011). – a combined
    open social media platform and proprietary job scheduling system to communicate
    with and organize a student volunteer army during the Christchurch Earthquakes
    (Bunker, Ehnis, Seltsikas, & Levine, 2013); and – an open social media platform
    for dynamic communication, coordination, and collaboration activities during Hurricane
    Harvey (2017) by emergency management agencies, media organizations, journalists,
    private individuals, celebrities, politicians, and influencers who took on the
    roles of information starters, information amplifiers and information transmitters
    (Mirbabaie, Bunker, Stieglitz, Marx, & Ehnis, 2020). These cases highlight an
    emerging need for development of effective complex information governance approaches
    for IS, using dynamic organizing principles. Lee, Zhu, and Jeffery (2019) researched
    information governance and data management for these types of platform ''ecosystems''.
    While they focussed on data governance and practices, they did not directly address
    the complexity of information governance where trusted situational awareness/consensus
    is developed at a societal level from a combination of formal and informal IS.
    In order to conceptualize and understand complex information governance for development
    of trusted situational awareness and response at scale, transitions may hold the
    key i.e. dynamic co-evolutionary processes that evolve from the "interplay of
    many unlike, particular processes" (Kemp, Parto, & Gibson, 2005, p. 23). Transitions
    present us with an opportunity to develop approaches for complex information governance
    as they are "aimed and guided in an iterative, forward-looking, adaptive manner,
    using markets, institutions and hierarchy (the three basic forms of coordination)"
    (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 23). These three forms of coordination are critical ''global
    levers'' for climate action so consensus regarding information governance at a
    transitional level is crucial for achievement of situational awareness, development
    of sustainability response/goals and resulting action. The key components or mechanisms
    of complex governance for social sustainability include: policy integration, common
    objectives, criteria, trade-off rules and indictors, information and incentives
    for practical implementation and programs for system innovation (Kemp et al.,
    2005). “The most significant challenge is to ensure that multi-player governance
    regimes embody capacity for sustainability-oriented co-ordination, direction and
    re-direction” (Kemp et al., 2005, p. 18). This can be achieved through the nature
    and dynamics of autopoiesis or self-producing/constructing physical systems (Bunker
    et al., 2013, Mingers, 2002, Mingers, 2004). These systems are: self-producing;
    contingently maintained (so that they don''t breakdown); structurally open but
    organizationally closed; structurally determined; able to be structurally coupled
    to other systems by mutual specification and/or co-evolution; and able to embrace
    embodied cognition and self-reference/recursion to enable self-construction/production
    (Mingers, 2002, p. 280). Transitional processes combined with the nature and dynamics
    of autopoietic systems, provide IS scholars with a theoretical basis for complex
    information governance development. The use of both formal organizational IS and
    informal personal/social IS in disaster management and crisis response, has been
    rapidly co-evolving at scale over the last decade (Ehnis & Bunker, 2020). While
    IS scholars have mainly focussed on information governance approaches for formal
    organizational IS, the self-producing/constructing attributes of hybrid IS which
    combine elements of the formal and informal have been largely ignored. The negative
    aspects of social systems and platforms and their combination/integration with
    formally managed and governed IS, have presented society with many problems (Elbanna,
    Dwivedi, Bunker, & Wastell, 2020). There is, however, potential for their management
    and use to effect positive outcomes for social sustainability and the response
    to the global climate crisis, if approaches to complex information governance
    are developed and implemented by IS scholars and practitioners. Currently there
    is a global focus on the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
    (STEM) education, but more recently there have been calls for a reframing of STEM
    from techno-science, towards a science of reconnection with nature (Smith & Watson,
    2020). IS courses and training can therefore, make a valuable contribution to
    the development of complex information governance for social sustainability at
    scale by developing and delivering units of study that focus on: 1) complex information
    governance and leadership for social sustainability - frameworks, concepts, descriptions,
    rules and communications approaches based on transitions and autopoietic systems;
    2) how to work in large and diverse teams - understanding, implementing and accommodating
    approaches to complex information governance; 3) and understanding the information
    governance of global supply networks and logistics for sustainable development
    goals. 3.5.3. Contribution 21 – climate change – IT – Data Science perspective
    – Ms Jeel Dharmeshkumar Shah The world’s climatic conditions seem to deteriorate
    every day, and the evidence from the research(Shaftel, 2021) held at NASA further
    bolsters this claim. The researchers at NASA further believe that the unprecedented
    warming trends today are the effect of human actions. Since most of these actions
    involve the development or use of technology, it certainly plays a significant
    role in climate change. The world today seems to be in a state of quandary. Whether
    to restrict the use of technology or invest in further research in the same field
    is a concern. However, in this case, I believe that the cause is the solution-
    just like the snake venom that is fatal for humans but is also proven to be medicinal
    and used to save lives. When the problem is so complicated, the solution must
    also be four-fold; we must take the System-of-Systems (SoS) approach. We must
    be able to analyze the dependencies of various systems - such as human, environmental,
    physical and information systems- which the SoS framework can enable. This could
    be a holistic approach to finding possible solutions to this complicated issue
    as it provides a good understanding from all viewpoints. Data Science is a required
    field for this discussion as it can analyze all forms of data and help automate
    crucial decisions. ‘Green Technology’ is expected to transform our society. The
    Climate Group, in their report, estimates that smart technologies such as smart
    homes/buildings, smart transport and logistics, intelligent agriculture management
    systems and smart electricity grids are a few of the various ways that can help
    reduce greenhouse emissions. It is Data Science that makes these technologies’
    Smart’ or ‘Intelligent’. While Big Data provides a platform for processing large
    chunks of heterogeneous data, Data Analytics and AI help analyze this data and
    identify trends (with the help of machine learning to identify main features and
    make predictions). This intelligence is then used in business to make informed
    and calculated decisions. Cloud computing can further be used to accelerate the
    process, and IoT could help apply these efficiently in a practical scenario. Analyzing
    the foot-fall data of various public transport systems, for example, could help
    identify efficient routes, and this ‘Smart Transport System’ would then optimize
    its fuel consumption and aid in reducing carbon footprints. Another such example
    would be a ‘smart air conditioning system’ that collects, compares and analyses
    weather and usage data to develop plans that optimize economic and environmental
    savings—solutions such as these help tackle issues regarding the sustainability
    of the climate. Various techniques followed by the Data Scientist aid this kind
    of analysis. Classification is one such technique that draws meaningful information
    and differentiates the data based on similarities found in its attributes. Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) can also be utilized in many practical scenarios for cause
    and effect analysis. One such example is the study carried out in the United States
    that used this technique to identify the factors affected due to differences in
    hydro-climatology of two different streams. This study successfully inferred how
    the differences affected the average runoff, flow stability(from baseline) and
    frequency of floods in the two areas (Poff, Tokar, & Johnson, 1996). Further improvements
    in the climate model were also made in 2003 (Knutti, Stocker, Joos, & Plattner,
    2003) to increase its efficiency with larger datasets. Calculations from this
    model revealed that almost half the members surpassed the surface heating range
    that the IPCC estimated earlier. In such challenging scenarios, neural networks
    can help extensively. It is all used to explore the general trend in climate change
    and its mechanisms to identify the hidden correlation/attributes in the data that
    is otherwise not decipherable. The use of Solar energy has become increasingly
    popular today as it is a renewable source of energy. One of the major drawbacks
    of this form of energy is that its availability widely depends on meteorological
    conditions. The efficiency and performance of a solar power plant would depend
    on these changing conditions. Jang, Bae, Park, and Sung (2016) has discussed how
    we can leverage images captured by the satellite to train a SVM (Support Vector
    Machine) model and predict the motion of clouds. This could be a brilliant way
    to determine when the plant would be most productive and when it would require
    backup. In this way, data analytics could help manage climate changes for uninterrupted
    and effective energy production. Climate change also significantly affects coral
    reefs that are important for the ecosystem as they provide food and shelter for
    their inhabitants. Thermal stress due to the warming of the ocean could cause
    infectious diseases, while frequent intense storms could lead to the destruction
    of the reefs. A rise in sea levels could lead to sedimentation, whose runoff can
    destroy the corals, while fluctuations in precipitation lead to an increase in
    runoff that could make the water murky and restrict the light. One such study
    (Franco, Hepburn, Smith, Nimrod, & Tucker, 2016) conducted in 2016 used the Bayesian
    Network approach to evaluate how climate change disturbances affected the coral
    reefs. The study revealed interesting results identifying the factor that contributed
    the most to the carbonate budgetary state of the reef and concluded that the change
    in the state of the reef was mainly due to the decrease in water quality (Franco
    et al., 2016). Data Science offers a plethora of such techniques that can be applied
    in the majority of challenging scenarios. It can help in the acquisition of environmental
    data as well as monitoring and analyzing it. This can help take immediate actions
    in case of an emergency or check if an industry is compliant with the pollution
    control requirements. Remote sensing and continuous data monitoring improve data
    availability that is the foundation for Data analysis. Risk analysis is another
    critical feature that can be used in combination with IoT enabled devices to send
    real-time alerts in case of high-risk prediction. These alerts and controls maintain
    safety by keeping a check on potential hazards. Results drawn from such analysis
    could also aid in finding sustainable alternatives. These advantages are very
    beneficial for governance, and the government has collaborated with the IT industry
    in developing and launching schemes that help alleviate the environmental conditions.
    The ‘National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)’ was established in 2020 by the central
    government that is predicted to reduce 20–30% of particulate matter concentration
    in 4 years by 2024 (NCAP, 2020). Another such flagship scheme introduced by the
    government is the ‘Namami Gange Programme’ that aims to reduce water pollution,
    conserve effectively and revive river Ganga (Namami Gange Programme, 2020). With
    the enormous number of benefits and applications, Data Science, in my opinion,
    has not yet reached its full potential. This is because ‘Data’ forms the foundation
    of Data Science, and without accurate and complete data, ambitious goals can be
    challenging to achieve. A recent paper published on the 10th of October 2021 (Callaghan
    et al., 2021) successfully collected enough evidence to conclude- based on mapping
    of 10000 attributes- that almost 80% of the land area globally is affected by
    climate changes caused by human actions. This is an excellent insight although
    the researchers also identified the ‘attribution gap’. Though the paper could
    draw important information about global climate models, it failed to understand
    the impact of climate on low-income countries. This was because they were unable
    to collect enough data from these regions. Shruti Nath, a researcher at Climate
    Analytics, said, “Developing countries are at the forefront of climate impacts,
    but we can see in our study there are real blind spots when it comes to climate
    impact data. Most of the areas where we are not able to connect the dots attribution-wise
    are in Africa. This has real implications for adaptation planning and access to
    funding in these places” (Mercator, 2021). Although curation of data and its quality
    remains a problem, my belief in the potential of this field stays unaltered. Though
    there are many hurdles on the way, Data Scientists are working hard in fighting
    these challenges and coming up with new and improved solutions every day. 3.5.4.
    Contribution 22 – the IS/IT in addressing the challenges of climate change – Dr
    Matti Mäntymäki 3.5.4.1. Need of increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT Digital services, platforms, and infrastructures consume significant
    amounts of electricity globally. On the other hand, digital infrastructures consume
    electricity. From this vantage point, for example Bitcoin can hardly be considered
    an environmentally sustainable technology. Moreover, the upgrade from HD to 4–8 K
    quality in video has an effect on the energy consumption of the devices such as
    smartphones and tables used to watch the videos. Considering the global smartphone
    penetration, energy consumption of smartphones is a significant sustainability
    issue. All in all, this calls for increased attention to the sustainability implications
    of IS/IT development and operations. This in turn requires that sustainability
    impact of digital services, platforms, and infrastructures be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion. 3.5.4.2. Reducing digital waste through
    IS/IT design As the volumes of data being created, transmitted, and stored have
    skyrocketed also the volumes of ’digital waste’, i.e. unused digital content,
    have surged. To provide some perspective of this phenomenon, CO2 emissions of
    YouTube in 2019 was evaluated to equal a city size of Glasgow.7 A well-known example
    of how IS/IT design could reduce CO2 emissions is not to show video for users
    who are only listening to audio. This idea of digital waste reduction videos could
    be taken a step further by default by asking the user if he/she wants to see the
    video in addition to the audio content. In addition, energy efficiency can be
    considered in website design. Typically, today’s websites are dynamic. While this
    design approach offers benefits in terms of user experience, it basically requires
    that the server hosting the website creates the website for the user. A static
    website that is stored on the server and updated on a 12-hour or 24-hour interval
    is considerably more power efficient. 3.5.4.3. Research-based decision-making
    to accelerate adoption of ‘green initiatives’ Resulting from the increased innovation
    around Greentech, there will be various new technological solutions to address
    the challenges of climate change. The effectiveness and impact of technological
    tools is dependent on their successful implementation as well as adoption and
    use by the users. The academic IS community has worked on technology adoption
    for decades and the individual-level technology adoption has evolved to be one
    of the most mature areas of academic IS research (Venkatesh, Davis, & Morris,
    2007). Hence, the IS community is well-equipped to contribute to the deployment
    of various technological solutions targeted to fight climate change. 3.5.4.4.
    Sharing economy and circular economy as a means towards more resource-effective
    societies The sharing economy is one way for existing resources to be used more
    efficiently (Sutherland & Jarrahi, 2018). Sharing economy at scale is typically
    executed through digital platforms. Digital platforms such as Uber are famous
    for leveraging data, advanced analytics, and artificial intelligence to predict
    and balance supply and demand. Another mechanism toward a more resource-efficient
    society is the circular economy. It is evident that executing a circular economy
    requires implementation of digital infrastructures where the physical and digital
    elements go hand-in-hand (see Lee, 2008; Rajkumar, Lee, Sha, & Stankovic, 2010).
    3.5.5. Contribution 23 – the value of information management in the built environment
    to tackle climate change – Mr Henry Fenby-Taylor The built environment is made
    up of sectors that have an outsize responsibility when it comes to the future
    of our planet. It provides us with our economic infrastructure – power lines,
    roads, railways, utilities, as well as our social infrastructure of homes, schools,
    hospitals and so on. Yet it also contributes around 40% of the UK’s total carbon
    footprint, according to the UK Green Building Council. There is a real sense of
    urgency that this needs to change. Industry leaders are increasingly in consensus
    that they need to prioritize how they mitigate and adapt to climate change, as
    well as reduce emissions. 3.5.5.1. Unlocking the value of data Critical to tackling
    climate change in the built environment will be the use of Information Management.
    It is currently a vast, largely untapped resource that will be pivotal in transforming
    the decision making process. At its core, Information Management is about making
    efficient use of resources – it’s about transforming information about the lifecycle
    of built assets into actionable intelligence. Effective information management
    gathers information across the lifecycle of assets from design to creation to
    operation. At each of these stages, data is collected that informs better decision
    making, enabling reductions in waste, time and cost, more efficient use of resources,
    improved design and safety and increased infrastructure resilience – all essential
    for reducing carbon emissions from our built environment and serving those it
    was intended for. Although we have the technology to collect large amounts of
    data it needs to be structured, managed and shared in an effective way to make
    it valuable. The Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB), through the National
    Digital Twin programme (NDTp) is creating the Information Management Framework
    which is a collection of open, technical and non-technical standards, guidance
    and common resources to enable secure and resilient sharing of data across sector
    and organizational boundaries. There are already some excellent examples of successful
    green Information Management in practice. The Energy and Carbon Reporting Framework
    developed by the CDBB, WMEBoom and the Construction Innovation Hub defines when
    operational energy and emissions need to be analyzed and reported during the lifecycle
    of built assets. This tool is providing organizations like NHS Scotland and their
    supply chain the ability to effectively identify and therefore control the energy
    and carbon impact of their built assets. It also supports the Construction Leadership
    Council''s CO2nstructZero programme which sets out how the construction sector
    can meet the Net Zero challenge. 3.5.5.2. Sharing data to improve climate resilience
    The sharing of data is an important part of the process. At the NDTp, the Climate
    Resilience Demonstrator (CReDo) provides a practical example of how connected
    data and greater access to the right information across organizational and sectoral
    boundaries can improve climate adaptation and resilience. Collaborating on CReDo
    are Anglian Water, BT and UK Power Networks who will use their asset and operations
    data as well as weather data on a secure, shared basis to inform an increased
    level of infrastructure resilience. CReDo will integrate data between energy,
    water and telecoms networks to improve climate resilience decision-making across
    infrastructure systems. 3.5.5.3. Fit for the future Although it is clear we should
    be pushing towards a green information economy, there remain hurdles - we need
    a workforce with the appropriate skills who can make it happen. Our work at the
    CDBB has a socio-technical focus and part of this is balancing the technology
    with the people aspect. That is why we commissioned a Skills and Competency Framework
    report, a joint collaboration between Mott MacDonald, Lane4 team and the Construction
    Innovation Hub, that sets out the key roles and skills needed. It is a very practical
    framework that allows organizations and individuals to assess their own needs
    and consider how to address them. 3.5.5.4. A shift in culture Data is no longer
    a commodity to be hoarded, but a resource to be shared. If industry and government
    are serious about tackling climate change there needs to be collaboration and
    there needs to be interoperability between information management systems, so
    that we use all the data we have in a relevant, impactful way. 3.5.6. Contribution
    24 – What can information technology and systems researchers and educators do
    to mitigate climate change? – Dr Wu He To respond to climate change, a significant
    threat to the United States and the world, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences,
    Engineering and Medicine has convened a committee of experts and published a report
    in 2021 to highlight the need for transforming the world''s energy system to one
    with net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2050 (NASEM, 2021). The report
    emphasizes the need to invest in new technology, expand innovation toolkits, and
    reduce the cost of existing technology in a socially just way. My Views on the
    above four questions: 3.5.6.1. Energy Use and Technology The information management,
    information technology, and information systems sectors highly depend on computers,
    sensors, and a wide variety of physical and electronic devices. However, the production
    and use of computers, sensors, storage devices, and other electronic devices require
    a tremendous amount of energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and causing
    harm to the environment. For example, data centers consist of a large number of
    servers and computing resources interconnected by high-speed networks, which need
    to work nonstop 24 × 7. Data centers have to rely on cooling systems to ensure
    all those machines do not overheat. Such cooling systems consume a lot of energy.
    The United States Data Center Energy Usage Report (Shehabi et al., 2016) indicates
    that data centers in the U.S. alone likely consumed approximately 73 billion kWh
    in 2020. Energy efficiency strategies and technologies, including AI and data
    analytics, could help monitor data centers’ energy usage and significantly improve
    energy conservation to reduce cost and carbon emissions. Google has reported using
    AI to reduce energy consumption in its data centers by as much as 40% (Evans &
    Gao, 2016). 3.5.6.2. Potential of information technology on mitigation of climate
    change Information technology has great potential to increase the energy efficiency
    of buildings, transportation systems, manufacturing, supply chains, power grids,
    infrastructure, and agriculture, enabling sustainable solutions for energy consumption
    and usage. Low-cost internet of things (IoT) sensors and devices (e.g., smart
    thermostats, smart humidifiers, smart air purifier, smart air conditioner, smart
    fans, smart blinds, and so on) have been used to reduce energy consumption and
    achieve long term cost savings by tailoring climate-control according to real-time
    needs and lifestyle of people and their schedule (either in the building or away).
    Teleconferencing, telemedicine, e-commerce, and e-learning technologies are playing
    a role in reducing unnecessary travel and thus reducing total emissions into the
    environment. These sensor-based technologies can continuously collect massive
    amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and other relevant parameters
    and adjust based on optimal standards or human preferences and needs. Big data
    analysis and visualization can be leveraged to unlock insights that will help
    individuals, organizations and communities track electricity consumption patterns,
    identify energy leaks, improve energy use efficiency, and find creative ways to
    conserve energy and adapt to climate change faster and better. 3.5.6.3. Suggested
    research agenda on climate change Several potential research ideas on climate
    change for information management, information systems, and technology researchers
    are listed below: • Conducting empirical research to collect first-hand evidence
    and develop evidence-based guidelines and suggestions to help practitioners design
    and implement Green IT(green information technology) and Green IS (green information
    systems) initiatives within their organization. Green IS (green information systems)
    refers to the use of information systems to achieve environmental objectives.
    In contrast, Green IT (green information technology) refers to the practice of
    environmentally sustainable computing and emphasizes reducing the environmental
    impacts of IT production and use (Dedrick, 2010). Green IT/IS can help reduce
    the negative consequences of technology production on the environment and contribute
    to sustainable solutions, including environmentally sustainable business processes,
    practices, and end products in organizations and communities (Boudreau, Chen,
    & Huber, 2008). • Studying the adoption of energy-saving IT in locations like
    home, businesses and communities, and assessing the impacts of information technology
    innovations on human behavior, mitigation of climate change, and relevant policymaking.
    • Conducting design-based research on designing and developing AI-based techniques,
    modeling and simulation, decision support tools, games, visualization, and other
    technologies or approaches that help the general public visualize and understand
    possible impacts of climate change. • Studying the use of games, mobile apps,
    augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality and other technology innovations
    in promoting environmentally sustainable behavior that contributes to climate
    change mitigation. Such studies could help understand the role of human behavior
    in achieving climate change mitigation strategies, reveal insights why people
    choose to engage in specific environmentally sustainable behavior or not, develop
    innovative approaches, policies, best practices, and solutions to climate change
    (Douglas & Brauer, 2021). 3.5.6.4. IT/IS education on climate change This generation
    and future generations need to understand the impacts of climate change on our
    daily lives and society. IT/IS education could play a critical role in helping
    individuals and communities in the understanding of the science behind climate
    change and what steps are needed to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions and global
    warming caused by climate change and human activity. IS/IT educators could use
    project-based or problem-based learning approaches to engage students to explore
    specific climate change issues and community-related climate datasets (e.g., heat,
    cold, rain, drought, snow, wind, river, lake, ocean, water quality, air quality,
    and coastal flooding) and to assess the impact of potential solutions by leverage
    existing software, tools and techniques such as data analysis and visualization,
    modeling and simulation, augmented reality/virtual reality/mixed reality, and
    AI techniques. When students are asked to use technology tools to explore specific
    climate change issues and datasets of interest or relevance to their local communities,
    they are more likely to become interested and engage in active learning for systems
    thinking, complex problem-solving, creativity, and evidence-informed decision-making.
    In the meantime, they will become familiar with these software, tools, and techniques
    through learning by using them to analyze data and solve problems in a meaningful
    way. Students will have a chance to develop interdisciplinary skills to interpret
    complex data analysis and visualization results into informed decisions and sound
    policies. The ability and skills to interpret data and communicate results to
    support the decision-making process are important for IT/IS students to become
    effective decision makers or problem-solvers in their careers. IS/IT educators
    are recommended to come up with concrete learning activities, to develop technology-related
    case studies, tutorials, projects, and exercises on the topic of climate change,
    and to encourage their students to work on collaborative or hands-on projects
    using open-source resources, including various datasets and open-source software
    and tools available on the Internet, such as CODAP, R, Python, and more. There
    exists significant levels of climate change, open-source projects on GitHub, which
    is an excellent way for IT/IS students to learn, practice, and contribute. 3.6.
    Technology and IS research agenda 3.6.1. Contribution 25 – holistically missing:
    climate change and information systems research – Professor Samuli Pekkola 3.6.1.1.
    Introduction and related activities In Finland, the Ministry of Transport and
    Communications recently published a climate and environmental strategy for the
    information and communication technology sector (Ojala & Oksanen, 2021). The strategy
    defines ICT related objectives and measures for carbon-neutral Finland, paying
    attention to ICT infrastructures and their energy efficiency, making recommendations
    on energy aspects in software and service procurement, considering material flows
    and recycling of the devices, suggesting energy consumption statistics on data
    centers, and increasing awareness of energy specific issues of software and hardware.
    These areas and objectives, and their measures are evidently impactful on climate
    change. They increase awareness and provide general goals. Unfortunately, the
    strategy pays no attention to how the use of ICT impacts on climate and environment.
    The use aspect is touched, for example, in the European Commission’s ICT for Sustainable
    Growth (2021) program, where, similarly to Estonia (2018), UK (Howes, 2020), and
    Norway (2016), the point of foci is on sustainable economics, not on sustainable
    ecology, environment, green ICT, or climate change – whatever term is adopted.
    This means that, in practice, environmental issues and ICT are approached either
    sporadically with a narrow view and disconnected contexts, or indirectly in the
    context of economic growth and prosperity. Similarly, IT/IS literature sees environmental
    issues as something that the ICT managers should consider in their work. For example,
    Esfahani, Rahman, and Zakaria (2015) and Singh and Sahu (2020) summarized the
    green IS studies focusing on the benefits, adoption, design and implementation,
    or initiation of green IS projects. Loeser (2013) takes a more concrete approach
    and lists a variety of different contexts for green IS initiatives. Wang X. (2015),
    Wang Y. (2015)’s meritorious literature review parallels these and poses a set
    of research questions, all aiming to understand the green IS initiatives. In general,
    it seems that IS literature focuses the adoption of ideas of climate change into
    the IS activities and context. Comprehensive understanding about how to apply
    and use IT/IS to improve the situation regarding climate change seem to be scarce.
    3.6.1.2. Towards a holistic understanding of IS and climate change The absence
    of comprehensive approaches is surprising especially after the lessons from COVID-19.
    For example, the amount of traveling decreased up to 90% in California due to
    stay-at-home orders (Schilling 2020). At the same time, air quality improved significantly
    (Eregowda, Chatterjee, & Pawar, 2021). People have learned new ways of working,
    learning, and living, without a need to travel to work, school, or anywhere. Although
    these settings of distant working, online learning, and online shopping, traveling,
    and leisure have been studied (c.f. Dwivedi et al., 2020; Pan & Zhang, 2020),
    the approach is again contextual: how to use IS in online meetings or education,
    how to provide or acquire goods, food, or services online, and how to manage and
    govern the IT (Herath & Herath, 2020). Contextual approach becomes problematic
    with the interconnectivity of systems and the systems of systems. For example
    during the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning tools have turned out to be quite
    efficient in conveying learning contexts to distant learners, although some learning-related
    difficulties have been identified (Chen and Roldan, 2021, Xie et al., 2020). Yet
    the difficulties may go beyond the learning contexts. Online activities have been
    reported to increase loneliness, disconnectivity with fellow students and teachers,
    distraction, mental problems, and increased workload (Maqableh and Alia, 2021,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). These negative issues may have unpredictably long-lasting
    effects on learners: for instance, do they know the topics, have they made friends,
    and have they learned to interact in face-to-face situations? The quality of an
    online learning environment may have an impact on the rest of the learner’ life.
    Similarly, targeting green IS/IT activities locally may, or may not, be beneficial
    from the viewpoint of climate change. They may have unintended consequences similarly
    to online learning: activities seemingly beneficial in the short term may possibly
    be harmful in the long run. This notion leads to following research topics: •
    What are the long-term effects of green ICT investments? To climate and environment?
    To people: employees, learners, travelers, and their ways of doing, working, and
    living? To institutions? To firms and other organizations? To other parts of the
    system? • When do the benefits of green ICT investments exceed its investment
    costs? The example of an electric car illustrates this: building an electric car
    is more environmentally harmful than building a petrol car, but the tide turns
    when the car is used enough. What is this turning point for a green IT/IS investment?
    And most importantly: • How can ICT be used to improve the situation regarding
    climate change? Interestingly, we are studying how the ideas and isms of climate
    change and green ICT are adopted, but not how ICT should be used to reduce climate
    change. This has been touched by sustainable economic endeavors, but aren’t there
    any other values in addition to economic issues? 3.6.2. Contribution 26 – information
    technology and climate change – Professor Rameshwar Dubey Irresponsible human
    activities are well reflected in the form of rising sea levels, forest fires,
    extinction of some rare species, the meteoric rise in floods in many parts of
    the world, and fast-shrinking levels of safe drinking water. These are clear indications
    that human influence on climate systems is clear and growing (Wright & Nyberg,
    2017). Whyte (2020) argues that it is now too late to avoid dangerous climate
    change. The negative effects of climate change have attracted significant attention
    from the world''s top leaders, industry, media, and policymakers (Banerjee, 2001,
    Kolk and Pinkse, 2008, Mees et al., 2019). Some scholars argue that “climate change
    threatens irreversible and dangerous impacts,” that may have serious negative
    effects on people and ecosystems (Whyte, 2020), and to address the pressing global
    threat, there exists a unanimous call for an immediate reduction in carbon emission
    levels (Park, Byun, Deo, & Lee, 2015). Although the COVID-19 crisis has caused
    severe discomfort and impacted human lives in significant ways, studies have identified
    signs of some positive and visible regional effects on the planet (Khan, Shah,
    & Shah, 2021). This could be easily explained by a change in behaviors during
    lockdown that has reduced human activities such as transportation, irresponsible
    consumption, production, and industrial activities. In the last two years, there
    is some evidence of an improvement in the quality of air, water and the environment
    looks greener and cleaner than it used to be (Everard et al., 2021). This change
    has been possible due to the role of emerging technologies, (Dwivedi et al., 2020,
    Pan and Zhang, 2020). Many scholars have found positive effects from emerging
    technologies on environmental sustainability: big data and predictive analytics
    capability (Dubey et al., 2019), blockchain technology (Saberi, Kouhizadeh, Sarkis,
    & Shen, 2019), AI (Nishant et al., 2020), and cloud computing enabled supply chain
    design (Shee, Miah, Fairfield, & Pujawan, 2018). However, the COVID-19 crisis
    has further accelerated the debate on “how information technology capabilities
    or information management scholars” can help tackle climate change (He, Zhang,
    & Li, 2021). Despite the general optimism in the role of environmentally friendly
    technologies or emerging technologies in tackling climate challenges, some developed
    and developing economies, industry and global corporations still remain skeptical
    about the role of information technology in tackling the climate change crisis
    (Teräväinen et al., 2014). Wright and Nyberg (2017) argue that the organizations
    in pursuit of their economic gains have in the past lobbied against carbon emissions
    initiatives and further delayed constructive action. Despite the rich body of
    literature on the corporation''s initiative towards mitigating the carbon emissions
    problem (Banerjee, 2001, Wright and Nyberg, 2017), organizational/ management/
    information technology scholars have an important role to play particularly in
    addressing the climate change crisis. There is a need for theory-driven research
    that provides an in-depth understanding of both the causes and possible solutions
    to tackle climate change. We note some clear research gaps in the academic literature
    and posit the following research questions that may help bridge the gaps in our
    understanding and the expected role of the information technology /emerging technologies
    in tackling the climate change crisis: a. How AI-enabled predictive analytics
    techniques may help identify some of the economic activities in some parts of
    the world which are contributing to carbon emissions? b. How the use of distributed
    ledger technology (DLT) and AI can help identify the role of some corporations
    involved in unethical practices that led to contamination of water bodies and
    deforestation? c. How the use of AI enables predictive analytics to detect issues
    during logistics and transportation within developing economies thereby contributing
    to a reduction in carbon emissions? d. How AI-enabled technologies can help build
    swift trust and collaboration among the stakeholders engaged in tackling the climate
    change crises? 3.6.3. Contribution 27 – blockchain and climate change – Dr Daniela
    Andreini Of all technologies in place in the market, the one I know best is the
    blockchain. This technology has environmental, social and economic impacts, and
    in these few words, I would like to focus on the ecological aspects. 3.6.3.1.
    How IM/IT/IS sector has any negative impact on the environment and how it can
    be reduced Like any other technology, blockchain creates a digital ecosystem composed
    of multiple hardware devices, program files, and different actors'' data files.
    Another critical component of the ecosystem is interacting and exchanging cryptocurrencies,
    files, information, etc. The sustainability of the blockchain is controversial;
    for instance, O''Dwyer and Malone (2014) stated that the energy consumption of
    the Bitcoin mining network is comparable with the Ireland electricity consumption.
    In the same way, we can think about the energy and infrastructural consumption
    of all the IM/IT/IS systems that cause enormous energy and infrastructural consumption
    and thus a tremendous environmental impact. 3.6.3.2. How IM/IT/IS can be utilized
    to improve situation regarding climate change At the same time, other authors
    demonstrated that the artificial intelligence and IT ecosystem could find more
    efficient ways to create and exchange information and virtual services. For instance,
    for what concerns bitcoins, Dimitriou and Karame (2013) demonstrated that in mining
    bitcoins, if a miner can create a block more efficiently and speedily than another
    one, the system will substitute the less efficient miner with the most productive
    and profitable one. This mechanism drives the entire system towards a more effective
    way to use and consume energy and infrastructures. Thus, the IM/IT/IS systems
    can be the sources and the solution of energy consumption and dispersion. 3.6.3.3.
    A brief discussion on research agenda related to IM/IT/IS and climate change The
    cost and climate impact of blockchain are strictly related to its diffusion. For
    instance, in this historical moment, the substitution of traditional currencies
    with bitcoins in our monetary system would be too expensive in energy consumption,
    and thus it could not be sustainable. Therefore, in finance, for instance, more
    research is needed to understand how the two monetary systems can coexist efficiently.
    The same thing can be extended to other IM/IT/IS systems: virtualized and physical
    transactions should coexist to balance environmental, social, and economic systems.
    3.6.3.4. How IS/IT education should reflect this Experimentation in education
    is relevant, and more educational systems should turn into laboratories, where
    institutions should offer problem-solving driven teaching methods. 3.6.4. Contribution
    28 – towards a relevant agenda for environmental issues within KM/IM/IS/IT – Professor
    Johan Olaisen The climate crisis is the largest threat to civilization we have
    ever faced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018
    made the science very clear. There are significant climate impacts all around
    the world even if we limit warming to the recommended 1.5 C. The report also showed
    there are significant increases in impacts and damages between 1.5 and 2.0 C.
    These results were fully supported by the IPCC science report (2021). We are building
    our living standards upon coal, gas, and oil, and few of us want to change our
    lives, and new global generations are coming that want our living standards. Every
    corporation wants to be green and practice sustainability even if the reality
    of the image is most often an illusion or just a fashion (Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbd). What is the research situation within knowledge management
    (KM), information management (IM), information technology (IT) and information
    system (IS) research? We investigated all academic papers 2016–2020 (N = 481)
    delivered at the European Conference for Knowledge Management (ECKM). We found
    that less than 5% of the papers investigated climate issues and concluded that
    the KM/IM/IT/IS potentially harms environmental-climate issues owing to neglect
    (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen,
    2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd). All research consists of problem, knowledge,
    and methodology sentences. We get traditional pragmatic business-as-usual research
    when there is an over-focus upon methodology and knowledge sentences and a low
    focus upon problems. We must start to ask the research questions about environmental
    and sustainability issues. Through verification and falsification (Popper, 1974),
    research is expected to come up with theories, paradigms, perspectives (Kuhn,
    1962) that explains and explores practices that we may evaluate, giving us either
    empirical research or critical research (what is acceptable/not acceptable) or
    constructed research (what is adequate and what is not adequate). Most research
    is empirical, and to get more focus upon environmental issues, we must get more
    constructed and critical research setting up the green and sustainable agenda.
    We must ask the essential questions about if the academic papers involve acceptable
    or not acceptable climate solutions or if the papers are adequate or not adequate
    for relevant climate issues. Fig. 3 presents the model of the climate crisis issues

    crisis in information research. Research deals with four paradigms: the empirical,
    the materialistic (political), clarified subjectivity, and action papers. Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbb found that nearly all papers
    might be classified as empirical and as a form of clarified subjectivity papers
    in harmony with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. We must invite
    papers in conflict with accepted problems, methodology, and knowledge. These papers
    will be representing the materialistic political and action paradigms. We must
    ask how research papers, often in conflict, contribute to climate issues. To get
    green and sustainable papers, we must get more problem-focused research on climate
    issues, more critical and constructed papers, more exploring papers built upon
    sensitizing concepts and less upon definitive concepts, and more political and
    action-based papers. Most of all, we need editors and conference chairs dedicated
    to climate issues asking for adequate and critical papers on this topic that might
    be political, action-based, and problems often based in conflict with existing
    issues, knowledge, and methodology. A political economy paradigm for the climate
    crisis in information research is a complement to presently prevailing concepts.
    KM/IM/IS/IT research and papers might be utilized to be a knowledge café, outlet,
    and center for environmental issues and perspectives. We might develop an environmental
    paradigm for relevant KM/IM/IS/IT research. We might define another future for
    societies and organizations. We might be giving the picture of a pluralistic sustainable
    future and even a utopia (More, 1973). We already have the experience through
    AI and robotics forming the fourth industrial revolution and solving the environmental
    issues is the fifth industrial revolution based upon the perspectives from KM/IM/IS/IT
    research. The paradigms within information research focusing upon the climate

    use in the climate crisis. The objective and agenda of IS/I/IT/KM research strategy
    for sustainability are to help to promote knowledge, information, systems, and
    technology that will: • Resolve national and global challenges relating to sustainability
    in corporations and societies • Facilitate industrial development that enhances
    sustainability and increases green competitiveness • Promote the innovativeness
    and creativity for sustainable solutions • Such objectives will include areas
    like: • Reduced climate change and effective adaptation measures • Preservation
    of ecosystems services and lower environmental impacts • Sustainable cities, corporations,
    regions, and transport systems • The circular knowledge economy The IPCC, 2018,
    IPCC, 2021 have mentioned five areas: Food and ecology, Sustainable cities, Energy
    and material, Health and wellbeing, Transportation. IT/IS/IM/KM are mentioned
    as essential for all these areas, and there is a need for developing the areas
    into issues for journals and conferences. The identified focus for research within
    information research is in Scandinavia sustainable private and public cases where
    the green and sustainable practices are documented. These cases should be developed
    into model cases for KM/IM/IS/IT. The cases should be used as action research
    cases promoting a sustainable practise (Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aaa, Jevnaker
    and Olaisen, 2021bbb, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021aac, Jevnaker and Olaisen, 2021bbd).

    model of information research. An important issue is how KM/IM/S/IT in higher
    education should reflect the environmental issues. Education that ensures future
    competencies upon sustainability, reuse, and environmental issues is essential.
    Environmental, green, and sustainable practices are an essential part of green
    education. Green KM/IT/IM/IS practice in action will be significant to get the
    students to participate in the transformational changes. The students must understand
    how different practices influence the environment. I have developed an executive
    program at BI (Oslo) “Sustainable leadership-in-action," where sustainable practices
    are discussed and reflected upon through collaboration with Norwegian businesses
    and the participants'' experiences and where the students project paper is an
    empirical paper reflecting and learning from green practices with a synopsis as
    a reflection upon how they have implemented sustainable practices in their organizations.
    Ideally, should environmental issues be a part of all programs. KM/IM/IS/IT are
    innovative and creative tools for the solutions to environmental issues. Let COP26
    also be the starting line for new objectives, areas, and education within KM/IM/IS/IT.
    We have every tool we need within information research to help to reduce and tackle
    the climate crisis. Let us all contribute!. 4. A brief overview of full opinion
    articles related to this theme This section outlines an appraisal of the selected
    full opinion articles related to this theme included within volume 63 of IJIM.
    Each study covers one or more themes related to the overall climate change and
    emissions reduction agenda, together with the views of the authors on the key
    specific technology and IS related topics. The following table (Table 4) lists
    the full selection of the full opinion articles. Table 4. List of full submitted

    emissions while enhancing value- adding human processes. The opinion article by
    Ågerfalk et al. (2022), explores the Scandinavian perspectives on three current
    research projects where digital transformation is posited as offering a positive
    force in the fight against climate change and its impact on the world. The research
    viewed the climate change challenges from a stakeholder-centric perspective, emphasizing
    the criticality of closely involving people to engender the necessary change required
    in the design of digital technologies and the requirement for green IS researchers
    to engage in a collaborative context. It is vital that emerging technology focussed
    solutions, designed to combat climate change, take account of the necessary ethical
    dimensions and values from the onset to negate the potential scenario of technological
    innovations exacerbating the climate change problem. These aspects are analyzed
    by Brooks et al. (2022) where the opinion article highlights the importance of
    technologies delivering the required socio-economic impact through climate engineering
    solutions. Via a review of the relevant literature, the research reveals the disjointed
    nature of ethical dimensions in many cases, lagging behind emerging technological
    innovations. The study advocates a rebalancing of emphasis where ethical dimensions
    are an integral element of the climate engineering process. The opinion article
    by Laukkanen et al. (2022) argues for the usefulness of virtual technologies for
    changing human consumption behavior toward more sustainable consumption behaviors.
    The article argues that such technologies could provide greater opportunities
    to influence consumer decisions than the present digital environment. The article
    details a discussion on technology-assisted sensory marketing, cognitive and emotive
    aspects of virtual reality, and outlines applications of virtual reality technologies
    to encourage sustainable consumption. The opinion article led by Papadopoulos
    and Balta (2022), highlights the low levels of existing studies that focus on
    the role of Big Data Analytics (BDA) and impact of climate change, positing the
    potential opportunities for more sustainable operations and supply chains. The
    study assesses the challenges faced by operations and supply chains, asserting
    the contribution from BDA in providing a valuable role in the development of solutions
    to the myriad of climate related problems. Environmental sustainability from a
    technology acceptance perspective, is discussed in Papagiannidis and Marikyan
    (2022), where the opinion article highlights the dichotomy of technology negatively
    impacting the environment, whilst helping to manage and save precious natural
    resources. The research offers insights to the technology acceptance process from
    the sustainability perspective, arguing for a change in approach from researchers
    to be more cognisant of the impact of systems on the environment, thereby engendering
    environmentally compliant behaviors. Researchers have highlighted the valuable
    role of smart and climate intelligent cities in the transition from current high
    emission urban infrastructure. The opinion article by Pee and Pan (2022) calls
    for resilient urbanization to weather the impending climate shocks that are likely
    to materialize as a direct result of global warming. The research posits the role
    of IS research and its potential contribution to energy and resource optimization
    and the role of IS in the contribution to mitigating many of the current climate
    change related challenges. The opinion article by Pan et al. (2022) offers an
    Australia focussed perspective to approaching the climate change crisis highlighting
    the role of innovative technologies with huge transformative potential such as
    AI, analytics and IoT to tackle global warming whilst adhering to sustainable
    development goals. The researchers posit a research agenda that focuses on: climate
    resilience, climate-conscious citizen science, and substantive ESG strategies
    that can positively impact global warming. The key challenges related to redesigning
    the necessary human processes to eliminate environmentally harmful activities,
    while maintaining humans’ fundamental value proposition are discussed in the opinion
    article by Trkman and Černe (2022). The opinion article discusses a future world
    where humans transition from digitalization to a human digitalization, recognizing
    the critical role of government and research institutions for this change. The
    researchers highlight the role that technology can have in identifying, planning,
    enabling and executing the required changes in human behavior, as well as measuring
    and communicating their impact. 5. Discussion and recommendations This section
    elaborates on the expert contributions presented in Section 3, to reveal the key
    emphasis and emerging themes relating to digital technology, IS and climate change.
    We highlight the implications for government and society, and develop a number
    of key recommendations for policy, practice and education. 5.1. Expert Contribution
    Analysis A systematic analysis of the contributed articles was undertaken to offer
    a deeper insight to the key topics and underlying analytics. The analysis reviewed:
    a) the frequency of specific keywords mentioned in the articles, b) specific text
    features such as keywords, phrases and c) scores of polarity and sentiment analysis.

    7 presents the polarity analysis of the contributed expert inputs. Most of the
    contributed expert inputs exhibit neutral polarity on the use of digital technologies
    and information management for climate change. If the neutral polarity is ignored,
    and the positive and negative polarity is compared, the majority of authors present
    a generally positive outlook for the use of digital technology and IS for combating
    climate change. This highlights the general consensus from the invited contributors,
    on the important role that technology can play in the global effort to reduce
    emissions to net zero by 2050. Download : Download high-res image (807KB) Download

    inputs. 5.2. Emerging Issues and recommended actions Whilst the views on the extent
    of the role of digital technology and IS in combating climate change vary amongst
    the contributors, there is general consensus that technology is an integral component
    of the overall solution, whilst at the same time - a fundamental aspect of the
    problem (Muregesan, 2008; Osibanjo & Nnorom, 2007). There exists a realization
    amongst many of the contributors that a more sustainable implementation of technology
    in all its forms, needs to be at the forefront of solutions to get to net zero,
    the mistakes of old cannot be repeated once more. A number of the submitted articles
    reference the negative impact of human behavior and people''s attitudes in their
    day to day use of technology, positing the necessity for a transformative change
    in the way technology is developed, used and recycled. The expert input by Professor
    Davison illustrates these points specifically, highlighting the study by Clarke
    and Davison (2020), where the study asserts that very few studies within the IS
    research discourse, viewed the major challenges from the environmental perspective
    or included the environment as a key stakeholder. Professors Constantiou and Vendelø
    develop a narrative that highlights the potential use of technological solutions
    to facilitate the necessary change in human behaviors, citing how technology could
    be used to: identifying climate impact of transportation options, reduction in
    food waste via collaborative consumption and education on sustainable cooking.
    Behavioral influences from the community perspective in the context of faith and
    youth activism, are discussed in the expert inputs by Dr Abumoghli and Professor
    Panteli respectively, highlighting the important role of technology in building
    active communities that challenge the status quo. The expert input from Professor
    Metri cites the study by Junior et al. (2018) to highlight the woeful record of
    environmental sustainability from the technology industry, where the article posits
    the necessity of embedding the UN SDGs within technology design considerations
    and the potential of penalties for organizations that fail to change behaviors.
    The educational awareness and requirements for changed working practices, are
    discussed within a number of submitted articles, where these aspects are viewed
    from the technological perspective and impact on progress to net zero. The expert
    inputs from Professor Barlette and Drs Nishant and Teo identify the need for the
    IS community to educate more effectively to instil a greater awareness of the
    impact from technology adoption and the delicate balance between benefits toward
    net zero and contributing to the problem. The impact of climate change can be
    effectively monitored via the use of technology leading to a greater awareness
    amongst people to change their behaviors. These points are discussed in the expert
    input from Professor Tiwari where the article asserts the benefits of education
    at a community level, to empower people to gain access to knowledge and relevant
    data and assist vulnerable populations in the fight against climate change. The
    manufacture of technology based products relies on the use of precious and finite
    natural resources, at significant cost to the environment (Okafor, 2020). The
    expert inputs by Professors Rowe, Raman and Rana illustrate some of the negative
    impacts on the environment from the use of technology and the necessity for organizations
    to change their working practices to be more cognisant of the impact from the
    choices we make, the effect on the planet and support for the transition to environmentally
    friendly products. Professor Rana further emphasizes the need for education not
    just on climate change but also on how to use technology in a responsible way
    to help reduce carbon emissions and become ambassadors for sustainable living.
    The expert inputs by Professor Michael and Dr Abbas discuss the importance of
    a transition from current IS design practices to a more sustainability focussed
    approach and framework (Crow & Dabars, 2015), presenting a socio-technical sustainable
    design cycle for responsible systems design. A number of the expert contributions
    discussed perspectives relating to the impact of people and communities, where
    key aspects of technology can be used to ensure humans live and work with a “lighter
    touch” to conserve precious resources and attain net zero via the innovative use
    of IS infrastructure (Elbanna at a., 2020). The expert input by Professor Kodama
    references the increasing focus on smart communities in the form of smart cities
    where next generation social systems connect homes, buildings and transport, within
    an environmentally supportive infrastructure, highlighting the criticality of
    an emphasis based on IT collaboration to deliver meaningful change. The smart
    city contribution to reduced emissions is discussed by Professor Scholtz, where
    the contribution highlights the smart environment dimensions of smart cities (Van
    der Hoogen et al., 2020), and the necessity for addressing the necessary skills
    and educational requirements to ensure people can interact with smart infrastructure,
    thereby attaining the intended benefits and sustainable outcomes. The expert input
    from Professor De’ discussed the issues surrounding Green IS initiatives (Dedrick,
    2010; Khuntia et al., 2018; Melville, 2010), and how digital technologies can
    counter the effects of climate change. The article highlights the need for a greater
    emphasis on gender rebalancing to counter the poor access to technology from women
    in developing nations and the disproportionate effect that environmental change
    has on women. Studies have posited the need for a greater focus on responsible
    digitization and corporate digital responsibility (Crawford, 2021; Lobschat et
    al., 2021). These aspects are discussed in the expert inputs from Professor Wade
    and also Professor Sarker where both articulate the need for organizations and
    consumers to take a more holistic view on the use of technology across the full
    lifecycle, highlighting the need for a more balanced, realistic and wider debate
    on environmental tradeoffs. The article by Professor Sein and Dr Chandra Kruse
    advocates a Design Science Research (DSR) approach from the IS community when
    developing sustainability and global warming solutions. This approach aims to
    create new knowledge through building methods and artifacts that are aligned with
    improving societal problems via the greater adoption of green practices. The literature
    has posited the role of technology in the monitoring and governance of climate
    change progression, via the extensive use of IS systems and remote sensing devices
    to provide the necessary data to scientists and decision makers at a global level
    (Bunker, 2020, Nüttgens et al., 2011). The expert input by Dr Mäntymäki highlights
    the need for a greater awareness of the sustainability impact of digital services,
    platforms, and infrastructure and that these systems be measured and monitored
    in a reliable and transparent fashion to mitigate the surge in unused digital
    content - so called digital waste. The expert inputs from Professor Gupta, Professor
    Bunker and from Mr Fenby-Taylor elaborate on these crucial aspects where they
    posit the benefits of improved data innovation practice, transitional approaches
    to complex information governance and effective information management to engender
    a culture shift in the use of data in all its forms, more collaboratively, thereby
    delivering impactful change. The expert input by Ms Shah highlights the critical
    role of data science processes to inform decision makers, monitoring of potential
    environmental hazards and accurate modeling of global warming scenarios. In the
    contribution from Dr He, he discussed the role of data analysis and climate change,
    where the role of sensor-based technologies was highlighted in the collection
    of huge amounts of environmental data to measure emissions and develop insights
    to conserve and improve energy use. A number of the submitted expert inputs discussed
    topics associated with IS and digital technology research, commenting on the current
    position and potential agendas for the future. The expert input from Professor
    Pekkola criticised the narrow approach taken by organizations and public bodies
    where environmental issues and ICT are approached from disparate perspectives
    in the context of economic growth and prosperity. The article from Professor Dubey
    posits the need for theory-driven research utilizing AI based approaches to provide
    a better understanding of the causes of climate change and potential solutions.
    The impact of blockchain technology and the environment was discussed in the submission
    from Dr Andreini, where the article asserts the need for a research agenda better
    aligned to understanding how the traditional and cryptocurrencies can coexist
    more effectively. The article from Professor Olaisen critiqued the current IS
    literature, finding that a very small percentage of studies actually investigated
    climate issues, asserting the need for researchers to start to ask the necessary
    research questions, on key aspects of the environmental and sustainability issues.
    5.3. Recommendations for research The expert contributions detail a number of
    research recommendations on many aspects of technology and digital products. One
    of the key emerging themes from the contributions is the call to explicitly include
    the environment as a key stakeholder. This is referenced in the expert inputs
    by Professors Davison and Sarker and implicitly supported in many other contributions,
    where a more honest and informed perspective is required, advocating a research
    agenda that focuses on impacts as well as benefits from a responsible IS perspective.
    Many of the contributions highlight the need for further research on the role
    of IS in improving systems and processes in the transportation, agriculture and
    manufacturing industries to improve energy efficiency, reduce waste and deliver
    accurate data to make better, more informed decisions. A number of contributions
    detail the critical role of IS and digital technologies in the provision of key
    data that can inform decision makers on the progress of global warming initiatives.
    Some of the topics discussed within the expert input by Professor Raman articulate
    many of the perspectives on this topic, highlighting the need for more research
    to improve the collection and dissemination of data on climate risk and use of
    sensor based IoT technologies within developing countries to alert authorities
    on emission levels. The expert input from Professor Rana supports a greater level
    of research focus on the socio-psychological behavioral factors surrounding the
    adoption of digital technologies, that can help inform researchers on how people
    adapt to new interactions and systems that reduce emissions. The theme of multidisciplinary
    perspectives on IS and sustainability for research agenda, is discussed by a number
    of experts including the need for greater focus on global IT collaboration. Viewing
    these perspectives from a transdisciplinary lens is advocated in the contribution
    from Professor Michael and Dr Abbas, where they posit the benefits of creating
    models and simulations within an overall sustainability framework that can encapsulate
    multi-level perspectives on the provision of data and technology interaction.
    A number of articles have referenced the role of smart technologies, smart cities
    and smart mobility, within the overall transition to a more sustainable digital
    infrastructure where people can interact with IS more effectively throughout their
    daily lives. However, as highlighted by Professor Scholtz, the focus on aligning
    smart initiatives to the UN SDGs seems to be an underdeveloped research area that
    could inform further research on key topics of sustainable water management, sanitation
    and access to sustainable energy sources. This sentiment is further explored in
    a number of articles, but particularly the call for greater multidisciplinary
    perspectives on CDR as highlighted by Professor Wade, asserting the need for a
    better understanding of the dynamics of CDR from theoretical and empirical perspectives.
    The problem of e-waste is discussed within a number of articles and further research
    in this area is explicitly called for. The article from Professor Gupta discusses
    a number of these key points that are detailed within many expert inputs, calling
    for greater research on improved strategies for dealing with this problem that
    negates the need for shifting the problem to emerging economies. The pivotal role
    of data and data science has been referenced in many submissions but particularly
    in the from Ms Shah where the article discusses the criticality of accurate data
    and empirical studies to inform key decision makers. Further research and insight
    is needed, through evidence-based initiatives to ensure the effects of global
    warming are effectively communicated to governments and organizations to ensure
    timely decisions are made and relevant resources are made available in the critical
    areas. 5.4. Recommendations for education The need for a greater educational awareness
    amongst IS researchers and users, seems to be a common thread within the submitted
    articles. A number of articles advocate a more holistic emphasis and informed
    debate on the environmental impact of technology, as well as its benefits in helping
    to mitigate further global warming and attainment of net zero by 2050. Many of
    the experts advocate a more balanced perspective within the IS and technology
    curriculum, to ensure students better understand the impact of behaviors. A number
    of articles also posit the need for better education on technologies that directly
    mitigate climate change, highlighting that this core topic seems to lack focus
    within many institutions. Technology has a critical role to play in the changing
    of human attitudes and behaviors toward sustainability. IS can educate and inform
    people about the carbon footprint to explore new innovative ways to perform everyday
    activities but in a more sustainable way. The article by Professors Constantiou
    and Vendelø illustrates how digital platforms can engender collaborative consumption
    and social entrepreneurship, educating people to redistribute unwanted products
    and reduce waste as well as influence consumers via sustainable cooking and plant
    based food. A number of experts have detailed the role of IS in the context of
    educating people through online communities. The contribution from Professor Panteli
    emphasizes this aspect, positing the role of young people and their digital activism
    in influencing a change in behaviors, whilst Dr Nishant and Professor Teo discuss
    the need for IS educators to increase awareness on green IS and the sustainability
    aspects of technology. It is clear from the submitted articles that education
    is a key component of the transition to net zero and ensuring that all stakeholders
    (industry and individuals) have the necessary knowledge to engender changes in
    behavior, is a key component of the transition. 5.5. Recommendations for practice
    and policy The UN COP26 conference gained commitment for a number of key initiatives
    that could have a significant impact on global warming. The key commitments included:
    at least 100 countries (including Brazil) agreeing to end deforestation by 2030;
    Led by the US and EU - 80 countries pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by
    2030; Although commitment could not be gained from China, the US, India and Australia
    - 23 nations made new commitments to phase out coal power, including five of the
    top 20 users: Indonesia, South Korea, Poland, Vietnam, Chile and Ukraine; India
    committed to attaining net zero by 2070 (COP26, 2021). Governments have a critical
    role in combating global warming from the legislative and policy perspective,
    but to ensure the targets set for 2050 have a realistic chance of being achieved,
    we need change at a societal level. The IS and technology industry has a critical
    role to play in the monitoring of progress toward net zero, but also a pivotal
    role in the development of innovative solutions to better manage emissions and
    offer people alternatives to current carbon based practices. Many of the contributions
    have highlighted the crucial role of organizations adopting a green philosophy
    and demonstrating a firm commitment to CSR and CDR policies and working practices.
    A number of the experts have discussed the realities of technology contributing
    to the global warming problem due to the high levels of waste and inability for
    manufacturers to adopt a greater sustainability focus on manufacturing materials,
    processes and poor emphasis toward product repair, not replace - so called e-waste.
    The expert input by Professor Metri cites the 2019 UN and WEF reports that 50
    million tonnes of e-waste was produced in that year, with only 20% being dealt
    with sustainably and the rest ending up as landfill. Many articles discuss these
    aspects, highlighting that the IS industry has much to do in this area. Organizations
    have their part to play to align with the goals and commitments from COP26, but
    successful outcomes rely on support from government and institutions to create
    the necessary environment and policy infrastructure, thereby enabling the technology
    industry to make the right long term decisions for the environment and society.
    6. Conclusions The UN climate change conference – COP26 held in Glasgow UK, is
    seen as one of the last chances for governments and key decision makers to make
    the firm commitments needed to ensure global temperatures do not exceed 1.5 °C
    above pre-industrial levels by 2050. The use of technology and IS is an integral
    component of many of the proposed mitigation measures, as governments and societies
    around the world take the necessary steps in transitioning to net zero. This multi-contribution
    editorial study offers a technology focussed and IS perspective on the climate
    crisis where many of the multi-faceted complexities facing governments, organizations
    and decision makers are discussed. In alignment with the approach set out in previous
    studies (Dwivedi et al., 2020, Dwivedi et al., 2022, Dwivedi et al., 2021a, Dwivedi
    et al., 2021b, Dwivedi et al., 2015), each of the invited experts offers their
    own unique viewpoints to explore many of the key topics related to climate change,
    IS and digital technologies. The major technology and IS focussed themes that
    have emerged from the invited experts include: the impact of technology on behaviors
    and attitudes; Education, awareness and changed working practices; Impact on people
    and communities; Responsible digitalization; Role of data, technology and IS governance;
    Technology and IS research agenda. We present this opinion paper as a timely perspective
    on this critical topic where we have discussed the multifaceted role of digital
    technology and IS in combating climate change. The expert contributions highlight
    the urgent need for education initiatives that offer a more holistic and balanced
    perspective on the opportunities for technology based solutions but also communicate
    the realities of the negative impact from e-waste and the shifting of the problem
    to poorer emerging nations. The developed countries throughout the world have
    a responsibility to develop solutions for problems of their own making and a greater
    focus on responsible digitalization has to be the right direction to engender
    sustained change. We advocate a greater awareness from individual consumers as
    well as manufacturers, on the “lived in” realities of environmental tradeoffs
    and key value choices (Rowe, 2018), as we continue to utilize technology as an
    integral component of our daily lives. Decision makers need to be cognisant of
    these key choices, as greater use is made of technology in all its forms to deliver
    net zero by 2050. References Abbas et al., 2021a R. Abbas, S. Hamdoun, J. Abu-Ghazaleh,

    Abstract

    This research introduces a Smart Watering System powered by Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) for

    precision agriculture. The system utilizes real-time monitoring and irrigation
    management to provide

    crops with the right amount of water based on their individual needs. The method
    aims to enhance

    agricultural yields, reduce labor costs, and improve water e¨ciency. By deploying
    a network of affordable

    wireless sensors in the ¦elds, soil moisture levels are continuously tracked,
    and the data is sent wirelessly

    to a central controller. Using advanced wireless protocols, the system analyzes
    the data and determines

    the optimal watering requirements for each crop. The technology is scalable and
    easy to install in larger

    agricultural ¦elds. Research ¦ndings indicate that the system can increase crop
    yields by up to 30% and

    improve water usage e¨ciency by up to 60%. Adopting this smart irrigation monitoring
    service powered

    by WSN allows farmers to conserve water, save time and money, and improve overall
    pro¦tability in

    sustainable agriculture.

    1. Introduction

    An important part of agriculture is irrigation, which makes sure that crops have
    enough water to grow.

    Traditional irrigation techniques, however, can be ineffective, resulting in water
    waste and higher

    expenses for farmers. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), there
    is a chance to put in

    place smart irrigation systems that may maximise water consumption while preserving
    agricultural

    productivity (Amarendra Goap et al., 2018, Karamiet al., 2021, Neha et al., 2019).

    The wireless sensor networks (WSN) used in this paper''s smart irrigation monitoring
    service provide for

    real-time data collection and analysis on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
    The gateway node

    transmits the data gathered by the sensors to a server for processing (Andres
    et al., 2020). The server

    then processes the data using algorithms to provide farmers useful information
    about the water

    requirements of their crops.

    The WSN-based monitoring system is composed of a number of ¦eld-deployed sensor
    nodes, a gateway

    node that gathers data from the sensor nodes and sends it to a server, and a web-based
    user interface for

    farmers to access the data (Fadi Al-Turjman, 2019, J. Gao et al., 2018). (Emmanuel
    et al., 2020; H. Ben

    Hammouda et al., 2015) The sensor nodes continually gather data on soil moisture,
    temperature, and

    humidity and communicate it to the gateway node. The data is subsequently sent
    from the gateway node

    to a server for archival and analysis. The server processes the data using data
    analytics techniques to

    produce useful information about the water needs of crops. Figure 1 depicts the
    data-§ow diagram and

    domain architecture reference-model for the monitoring service.

    The algorithms that calculate the best time and volume of water application are
    the foundation of the

    system''s functionality. Based on the crop type and development stage, these algorithms
    analyse the

    gathered data to determine the quantity of water that crops need and recommend
    applying. This strategy

    guarantees that water is only applied when required, minimising waste and increasing
    crop output. The

    Page 3/18

    suggested method gives farmers precise and timely information on when and how
    much water to apply,

    with the goal of increasing irrigation e¨ciency. The system may gather data from
    several places in the

    ¦eld utilising WSN (A. Z. Abbasi et al., 2014; H. Al-Sakran et al., 2013), which
    enables a more accurate

    depiction of soil moisture levels. The device can also spot patterns or abnormalities
    in the data, warning

    farmers of possible problems like overwatering or underwatering.

    The suggested approach has a number of advantages over conventional watering methods.
    First off, it

    lessens water waste by giving farmers up-to-date knowledge on their crops'' water
    requirements. It also

    helps farmers to use water more e¨ciently, which boosts agricultural yields and
    lowers water expenses.

    Thirdly, it encourages environmental sustainability by minimising irrigation''s
    negative environmental

    effects and lowering water waste. A ¦eld experiment of the system is run at a
    corn farm to assess its

    e¨cacy. The research resulted in a 40% decrease in water use while preserving
    crop output, highlighting

    the system''s potential to increase agricultural sustainability.

    The rest of this essay is structured as follows. A brief summary of the related
    work on intelligent irrigation

    systems is given in Section 2. The system architecture and components are thoroughly
    explained in

    Section 3. The experimental setup and ¦ndings are presented in Section 4. The
    study is concluded in

    Section 5 which also explores the possibility of further research.

    2. Literature Review

    The analysis demonstrates how water shortage is a signi¦cant problem for agriculture
    and how smart

    irrigation systems are a good way to maximise water use. For the purpose of maximising
    irrigation,

    several research have suggested the use of wireless sensor networks to gather
    information on soil

    moisture, temperature, and humidity. These studies show how wireless sensor networks
    may be used to

    monitor and manage irrigation systems in real time.

    The review also covers the many parts of a smart irrigation system, such as sensor
    nodes, wireless

    sensor networks, communication protocols, and algorithms. The ideal amount and
    time of water delivery

    are suggested by these algorithms based on information on soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. The

    review emphasises how crucial it is to choose the right algorithms and models
    based on the kind of crop,

    soil, and environment. Also evaluated the literature already in existence on WSN-based
    smart irrigation

    systems, emphasising their success in streamlining water use and enhancing agricultural
    production.

    The Agro-IoT system is one existent system that makes use of wireless sensor networks
    and Internet of

    Things (IoT) technology. This system is made up of multiple sensor nodes that
    track temperature,

    humidity, and soil moisture among other things. The central server, where it is
    processed and examined,

    receives the data that the sensor nodes have collected. The system also has a
    smartphone application

    that gives farmers access to real-time information on crop conditions and empowers
    them to plan

    irrigation effectively. Similarly, the WaterSense system is an established technology
    that utilizes wireless

    sensor networks and IoT capabilities. This system measures soil moisture levels
    and provides real-time

    information on crop water needs using a network of soil moisture sensors. Farmers
    may view the data

    Page 4/18

    and use the system''s mobile application to decide how much irrigation to use,
    optimizing water usage

    and enhancing crop yield in the process. The integration of IoT with wireless
    sensor networks holds great

    promise in revolutionizing precision agriculture and empowering farmers with actionable
    insights for

    sustainable and e¨cient farming practices (Jazaeri et al. (2016).

    The LoRaWAN-based WSN model is an other existing model. This approach enables
    communication

    between sensor nodes and a gateway node by using the LoRaWAN protocol, a low-power
    long-range

    wireless communication protocol. The gateway node gathers and sends data to a
    centralised server for

    processing, while the sensor nodes are deployed in the ¦eld to detect soil moisture,
    temperature, and

    humidity. After processing the data, the central server uses a user interface
    to give farmers real-time

    information on crop water needs.

    The use of WSNs for intelligent irrigation systems has been the subject of several
    research. For precision

    agriculture, Akyildiz et al. (2002) developed a system based on WSNs. The system
    used sensor nodes to

    detect a variety of variables, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture,
    and it sent the data to a

    processing hub for storage and analysis. When compared to conventional irrigation
    techniques, the

    scientists found that crop output and water utilisation had signi¦cantly improved.
    WSN-based smart

    irrigation systems have been successfully implemented, according to several research.
    For instance, a

    WSN-based irrigation system created by Lia Gao et al. (2013) increased agricultural
    productivity by 20%

    while using 45% less water. In a similar vein, Shuangde Zhang (2014) claimed that
    a WSN-based

    irrigation system resulted in a 50% decrease in water use and a 10% improvement
    in crop output.

    Similar to this, Joaquin Gutierrez et al. (2014) suggested an intelligent watering
    system for vineyards

    employing WSNs. The system was made up of several sensor nodes placed all around
    the vineyard that

    detected different things including soil moisture and leaf temperature. The technology
    provided the ideal

    timing and volume of water application depending on the data after wirelessly
    transmitting the gathered

    data to a central point for analysis. When compared to conventional irrigation
    techniques, the scientists

    found that crop output and water utilisation had signi¦cantly improved.

    The evaluation also touches on how crucial user interfaces are to smart irrigation
    systems. Farmers may

    get real-time data on crop water requirements and make knowledgeable irrigation
    decisions thanks to

    user interfaces. The use of web-based interfaces for remote data access has been
    suggested in several

    studies, making it simpler for farmers to control irrigation systems from any
    location.

    The analysis comes to the conclusion that wireless sensor networks and smart irrigation
    systems have

    the potential to greatly enhance agricultural water use. The choice of relevant
    algorithms and models, as

    well as the creation of user interfaces that are user-friendly and available to
    farmers, are necessary for

    these systems to be successful. The solution that is being suggested in this study
    attempts to overcome

    these di¨culties and make a positive impact on the creation of successful smart
    irrigation systems.

    3. Proposed System

    Page 5/18

    A Smart Monitoring Service for Irrigation The current irrigation method of using
    WSN is new (K. H. Dhara

    and A. B. Makwana, 2015; Loubna Hamami et al., 2020), however the farmers have
    not yet fully

    embraced it. It is mostly used by researchers to carry out experimental experiments.
    A novel idea in

    agricultural applications, the wireless sensor network (WSN), inspired several
    academics to do study in

    this area. The current irrigation method of using WSN is relatively new but holds
    immense potential to

    revolutionize agriculture through its real-time monitoring and precision water
    management capabilities.

    Wired sensor systems may now handle particular challenges thanks to recent advancements
    in wireless

    sensor network (WSN) technology (Md Mohinur Rahaman et al., 2022; Mehdi Gheisari
    et al., 2022). Wired

    sensor systems may now handle speci¦c challenges thanks to recent advancements
    in wireless sensor

    network (WSN) technology (A. Z. Abbasi et al., 2014).

    3.1 Soil Evaporation Model

    Prediction of soil moisture is essential for effective irrigation management.
    The Penmen approach was

    thought to produce the most precise ¦ndings with the least amount of inaccuracy
    in relation to the live

    grass reference crop. It was found that, depending on the location of the land,
    the pan approach would

    provide us with appropriate precision. The following equations illustrate the
    FAO Penman-Monteith

    technique for calculating ET0:

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), G = heat §ux density of soil
    [MJ m−2·day−1], μ2 = 

    wind speed at height of 2 m [ms−1], T = daily mean air temperature at 3 m height
    [°C], Rn = crop surface

    net radiation [MJ M−2 day −1], ea = actual vapor pressure [kPa], es = saturated
    vapor pressure [kPa], es-ea 

    = de¦cit saturation vapors pressure [kPa], P = atmospheric pressure [kPa], Δ = curve
    of slope vapor

    pressure [kPa °C−1], γ = psychrometric constant [kPa °C−1], z = elevation above
    sea level [m], e0 (T) = 

    saturation vapor pressure at the air temperature T [kPa], CP = speci¦c heat at
    constant pressure, 1.013 10–

    3 [MJ kg−10C−1], λ = latent heat of vaporization, 2.45[MJ kg−1], € = ration molecular
    weight of water

    vapor/day air = 0.622.

    Page 6/18

    The soil moisture estimation is mainly depending upon the evapotranspiration.
    The other most frequently

    used method based on extra-terrestrial radioactivity and temperature to evaluate
    ET0 (G. H. Hargreaves

    and Z. A. Samani, 1985)

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), Tmax and Tmin = max. temperature
    and min.

    temperature (°C), Ra = extra-terrestrial radiation (MJm−2 day−1).

    Ritchie purposed another method for the estimation of ET0 (C. Jones, 1990) based
    on solar radiation and

    temperature. It is expressed as

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum and
    minimum

    temperature (°C); and Rs = solar radiation (MJm−2 day−1).

    When

    A method for measuring evapotranspiration based on neurofuzzy (NF) inference was
    developed because

    it shows greater accuracy than combinations of air temperature, wind speed, and
    solar radiation (M.

    Cobaner, 2011). The NF model is dependent on relative humidity, solar radioactivity,
    and air temperature.

    The weather forecast sensors installed at the farm have anticipated the wetness
    of the soil. According to

    L. Ruiz-Garcia (2009), soil temperature, radiation, air temperature, and relative
    humidity all affect how

    much moisture evaporates from the soil. In order to e¨ciently irrigate farmland,
    a sensor-based and IoT

    constructed architecture (Figure 4) has been developed for gathering, processing,
    and transmitting the

    various physical parameters (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture,
    soil temperature, and

    radiation).

    3.2 WSN Architecture

    The mobile ad hoc network of WSNs, access points, routers, gateways, and multi-point
    relays shown in

    Figure 2 form a sophisticated architecture for seamless communication and connectivity
    among WSN

    nodes, coordinators, relays, gateways, and routers. As highlighted by Mir A et
    al. (2002), Rathore M et al.

    (2018), and P. Singh et al. (2013), access points serve as ¦xed-point transceivers,
    granting local nodes or

    those within wireless range easy accessibility. Meanwhile, multipoint relays play
    a vital role in

    Page 7/18

    establishing connections to various networks, including the Internet and mobile
    service provider networks.

    When it comes to packet transmission, routers skillfully navigate through available
    open paths in the

    network, e¨ciently choosing the optimal route. Lastly, the crucial task of linking
    the two networks falls to

    the coordinator, ensuring seamless communication between them. This intricate
    architecture forms the

    backbone of the smart monitoring service for irrigation, allowing real-time data
    collection and analysis for

    precise water management in agricultural ¦elds (Jazaeri et al. (2021).

    The WSN nodes have the ability to forward data to the access point (base station)
    as well as sense data.

    The nodes may move around and can communicate with distant access points while
    having coverage

    and mobility range. Access points have the ability to acquire and process data
    and are connected to a

    wider network, such as the Internet (Kenny Paul et al., 2022; S. M. Kamruzzaman
    et al., 2019). Layered

    construction is seen in Figure 3. Each node has a connection to a close neighbour.
    When the node travels

    farther, it connects with the access point (base station) through 2 or 3 hops.
    Low-power transceivers

    connect each node to the closest neighbouring layer WSNs. 

    Assume that there are three levels of WSNs around the base station. WSNs at Layer
    1 link directly. Before

    connecting directly, layer 2 WSNs make connections to layer 1 WSNs acting as coordinators.
    Prior to

    connecting to layer 1 WSNs and the access point, layer 3 WSNs establish connections
    to layer 2 WSNs

    serving as coordinators. The layer 1 WSN1 and WSN6 connections to the access point
    are depicted in the

    image. It denotes a hop count of 1. WSN 2 and WSN 3 are likewise depicted in the
    picture at layer 2. The

    ¦rst hop is to WSN1, while the second hop is through WSN1. For layer 2, the hop
    count is 2. In other

    words, WSN 2 is connected to WSN 1, which is connected to the access point (base
    station). 

    WSN 4 and WSN 5 are likewise depicted in the picture at layer 3. Three hops are
    required for their

    connection—one to layer 2 WSN, one to layer 1 WSN, and one to the access point.
    For layer 3, the hop

    count is 3. As a result, WSN 5 connects to WSN2, WSN1, and ¦nally the access point.
    The access point is

    connected via WSN4 before WSN3, WSN1, and WSN3. Wireless LAN (802.11b) access
    points are used to

    link the clusters. Connectivity to the Internet is made possible via the access
    points. Users with mobile

    devices and distant clients can access the archived and real-time queryable sensor
    data. The WSNs are

    shown in Figures 2 and 3. Every access point and gateway are connected. Each gateway
    uses LPWAN to

    interact with the cloud.

    3.3 Proposed System Architecture

    The fundamental design of a wireless sensor network-based irrigation monitoring
    system is depicted in

    Figure 4. The sensor nodes, gateway node, cloud, and Internet are the system''s
    four key parts.

    Sensors: The tools that gather environmental data are known as sensors. Temperature,
    humidity, soil

    moisture, and light intensity sensors are all present in this situation. The gateway
    devices receive the

    wirelessly sent sensor data and pass it along to the cloud computing platform
    for processing and

    analysis. This information may then be used by the cloud computing platform to
    decide when and how

    Page 8/18

    much to irrigate the crops. The platform may also transmit instructions back to
    the gateway components

    to regulate the irrigation system.

    Gateway: A device known as a gateway is used to gather data from sensors and transmit
    it to a server. A

    Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) module, a WiFi module, a microcontroller unit (MCU),
    and RAM are all

    included with the gateway.

    Server: The server is the key element of the system that stores and processes
    the sensor data. It receives

    the data from the gateway and, after analysing it, issues orders to the actuators.

    Devices that carry out activities in response to orders sent from the server are
    known as actuators. The

    actuators in this instance consist of a water pump, a solenoid valve, and a fertiliser
    dispenser. The MCU

    in the gateway, which gets commands from the server through the WSN module, manages
    these devices.

    A WSN has an ID and monitors moisture among other things. Every node is a WSN.
    Each WSN takes

    measurements at certain depths inside the soil at designated locations within
    a crop. Three similarly

    spaced depths of sensors are employed. A network is created when a collection
    of WSNs use ZigBee to

    communicate. Each network has an access point that uses LPWAN to receive messages
    from each node. 

    Data is continually gathered by the sensors and sent to the gateway. Data from
    the sensors is gathered

    by the gateway and sent to the server via the WiFi module. To ascertain the plants''
    watering needs, the

    server receives the data and processes it. The server issues orders to the actuators
    based on the analysis

    to carry out the required tasks, such as turning on the water pump or opening
    the solenoid valve. Through

    the WSN module, the server sends commands to the MCU in the gateway, which then
    uses those

    commands to operate the actuators.

    The smart irrigation monitoring system we suggest carries out the following duties:

    Smart irrigation uses moisture sensors and actuators to water channels.

    Installs each soil moisture sensor at a certain depth in the ¦elds using a sensor
    circuitry board.

    Makes use of a variety of actuators (solenoid valves) that are positioned along
    water lines and that

    regulate moisture levels that are too high during a certain crop time.

    Monitors evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration) and moisture in fruit
    plants such as

    grapes and mangoes using sensors positioned at three depths.

    Calculates and tracks real water requirements for irrigation and absorption

    Each sensor board is enclosed in a waterproof shell and uses the ZigBee protocol
    to connect to an

    access point. A WSN is made up of a number of sensor circuits.

    The data is received by the access point, which then sends it to a related gateway.
    Data is

    transformed at the gateway before being sent through LPWAN to a cloud platform.

    The platform''s analytics examine the moisture data and interact with the water
    irrigation channels''

    actuators in accordance with the amount of water needed and previous data.

    Page 9/18

    Sensors take measurements at predetermined intervals, and actuators respond to
    the intervals''

    needed values after analysis.

    The platform sets the preset measurement intervals of T1 (for example, 24 hours)
    and the preset

    actuation interval of t2 before uploading the programmes to the sensors and actuators
    circuits. 

    An algorithm downloads and updates the programmes for the gateways and nodes.
    Sensed

    moisture readings that surpass certain thresholds then send off the alert.

    Operates at the data-adaptation layer and, at regular intervals, identi¦es the
    malfunctioning or

    inaccessible moisture sensors.

    The monitoring system''s prototype was created using an open-source SDK and IDE.

    3.4 Experimental Setup 

    Typically, the experimental setup for the Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service
    utilising Wireless Sensor

    Networks (WSN) consists of a network of sensors that monitor soil moisture content,
    temperature, and

    humidity levels. The sensor nodes are wirelessly linked to a central node or gateway,
    which is in charge of

    gathering data from the nodes and transmitting it to a platform for cloud-based
    data storage. Figure 5

    displays photographs of the planned model prototype that was placed in several
    agricultural areas to

    gauge the soil''s temperature and moisture content.

    To operate the hardware, a software programme is created and run on the ESP8266
    microcontroller. The

    node was positioned close to the plant to feel its surroundings, and it is wirelessly
    connected to the main

    station through an ESP8266 microcontroller that serves as both an access point
    and a server. The

    ESP8266 module also communicates with the main station via serial communication.
    Each zone in the

    planted area has sensors for soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature, and
    solar light brightness. To

    obtain correct data, this division is carried out depending on the sensing range
    of the sensors. The

    ESP8266 module is used to wirelessly link all the parameters that correspond to
    the de¦ned zone before

    sending them to the sink node. After that, each sensor node''s data is assembled
    and delivered via serial

    connection from the sink node to the main station. The main station collects the
    data and uses an

    application to process it in order to decide on irrigation while simultaneously
    saving the information in a

    database. The decision command was transmitted through serial connection to an
    ESP8266 module,

    then converted and sent wirelessly to the actuator node. The actuator node then
    uses a relay module to

    operate the water pumps. Figure 5 depicts the deployment of sensors in various
    agricultural ¦elds,

    including farm ¦elds, house gardens, and plant-in-pot ¦elds.

    The sensor nodes are positioned across the agricultural area, and the data they
    collect is evaluated to

    establish the best watering schedules for the crops. The central node or gateway
    is often connected to

    the irrigation system, enabling remote monitoring and management of irrigation
    procedures. According to

    studies, using WSN technology for irrigation monitoring has increased irrigation
    e¨ciency by an average

    of 30%. Accordingly, farmers may now use up to 30% less water, which saves them
    a lot of money and

    has a less negative impact on the environment.

    Page 10/18

    4. Results And Discussion

    In addition, farmers can now manage irrigation practises from any location thanks
    to the system''s remote

    monitoring and control capabilities, which has increased production and e¨ciency.
    The Smart Irrigation

    Monitoring Service''s use of WSN has shown encouraging results. The method has
    made it possible to

    use targeted and accurate irrigation techniques, which has reduced water waste
    and enhanced

    agricultural yields. The ¦ndings from the experimental design are as follows:

    Soil Moisture Content: The percentage of soil moisture is measured by the soil
    moisture sensors. The

    results can range from 0% to 100%, where 100% represents fully saturated soil
    and 0% represents

    severely dry soil. For most crops, a soil''s ideal moisture content ranges from
    50% to 70%.

    Temperature: The sensors monitor the ambient temperature in either Celsius or
    Fahrenheit.

    Depending on the sensor''s specs, the numbers received can range from -40°C to
    125°C or -40°F to

    257°F. Most crops do best at a temperature of 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F).

    Humidity: The humidity sensors calculate the environment''s % relative humidity.
    The results can vary

    from 0% to 100%, where 100% represents totally saturated air and 0% represents
    excessively dry air.

    For most crops, a humidity level between 40% and 70% is ideal.

    Irrigation Frequency: Based on the moisture content of the soil and other environmental
    parameters,

    the experimental values also take irrigation frequency into account. Depending
    on the needs of the

    crop, the frequency might range from many times per day to once per week.

    Water Consumption: The Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service utilising WSN also
    measures the

    quantity of water utilised for irrigation, which can assist farmers in streamlining
    their water

    consumption and lowering expenses. Depending on the needs of the crop and the
    surrounding

    environment, the experimental numbers can range from a few litres to several thousand
    litres per

    day.

    The outcomes of employing the WSN-based Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service have
    been quite positive.

    Farmers have been able to optimise irrigation practises thanks to the technology,
    which has led to

    considerable water savings and higher crop yields.

    5. Conclusion and Future Scope

    Smart irrigation monitoring services using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have
    revolutionized

    precision agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring of crucial environmental
    variables such as

    humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. This technology has proven highly successful
    in optimizing

    irrigation schedules and conserving water resources, resulting in a remarkable
    30% improvement in

    irrigation practices. By embracing smart irrigation with WSNs, farmers have experienced
    increased crop

    yields, reduced water waste, and a smaller environmental impact. The future holds
    immense potential for

    even greater advancements, including enhanced data analysis through technologies
    like Arti¦cial

    Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, as well as integration with other smart
    agricultural technologies

    Page 11/18

    like drones and precision farming. To further enhance the effectiveness of smart
    irrigation monitoring,

    future work could focus on developing advanced AI algorithms that can predict
    crop water requirements

    more accurately and dynamically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time
    weather and soil

    conditions. Additionally, exploring the use of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms
    to create a seamless and

    interconnected network of smart agricultural devices and systems would open up
    new possibilities for

    data exchange and decision-making. Collaborative efforts between researchers,
    industry experts, and

    farmers are essential in driving these innovations forward, ultimately shaping
    a sustainable and e¨cient

    farming landscape for the future.

    irrigation system with multiple wireless sensing nodes to collect real-time data
    on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The authors propose a smart

    \ is the major source for the existence of the mankind. In order to meet the food\
    \ \nrequirements for the ever increasing population, the quantity of the food\

    \ is one such major sector which \nprovides the food for mankind. It not only\
    \ provides food but also supplies raw materials \nfor industries. Implementation\
    \ of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things in \nagriculture helps in\

    \ and rainfall. The data from the various sensors is aggregated \nat each node\
    \ and transmitted to the coordinator station using long range transceiver. The\
    \ \ndata received at the coordinator station is subjected to a rule based decision\

    With the ever increasing population, the competition for the \nresources is increasing,\
    \ food is one among them. The entire \nworld is indirectly dependent on the agricultural\
    \ outcome. \nSustainability in agriculture is process of employing suitable \n\
    ways in the field which helps in meeting the ever increasing \ndemand. At the\
    \ same time modernization in agriculture is also \nessential. This modernization\
    \ from the traditional practices, \nstarted with the utilization of tractor in\
    \ the agriculture and this \npaved the way for industrial agriculture [1]. To\
    \ meet the \nchallenges, an automation in agriculture with data driven \nmanagement\
    \ is essential. This can be achieved with the \nInternet of Things. Agricultural\
    \ Internet of things refers to \nmanaging the remote sensors, actuators, autonomous\
    \ vehicles \nthat are deployed in field with the help of internet there by \n\
    intergrating automation and decision support in one system. \nEnergy management\
    \ in agriculture is one of the major issue. \nAgriculture has also its role in\
    \ the emission of green house \ngases. Hence there is a need to schedule or control\
    \ the usage \nof energy resources in agriculture [2]. Climatic changes, \nplantation\
    \ density, soil pollution due to pesticides [3, 4], air \npollution due to road\
    \ transport vehicles are also impacting the \nyield in the agriculture. The crops\
    \ which are closer to roads \nhave greater impact when compared to the faraway\
    \ fields [5]. \nThere are five major types of risks in the agriculture [6]. 1)\
    \ \nproduction- is affected due to change in environmental \nparameters, pests,\
    \ soil minerals, diseases etc. 2) Market risks - \nuncertainty in the prices due\
    \ to the demand and yield. 3) \nInstitutional risks – occurs due to unpredictable\
    \ agriculture \nrelated policy changes in government. 4) Personal risk – it is\
    \ \nrelated to the individual. Factors such as health, family issues, \nincome\
    \ may influence the individual. 5) Financial risk – this \nrefers to financial\
    \ in flow towards the crop maintenance. It also \nincludes availability of loans\
    \ and the rate of interest.  All these \nare some of the parameters that influence\
    \ the agriculture \nproduction. In rural areas due to lack of storage and \ninfrastructural\
    \ facilities, farmers are selling their crop at the \npoint of origin to the middle\
    \ men. They are in turn unaware for \nexisting market prices, therefore middle\
    \ men are fetching huge \nprofits [7]. \nImparting the digital innovations in\
    \ agriculture can \nmaximize the yield and also paves the way for sustainable\
    \ \nagriculture. This can be done by employing the wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ for gathering the field level parameters [8]. Coverage \nand proper connectivity\
    \ of the nodes to the base station is also \nessential [9]. This real time monitoring\
    \ using wireless sensor \nnetworks, generates huge amount of data. Based on the\
    \ useful \nextracted data, the farmers can take timely efficient decisions \n\
    and also controls the irrigation process automatically [10]. The \nvarious sensors\
    \ that are employed in the system are prone to \nvarious attacks, because they\
    \ are deployed in harsh \nenvironment [11]. Various communication technologies\
    \ such \nas RFID, Wi-Fi, LoRa, LTE, IPv6 Low-power Wireless \nPersonal Area Network,\
    \ Blue tooth, Zigbee etc., can be used \nfor data transmission in agriculture\
    \ [12]. Updating the data to \ncloud in turn helps in adding the intelligence\
    \ to data to \nfacilitate for further predictive analysis [13, 14]. \nInstrumentation\
    \ Mesure Métrologie \nVol. 20, No. 1, February, 2021, pp. 39-47 \nJournal homepage:\
    \ http://iieta.org/journals/i2m \n39\n \nUsage of zigbee and Blue tooth for data\
    \ transmission limits \nthe distance between the wireless sensor nodes and central\
    \ \nstation. For data transmission over longer distances multi hop \ncommunication\
    \ can be used, but the disadvantage is the \nincreased \nforwarding \ntime \n\
    and \nadditional \nhardware \nrequirement for multiple hops. In this system HC12\
    \ \ntransceiver is used to overcome this problem, and helps in data \ntransmission\
    \ over longer range. \n \n \n2. RELATED WORK \n \nResearchers had developed many\
    \ models relating to smart \nmonitoring of agricultural parameters to improve\
    \ the \nproductivity and sustainability. Ayyasamy et al. [15], \nproposed an excess\
    \ water removal system. The excess water \nin agricultural land occurs due to\
    \ various reasons such as rain, \nimproper irrigation scheduling, floods etc.\
    \ Removing the \nexcess water from the agricultural land prevents the rotten of\
    \ \nthe plant root.  Maintaining the soil pH helps in preserving \nvarious micronutrients\
    \ such as zinc, manganese, iron, etc., \nsalinity sensor based on BC548 transistor,\
    \ can be used to \nindicate the presence of salt water. Employing solar energy\
    \ in \nthe agriculture helps in the effective utilization of the resources \n\
    [16]. Shi et al. [17], defined a Plant water deficit index (PWDI), \nwhich gives\
    \ the information about the capability of the plant \nroots in absorbing the water\
    \ content from soil. This parameter \nwas analyzed by measuring the root profile.\
    \ \nNagaraja1 et al. [18] proposed a smart system for \nmonitoring using raspberry\
    \ pi, the various parameters that are \nmonitored on the farm land are stored\
    \ in fire base. This data is \ninturn used for the crop prediction by processing\
    \ through \nmachine learning algorithms. Kadar et al. [19] developed an \nAGRI2L\
    \ system. In this the water leakage from the PVC pipes \nare detected by analyzing\
    \ the data from flow rate sensor and \nwater level sensor. The status was intimated\
    \ to farmer using \nmobile app. Doshi et al. [20] proposed an automated farm \n\
    monitoring process by using various sensors and calculated \npower consumption\
    \ per hour in sleep mode, active mode. \nswitching to sleep mode helps in extending\
    \ the life of power \nbank. \nKumbhar et al. [21] proposed an agriculture 3-phase\
    \ \ninduction motor protection system by using R, Y, B voltage \nsensors and vibration\
    \ sensors. This system gives an alert \nmessage using GSM during voltage variations.\
    \ Bulusu et al. \n[22], proposed a detection mechanism for phase imbalance \n\
    fault condition and phase loss condition for the agricultural \nmotor by developing\
    \ a voltage and current measurement unit. \nThe motor is made to trip under the\
    \ imbalance condition with \nthe help of arduino and opto-coupler with relay.\
    \ Ulaganathan \net al. [23] proposed a motor protection system by identifying\
    \ \nthe current overload and phase absence condition. It also \nintimates the\
    \ farmer using GSM module. Balakrishna et al. \n[24] developed a motor status\
    \ tracking and inturn controlling \nsystem raspberry pi module to identify the\
    \ conditions like \nmotor malfunction, no power and no ground water. Android \n\
    application was developed to update these conditions to \nfarmer. Suleman et al.\
    \ [25] developed a multi node monitoring \nsystem consisting of sensors are equipped\
    \ with arduino uno, to \ncollect the micro nutrients such as nitrogen, and potassium\
    \ and \nsoil moisture content from the soil. This data is sent to the \nmaster\
    \ station using xbee module to control the irrigation. \nPrakash Jadhav et al.\
    \ [26] used mesh topology for connecting \nthe multiple nodes and coordinator\
    \ for intelligent monitoring \nin agriculture. \nMost of the work is based on\
    \ the analysis of the agricultural \nparameters at a single node and updating\
    \ the data to user with \nthe help of Internet of things. In case if the node\
    \ fails the entire \nsystem becomes idle. By considering the multiple nodes an\
    \ \nenhancement in the decision making approach can be realized. \nUnder some\
    \ situations, the flow sensor may give false readings \nto identify motor dry\
    \ run because of the air drawn by the motor. \n \n \n3. PROPOSED SYSTEM FRAME\
    \ WORK \n \nThe implementation frame work is categorized into three \nparts 1)\
    \ Wireless monitoring sensor nodes, 2) coordinator \nstation and 3) data logger.\
    \ \n \n3.1 Wireless monitoring sensor nodes \n \nIn the case of large farms, the\
    \ data analysis using a single \nnode may not give the accurate results. Deploying\
    \ multiple \nnodes improves the precision in decision making process. The \nwireless\
    \ monitoring sensor nodes are deployed at various \nlocations in the field to\
    \ capture the agri - environment data. In \nthis proposed system, three nodes\
    \ are deployed at three distinct \nlocations in the field. To conveniently identify\
    \ the nodes, three \nsensing nodes are named as node1, node2 and node3. All these\
    \ \nare stationary nodes, their position in the field is fixed. All the \nnodes\
    \ are powered using the external 6000mAh power bank. \nEach node consists of a\
    \ sensing module, microcontroller and a \ntransmitter. The sensing module includes\
    \ multiple sensors \nsuch as DHT11 -temperature and humidity sensor, soil \nmoisture\
    \ \nsensor \nand \nrain \ndetector. \nArduino \nuno \nmicrocontroller is used\
    \ to gather the data from sensing \nmodules at regular intervals of time.  Further\
    \ this data is \ntransmitted to the coordinator station using HC 12 radio \nfrequency\
    \ (RF) transceiver. The same setup is used for all the \nthree nodes. \n \n3.1.1\
    \ Temperature and humidity sensor \nThe DHT 11 sensor measures the temperature\
    \ and relative \nhumidityin itssurroundings. The temperature is measured \nbased\
    \ on the negative temperature coefficient of the thermistor. \nAs the temperature\
    \ of the surroundings increases the resistance \ndecreases. The relative humidity\
    \ is measured using the \ncapacitive sensing element. Change in relative humidity\
    \ \nresults in the change in the capacitance values. The data frame \nsent by\
    \ the sensor consists of humidity followed by the \ntemperature.  \n \n3.1.2 Soil\
    \ moisture sensor \nThe FC-28 sensor consisting of two probes acts as a variable\
    \ \nresistor. When the sensor is inserted into the soil, it measures \nthe volumetric\
    \ water content present in the soil as a function \nof content of the water in\
    \ the soil. During the presence of \nmoisture in the soil, the resistance decreases\
    \ and the \nconductivity increases [27]. The module outputs the voltage in \n\
    accordance with the resistance. \n \n3.1.3 Rain sensor \nThe FC-37 rain sensor\
    \ is used to sense the presence of rain. \nThe module consists of a control board\
    \ and a rain or collector \nboard. The copper tracks are present on the collector\
    \ board. \nUnder no rain condition, because of dryness the on the board, \nresistance\
    \ is high and the control board produces an output \n40\n \nvalue 1023. During\
    \ the presence of rain, the output value \nreduces from 1023 to 0, in accordance\
    \ with the reduced value \nof the resistance. \n \n3.1.4 HC12RF Transceiver \n\
    It is a serial communication module with multiple channels \nand capable of transmitting\
    \ the data in wireless manner over a \nrange nearing to about 1Km in the open\
    \ environment. It \nconsists of 8 bit STM8S003F3 microcontroller and Si4463 \n\
    transceiver. It supports multiple baud rates with FU1, FU2 and \nFU3 transmission\
    \ modes with FU3 being the full speed mode. \nThe module comes with the default\
    \ setting of baud rate \n9600bps, FU3 mode, (8-bit data and one stop bit), CH001\
    \ \n(433.4MHz). The parameters can be varied with the help of \nAT commands. The\
    \ default settings itself were used in this \nsystem for data transmitting the\
    \ data from each of the nodes to \ncoordinator. \n \n3.2 Coordinator station \n\
    \ \nThe coordinator station consisting of arduino uno, collects \nthe data from\
    \ the nodes 1, 2, and 3 with the help of the HC12 \ntransceiver. The transceiver\
    \ is connected to the serial port of \narduino uno receives the data in wireless\
    \ manner. The \nirrigation motor supplies the water to the field and dewaterting\
    \ \nmotor removes the excess water, accumulated during heavy \nrains. The received\
    \ data is analyzed by the microcontroller and \nthe actuation of the irrigation\
    \ motor and dewatering motor \noccurs accordingly. Both the motors are connected\
    \ to the \ncoordinator station through relays. The current sensor is \nconnected\
    \ in series with the irrigation motor measures the \ncurrent flowing through the\
    \ motor. The ATmega328P \nmicrocontroller is also interfaced with LCD to display\
    \ the \nnode failure status and Buzzer to alert the farmer in the case of \nirrigation\
    \ motor dry run. \n3.3 Data logger \n \nThe ESP8266 acts as the data logger. It\
    \ receives the soil \nmoisture and rain sensor data of all the nodes 1,2 and 3,\
    \ the \ncurrent sensor data, status of the irrigation motor and \ndewatering motor\
    \ from the coordinator station in the \nscheduled intervals of time. The received\
    \ data is in turn \nuploaded to thing speak cloud. It is an open source cloud\
    \ \napplication to send and receive the data. The data is uploaded \nto cloud\
    \ using the hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) protocol \nover the Internet.\
    \ \n \n \n4. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION \n \nMulti node, multi sensor smart monitoring\
    \ system gathers \nthe agri-environment parameters from distinct locations. The\
    \ \nsensor connection diagram of one node is shown in the Figure \n1 below was\
    \ drawn using fritzing.  \nWireless monitoring node interconnection diagram remains\
    \ \nsame for all the sensing nodes 1, 2 and 3. Aurdino uno is the \nheart of each\
    \ of these sensing nodes. For each node, DHT11, \nsoil moisture sensor, rain detector\
    \ are connected to the arduino \nuno analog pins. The microcontroller reads the\
    \ data from these \nsensors at regular intervals of time. The data is transmitted\
    \ \nfrom the node to the central station using the HC12 RF \ntransceivers. Each\
    \ of the nodes transmits the sensor data along \nwith the node header with a baud\
    \ rate of 9600. Each node has \na unique header, the respective node number is\
    \ specified in the \nheader portion. Therefore the receiver can clearly distinguish\
    \ \nthe received data, by analyzing the header whether it is \nbelonging to node\
    \ 1, 2 or 3. The nodes and coordinator station \nconnectivity diagram is shown\
    \ in the Figure 2. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Interconnection diagram of a node \n\

    \ Images of different water levels accumulated in \npaddy field \n \nAll the nodes\
    \ and the coordinator station are connected \nwirelessly in the form of star topology.\
    \ The central station is \nalso equipped with HC 12 RF transceiver, which now\
    \ acts as \na receiver and collects the data from the three nodes. The \nindividual\
    \ agricultural parameters are extracted from received \ndata and are analysed\
    \ for actuating the motors. Under the \npresence of predominant rain, excess water\
    \ gets accumulated \ninto the field. In the following Figure 3 (a), (b) shows\
    \ such \nsituation of the paddy crop drowned in the water due to heavy \nrain.\
    \ Condition of the crop under mild rain is shown in the \nFigure 3(c). \nThese\
    \ images are captured in the paddy field after heavy \nrain in the region of Andhra\
    \ Pradesh, India, in the month of \nnovember 2020. \nIf the necessary action was\
    \ not taken to remove the excess \nwater out the crop area, the roots become weak\
    \ and it may even \nleads to the death of the plants due to the prolonged stay\
    \ in the \nwater. It results a huge loss to farmers. Therefore the \ndewatering\
    \ motor helps to remove the excess water out of the \nfields. Mild rain situation\
    \ is tolerable as the land takes less \ntime to dry when compared to heavy rain.\
    \ \nBy analyzing the soil moisture and rain sensor data, the \nirrigation motor\
    \ and dewatering motor actuation is controlled \nby the microcontroller at coordinator\
    \ station. The various \ncases and the action taken are shown in the Table 1 below.\
    \ \nThe mapping of the rain and soil sensor analog data to \ndigital data is given\
    \ by Eq. (1). \n \nDigital Value = Signal value\n5\n∗ 1023 \n(1) \n \nThe system\
    \ contains 10 bit analog to digital converter \n(ADC). The soil and rain threshold\
    \ values are set according to \nthe mapped reading. The functioning of the central\
    \ station \nunder various conditions is explained in the Figure 4. \n \nTable\
    \ 1. Action taken at coordinator station under various cases \n \nCases \nParameter\
    \ analyzed \nDecision \nAction taken \nCase \n1 \nAtleast one soil moisture sensor\
    \ indicates soil dry and no rain status \nfrom all three rain sensors \nNo Rain,\
    \ Soil- Dry \nMotor 1- \nIrrigation motor On, Motor 2 - \nDewatering motor off.\
    \ \nCase \n2 \nAll the soil sensors indicate soil wet and rain sensors indicate\
    \ the \npresence of predominant rain fall \nPredominant rain and soil Wet \nMotor\
    \ 1 - \nIrrigation motor Off, Motor 2- \nDewatering motor on. \nCase \n3 \nAll\
    \ the soil sensor indicate the soil is wet and presence of mild rain/ \nno rain\
    \ \nMild rain/ no rain and Soil wet \nMotor 1 - Irrigation motor off, \nMotor\
    \ 2 – Dewatering motor off. \n42\n \n \nFigure 4. Flow chart indicating the control\
    \ process carried out at coordinator station \n \nWhen soil and rain moisture\
    \ sensor data are greater than the \nsoil threshold and rain threshold, it indicates\
    \ that the soil is dry \nand no rain. Therefore the irrigation motor is switched\
    \ on. The \nirrigation motor draws the water from the water source and \nsupplies\
    \ to the field.  Under this condition if the water source \nis dry or the level\
    \ of the water is too low for the motor to \nextract, the motor fails to pump\
    \ the water and its runs \ncontinuously with no water. This condition was termed\
    \ as \nmotor dry run. In long run it may even damage the motor, \nfurther the\
    \ power consumed by the motor leads to wastage of \nresources. To avoid this condition,\
    \ a current sensor ACS712 \nwas connected in series with the irrigation motor.\
    \ When the \nmotor has the sufficient amount of water at its source point it \n\
    draws more current, to pump the water, when compared to no \nwater at the source\
    \ point. Based on this data from the current \nsensor, the microcontroller controls\
    \ the switching of irrigation \nmotor. When the current senor reading is below\
    \ the threshold \nvalue, immediately the irrigation motor is turned off and \n\
    buzzer is turned on to alert the farmer. Therefore the dry run \ncondition is\
    \ avoided, which not only protects the motor but \nalso saves power.  \nIn case\
    \ no data is received from any particular node for a \npredominant amount of time\
    \ due to power failure then that \nparticular node was treated as malfunctioned\
    \ and the status of \nthe same is indicated through the LCD present in the central\
    \ \nstation as shown in Figure 5, as node fail 1 or node fail 2 or \nnode fail\
    \ 3 depending the failed node. Therefore the farmer \ncan take necessary measures\
    \ to make the node operational. \n \n \nFigure 5. Node status on LCD \n \n \n\
    5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n \nIn this system, single phase, 0.5 Horsepower,\
    \ 200-240 volts \nmotor was used as an irrigation motor.By analyzing the \nreceived\
    \ data from the three nodes as mentioned in the \nflowchart, the coordinator station\
    \ actuates the irrigation motor \nor the dewatering motor. Before connecting the\
    \ irrigation \nmotor to central station, the m number of current readings \nunder\
    \ the presence of water was noted as wi, where i = \n1,2,3,…m. Similarly the p\
    \ number of recoded readings under \ndry run was noted as nwj, wherej = 1, 2,3,…p.\

    \ \n \nMulti sensor node based precision farming assists in \nsustainable crop\
    \ management with effective utilization of \nwater. Analyzing the data from the\
    \ multiple nodes helps in \nprecise decision making in scheduling the irrigation.\
    \ Major \nfocus of this research also lies in predicting the availability of \n\
    water at the motor inlet by measuring the current consumed by \nthe motor. Monitoring\
    \ the irrigation motor for the dry run \ncondition, not only protects the motor\
    \ but also saves the time \nand money for the farmer. The stagnant water, due\
    \ to heavy \nrains is pumped out of the crop using dewatering motor. This \nsaves\
    \ the crop from prolonged stay in excess water.  In the \nproposed system data\
    \ from the senor nodes to the central \nstation is transmitted using RF transceiver.\
    \ Therefore the \ninternet connectivity for the entire crop area is not necessary.\
    \ \nThe internet connectivity at the central station alone is \nessential to upload\
    \ the synchronized parameters from the \nnodes and status of the two motors to\
    \ the cloud. So that the \nfarmer can monitor the status of the crop from any\
    \ location in \nthe world. \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n \n[1] Charania, I., Li, X.R.\

  data_sources: Real-time soil moisture data collected from the sensor network
  explanation: The study aimed to develop, assess, and integrate a heterogeneous network
    of Internet of Things (IoT) soil moisture sensors to monitor soil moisture in
    real-time and provide an early warning to farmers to prevent overwatering. Using
    a co-innovation approach, researchers worked alongside water users to understand
    their needs and develop a low-cost, open-source sensor tailored to their farming
    practices. The sensor employs a capacitance probe to measure soil moisture and
    transmits the data wirelessly via a LoRaWAN network. To ensure the accuracy of
    the sensor, a single-parameter calibration method was developed based on the gravimetric
    method.
  extract_1: To this end, we built a network of wireless, low-cost, low-tech, low-power
    and open-source soil moisture sensors. The overall architecture of the network
    of sensors is shown in Fig. 1.

    in real conditions in three irrigated potato plots throughout the whole crop cycle.

    • We developed a low-cost, low-tech, low-energy, open-source iot-based soil moisture
    sensor. • Both in-field and in-lab single parameter calibration methods are possible.
    • The sensor is usable as a decision-support tool for real-time irrigation monitoring.
    • Do it yourself: all the steps from design to calibration are highly reproducible.
    • Open source data is available for download. Abstract Unsustainable use of water
    resources and climate change will exacerbate the existing tensions surrounding
    resources, especially in the Mediterranean context. Despite investments in costly
    modern equipment, the performance of irrigated agriculture remains below expectations,
    notably because of the lack of available water data and the limited use of decision
    support tools. Although a variety of soil moisture sensors are available on the
    market, they are not widely used by the agricultural community because of their
    high cost and complexity. Access to information at an unprecedented level, via
    easily accessible low-cost and low-tech sensors, may be a major lever for improved
    identification of achievable gains in performance, and to guide actors toward
    efficient water management. To explore this hypothesis, an open source wireless
    soil moisture sensor, low-energy and economically and technically accessible,
    was developed. The tool was designed according to water users’ requirements and
    applied to a Tunisian irrigation scheme subject to major water use efficiency
    issues. The functioning of the wireless sensor network was tested on pilot plots
    over a growing season and compared with commercial sensors. A single parameter
    calibration can be performed in either the laboratory or the field. This low-cost
    sensor can be used for real-time irrigation monitoring and as a decision-making
    tool for water management. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Irrigation is a fundamental aspect of crop production. Summer 2022, already considered
    to be one of the driest and warmest seasons ever recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean
    basin [1], has shown how crucial it can be [2], and what is more, the Mediterranean
    region is considered as a climate change hotspot. The Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change [3] foresees the intensification of extreme hydrological events,
    notably more frequent and longer episodes of water deficit. Agricultural activities,
    largely dependent on water availability, are particularly impacted and threatened.
    Irrigation is a response to agricultural vulnerability to drought. As a result,
    irrigated land has increased in recent decades, and the increase will most probably
    continue in the future. However, pressure on water resources is already critical
    in the Mediterranean region, due not only to the high spatio-temporal variability
    of its distribution but also to increased urban and rural demand. In particular,
    agricultural water demand tends to grow with increasing potential evapotranspiration.
    These tensions have already led to water use restriction policies, user conflicts
    and water shortages [4]. In this context, it is indispensable to improve agricultural
    water management and encourage water-saving practices. Precision agriculture has
    flourished in recent decades and a wide range of monitoring tools including model-based
    control strategies, automation systems, remote sensing or in field sensing [5,6]
    have been developed to improve the performance of irrigated systems. At farm level,
    irrigation management can be supported by using soil moisture probes to improve
    irrigation scheduling and reduce the volumes applied throughout the growing season
    [7,8]. Tensiometers and capacitance sensors that provide information on soil water
    status are already available [9] but are rarely used in farming systems, particularly
    at the farm scale, and even more rarely in the Global South. The different barriers
    to the adoption of precision farming technologies are linked to the user''s socio-technical
    environment, but mostly to (i) economic rationales or (ii) the complexity of using
    these technologies, including the calibration procedures [10,11]. Recent technological
    developments such as onboard electronics and Internet of Things (IoT) offer new
    opportunities to provide alternative monitoring tools for agro-systems and resource
    management [12] that are easier for farmers to use than previous systems. For
    irrigated agriculture in particular, these technologies allow real-time monitoring
    of water flows through water sensor networks (WSN) that can be installed at the
    required spatial and temporal scale. Several studies have demonstrated the technical
    feasibility of monitoring irrigation using these types of systems with different
    telecommunication networks and sensors to monitor weather, soil and plant variables
    [[13], [14], [15]]. Some studies mentioned gains in irrigation performance in
    different agronomic contexts thanks to the use of such tools [[16], [17], [18]].
    Recently, some advances were made in the characterisation and calibration of low
    cost capacitance sensors for IoT networks [19,20]. However, to our knowledge,
    no study has yet gone beyond laboratory prototypes or experiments in controlled
    conditions, and have adapted these innovations to local agrarian contexts. The
    objective of this study was thus to fill this gap by developing a soil moisture
    sensor that is easily adoptable by water users and to share all the steps, from
    design to calibration, operation and maintenance, based on a field reality. To
    this end, we designed an open source, low-tech and low-cost tool with a single
    parameter and physically-based calibration method, tested it in real farmers’
    conditions, and assessed the potential advantages and limits of this technology.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Shaping innovation: Our overall approach We argue
    that for technological innovations to be useful for end users, the innovations
    need to be co-developed with the stakeholders thus making it possible to adapt
    the technology to the local context. A co-innovation process between researchers
    and stakeholders was established to (i) chose the variable to monitor; (ii) build
    the sensor and (iii)evaluate its use. This was done through a loop back procedure
    described in Vandôme et al. [21]. After diagnosing the agrarian context, local
    water management issues and stakeholder needs, a sensor prototype was submitted
    to water users through a demonstration workshop. The feedback provided by the
    workshop participants enabled the production of a second version of the prototype
    that was better suited to local needs and constraints. The creation of an area
    for the design, maintenance and sharing between the actors of the co-innovation
    process – hereafter called Fab Lab – allowed the innovation to continually evolve
    based on the users’ feedback throughout the process. 2.2. Study site and water
    user requirements The Echraf public irrigation scheme is located in the Haouaria
    agricultural plain, at the northern tip of the Cap Bon peninsula in Tunisia (36°59′33.529″N,
    11°2′28.309″E). Drip irrigation of market gardening crops grown on sandy and draining
    soils has resulted in several problems. The reduced soil water holding capacity
    (around 4%) makes irrigation management complex: on the one hand the permanent
    wilting point (PWP) is quickly reached due to rapid drying of the soil; while
    on the other hand, the root profile is quickly saturated during an irrigation
    event, leading to percolation losses. In these conditions, optimal irrigation
    would theoretically involve regular application of low water volumes. In practice,
    this strategy is difficult to achieve for the farmers, due to (i) lack of information
    concerning the water resource (volumes applied, discharge rates, soil moisture,
    surface area irrigated), (ii) the variable flow rates of water supplied by the
    collective network, (iii) poor uniformity of application due to ageing or low
    quality irrigation equipment, and (iv) the recent emergence of drip irrigation
    technology in the region, which has not been combined with any training for water
    users. In the first stages of the co-innovation process, the stakeholders and
    the researchers agreed that, to solve these problems, a soil moisture sensor –
    hereafter termed Pilowtech – should be used in the field to assess crop water
    availability. To further develop this idea, a Fab Lab was set up in the Water
    Users Association (WUA) building where exchanges with farmers led to a set of
    specifications (Table 1) that were then used to design prototype soil moisture
    sensors. The Fab Lab was also used for the production and repair of the sensors.
    In parallel, three pilot farmers volunteered to host tests of the sensors in real
    conditions in three irrigated potato plots throughout the whole crop cycle. Table

    stated needs, we built a network of wireless, low-cost, low-tech, low-power and
    open-source soil moisture sensors. The overall architecture of the network of
    sensors is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (283KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flowchart of the water sensor network. 2.3.1.
    Hardware components The Pilowtech sensor is composed of a soil moisture probe,
    a data acquisition module and a power supply. The capacitance soil moisture sensor
    – model EK1940 v1.2 – was chosen for its resistance to corrosion, its low cost
    and availability. In addition, it operates over a voltage range of 3.3 V to 5
    V, making it compatible with low-power microcontrollers. The data acquisition
    module includes a microcontroller, a communication microchip and small electronics
    (wires, resistors, breadboard). The microcontroller chosen was the Arduino Pro-Mini,
    with a 3.3 V voltage and a frequency of 8 MHz. In addition to the advantages of
    Arduino systems (widely used, easy to use and open-source), thanks to its small
    size, the Pro-Mini is easy to embed and is one of the cheapest controllers on
    the market. It is also compatible with the LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network)
    communication protocol. The LoRa SX1276 communication module makes it possible
    to send and receive data via the LoRA radio network. The whole device is powered
    by a rechargeable Li-ion 18,650 battery (3.7 V and 3500 mAh). To allow onsite
    and instantaneous data reading, a reader was further developed based on an Arduino
    Uno board and a liquid crystal display (LCD) shield. The system is powered by
    a rechargeable Li-ion power bank with a 3.7 V output. To avoid damage caused by
    humidity, the probes were assembled at the end of PVC pipes (Ø40). Silicone was
    used to guarantee a tight sealing at the junction of the probe/pipe and the heat-shrink
    tubing at the wire junctions. The case of the acquisition module was printed using
    a 3D printer. The 3D printing file is available in the research data section at
    the end of this article. 2.3.2. Wireless communication network IoT technologies
    allow wireless communication of data generated by devices via different types
    of networks. The LoRaWAN communication protocol allows data transmission at low
    data rates (0.3–50 kb/s) and over long ranges (≤ 30 km). Compared to other available
    networks, the LoRa network stands out for its low energy consumption [22]. The
    LoRaWAN protocol thus met both our objectives and technological development conditions
    (sparse plots, no need for heavy data packets) and had also been tested in previous
    studies [23]. A private LoRa network was set up in the irrigation scheme. Likely
    due to the topography, two gateways were needed to cover the area that included
    the three experimental plots. The Things Network gateway, which, according to
    the manufacturer, has a range of about 10 km, was installed near the Fab Lab.
    The Things Indoor gateway, which has a shorter range but costs less, was installed
    between two pilot plots in the eastern part of the irrigation scheme. 4G+ airboxes
    were used to provide the Wi-Fi required for the gateways internet connection.
    2.3.3. Software and data workflow The microcontroller was programmed in C/C++
    language using the open source Arduino software (IDE) 1.8.19. The program was
    uploaded from the computer to the Arduino Pro-mini using a FTDI wire. To minimize
    energy consumption, the program code was written to maintain the sensor in sleeping
    mode (low µA consumption). The system woke up at 5-minute intervals to collect
    the analog signal produced by the probe, to convert it into digital data and send
    it through the LoRa network. Theoretically, this optimization enables the sensor
    to be energy autonomous throughout the irrigation season. The Arduino program
    is also available in the research data section. The data produced transited locally
    through the gateway via the LoRa network and was then routed online to the free
    server “The Things Network Cloud (Europe 1)” [24]. Within this server, the gateway
    was declared on the cloud and an application gathering sensor (device) IDs was
    generated. This server allowed real time data reading online but not storage or
    data processing. The free and open-source flow-based programming tool Node-RED
    [25], was thus used to gather the data from this online server and store it on
    a local server via an InfluxDB database [26]. The Node-RED flow is also available
    in the research data section. 2.3.4. User access to data Three different types
    of user access to data were provided through multiple channels to serve end-users
    with different technology literacy levels: (i) an online platform with access
    to data time series; (ii) a mobile phone messaging alert system; and (iii) an
    onsite data reader (Fig. 1). The online data reading is done using Grafana software
    [27], a free open-source data visualization and processing platform. A dashboard
    was produced to visualize data from each pilot farm. The dashboard comprised time
    series graphics for each soil moisture sensor (specified by its location and depth)
    and a map showing the location of the sensors. Data could be combined for visualization
    at different levels (plot, farm, irrigation scheme – the highest level being defined
    by the network). In parallel, Grafana enabled the development of a messaging alert
    system using the Telegram smartphone application and Telegram bots. The alert
    system was set to send a message to the end-user each time the soil water content
    (i) dropped below a threshold value (permanent wilting point), corresponding to
    a certain level of crop water-induced stress; or (ii) reached field capacity,
    in order to stop irrigation. The onsite data reader was designed for instantaneous
    visualization. The farmer has to physically plug the onsite reader into the sensor
    to get an instant display on the LCD screen. The reader can be programmed to display
    the volumetric soil moisture content, or the% refill level of total available
    soil moisture. Both Arduino programs are available in the research data section.
    In all cases, it is necessary to provide the user with data that can be easily
    used and guide their decision-making. The data emitted by the sensors and stored
    on the server are raw data, proportional to the output voltage of the capacitance
    probe. It is therefore necessary to define the relationship between soil moisture
    and raw values, before processing the data using visualization tools. 2.4. Calibration
    of the capacitance probe The capacitance probe operates according to the following
    principle: electric current flows through a coplanar concentric capacitor, which
    is the part inserted into the soil. The capacity is proportional to the relative
    dielectric permittivity of the medium, which itself depends on the soil moisture
    content. The output voltage (0–5 V) is converted into a digital value (10 bits)
    by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. Two calibration
    protocols based on the gravimetric method are proposed to determine the relationship
    between the output voltage and soil moisture. 2.4.1. Calibration in the laboratory
    Laboratory experiments allowed us to determine the relationship between the output
    values of the sensor (ϵ) and the volumetric soil moisture (θv,% volume). The gravimetric
    method was used. Three soil samples (S1, S2, S3) were collected from the 0–30
    cm horizon in three separate plots in the irrigation scheme. In parallel, bulk
    density was measured in each plot using the cylinder method. Samples were first
    dried in a heating chamber at 105 °C for 24 h and then left to cool at room temperature
    (20 °C). The dry soil samples were then used to fill a beaker of known volume
    (150 mL) while making sure the field bulk density was maintained by weighting
    the beaker. The volumetric humidity (θv) could therefore be defined by Eq. (1):
    (1) where θv is the volumetric soil moisture content (%), Vw the water volume,
    Vs the dry soil volume. To determine the relationship, the probe was inserted
    along the entire length of the capacitance device (approximately 6 cm), guaranteeing
    good contact between the soil and the probe. A small volume of water (1.5 mL corresponding
    to an increment of 1% of soil volumetric moisture) was repeatedly added to the
    sample. At each addition, the soil was mixed to guarantee isotropy, left to rest
    for 15 min and then restored to bulk density. The operation was repeated until
    the digital value reached a plateau, corresponding to soil water saturation. The
    digital value of the sensor, ϵ, acquired with the onsite reader, was recorded
    for each known sample volumetric humidity value, θv, in order to establish their
    correspondence. 2.4.2. Field calibration The purpose of field calibration was
    to provide a simple method to locally parametrize the soil moisture sensor without
    the need for sophisticated equipment. A soil sample was collected from each of
    the three pilot plots (samples P1, P2 and P3). The protocol was the same as that
    used in the laboratory with the following adaptations. First, the samples were
    dried in the sun on the roof for two days, followed by 3 h in an oven at 100 °C.
    To check the soil was dry, the sample was weighed on a kitchen scale (precision
    ±1 g), then put back in the oven and weighed again. If the mass of soil was unchanged,
    the soil was considered to be dry. Second, to limit the uncertainty caused by
    the use of a simple kitchen scale, a large mass of soil was used and the sample
    was only weighed at initialization. Bulk density could not be measured in field
    conditions. Consequently, a standard sandy bulk density was defined for the soil
    samples (1.5 kg of dry soil for 1 L in a graduated bucket), for which the θv-ϵ
    relationship was established. Water was progressively added using a 10 mL measuring
    glass (i.e. an increment of 1% θv). Readings were made with the sensor in the
    same conditions as those used for the laboratory calibration. Three replicates
    were made for each soil sample using three different probes in order to study
    the potential variability linked to the capacitance probe and its impact on the
    calibration. 2.4.3. Properties of the soil samples Soil samples from the pilot
    plots were analyzed in the laboratory. Table 2 lists the main soil properties.
    Despite slight local heterogeneities, the soils had most properties in common.
    They are sandy soils (≥ 90%) with low organic matter content (≤ 1%). Water storage
    capacity is low, with permanent wilting points ranging from θv 5% to 7% and field
    capacity ranging from 9% to 11%. Bulk density is about 1.6 g/cm3. Table 2. Soil

    Soil moisture measurements make it possible to understand different physical processes
    such as filling of the total available soil moisture, deep percolation, or surface
    evaporation. The choice of the location and depth of the sensor depends on the
    properties of the type of soil and the processes to be monitored, as well as the
    characteristics of the cropping system. In our study site with a drip-irrigated
    potato crop, the objectives were twofold: to ensure crop water comfort and to
    limit deep percolation. To this end, soil moisture was measured at two depths:
    (i) at a depth of 30 cm, at a distance of 15 cm from the drip line, and (ii) at
    a depth of 60 cm, directly under the drip line. These measurements provided information
    on the structure of the water bulb. On the one hand, we considered that “correct”
    soil moisture at the two locations satisfies crop water comfort and on the other
    hand, that high soil moisture content at a depth of 60 cm – the maximum effective
    rooting depth – leads to deep percolation. Field monitoring lasted from March
    5 to June 15, 2022. Three plots were instrumented with two to three Pilowtech
    sensors each, corresponding to approximately one sensor/0.1 ha. To evaluate the
    quality of the sensors by comparing the data, plots P1 and P2 were equipped with,
    respectively, a commercial capacitance-based sensor (Drill and Drop manufactured
    by Sentek Technologies, “SAND” factory default setting) and a tensiometer (Watermark
    manufactured by Irrometer). Measurement depths and positions with respect to the
    drip line were the same as with the Pilowtech sensors. Time series produced by
    the commercial capacitance sensor were post-calibrated with respect to the average
    of the series produced by the Pilowtech (coefficient of 0.621) in order to adapt
    the measurement of the commercial probe to the local soil type and to allow comparison
    of the data. Installation of the Pilowtech in the field required the use of a
    graduated auger and a fence post to attach the acquisition module. The capacitance
    probe was inserted vertically into the soil after moistening the substrate to
    guarantee a good contact between the soil and the probe. 3. Results 3.1. Design
    of the Pilowtech, a decision-support tool for irrigation management 3.1.1. Hardware
    The hardware design of the soil moisture sensor is easy and quick to make (about
    30min.). The electrical assembly was simplified in order to be as reproducible
    as possible (Fig. 2). The sensor was configured with two analog inputs for two
    capacitance probes, thus allowing soil moisture to be measured at two depths at
    each location. Access to the plug for on-site reading was by means of a screw
    cap at the above-ground extremity of the PVC tube. Download : Download high-res

    the Pilowtech sensor. The numbers refer to Table 4. 3.1.2. Results of calibration
    The results of the laboratory calibration are presented in Fig. 3. The digital
    values returned by the sensor in air and in water were ϵa = 437 and ϵw = 202,
    respectively. The sensor displayed a digital value of ϵs = 434 in the presence
    of dry soil (θv = 0%). The curve decreased, reflecting the inverse relationship
    between moisture content and output voltage: the wetter the soil, the lower the
    output voltage, and therefore the lower the digital value returned. The distribution
    of the data shows a linear trend at low soil moisture content and then an increase
    in the slope above a threshold (around 6% moisture content) suggesting the existence
    of a vertical asymptote. This type of behavior can be described by an exponential
    relationship between ϵ and θ. From these results, we constructed the following
    empirical equation: (2) where k is a parameter depending on soil properties, ϵs,
    ϵw and ϵa are respectively, the sensor output variable, the sensor constant value
    in water and the sensor constant value in the air. Therefore, the expression of
    volumetric soil moisture can be modeled as a function of the output voltage variable
    and three parameters depending on the soil type (k) and the probe used (ϵw, ϵa).
    This model appears well fitted (R2 = 0.972) with respect to the data obtained
    from the laboratory calibration (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (265KB)

    the field calibration performed on the soils of the pilot plots are shown in Fig.
    4. For each of the three soil samples (P1, P2, P3), the calibration is made using
    three different sensors (A, B, C). The results were used to parametrize Eq. (2),
    and the corresponding curves (models) were compared with the experimental data.
    The soil parameter k was determined by searching for an optimal match between
    the gravimetric and simulated soil moisture and minimisation of the error. Table
    3 summarizes the parameters obtained. The results showed that the model based
    on Eq. (2) satisfactorily fitted the data obtained using the gravimetric method
    for all three soils (0.875 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.983). The parameters related to the capacitance
    probe ranged between 182 and 198 for ϵw and between 430 and 479 for ϵa. The soil
    parameters obtained with the same soil sample varied little with respect to their
    mean (3% ≤ cv ≤ 4%). However, parameter k varied more between the different soil
    samples (6% ≤ cv ≤ 10%), parameter k is thus more sensitive to soil characteristics.

    farmer connected to the WSN has access to a personal space on the online platform.
    The data produced by the sensors are gathered for each farm and can be displayed
    according to the desired location, date and depth. The calibration results allow
    the raw data to be displayed in the form of volumetric soil moisture (Fig. 5).
    Time series are available for consultation (historical and real time) and can
    be downloaded in different formats. In the field, the data can be accessed manually
    using the onsite reader. When visiting the plots, by unscrewing the top of the
    protective PVC tube at the desired location and depth, the farmer can simply plug
    in (Fig. 6a). After several trials, the farmers indicated the most practical visualization
    is the one that displays the filling percentage of the total available soil moisture
    (FP = ). This percentage is visualized by means of a progress bar (Fig. 6b). Download

    3.2. On field data evaluation: comparison with commercial water sensors The data
    series produced by the Pilowtech sensors were compared with series produced by
    commercial sensors at two locations. 3.2.1. Ability for monitoring relative soil
    water status The data obtained for plot P2 were compared with the tension measurement
    produced by a commercial tensiometer probe (Watermark) at the same location and
    depths (30 and 60 cm) as the Pilowtech (Fig. 7). Monitoring continued from March
    8 to June 13, 2022, i.e. shortly after planting until the potatoes were harvested.
    The tensiometers were installed on March 25, before the start of the irrigation
    season. Irrigation was regular (frequency of around 3 days) during the development
    stage (April). Irrigation events were less frequent from the midseason until harvest
    (from May to June). The time step for data generation is 4 h for the tensiometer
    and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Irrigation events are clearly identifiable
    from the peak moisture contents measured by the Pilowtech, and from the drops
    in tension measured by the tensiometer. At a depth of 30 cm, tension varied between
    0 and 50 kPa. The volumetric soil moisture measured globally varied between the
    permanent wilting point (  = 5.83% at pF = 4.2) and field capacity (  = 9.41%
    at pF = 2.5). At a depth of 60 cm, the range of soil moisture was slightly higher
    (between 8% and 13%) and the range of tension was lower (between 2 and 15 kPa).
    At both depths, the data produced by the commercial tensiometer and the Pilowtech
    sensor were highly correlated. In the shallow soil layer, the probes are more
    sensitive to water inputs. Their variations make it possible to monitor the entire
    irrigation schedule, and to distinguish between the hydration and drying phases
    of the soil. Close to the maximum rooting depth, the response of both probes was
    less sensitive to drip irrigation inputs. Minor non-percolating irrigation events
    were less or not detected. However, analysis of moisture peaks showed that both
    probes reacted to irrigation events on the same dates. The sensor thus has the
    ability to monitor relative changes in soil moisture. Download : Download high-res

    status in plot “P2”: comparison between the Pilowtech (red curves) and a commercial

    was due to a power failure, independently from our system. 3.2.2. Ability for
    absolute soil moisture monitoring In plot P1, the measurements made with a commercial
    capacitance sensor and the Pilowtech (30 and 60 cm) from April 4 to May 3 were
    compared (Fig. 8). The data generation time step of the commercial sensor is 1
    h, and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Comparison of the soil moisture content
    characteristics measured in the plot “P1” (  = 7.00% at pF = 4.2 and  = 10.71%
    at pF = 2.5) showed that the range of moisture content measured by the commercial
    probe and by Pilowtech was globally bounded by the permanent wilting point and
    field capacity. We also compared the potential of detection of irrigation peaks,
    corresponding to local maximum soil water moisture content. Results revealed an
    excellent temporal match, confirming that irrigation events were accurately detected
    by both sensors. The ability of the Pilowtech to measure the intensity of irrigation
    events was further analyzed by comparing the magnitude of changes in soil moisture
    recorded by both probes during the first month of monitoring (Fig. 9). Download

    soil moisture content in plot “P1”: comparison of the magnitude of changes in

    magnitude of an event was calculated as the difference between the maximum peak
    moisture measured following an irrigation event and the minimum moisture value
    preceding the same irrigation event. The results showed a good correlation between
    the magnitudes recorded by the two probes for low and medium intensity events
    (∆ < 4%). On the other hand, the gap between measurements by the two probes was
    larger in the case of more intense, higher magnitude events (∆ > 4%). Under these
    conditions, the Pilowtech sensor gave higher amplitudes than those measured by
    the commercial probe. This difference could be explained by the different sampling
    intervals used in sandy soils with high hydraulic conductivity. These behavioral
    variations could also be the result of drift trends the experimental data did
    not allow us to characterise. 3.3. Provisioning and maintenance 3.3.1. A low tech
    sensor with reasonable maintenance requirements The system was designed to be
    low power and to enable several months’ autonomy with a 3.7 V battery. The main
    maintenance tasks during the season were: (i) battery management; (ii) network
    troubleshooting; (iii) hardware maintenance. At the end of the 102-day monitoring
    period, one sensor out of the eight installed needed its battery recharging. The
    first assumption made in the event of a gap in the data time series is that the
    battery is empty. After checking the voltage, the second hypothesis is a network
    failure. A few occasional network interruptions required maintenance tasks over
    the course of the season, the origins of which were identified as follows: power
    supply failure at the gateway or an interruption in Wi-Fi coverage at the gateway
    location. Finally, once the network and the power supply have been checked, a
    gap or an anomaly in the data time series may be due to hardware failure. The
    connectors in the acquisition module and at the junction with the probes should
    then be checked. Direct reading in the field may be necessary to check the quality
    of the data provided by the probe. Out of the 16 probes installed (2 per sensor),
    25% of the probes showed occasional anomalies that required a technical intervention.
    In these situations, the probes produced unstable and inconsistent data in the
    data series that were easy to identify. As these events occurred following irrigation
    events, we assume they were due to faulty seals resulting in leakage into the
    probe''s electronic circuits. In this case, technical maintenance consists in
    removing the damaged probe, and drying or replacing it, and making sure it is
    watertight. The resulting anomalies in soil moisture data time series can also
    be easily cleaned. 3.4. A low-cost sensor with adjustable costs Table 4 summarizes
    the costs required to design a low tech soil moisture sensor. The cost of production
    is adjustable depending on requirements. The components needed for the sensor
    itself cost less than 10€ with an onsite reading system only, less than 15€ for
    a wireless sensor, and a total of slightly more than 20€ for the sensor with a
    double data reading mode. For the wireless solution, setting up a LoRa network
    requires a gateway (costing between 50€ and 300€) and an Internet connection.
    However, this investment is sufficient to network an unlimited number of sensors,
    which allows the costs to be amortized or shared between users. The low cost hardware
    and free software of the Pilowtech thus make the sensor highly affordable. Table

    probes become accessible to any water user? We developed a soil moisture sensor
    based on the specifications and feedback provided by the water users of an irrigation
    scheme. The sensor we developed is (i) low tech, meaning easy to make, maintain
    and reproduce; (ii) low cost, so small farming systems can afford it; (iii) low
    power, and consequently relatively self-sufficient and sustainable over time;
    (iv) meeting farmers’ expectations for monitoring water status in the root zone.
    The data can be accessed in two ways: remotely via an online interface, or in
    the field through direct reading. Calibration is feasible both in the laboratory
    and in the field. The sensor rating curve (Eq. (2)) is given by only one parameter,
    k, characteristic of the soil. This rating equation provides a reliable prediction
    of volumetric soil moisture once it has been parameterized. The sensor allows
    soil moisture to be monitored at two depths and can be used as a decision support
    tool for irrigation scheduling. Comparison with commercial probes highlighted
    the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor for irrigation scheduling and for
    monitoring relative soil moisture. The low recording frequency of the commercial
    tensiometer, capillary hysteresis processes and the low water holding capacities
    of the soils prevented accurate plotting of sandy soil retention curves [28].
    To go further, a laboratory experiment conditions would allow comparison of the
    Pilowtech sensor results with the predictions of the Van Genuchten function for
    a sandy soil [29]. The measurement of absolute soil moisture was satisfactory
    compared with that of the commercial capacitance probe, but the measurement may
    be subject to slight deviation over time. A metrological study, specific to the
    monitoring of the deviation by multiplying the controls and measuring battery
    discharge rates, should enable conclusions to be drawn concerning these effects.
    At the level of the farm or of the irrigation scheme, the number of sensors could
    be multiplied to create a wireless sensor network based on the LoRaWAN protocol.
    The data produced in real-time can be used by different types of stakeholders:
    (i) by farmers as a decision-support tool at the field and farm levels; (ii) by
    irrigation scheme managers and agricultural advisors to assess water requirements
    and advise water users; (iii) by researchers, for whom the production of these
    data will help assess performance gaps, compare practices and feed model scenarios.
    Recent advances in on-board electronics and IoT therefore appear promising for
    the agricultural sector and particularly for water management, to the extent that
    they led to the development of both economically and technically accessible measurement
    tools. The plasticity of these systems is particularly interesting because it
    makes the tool adaptable to the agrarian context: for instance, we were able to
    adapt the data reading system to the users. Moreover, the open source nature of
    the system transforms the traditionally “black box” sensor into a tool that can
    be fully programmed by the user. Thus the user can calibrate the Pilowtech according
    to the characteristics of his/her field, which makes it better suited and therefore
    more reliable than a default pre-calibrated probe. On the other hand, it is important
    to stress that these advantages are not necessarily considered as such by every
    farmer. Indeed, the “do it yourself” approach may be seen as a limitation as it
    requires time to get used to it, more regular maintenance, and a certain level
    of agronomic expertise. These limitations can be overcome by supporting users,
    notably through training or by providing technical support. The scale of the irrigation
    scheme, and user collectives such as water users associations, appear to be a
    suitable environment to host a Fab lab, making it possible to pool maintenance
    interventions and the expenses involved in running wireless sensor networks. The
    Fab Lab also appears as a valuable environment for user training, notably regarding
    the calibration process, which although not requiring any special equipment, may
    nevertheless demand some ability. Another alternative could be for further studies
    to produce tables associating parameter values with major soil types. Currently,
    the use of these technologies is facilitated by the growing importance of the
    community involved in this domain, the multiplication of suppliers worldwide,
    and the trend towards simplification of components and reduction of their costs.
    However, component costs still depend on the market, and are consequently sensitive
    to fluctuations (the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, led to a worldwide shortage
    of electronic chips). Hence, the equipment used in the present study will inevitably
    evolve with technical advances and market changes, which is not a problem as long
    as the equipment remains highly affordable and available from local suppliers.
    In any case, the Pilowtech sensor was designed as an evolving tool, necessarily
    subject to change through re-design and ”bricolage”, as signs of its re-appropriation
    by users [30]. Future studies should focus on the multi-criteria (agronomic, environmental,
    hydraulic, socioeconomic) impacts of the adoption of such tools for irrigated
    agriculture, including paying attention to potential side effects [31,32]. Some
    work remains to be done before massive use of this type of technology is achieved,
    and particular attention will have to be paid to the mechanisms of adoption and
    the means to promote the dissemination of the innovation among farmers and water
    users. After all, there is nothing to prevent the adjustment of this sensor to
    a variety of contexts, for irrigation management of diverse cropping systems or
    for environmental monitoring, at the same time bearing in mind that “not everything
    that can be counted actually counts”. 5. Conclusion The use of new technologies
    for agriculture does not necessarily need to be expensive, complex and energy
    intensive. We designed a low-cost, open source, low-tech and low-energy soil moisture
    sensor for monitoring crop irrigation. The calibration method implemented is simple,
    based on only one parameter, and allows real time monitoring of the fulfillment
    of the water requirements of an irrigated crop, in the present case, potato. The
    irrigation schedule can therefore be adjusted accordingly. Comparison of our low-cost
    sensor with commercial probes in field conditions over a whole irrigation season
    underlined the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor. The sensor can be used
    as a decision-support tool for real-time water management. At the scale of an
    irrigation scheme, the skills and costs of the equipment required to build a wireless
    sensor network could be shared between users. Soil moisture probes are known as
    a driver to achieve water savings, and this study provides a way to make them
    accessible, although they require more regular maintenance than existing commercial
    ready-to-use solutions. We believe that this study contributes to the democratization
    of the use of new technologies in agriculture and provides keys to facilitating
    their adoption, in both the North and the global South. Future work should focus
    on assessing the impacts of the adoption of such innovation, and its adaptation
    to different contexts. Research data All the software required for the design

  explanation: "This systematic review on the applications of digital technologies\
    \ for improving the current state and future potential of real-time irrigation\
    \ management systems categorizes the studies based on the highlighted technology\
    \ like Big data, IoT, AI, Robotics, BCT, RFID as follows:\n\n1. Big data: The\
    \ review states that about 24% of the studies focused on Big data analytics and\
    \ its applications. It enhances the supply chain decisions by harnessing real-time\
    \ data and deriving insights from large datasets which portrays integrity, volume,\
    \ variety and velocity. Some of the key findings in this area are:\n - A combination\
    \ of data technologies and agri-food projects too crucial for creating new knowledge\
    \ by extension of farmers' data, advanced services, processes, and software. \n\
    \ - A study using structural equation modelling proposed a data analysis method\
    \ based on which a positive association with increased financial performance when\
    \ there was harmony among supply chain partners was observed. \n-Another study\
    \ in this area highlighted setting up Large scale pilot plants (LSPs) based on\
    \ IoT to identify technological and Agri-food requirements and describing sectoral\
    \ and technical challenges. \n-It is also reported that challenges in IoT adoption\
    \ for retail level in the Indian context are factors like flavor emissions, color,\
    \ etc. Studies have also focused on developing novel approaches for smart farming\
    \ using IoT and automation to increase productivity by controlling field operations\
    \ remotely. \n-IoT is predicted to help improve demand forecasts, safety stock\
    \ reduction, and supplier performance management.\n\n2. IoT (Internet of Things):\
    \ The review categorizes that about 17% of the studies focused on IoT (Internet\
    \ of Things). It layer produces an anomalous amount of data, using sensor technology,\
    \ nanotechnology, higher connectivity through satellite or 5G, and devices such\
    \ as robots or drones, which can remotely generate live data and interact, making\
    \ the digital representation of the real-world for the development. Some of the\
    \ key findings in this area are:\n - The study found that self-adaptive food supply\
    \ chains can be formed, in which objects decide, operate, and learn continuously\
    \ and autonomously and proposed architecture for enabling information systems\
    \ by analyzing virtual supply chains from a perspective of IoT and usage of architecture\
    \ in the fish supply chain for 'Proof of concept'.\n -A conceptual model using\
    \ two-echelon supply hubs to represent supply chain challenges in the perishable\
    \ supply chain was proposed based on IoT captured real-time data. These hubs,\
    \ which act as supply chain dominators, react to the real-time data acquired from\
    \ IoT-enabled supply chain operational process providing information on public\
    \ warehousing and logistic services.\n -An IoT-based three-layer architecture\
    \ for precision agriculture was discussed which collects data needed and relays\
    \ it to a cloud-based backend for processing and analysis. \n-A smart device with\
    \ interfacing sensors and internet connectivity will monitor operations and control,\
    \ and Zigbee modules with a micro-controller will execute operations.\n\n3. AI\
    \ (Artificial Intelligence): The review states that about 12% of the studies focused\
    \ on AI (Artificial intelligence). AI techniques are not in use significantly\
    \ as there is a lack of awareness and huge costs associated with this technology's\
    \ implementation. Some of the key findings in this area are:\n -A study proposed\
    \ Artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic controller to determine the\
    \ crop water requirement, grading crop produced, plant disease detection, phenotyping\
    \ of crops, etc.\n -Another study proposed an AI-augmented farm can robotically\
    \ alter crop amounts for supply & demand data, making earth cycles more resilient.\n\
    \ -An approach to improve the distribution efficiency, transportation, and removal\
    \ of poor products from the supply chain using centralized data collection and\
    \ analysis techniques in IoT-based mechanisms was proposed.\n\n4. Robotics: The\
    \ review categorizes that about 6% of the studies focused on Robotics. Robotics\
    \ and autonomous systems (RAS) are presented in the economy depicting low productivity\
    \ like agri-food, the technology aims to reduce and replace intense human efforts\
    \ and produce significant mini and macro-scale productions. Some of the key findings\
    \ in this area are:\n-The usage of robotic technologies in agriculture operations\
    \ autonomously, ensuring that the adverse climatic and soil conditions have less\
    \ or no effect on production and better precision.\n-Drones are used in agriculture\
    \ to monitor crop health, equipment, weed recognition, and disaster control. Also,\
    \ pesticides and herbicides can be sprayed effectively with drones' aid, and plants\
    \ can be monitored.\n\n5. BCT (Blockchain Technology): The review states that\
    \ about 24% of the studies focused on BCT (Blockchain Technology). It is a technological\
    \ concept evolved from Bitcoin (Dujak and Sajter, 2019). It also finds food security\
    \ applications, safety, integrity, and waste reduction in the present complex\
    \ food supply chains, including numerous actors like farmers, shipping companies,\
    \ wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. Some of the key findings in this area\
    \ are:\n-Blockchain technology (BCT) applications for smart farming, agricultural\
    \ insurance, agricultural product transaction. \n-BCT based on a decentralized\
    \ system assures product safety and increased efficiency.\n-BCT embedded cryptography,\
    \ digital records, transaction disintermediation processing, and data storage\
    \ makes work easier.\n-Agri-block (IoT-BCT)-based tool in AFSC for traceability\
    \ by integrating IoT devices.\n -Two cases from China were analyzed, emphasizing\
    \ on uncertainty, trading frequency, and asset specificity.\n\n6. RFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identification): The review categorizes that about 17% of the studies\
    \ focused on RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). RFID detection (RFID) is a\
    \ pervasive technology with complete food logistics applications and cold chain\
    \ monitoring, which is vital to producing storage retails and supply chain management.\
    \ Some of the key findings in this area are:\n-RFID logistic pilot III (RLP3)\
    \ project that focused on RFID deployment and IT infrastructure development for\
    \ real-time data management in fresh produce supply was dealt with.\n-RFID has\
    \ potential applications in shrinkage reduction and optimization of shelf inventory\
    \ levels of products.\n-RFID delivers unique identification, sensor aids in monitoring\
    \ real-time quality, and BCT creates digital databases tamper-proof.\n-Near-field\
    \ wireless thin-film coated RFID compatible sensor tag' for evaluating the volatility\
    \ of packed food at room temperature, and the sensor tags having polyaniline,\
    \ coated as thin-film on the interdigitated capacitor. A low-frequency RFID (Ultra-high\
    \ frequency RFID) systems can be assessed and improvised for the food composition\
    \ directly from the design phase.\n-RFID fault tolerance mechanism confirmed system\
    \ practicability. This design ensured food safety, especially in perishable foods\
    \ like meat. A sensor was developed to evaluate the food expiry date, which contains\
    \ an RFID tag and a conductive polymer. It operates on the principle that the\
    \ conductivity of polymer changes on exposure to spoiled foods and is detected\
    \ as an RFID signal by the reader.\n-RFID food management (RFM) system in the\
    \ IoT network paradigm to bring in healthy eating habits and help in the fight\
    \ against food wastage.\n-Electronic-pedigree food traceability method to use\
    \ RFID technology, WSN, for temperature and humidity data collection. \n-RFID\

    \                    JEL: L66, O30, Q11, Q55 \n \n \n1. Introduction \nAgri-food\
    \ is a complex sector that consists of a varied range \nof operations and roles\
    \ worldwide. It is an area of prominence, \nmaking it critical to successfully\
    \ apply advanced internet tech-\nnologies to ensure an efficient agri-food supply\
    \ chain. It is the \nleading provider of sustainable, sufficient, affordable,\
    \ and safe \nfood, feed, fiber, and fuel to the end-user. The pressure is be-\n\
    ing created on different stakeholders associated with agri-food \nsupply chains\
    \ due to free trade strategies and globalization, \nbesides the safe, hygienic,\
    \ and quality foods. Socioeconomic \nand ecological factors play a vital role\
    \ in achieving a thriving \nsupply chain (Bhat and Jõudu, 2019). Innovative solutions\
    \ are \nneeded as supply chains are mostly inefficient, with increasing \nconstraints\
    \ and demand. The stakeholders related to the Agri-\nfood sectors, such as manufacturers,\
    \ producers, retailers, gov-\nernment, and policymakers, are linked intrinsically\
    \ to solve \ncritical challenges. Technology plays a vital role in defining \n\
    and implementing key solutions and in the due process of de-\ncision-making (Panetto\
    \ et al., 2020; Mor et al., 2018b). After \nthe industrial revolution in the nineteenth\
    \ century, there has \nbeen a rapid growth in the Agri-food industry where there\
    \ \nwere system mechanization and steam engine usage, which \nlaid a base for\
    \ the food processing industry. This period is \nspecified as 'Agri-Food 1.0'.\
    \ In the 1950s, commonly called \n'Agri-Food 2.0', there has been increased use\
    \ of electrical ma-\nchines leading to improved production facilities. Robotics\
    \ and \nautomation were the main pillars of 'Agri-Food 3.0', which \nemerged in\
    \ the 20th century. These led to the usage of special-\nized machinery to sow\
    \ and harvest operations that complete \nwork cycles in separated tasks. This\
    \ era also led to remarkable \nprogress in crop techniques (Miranda et al., 2019).\
    \ 'Industry \n4.0' influences the agri-food industry through various tech-\nniques,\
    \ technologies, strategies, and methods. Cyber-physical \nsystems (CPS) are the\
    \ main benefits in this era with applica-\ntions in precision production systems\
    \ and open food produc-\ntion systems. Some CPS involved intelligent greenhouses,\
    \ \nsmart sensors, robots, vertical farms, drones, wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ (WSN), etc. There was a particular emphasis on en-\nvironmental, social, and\
    \ economic issues with advanced sys-\ntem digitalization, sustainable practices\
    \ adoption, and modern \nVASAVI DADI ET AL. / PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES\

    \ era \n(Miranda et al., 2019). New opportunities are provided with \ndigital\
    \ technologies in agri-food right from 'farm to fork' as it \noffers new solutions\
    \ to meet old and new challenges. These \nopportunities are considered essential,\
    \ particularly on climate \nchange challenges and in an integrated global food\
    \ system \n(OECD, 2019). \nTechnological advancement also drives horizontal integra-\n\
    tion and vertical integration in the agri-food chain, favoring \nmajor food suppliers\
    \ (Kirova et al., 2019). Specifically, digital \ntechnologies also enable novel\
    \ business model development \nby offering probabilities for new practices that\
    \ provide entre-\npreneurship (Gregori and Holzmann, 2020). Smart technolo-\n\
    gies are also viewed as adjuncts that can cause a short food \nsupply chain conventionalization,\
    \ thereby altering the opti-\nmally distinct (Lioutas and Charatsari, 2020). Today,\
    \ the \nglobal challenges of managing the efficacy of resources in \nagri-food\
    \ is a key concern. Some issues like energy-related \nconcerns are the same at\
    \ the global level, while others, like \nwater scarcity, vary based on their economic\
    \ condition (Ana-\nstasiadis et al., 2018). The impacts of digital transformations\
    \ \non commercial and ecological performance are mediated by \ndigital platforms\
    \ (Li et al., 2020). The digital transformations \ncan reduce waste, strengthen\
    \ logistical processes & infor-\nmation, and support flexible production and resource-sparing\
    \ \nby encouraging lean production (Hoellthaler et al., 2020). \nHowever, digitalization\
    \ is not new because it is a crucial com-\nponent of modern supply chains. Material\
    \ requirement plan-\nning, i.e., MRP-I and MRP-II, implementation can be consid-\n\
    ered as a starting point for supply chain operations digitization \n(Kittipanya-ngam\
    \ and Tan, 2020). ERP systems and continual \ndigital transformations in food\
    \ production technologies facili-\ntated the food supply chain streamlining towards\
    \ downstream, \nboosting efficiency (Gharehgozli et al., 2017). Also, the de-\n\
    velopments in farming-related processes, including machin-\nery, robots, and drones,\
    \ have replaced the existing traditional \nmeans of transportation and aid in\
    \ last-mile deliveries (Robin-\nson 2017). Agri-Food 4.0, a digitization approach\
    \ for sustain-\nable agriculture acceleration and support, land management, \n\
    and competitiveness, the agri-food sector presents an excellent \npotential for\
    \ improved efficiency, intelligence, performance, \nand sustainability accompanied\
    \ by internet-based networks \nand services (Hernández Jorge et al., 2018). Integrating\
    \ demo-\ngraphic changes, unequal resource distribution, poverty, cli-\nmate change,\
    \ and digital technology would also emerge as a \nchallenge in agri-food 4.0.\
    \ Between concerns and capabilities \nof digital transformation, exploitation,\
    \ and management of ag-\nricultural data act as the central node (Lezoche et al.,\
    \ 2020). \nTechnological interventions, real-time monitoring, and cost \ncontainment\
    \ are the advantages of agriculture digitalization \ntowards sustainability improvement\
    \ and territory management \n(Kamble et al., 2020; Panetto et al., 2020). There\
    \ would be \nmore cost-effective and less labor-intensive supply chains \nwith\
    \ high responsiveness to market demands using highly in-\ntegrated digital platforms.\
    \ Ivanov et al. (2019) studied the im-\npact of supply chain digitization, where\
    \ increased demand re-\nsponsiveness and capacity flexibility encouraged the adoption\
    \ \nof digital technologies. This paper addresses the emerging \ntechnologies\
    \ for transforming the traditional supply chain into \na digitized one via innovations\
    \ such as AI, IoT, robotics, \nblockchain, big data, RFID, etc. This paper presents\
    \ a system-\natic literature review aimed at answering the following re-\nsearch\
    \ questions:  \nRQ.1. What are the issues resolved by the implementation \nof\
    \ digitized agri-food chains?  \nRQ.2. What are the trends or innovations in different\
    \ digital \ntechnologies to address new challenges in the agri-food supply \n\
    chain? \nRQ.3. What should future research emphasize on the suc-\ncessful execution\
    \ of a digitized agri-food supply chain?  \nFurther, this paper highlights the\
    \ findings and research gov-\nerning digital transformations in agri-food. There\
    \ is a focus on \nan urgent need to optimize the existing processing methods \n\
    and management techniques in the agri-food sector for sus-\ntainable development.\

    \ Articles \nThe articles selected were sub-categorized based on the \ntechnology\
    \ emphasized like: Big data, IoT, Robotics, AI, \nBlockchain technology (BCT),\
    \ and RFID, as these are the \nleading technologies highlighted in this paper.\
    \ Based on the \nexisting literature reviews, it was observed that the articles\
    \ \ncovering all technologies are in minimal number, and the sus-\ntainability\
    \ concept was also not emphasized on all papers, \nwhich becomes the base of this\
    \ paper. \n \nFig. 2. Classification for digital technologies \nThe classification\
    \ of articles for different digital technolo-\ngies depicts that maximum studies\
    \ were on blockchain tech-\nnology, which accounted for ~24%, and only 6% of total\
    \ pa-\npers were on robotics (Fig. 2). More research on robotic \ntechnology and\
    \ its usage in agri-food is needed to uncover the \nchallenges and opportunities.\
    \ All other technologies had \nenough approach, and their uses are exploited in\
    \ all sectors, \nincluding agri-food. \nIt is evident that most of the articles\
    \ in the review were pub-\nlished in 2020 and 2019, and the least, i.e., 5% in\
    \ 2016, show-\ning increased research studies on digitalization from 2016 to \n\

    \ a measuring process \nimplies the quality of attained outcome leading to as\
    \ repre-\nsentative. External validity demonstrates whether the study \nsample\
    \ approves to the population or not (Neuendorf, 2002; \nKrippendorff, 2004). In\
    \ this paper, the articles concerning dig-\nital technologies and their roles\
    \ in operations and supply chain \nmanagement for agri-food sector are selected.\
    \ Hence, the ex-\nternal validity is assured. Further, this review has been con-\n\
    firmed with the academicians and agri-food industry profes-\nsionals for content\
    \ validity. The reliability is assessed through \nthe percent agreement procedure\
    \ (Mor et al., 2018a), 82%, and \nthus deemed reliable. \n3. Analysis \n3.1. Big\
    \ Data Analytics  \nData-driven supply chain decisions have become trouble-\n\
    free, using tools and techniques developed by big data analyt-\nics (BDA). Better\
    \ and faster decisions can assist enterprises by \nanalyzing and comprehending\
    \ real-time results that deal with \nlarge datasets that portray integrity, volume,\
    \ variety, and ve-\nlocity. Organizations can also improve the supply chain by\
    \ \ncost reduction and risk mitigation (Govindan et al., 2018). \nA combination\
    \ of data technologies and agri-food projects too \ncrucial for creating new knowledge\
    \ by extension of farmers' \ndata, advanced services, processes, and software.\
    \ It also plays \na role in the adaptation of factories-of-future (FoF)  and infor-\n\
    mation & communication technologies (ICT) and related to \nagricultural patterns\
    \ and big data models (Lezoche et al., \n2020). Yu et al. (2018) explored financial\
    \ performance af-\nfected by a Chinese firm's data-driven supply chain. This \n\
    study proposed a data analysis method based on structural \nequation modelling.\
    \ This study depicted a positive association \nwith increased financial performance\
    \ when there was har-\nmony among supply chain partners. A change in supply chain\
    \ \nresponsiveness was also seen in fast response to market de-\nmand shifts in\
    \ an organization. Singh et al. (2018) proposed \na methodology using BDA by identifying\
    \ constraints in pre-\nvailing food supply chains and logistics from social media\
    \ \ndata (Twitter). The text analytics approach analyzed the cap-\ntured Twitter\
    \ data, which uses hierarchical clustering and \na support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ with multiscale bootstrap \nsampling. The cluster of words about improvement\
    \ in various \nsegments of the supply chain was the outcome of this analysis.\
    \  \n \nBelaud et al. (2019) proposed a five-step approach in \nwhich big data\
    \ is integrated to improve sustainability in the \nsupply chain and increase agricultural\
    \ waste value. Oncioiu et \nal. (2019) concentrated on supply chain management\
    \ and \nBDA usage in supply chains of Romanian companies to eval-\nuate the experience,\
    \ professional capabilities, and strategies in \nsuccessfully implementing BDA\
    \ as determining the tools re-\nquired to achieve the goal. Results showed that\
    \ 90% of re-\nspondents endorsed an enterprise-wide approach, encouraging \nbig\
    \ data to add business value. Roßmann et al. (2017) studied \nBDA applications\
    \ by a multi-method approach, which is part \nof the organizational information\
    \ processing theory (OIPT). \nBy conducting a Delphi survey, projections up to\
    \ the year \n2035 were integrated, and fuzzy c- clustering was employed \nto identify\
    \ future scenarios that depict the future of BDA in \nSCM. It was suggested that\
    \ BDA would help improve demand \nforecasts, safety stock reduction, and supplier\
    \ performance \nmanagement. Jha et al. (2020) studied the criteria for capabil-\n\
    ity-building and profit maximization through BDA technolo-\ngies. \n3.2. Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) \nIoT layer produces an anomalous amount of data, using sen-\n\
    sor technology, nanotechnology, higher connectivity through \nsatellite or 5G,\
    \ and devices such as robots or drones, which \ncan remotely generate live data\
    \ (Valentini et al., 2019). A con-\nnected world is visualized by IoT where things\
    \ can communi-\ncate measured data and interact, making the digital represen-\n\
    tation of the real-world for the development (Reyna et al., \n2018). Recently,\
    \ smart farming systems that enhance food \nproduction and are based on embedded\
    \ systems and IoT are \ngetting attention and popularity among people (Mahbub,\
    \ \n2020). Integration of IoT with agriculture offers data related \nto agri-features\
    \ like water, humans, soil, animals, etc. (Lezo-\nche et al., 2020). The Agri-food\
    \ sector is deficient in ICT up-\ntake. The high cost is incurred in data capture\
    \ and analytics, \ndelivering different decision support tools (Brewster et al.,\
    \ \n2017). IoT employs several technologies like wireless sensor \nnetworks (WSN),\
    \ radio frequency identification (RFID), sen-\nsors, and global positioning systems\
    \ (GPS) that are useful for \nenvironmental monitoring, greenhouse management,\
    \ tracea-\nbility, cold chain monitoring, etc. (Ping et al., 2018). Precision\
    \ \nAgriculture (PA) is one such promising example of the IoT \napplication in\
    \ agriculture. The use of guidance systems can \nachieve cost savings in terms\
    \ of seed, fertilizer, and tractor \n5%\n14%\n25%\n28%\n28%\n2016\n2017\n2018\n\

    \ hours during planting \nand fertilizer application (Trendov et al., 2019; Kamble\
    \ et al., \n2019). By IoT usage, self-adaptive food supply chains can be \nformed,\
    \ in which objects decide, operate, and learn continu-\nously and autonomously\
    \ (Verdouw et al., 2016).  \nBrewster et al. (2017) emphasized setting up Large\
    \ scale pi-\nlot plants (LSPs) based on IoT by identifying technological \nand\
    \ Agri-food requirements and describing sectoral and tech-\nnical challenges.\
    \ Design and description of four agri-food do-\nmains LSP (dairy, meat, arable,\
    \ fruit, and vegetable supply \nchain) based on IoT are provided. This provided\
    \ a detailed ac-\ncount of the most appropriate IoT technologies in the agri-\n\
    food sector and their applications and the key performance in-\ndicators to assess\
    \ the proposed LSP's performance in a quan-\ntifiable manner. Kittipanya-ngam\
    \ & Tan (2020) studied IoT \nusage to export Thai Jasmine rice and organic rice\
    \ to global \nmarkets and reach consumers, both B2B and B2C, a major \ndownstream\
    \ challenge. There were safety and quality issues in \nthe upstream case, where\
    \ real-time data availability and trans-\nparency through IoT resolved it. Verdouw\
    \ et al. (2016) pro-\nposed architecture for enabling information systems imple-\n\
    mentation by analyzing virtual supply chains from \na perspective of IoT and usage\
    \ of architecture in the fish sup-\nply chain for 'Proof of concept'. Based on\
    \ online operational \ndata, a basis for optimization, simulation, and decision\
    \ support \nof the virtual supply chain is expected to be established. Ac-\ncorsi\
    \ et al. (2017) discussed goals and strategies for IoT design \nand formation,\
    \ which aid in Food Supply Chain planning, \nmanagement, and control. An IoT paradigm\
    \ embedded simu-\nlation gaming tool was also proposed and elucidated, reflect-\n\
    ing the pros and cons of the 'physical food ecosystems' direct \nintegration into\
    \ a computerized environment virtually. Cui \n(2018) proposed cold chain traceability\
    \ system architecture by \nconducting systematic research in supply chain characteristics\
    \ \nfor IoT and its role in innovation. Competences needed to im-\nprove supply\
    \ chain resilience are reinforced with the decision-\nmaking model. In this system,\
    \ the knowledge database in the \nIoT environment is the key to the firm's contingency\
    \ manage-\nment to make necessary improvements. Related staff and links \nof the\
    \ supply chain also need to be activated to enhance the \nsupply chain resilience\
    \ capabilities.  \nAmandeep et al. (2017) developed a novel design approach \n\
    for smart farming using IoT and automation to increase \nproductivity. A remote-controlled\
    \ GPS-based vehicle helps \nmonitor fields to prevent thefts, sensing soil moisture\
    \ content, \nsensing soil moisture, spraying composts & insecticides, \nweeding,\
    \ etc. Smart warehouse management is also enforced \nwith the sensing of the stored\
    \ products' temperature and hu-\nmidity and the detection of missing products\
    \ in the warehouse. \nA smart device with interfacing sensors and internet connec-\n\
    tivity will monitor operations and control, and Zigbee modules \nwith a micro-controller\
    \ will execute operations. Zhang et al. \n(2017) addressed the challenges in the\
    \ perishable supply chain \nbased on IoT captured real-time data using a conceptual\
    \ model \nusing two-echelon supply hubs. These hubs, which act as sup-\nply chain\
    \ dominators, react to the real-time data acquired from \nan IoT-enabled supply\
    \ chain operational process providing in-\nformation on public warehousing and\
    \ logistic services. Lu et \nal. (2019) studied the multi-tag spot collision evasion\
    \ in IoT \ntechnology for the \"connected objects\" feature to offer data \nfrom\
    \ processing to sales, tracking each link in a process flow, \nfinding the food\
    \ source and product flow effectively. Alonso \net al. (2019) presented a platform\
    \ for IoT application, Artifi-\ncial Intelligence, Edge Computing (EC), and BCT\
    \ in smart \nfarming environments, using the new global edge computing \narchitecture.\
    \ It was also developed for real-time monitoring of \nthe cattle and feed grain\
    \ and to ensure the sustainability and \ntraceability of various production processes\
    \ (Mor et al., 2019).  \nKamble et al. (2019) worked on the food retailing scenario,\
    \ \nincreasing complexity in pressurizing the retailing firms to in-\ncorporate\
    \ the changing consumer behavior and re-design their \nmarketing strategies. IoT\
    \ is predicted to control the food prod-\nuct quality, plan waste management of\
    \ shelf life exceeded \nitems, manage the store, freezer, and other equipment\
    \ temper-\natures contributing to reduced energy consumption. Despite \nIoT's\
    \ potential in food retails, its adoption is still in its emer-\ngent stage. Therefore,\
    \ various barriers were identified that af-\nfect IoT adoption at the retail level\
    \ in the Indian context. \nElavarasi et al. (2019) reduced the fresh fruits spoilage\
    \ and \nwastage using IoT, which continuously monitors the produce. \nTracking\
    \ fruit quality throughout the process was done by us-\ning contact and non-contact\
    \ sensors and smart logistics usage. \nMQ3 sensors were used to detect fruit spoilage\
    \ and send mes-\nsages to operators' mobile, and he removes the spoiled pro-\n\
    duce by using a pick and place robot. Pal and Kant (2018) \naimed to improve the\
    \ distribution efficiency, transportation, \nand removal of sour products from\
    \ the supply chain using cen-\ntralized data collection and analysis techniques\
    \ in IoT-based \nmechanisms. This reduced food wastage by analyzing produce \n\
    characteristics like flavor emissions, color, etc.  \nNirenjena et al. (2018)\
    \ utilized advanced IoT to observe nu-\ntritive qualities and nourishment levels\
    \ in food substances to \nindicate contamination and degradation in foods throughout\
    \ \nthe supply chain. A WASPTOME sensor gathers food degra-\ndation information,\
    \ and an alert is sent to manufacturers and \nconsumers by the raspberry pi unit.\
    \ GPS and temperature sen-\nsors are also used in combination with WASPTOME and\
    \ rasp-\nberry pi unit. Wadhwa et al. (2018) proposed architecture to \nimplement\
    \ enabling information systems from an IoT perspec-\ntive in virtual supply chains.\
    \ Matsumoto et al. (2017) devel-\noped a simulation-based on the information of\
    \ IoT on culti-\nvated fields to perform an advanced evaluation of business by\
    \ \nconsidering insufficient stock and crop loss has given an un-\nreliable amount\
    \ of harvest. Prosanjeet et al. (2016) worked on \nincreasing agricultural production\
    \ by optimally using re-\nsources and continuous monitoring using remote monitoring\
    \ \nsystems based on IoT protocol. For re-programmability and \nreduction of expenses,\
    \ the use of a microcontroller and \nESP8266 was proposed. Khattab et al. (2016)\
    \ presented an \nIoT-based three-layer architecture for precision agriculture,\
    \ \nwhich collects data needed and relays it to a cloud-based \nbackend for processing\
    \ and analysis. Front end nodes receive \nfeedback actions based on the analyzed\

    \ (AI) \nAI is a technique that aids in tasks and processes' automation \nby recreating\
    \ human-like cognitive abilities (Barnewold and \nLottermoser, 2020). For agri-food\
    \ applications, AI techniques \ncan provide essential contributions to identifying\
    \ service cre-\nation, knowledge models, and decision-making processes. In \n\
    agriculture, AI has three broad categories: agricultural robot-\nics, crop and\
    \ soil monitoring & predictive analytics (Guru-\nmurthy and Bharthur, 2019; Lezoche\
    \ et al., 2020). Moreover, \nAI-augmented farms can robotically alter crop amounts\
    \ for \nsupply & demand data, making earth cycles more resilient \n(Valentini\
    \ et al., 2019). In the case of fresh produce, AI helps \nestimate shelf life,\
    \ reducing guesswork, reducing wastage of \nfood as there are improved planning\
    \ and inventory manage-\nment (Payne, 2019). AI has applications in the food industry,\
    \ \nlike food item segmentation, ensuring stability in FSC, im-\nproving food\
    \ delivery (Abhijit, 2019). Machine learning \n(ML), deep learning, and neural\
    \ networks help solve complex \nproblems, and the human level concerning reasoning,\
    \ speech, \nand vision is the benchmark for AI (Singh et al., 2020). ML is \n\
    an AI-based application around the concept that machines \nshould be given data\
    \ access and allowed to learn by them-\nselves using structured historical information\
    \ (Barnewold and \nLottermoser, 2020; Donatelli and Pisante, 2019; Sharma et al.,\
    \ \n2019). Machine learning models can be used for business de-\ncision-making\
    \ by predicting the backorder of products with \nmore flexibility, process clarity,\
    \ higher accuracy (Islam and \nAmin 2020), and demand forecasting due to their\
    \ learning \nability and finding data patterns (Tavana, 2016). Automated \nreasoning,\
    \ multi-agent systems, semantic web, autonomous \nsystems, natural language understanding,\
    \ and decision-mak-\ning are other AI applications. \nTable 2. Studies on AI \n\

    \ \n3.4. Robotics \nRobotics and autonomous systems (RAS) are presented in \n\
    the economy depicting low productivity like agri-food (Duck-\nett et al., 2018).\
    \ The technology aims to reduce and replace \nintense human efforts and produce\
    \ significant mini and macro-\nscale productions. Productivity has seen massive\
    \ amplifica-\ntion with the usage of robotic technologies. According to Mar-\n\
    kets and Markets, the agricultural robots' market is estimated \nto grow from\
    \ USD 4.6 billion in 2020 to USD 20.3 billion by \n2025. The compound annual growth\
    \ rate (CAGR) rises at \n34.5% from 2020 to 2025 (Markets and Markets, 2017).\
    \ The \nrobots perform various agriculture operations autonomously, \nensuring\
    \ that the adverse climatic and soil conditions have less \nor no effect on production\
    \ and better precision (Talaviya et al., \n2020). Drones are used in agriculture\
    \ to monitor crop health, \nequipment, weed recognition, and disaster control.\
    \ Also, pes-\nticides and herbicides can be sprayed effectively with drones' \n\
    aid, and plants can be monitored (Talaviya et al., 2020). These \nalso benefit\
    \ the supply chain by creating soil maps that aid in \ndamage control (Kirova\
    \ et al., 2019). Trendov et al. (2019) \nreported the usage of small robots for\
    \ replacing high mass \ntractors. Todorova and Tcacenco (2019) stated unmanned\
    \ aer-\nial vehicles (UAV) as the agricultural sector's most progres-\nsive and\
    \ prospective trend and elaborated on drone usage's \npros and cons. Robinson\
    \ (2017) reported using autonomous \ndelivery robots, which move at a speed of\
    \ four miles per hour \nand have nine cameras and ultrasonic sensors embedded\
    \ inside \nthem, enabling faster delivery and reducing human interfer-\nence.\
    \ Rigorous research is needed in the agri-food as there is \nmuch variability,\
    \ need for sensitive handling. \n3.5. Blockchain Technology \nIt is a technological\
    \ concept evolved from Bitcoin (Dujak \nand Sajter, 2019). It also finds food\
    \ security applications, \nsafety, integrity, and waste reduction in the present\
    \ complex \nfood supply chains, including numerous actors like farmers, \nshipping\
    \ companies, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. \nTraditional supply chains\
    \ are highly inefficient and unreliable, \nwhere there is a high risk, trust issues,\
    \ and complexity between \nbuyers and sellers during the value exchange involving\
    \ mas-\nsive paper settlement. There is an increment in overall transfer \ncost,\
    \ and transactions are fraud vulnerable involving interme-\ndiaries, making the\
    \ cost of operating the supply chain increase, \namounting to 2/3rd of the final\
    \ cost of goods (Kamilaris et al., \n2019). Food provenance can be traced with\
    \ blockchain tech-\nnology (BCT), which helps create food supply chains with \n\
    trust (Xiong et al., 2020; Dujak and Sajter, 2019). Blockchain \nfacilitates the\
    \ digital traceability and authentication of food \nproducts throughout the entire\
    \ supply chain, from suppliers to \nstore shelves and finally to end consumers\
    \ (Tijan et al., 2019). \nBlockchain is proving its prominence for hitching transpar-\n\
    ency and solving the problems in scenarios where some re-\nsource distribution\
    \ involves numerous untrusted actors. It also \naids in automatically matching\
    \ real-time data, avoiding man-\nual checks and duplication, reducing documentation\
    \ work to \na fifth of the time. The origin of goods and the environmental \n\
    footprint of production can also be harnessed. Traceability \ntags in BCT can\
    \ efficiently attain tag source verification, in-\nformation, and ownership (Liu\
    \ and Li, 2020). \nKamilaris et al. (2019) represented an example of a digitized\
    \ \nsupply chain using QR codes, RFID, digital signatures, sen-\nsors, etc., supported\
    \ by blockchain. Every action along the \nsupply chain is recorded in blockchain\
    \ blocks where the inter-\nnet/web serves as a connecting bridge. Businesses validate\
    \ the \ninformation in blocks as it passes through the chains forming \nimmutable\
    \ means to store information, becoming a permanent \nrecord (Kamilaris et al.,\

    \ \nresolving food safety and security issues, giving an account of \nfood freshness\
    \ and the origin of food (Athauda and Karmakar, \n2019). Bottani et al. (2017)\
    \ dealt with the RFID logistics pilot \nIII (RLP3) project that focused on RFID\
    \ deployment and IT \ninfrastructure development for real-time data management\
    \ in \nfresh produce supply. Benefits of the supply chain were as-\nsessed with\

    shopfloor management systems in fresh food retailing. RFID \nhas potential applications\
    \ in shrinkage reduction and optimi-\nzation of shelf inventory levels of products.\
    \ Mondal et al. \n(2019) developed an architecture utilizing sensor-based-RFID\
    \ \nat the physical film and BCT at the cyber film. RFID delivers \nunique identification,\
    \ sensor aids in monitoring real-time \nquality, and BCT creates digital databases\
    \ tamper-proof. De-\ntailed security analysis for cyber-attacks investigated the\

    \ the effect of the available \nshrinkage recovery rate and ordering rate on the\
    \ warehouse \ncosts and investigating the RFID adoption. It is mainly de-\npendent\
    \ on the cost of deprivation, error severity, and shrink-\nage recovery rate.\
    \ Arnaud and Costa (2020) developed Ultra-\nlow-cost RFID-based sensors that sense\
    \ nodes and loggers to \ncollect data on food production and logistics using IoT.\
    \ An \napplication-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was used to en-\nhance semi-active\
    \ low-frequency sensor transponder reading \nup to a distance of a few meters.\
    \ It was fabricated in 0.6μm \nhigh voltage- complementary metal oxide semiconductor\
    \ \n(HV-CMOS), which reported a portable reader presence up to \n5m. Karuppuswami\
    \ et al. (2019) presented a 'near-field wire-\nless thin-film coated RFID compatible\
    \ sensor tag' for evaluat-\ning the volatility of packed food at room temperature,\
    \ and the \nsensor tags having polyaniline, coated as thin-film on the in-\nterdigitated\
    \ capacitor. In the direct-wired structure, conductiv-\nity is measured across\
    \ the film by introducing ammonia gas at \ndifferent concentrations in an enclosed\
    \ chamber. An inductor-\ncapacitor resonant tank is formed by soldering an inductor\
    \ \nacross the interdigitated capacitor in the wireless configura-\ntion. The\
    \ proposed sensor is a highly sensitive sensor detect-\ning ammonia as low as\
    \ 3 PPM, and it can be easily adapted \nacross the supply chain to monitor packaged\
    \ food quality. \nParada et al. (2019) designed the RFID food management \n(RFM)\
    \ system in the IoT network paradigm to bring in healthy \neating habits and help\
    \ in the fight against food wastage. RFM \nis composed of a multi-platform application\
    \ to process real-\ntime RFID information.  \nA web-based application is also\
    \ developed to allow users \nabout food expiry and other details. Recipes that\
    \ can be pre-\npared with foods available are also shown along with nutri-\ntional\
    \ information, preventing wastage. This embedded sys-\ntem may economically benefit\
    \ the manufacturer as it permits \nsuperstores to pay for advertising the items.\
    \ Barge et al. (2019) \nevaluated composition, food product temperature, and the\
    \ mu-\ntual label-reader orientation role in RFID tag identification \nperformances.\
    \ Findings show that reading ranges critical food \nproduct identification by\
    \ UHF RFID (Ultra-high frequency \nRFID) systems can be assessed and improvised\
    \ for the food \ncomposition directly from the design phase. Fan et al. (2019)\
    \ \nimproved the traceability in the bidirectional transformation \nof barcode-RFID,\
    \ an effective traceable resource unit (TRUs). \nYiying et al. (2019) developed\
    \ a food traceability system for \na complete life cycle, using RFID, which ensures\
    \ full supervi-\nsion from source to consumer. The RFID fault tolerance mech-\n\
    anism confirmed system practicability. This design ensured \nfood safety, especially\
    \ in perishable foods like meat. A sensor \nwas developed to evaluate the food\
    \ expiry date, which con-\ntains an RFID tag and a conductive polymer. It operates\
    \ on the \nprinciple that the conductivity of polymer changes on expo-\nsure to\
    \ spoiled foods and is detected as an RFID signal by the \nreader (Honari et al.,\
    \ (2018). Saggin et al. (2019) introduced a \nflexible UHF-RFID sensor to detect\
    \ the food quality with an \ninterdigitated capacity in a vegetal biopolymer layer\
    \ deposited \nRFID antenna. Experimental measurements validated this \nstudy by\
    \ exposing it to the environment of real food gas in \ndegradation. Yuan et al.\
    \ (2018) focused on designing and sim-\nulating wearable RFID patches to sense\
    \ food spoilage and read \ntemperature information using near field communication\
    \ tech-\nnology supporting devices.  \nKaruppuswami et al. (2018) developed an\
    \ antibody-free bi-\nosensor to rapidly detect pathogenic bacteria in milk using\
    \ \ndextrin capped gold nanoparticles (d-AuNP). These sensors \ncan perceive microbes\
    \ count as low as 5 log CFU/ml in an \nhour and is compatible with RFID tag making\
    \ them useful in \nthe food chain. Chetanraj et al. (2017) described the block\
    \ di-\nagram and the RFID communication protocol and advantages \nover WSN. This\
    \ technology helps detect spoiled food during \nlong-distance transportation leading\
    \ to losses and rejections \nby the consumer. Dabbene et al. (2016) studied the\
    \ challenges \nand opportunities of adopting RFID for food traceability in \n\
    food supply chains and its applications in warehouses, retail \nmanagement, intelligent\
    \ packaging, cold chain monitoring, lo-\ngistics, etc. Alfian et al. (2020) proposed\
    \ machine learning \nmodels to detect passive RFID tags' direction to improve\
    \ the \ntraceability system's efficiency, which is more needed in per-\nishable\
    \ products. Received signal strength (RSS) and tags \ntimestamp depict input features.\
    \ Xiao et al. (2017) explored \nRFID applications in food warehouse management\
    \ and stor-\nage. RFID process simulation model reported increased store \nmanagement\
    \ efficiency with RFID application when com-\npared with previous technology.\
    \ Fathi et al. (2020) empha-\nsized introducing chipless RFID sensors for temperature,\

    \ were also highlighted, \nproviding future research direction. Li et al. (2017)\

    \ Polyaniline coated capac-\nitive sensor works as a sensing element with a higher\
    \ affinity \nfor ammonia.  \nAmong the two methods, direct probing was found as\
    \ more \nstable as it can detect a minimum of ammonia of 3 ppm with \n30 min response\
    \ time and 60 min recovery time. Zhang et al. \n(2020) focused on the whole dairy\
    \ tracking system, as there \nare increased safety and quality concerns in the\
    \ dairy industry \nlike leather milk and melamine incidents. RFID is the most\
    \ \neffective and viable method, and its application needs to be \nput forth across\
    \ supply chains shortly. Alfian et al. (2017) rec-\nommended an e-pedigree food\
    \ traceability method to use \nRFID technology, WSN, for temperature and humidity\
    \ data \ncollection. This approach was tested on Korea's Kimchi sup-\nply chain,\
    \ and increased customer satisfaction and optimized \nfood distribution were observed.\
    \ Miao et al. (2018) proposed \na rice traceability system for agricultural products\
    \ and real-\ntime using RFID and WSN. Collected rice growth environ-\nment data\
    \ was transmitted through the CC2530 wireless mod-\nule. RFID was used to trace\
    \ rice harvest information, transpor-\ntation, storage, and engineering aspects\
    \ of supporting \na traceability database for agri-food products. The usage of\
    \ \ntechnologies, in combination with each other, might amelio-\nrate them with\
    \ increased advantages.  \nSobral et al. (2018) enhanced the IoT application perfor-\n\
    mance by integrating RFID with WSNs through Fuzzy Q-Al-\ngorithm to improve an\
    \ anti-collision protocol for RFID and \nthe Fuzzy System-Based Route Classifier.\
    \ RFID tag's identi-\nfication performance improvement, lowered packet loss rates,\
    \ \ndecreased energy consumption by nodes, and improved net-\nwork load balancing\
    \ was significantly observed, thus provid-\ning better energy efficacy and service\
    \ quality for IoT applica-\ntions. Desai et al. (2019) developed an architecture\
    \ where \nblockchain technology as value-added services was integrated \ninto\
    \ an IoT-based product tracing & tracking solution by test-\ning and implementing\
    \ it on the NIMBLE-B2B platform. With \nthis approach, small & medium enterprises\
    \ control the data \nand can be benefitted from flexible scalability and cost.\
    \ Alfian \net al. (2019) proposed using machine learning algorithms to \nfilter\
    \ false positives generated by RFID. These models also \nhelped in successfully\
    \ classifying RFID outcomes with high \nprecision and assimilating for detecting\
    \ the outlier. \n4. Sustainable Agri-Food Industry and Digital \nTechnologies\
    \ \nAgricultural sustainability can be supported by the digital \nmarketplace,\
    \ which can act as a platform for financial technol-\nogy (FinTech), which aid\
    \ in innovating crowdfunding and \npayment systems in a broader agriculture ecosystem\
    \ that pro-\nmotes empowerment, transparency, and resourcefulness (An-\nshari\
    \ et al., 2019). Precision agriculture, which uses digital \ntechnologies, has\
    \ environmental benefits of addressing cli-\nmate change, improving resource efficiency,\
    \ and toxin reduc-\ntion (Claap et al., 2020).  Blockchain forms sustainable supply\
    \ \nchain networks that are economical as these reduce transaction \ncosts, business\
    \ waste, and time utilized by decreasing the \nnumber of tiers in the chain and\
    \ reducing human errors (Ward \n2017). Environmental supply chain sustainability\
    \ is ensured \nby reducing resource consumption and greenhouse emissions \nby\
    \ reducing rework and recall practices by identifying sub-\nstandard products\
    \ (Saberi et al., 2019). It makes information \nstable and immutable, ensures\
    \ food safety, and provides ade-\nquate information infrastructure to manage all\
    \ humanitarian \neventualities at the field level, which aids in building a socially\
    \ \nsustainable supply chain (Rejeb et al., 2020). Concerning the \nthree sustainability\
    \ dimensions, blockchain and mobile tech-\nnology seem to have the highest economic\
    \ impact. The sensors \nand actuators, followed by AI, big data analytics, and\
    \ cloud \ntechnology, have the highest impact on the environmental sus-\ntainability\
    \ dimension. In contrast, cloud technology and big \ndata analytics seem to impact\
    \ the social sustainability dimen-\nsion (Bai et al., 2020). \n \n \n5. Conclusions\
    \ \nFood safety, security, traceability concerns in the agri-food \nneed to be\
    \ predicted and prevented rather than reacting and \nresponding as people are\
    \ more concerned about health nowa-\ndays. Digitization remains a perfect way\
    \ out for all these is-\nsues with reducing human interference and provides food\
    \ \nmonitoring along the supply chain, which is highly impossible \nfor humans.\
    \ Thus, there is a need for science-based decision-\nmaking and advanced technology\
    \ usage, which helps supply \nchains, especially food, safer and more secure,\
    \ with better \ntraceability and accountability. Digital technologies help to\
    \ \ndevelop efficient agri-food supply chains in varied ways, i.e., \nRFID can\
    \ sense the food environment; big data can help ana-\nlyze vast info in a fraction\
    \ of seconds; IoT is a combination of \ndifferent technologies; robots can automate\
    \ work. Robots can \nreduce human interference; AI can think independently and\
    \ \nact accordingly. The usage and generalization of such high-\nend technologies\
    \ are needed in the agri-food sector. Thus, \nthere seems to be a vast scope of\
    \ research in the area, such as: \na) The cost associated with data acquisition\
    \ remains signif-\nicantly high in data-driven agriculture, acting as a barrier\
    \ \nfor IoT and AI usage in agriculture. This indicates there \nis a need for\
    \ innovation in inexpensive sensing technol-\nogies. \nb) Cybersecurity is the\
    \ main concerning IoT issue, and data \nsecurity breaches in big data could be\
    \ incurable to busi-\nnesses. \nc) BCT application to the full extent of food\
    \ supply chain \nmanagement needs to be done to remove significant bar-\nriers.\
    \ \nd) A combination of one or more technologies would be \nmore promising, providing\
    \ a featured supply chain that \ncomplies with all food needs. \ne) Integrating\
    \ technologies like blockchain with IoT can \ncomplement the usage by providing\
    \ a reliable and trace-\nable service. \nf) There are also difficulties associated\
    \ with bringing all \nstakeholders on board and a lack of regulations in imple-\n\
    mentation. \nVASAVI DADI ET AL. / PRODUCTION ENGINEERING ARCHIVES 2021, 27(2),\

    \ are helping to make water management smarter\nand optimizing consumption in\
    \ the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology\nof sensor\
    \ nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efﬁcient components, such as\
    \ water level,\nsoil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally,\
    \ to guarantee good performance\nof the system, the used transmission module is\
    \ based on LoRa LPWAN technology. The design of the\nmain circuit board of the\
    \ system is optimized by combining two layers and implementing software\noptimization.\
    \ The overall sensor network is developed and tested in the research lab, and\
    \ real farms\ncan be controlled by users manually or automatically using the mobile\
    \ application. Experimental\nresults are produced by testing sensor and communication\
    \ link effectiveness, and are subsequently\nvalidated in the ﬁeld through a one-week\
    \ measurement campaign.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); water management;\
    \ smart agriculture; LoRa; LPWAN; sensor\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) technology, which is known as the center of the Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ has continuously grown in recent years. An advantage of WSNs is their ability\
    \ to easily\ndeﬁne a network of devices that can be communicated with and gathered\
    \ from a monitored ﬁeld\nthrough communication links since the information is\
    \ sent through multiple nodes with a gateway and\nconnected to other networks\
    \ like wireless Ethernet. Many researchers have applied WSNs to different\nresearch\
    \ areas, such as environmental monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, smart cities,\
    \ smart education,\nhealthcare, agricultural control, water quality monitoring,\
    \ military uses, and asset management [1–9].\nAccordingly, WSNs are suitable for\
    \ multiple applications. The long range (LoRa) LPWAN is one\nnovel IoT communication\
    \ technology with an excellent capacity for development that is applied in\nmany\
    \ ﬁelds. The beneﬁts of this technology can be attributed to its capabilities\
    \ of ultra-long-distance\ncommunication, low power consumption, and ease of deployment,\
    \ among others.\nIn agriculture, environmental monitoring is required to control\
    \ speciﬁc plant conditions.\nBy collecting approximate values of available data\
    \ and making more accurate estimates, a WSN\ncan be used to achieve this task.\
    \ In addition, many agriculture researchers apply WSNs to monitor\nenvironmental\
    \ criteria [2–6]. In addition to standard environmental conditions such as temperature,\n\

    \ such as the ability to control the water level or temperature level are\nthe\
    \ subject of research in an agricultural environment [10].\nWater management and\
    \ optimal water supply have become popular topics in the ﬁeld of smart\nagriculture\
    \ and are being studied and developed by many researchers. Over the years, prominent\n\
    researchers in the ﬁeld of smart agriculture have written many survey articles\
    \ which introduce the\nresearch methodology for various communication technologies\
    \ that control resources efﬁciently based\non IoT technology [11–13]. We summarize\
    \ and compare our model with the existing literature in\nTable 1. In Vietnam,\
    \ agricultural production has transformed the country’s socioeconomic status\n\
    by alleviating national food insecurity, reducing poverty, fostering agrarian\
    \ exports, and providing\nlivelihoods to nearly half of the labor force nationwide.\
    \ These are just some examples, since WSN is\nactively applied to various functions\
    \ such as smart cities, waste management, and waste collection\nwith LoRaWan technology\
    \ [14–16].\nTable 1. A comparisons of our model with existing literature.\nModel\n\

    \ work on WSN in smart\nagriculture, clariﬁcations on issues of water management,\
    \ and essential tasks to be completed. Section 3\npresents details of the architecture\
    \ of the IoT proposed system. Section 4 presents the operational tests\ncomposed\
    \ of two different tasks, while Section 5 discusses the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of our\npolicy. Finally, some concluding observations and a way forward are\
    \ offered in Section 6.\n2. Smart Agriculture and Related Works\nAs it possesses\
    \ the advantage of critical natural resources, Vietnam is an agricultural country\
    \ that\nis growing very quickly. Agriculture plays an essential role in the Vietnamese\
    \ economy and contributes\nto the country’s economic development currently and\
    \ in the future. Agriculture is one of the critical\nindustrial sectors of Vietnam,\
    \ and economic growth depends heavily on agriculture. The population of\nVietnam\
    \ will rise to reach 100 million people by 2020, while the demand for agricultural\
    \ products such\nas food crops (e.g., sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, and corn)\
    \ rice, coffee, pepper, cashew nut, rubber,\ntea, fruit, and vegetables continues\
    \ to increase dramatically. Combined with the effects of climate\nchange, these\
    \ demands place even more strain upon land, water, energy, and other resources\
    \ that are\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n3 of 22\nalready inﬂuenced. Several\
    \ smart solutions can be co-optimized and scaled up to improve yields and\nmeet\
    \ growing food production demands while transporting power and water resources\
    \ efﬁciently [17].\nMany articles depict the close relationship between smart\
    \ agriculture and IoT/WSN.\nResearchers focus on how this high-tech improvement\
    \ can be employed to develop effective smart\nsystems and data transmission [8,18].\n\
    The authors of [18] present a SmartFarmNet framework, based on the IoT platform\
    \ that can\nautomate the collection of environmental, fertilizer, soil, and irrigation\
    \ data; automatically correlate\nthat data and evaluate product performance; and\
    \ calculate product estimates and suggest speciﬁc\nproducts for any particular\
    \ farm. Importantly, IoT devices can be integrated into this platform as\nsensors,\
    \ cameras, and weather stations. Produced data can then be saved in the cloud\
    \ to enable\nperformance analysis and and recommendations.\nWith the help of IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4, which is a suite of high-level communication technology, artiﬁcial\n\
    intelligence, and decision support technology, the authors of [19] have developed\
    \ research on the\nagricultural application of IoT technology to monitor real-time\
    \ moisture and nutrients of citrus, along\nwith an analysis of the combination\
    \ of fertilizer support systems and irrigation. However, this research\nhas weaknesses,\
    \ which include system complexity and high costs. The authors of [20] also present\n\
    a narrow-band radio channel model whereby the communication link transfers under\
    \ near-ground\nrequirements for a smart agriculture platform.\nThe solution presented\
    \ in [21] was developed by implementing machine learning applications\non agriculture\
    \ datasets for smart farm improvement. By employing and comparing numerous\nmachine\
    \ learning methods to recommend the best solution, this system enabled the investigation\n\
    and deployment of useful jobs, varying from crop yield forecasting to missing\
    \ or incorrect sensor\ndata reconstruction. However, the only reasonable application\
    \ for this scenario is smart agriculture,\nsince three different resources are\
    \ available: the CRN scientiﬁc dataset, Istat statistical dataset, and the\nIoT\
    \ sensor manufacturing dataset.\nMany researchers and developers have chosen microcontroller\
    \ boards (e.g., Arduino boards) or\nRaspberry Pi for IoT applications. These allow\
    \ real-time monitoring, collection, data management,\nsecurity, and remote control\
    \ functions using the mobile app because of the suitable platforms available\n\
    for Internet-connected sensor buttons. This option is often challenging because\
    \ it entails a trade-off\nbetween cost, performance, and functionality for each\
    \ speciﬁc application project. Water management\ninvolves a valuable resource.\
    \ If an attacker controlled the system, entire crops could be destroyed\ndue to\
    \ altered irrigation levels. A denial of service (DoS) attack on sensors, irrigation\
    \ actuators,\nor distribution systems could affect system-wide operations. Changes\
    \ to sensor settings may also\nissue a warning that could cause networks or decision\
    \ producers to perform illegal actions and yield\nmonths of efforts and production\
    \ aims. If an attacker gains control of the actuators, irrigation and\nwater distribution\
    \ may be compromised and result in the incorrect irrigation of certain products.\n\
    Furthermore, eavesdropping may give criminals access to secret data about the\
    \ farm. They could\nremove productivity information and even manipulate the commodity\
    \ business, which represents an\neven more signiﬁcant threat. Self-governing vehicles,\
    \ drones, and engines utilized to collect images or\ncontrol manufacturing must\
    \ also be kept classiﬁed. An unauthorized node in the network can send\nincorrect\
    \ information about a crop. However, the authors only present the challenges to\
    \ security in\nsmart agriculture, and do not discuss how to overcome challenges\
    \ [22].\nA smart agriculture system was constructed to use low-power Bluetooth\
    \ and LPWAN\ncommunication technologies, including the wire-based communication\
    \ technology used in the existing\nfarm in [23]. This was combined with microcontrollers\
    \ such as an Arduino UNO board or Raspberry Pi\nboard. The administrator receives\
    \ data from sensor connections, and then stores the data, analyzes it,\nand provides\
    \ a user interface to monitor it. A related study [24] explains how an approach\
    \ to using IoT\nand cloud computing that incorporates development is helping to\
    \ quickly modernize agriculture and\nto realize smart solutions for agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, to solve problems regarding more practical issues\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n4 of 22\nrelated to farmers, sensors can be applied for use\
    \ in the IoT system. Furthermore, 2G and 3G wireless\nbroadband networks can be\
    \ used for communication between other components in the IoT system.\nSeveral\
    \ enabling technologies are adapted to present smart platform projects, which\
    \ are able\nto collect and manage data handling problems related to water management\
    \ in smart agriculture.\nFor example, the SWAMP project is a platform architecture\
    \ that includes a scenario-based development\nprocess for the obtained systems\
    \ in [25]. Moreover, the platform develops and assesses smart water\nmanagement\
    \ for precision irrigation in agriculture with a practical method based on four\
    \ pilots in\nBrazil, Italy, and Spain. The structure of SWAMP can be developed\
    \ for different solutions to deal\nwith the requirements of different contexts,\
    \ countries, climates, soils, and crops. Indeed, considerable\nﬂexibility is required\
    \ to adapt to a range of deployment conﬁgurations, including a diverse mix of\n\
    technologies. Unfortunately, for this platform, it is not possible to use without\
    \ the license and to do\nthis. The different IoT smart platforms presented in\
    \ [26] propose the use of cloud-based technology\nto manage the collection, analysis,\
    \ and forecast of agricultural environmental information in one\nuniversal system.\
    \ Besides the introduction of the platform, the author of the paper also presented\
    \ LoRa\ncommunication and applied it to the studied network, and although details\
    \ were not provided on the\nhardware used to do this. In summary, both studies\
    \ presented interesting suggestions and suitable\nplatforms for application to\
    \ smart agriculture.\nOther authors have focused on completing a systematic literature\
    \ review of IoT research and\ndeployments in protected agriculture over the past\
    \ ten years, in which they evaluate the contributions\nmade by various researchers\
    \ and organizations. Moreover, the structure of IoT is also detailed in\nprotected\
    \ agriculture, including the used platforms, modern wireless technologies, cloud\
    \ computing,\nmachine learning, big data, animal farming, hardware, software challenges,\
    \ and so on [27].\nAnother paper [28] proposes an IoT idea-based solution for\
    \ smart farming, where the authors\nproposed stack and discuss the current improvements.\n\
    They mainly focus on the IoT/M2M\ninteraction and explain the design and development\
    \ of a gateway that discusses the provided\nservices. Notably, in [29], the Web\
    \ of Things (WoT) was proposed as an idea to use environmental\nmonitoring and\
    \ enhance agricultural practices by supporting decision-making based on bio-data\n\
    collection. The paper brieﬂy presents the original design, which is a middleware\
    \ platform for IoT\nthat performs separation by understanding opportunistic networking\
    \ and computing operations.\nAccordingly, it is able to detect and control environmental\
    \ targets using web-based technologies.\nMeanwhile, the use of IoT for smart precision\
    \ agriculture for rural areas is proposed in [30]. In this\npaper, the authors\
    \ focus on a scalable network architecture for real-time monitoring of agriculture\
    \ in\nrural areas. A possible strategy is to optimize each element of the system\
    \ to reduce system latency\nup to a particular area. A solution [31] was proposed\
    \ by implementing a framework for managing,\ninvestigating, and sharing groundwater\
    \ data, with the use of sensors to gather data on groundwater\nlevels, pump sensors,\
    \ and weather conditions.\nIn [32], electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis is presented\
    \ as an enhanced monitoring approach for\nsubsurface radio wave propagation and\
    \ underground sensing applications in the ﬁeld of prediction\nagriculture. However,\
    \ this technology is challenging to implement in complex real environments,\n\
    which may delay system deployment. The prediction of the agriculture model presented\
    \ by [33]\noffers solution management capabilities by monitoring soil conditions\
    \ in real time using underground\nwireless sensors. Furthermore, the structure\
    \ used two types of communication links, above-ground\nand underground, for the\
    \ experiments. However, other challenges need to be solved, such as reducing\n\
    energy loss and promoting energy efﬁciency. These nodes should be able to adapt\
    \ to the soil moisture\nand temperature changes of the environment, among others.\n\
    More recently, the authors in [8] proposed an irrigation system that combines\
    \ IoT and data\nanalysis for the collection of environment data and control of\
    \ the farm via web and mobile applications.\nHowever, this article faced challenges\
    \ in controlling water in the farm. After analyzing state-of-the-art\nresearch\
    \ on water management and smart agriculture that applies IoT and related technology,\n\
    the following outcomes are drawn:\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n5 of 22\n\
    •\nMany popular systems and platforms can be used for water management in smart\
    \ agriculture,\nbut may be too expensive for the average farmer [28–31].\n•\n\
    The combination of multiple technologies in one system and the presence of limitations\
    \ leads to\ncomplexity when combining proprietary technologies. Moreover, many\
    \ factors affect the price\n(e.g., farm, hardware design, and guiding documentation),\
    \ although a basic package costs a\nminimum of $500 in [28–31].\n•\nAll IoT smart\
    \ agriculture solutions on the market are Most IoT smart agriculture products\
    \ are\npassive methods (i.e., manual). In some cases, they are connected to farm\
    \ monitoring devices to\nact smartly.\n•\nMany researchers have presented solutions\
    \ for smart agriculture systems. However, these\nmethods are restricted by the\
    \ design-embedded board and the inﬂexibility of devices, as it\nmay be necessary\
    \ to attach additional sensors or to control two or more farms with the same\n\
    mobile application.\nTherefore, we proposal a novel system to address the four\
    \ above points:\n1.\nThe standard IoT water management system is explained and\
    \ designed. It can connect to the\nInternet through LoRa communication both manually\
    \ and automatically with all hardware\ndesigns. The IoT box is designed to manage\
    \ the IoT devices and obtain data from the farms.\n2.\nA system is possible connected\
    \ the agriculture from farming based on rural areas efﬁciency\nto IoT system.\
    \ Additionally, the implemented system is a good alternative for analyzing the\n\
    communication between the gateway and nodes 1 and 2.\n3.\nOur smart watering system\
    \ receives real-time data input from sensors embedded in a farm tunnel\nand other\
    \ locations. The system then offers suggestions for watering schedules and capacity.\n\
    An advantage provided by the sensors, used for two farms, are the transmission\
    \ of an evaluation\nto the user’s mobile application, from where users can prepare\
    \ a watering plan for the farms.\n4.\nFinally, our smart watering system is scheduled\
    \ to a date and time which guarantees that the\nwater level falls below the threshold\
    \ in the tunnel farm. The system notiﬁes the user and switches\non the water pump\
    \ (manual or automatic) in time to water the plants.\n3. System Architecture\n\
    The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the real-time monitoring of\
    \ water management\nthat optimizes power consumption.\nAn additional target is\
    \ a cost-saving in smart agriculture.\nThe critical element that affects energy\
    \ dissipation in the sensor nodes is the transmitting module.\nAs a design operation,\
    \ it focuses on the structure of the sensor node and the meaning of the network\n\
    sensor architecture. Finally, the determination of effective data transfer technology\
    \ is geared towards\nimplementing an energy-efﬁcient sensor node. The details\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.1.\nHowever, most of the smart agriculture ﬁeld if\
    \ the data are the crucial importance in the node,\nwhere the users could be easily\
    \ chosen by operating more comfortable components. Therefore,\nthe micro-controller\
    \ must be selected to guarantee a suitable trade-off between energy efﬁciency\n\
    and complexity. Finally, elements must be selected to consider the optimal agreement\
    \ between\nmeasured data accuracy, expected energy to carry out that task, and\
    \ price, thus prioritizing the use of\nsensors. As a result, the power of the\
    \ sensors becomes an important factor for energy consumption\nand longevity. The\
    \ proposed IoT node in our system is constructed following these requirements.\n\
    First, the choice made regarding essential elements is a single-chip micro-controller\
    \ such as an\nATmega328/P or ATmega2560. A reasonable choice is to provide simple\
    \ open-source software to allow\nthe user to observe and boost their conﬁdence\
    \ in the programming. Second, it uses a lower number\nof clock cycles to execute\
    \ instructions than others—all of the sensors and the developed single-board\n\
    microcontroller, where all of the devices are integrated. Third, after reviewing\
    \ the start-of-the-art of\nthe relevant technology, the best option is the LoRa\
    \ technology, as it provides IoT connectivity over\nlarge areas by enabling data\
    \ transmission across an extended range. It uses very little power, is robust\n\
    in a rural area, and uses an overall network architecture that was developed in\
    \ a smart agriculture\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n6 of 22\nsituation.\
    \ Finally, low-cost and low-power sensors were selected to provide an excellent\
    \ balance\nbetween measurement accuracy and energy efﬁciency.\nOur paper introduces\
    \ a reliable, robust, cost-effective, and scalable smart agriculture solution\n\
    based on IoT technology. The architecture system is presented in Figure 1, which\
    \ presents three\nnode prototypes: the gateway, node 1 and sensor node 1, and\
    \ node 2. The ﬂow diagram shown in\nFigure 2 demonstrates how to manage data transmission\
    \ between the gateway, node 1, and node 2 of\nour system.\n•\nThe gateway performs\
    \ the core functions of data collection from the nodes via LoRa, and then\nsends\
    \ data to the cloud, via the WiFi ESP82666 module, and to the mobile application.\
    \ Moreover,\nusers can also control the node throughout the gateway with the use\
    \ of the mobile app.\n•\nNode 1 and sensor node 1 are designed for this case,\
    \ as we assumed that the water pump machine\nis far from the sensor location.\n\
    •\nNode 2 was designed for orchard conditioners, with a topographic condition\
    \ suitable for installing\npumps directly in the farm without separating the sensor\
    \ block.\nFarm 1\nFarm 2\nGateWay\nNode 1\nSensor node 1\nNode 2\nFigure 1. Block\

    this power has to convert toward the expected form with normal voltage range for\
    \ storing power\nsupply to different kinds of devices in the IoT proposed node.\
    \ Based on the requirement of the\npower IoT system that the microcontroller and\
    \ the communication module need 5 V and 3.3 V for\nthe powering system with receive\
    \ node, respectively. It is necessary to include voltage regulators\ninside the\
    \ node. For that reason, two voltage regulators employ a 5 V regulator that powers\
    \ sensors of\nFigures 3–5 and a 3.3 V one which powers the powering system for\

    \ is combined of a LoRa module and WiFi ESP8266 module, and ATmega2560. Figure\

    \ how all device elements are\nconnected: the LoRa transmission module, WiFi ESP8266\
    \ module, ATmega2560, and power system for\nGateway. Figures 6 and 7a show the\
    \ Electronic schematic and Gateway’s prototype, which includes\nthe sub-section\
    \ mentioned as below:\n3.2.1. Transmitter Module\nAs mentioned previously, the\
    \ transmitter module performs a vital concern in energy consumption\noptimization.\
    \ Hence, it has to be precisely selected and prospered. The IoT proposed node\
    \ is proposed\nto be used outside and spread over a rural area. Since radio communication\
    \ link solutions must be\nexplored, this needs to be taken into account. In fact,\
    \ it is unthinkable for something like this to have\na wirework connection (e.g.,\
    \ LAN) in large quantities at each node. An IoT application has many\ncommunication\
    \ networks where the sensor system is proposed. These systems are working based\
    \ on\nvarious radio technologies. Table 2 shows a measurement of the available\
    \ technologies, along with\ntheir essential features. The vital functions such\
    \ as area, consumption, and availability are accentuated\nin this table because\
    \ they are crucial parts for developing the device. After reviewing the technical\n\
    aspects as presented in this paper, the selection for data transmission technology\

    \ 6. Electronic schematic of the Gateway and Node 1.\nConsidering all of these\
    \ previous technologies, there are mean ﬂexible options for the achievement\n\
    of IoT nodes. The most signiﬁcant selection has to be carefully studied as it\
    \ is easy to change\nthe hardware, implementation, and long-lasting quality over\
    \ time. The one recommended in our\narticle, which is a solution for the real-time\
    \ monitoring of controlling the level of water and resulting\nhypothesis, shows\
    \ as:\n•\nThe IoT node system is expected to be deployed for two nodes with the\
    \ distance between two\nnodes being a few km with complex terrain in rural areas.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of the system needs\nto reduce to the lowest level possible,\
    \ and the support services need to be optimized:\n•\nThe coverage of our system\
    \ to around tens of km2;\n•\nThe lower power consumption is composed possibly\
    \ for an adaptive data rate and changes\nthe output bit rate. Moreover, it depends\
    \ on payload combined with chirp spread spectrum\ntechnology that effectively\
    \ gives processing gain. In addition, LoRa Technology can easily plug\ninto existing\
    \ infrastructure and enables low-cost battery-operated IoT applications.\nAfter\
    \ reviewing these simple highlights, it can deﬁne the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\
    \ the leading\nfour communication networks released for the previously outlined:\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n10 of 22\n(a) Gateway\n(b) Node 1\nFigure\
    \ 7. Prototype of the gateway and Node 1.\n•\nLocal Area Networks (LAN): The ad\
    \ hoc’s area coverage is signiﬁcantly more than other carrier\nnetwork technologies.\
    \ However, it still has some disadvantages. Applying the radio technology\nnetwork\
    \ for our system: for instance, WiFi or BLE technology set up, requires a signiﬁcant\
    \ number\nof nodes for the system. It will noticeably change the overall cost\
    \ of the deployed infrastructure.\nA different choice might be to implement a\
    \ ZigBee network or BLE technology. Because the system\nis not energy efﬁcient,\
    \ and admits a signiﬁcant decrease in the power consumption of the\nend device\
    \ nodes, this means that, although their current absorption levels are relatively\
    \ low\n(40 mA [35]), their life expectancy provided by batteries is in some order.\n\
    •\nLow Power Consumption (LPWAN): The authors in [36] proposed characterizing\
    \ great Area\nNetworks LPWAN solutions as their more extensive transmission range\
    \ allows for the\nestablishment of a star or multi-star network with some APs.\
    \ Allowing the sensor node to\nuse the chief duty-cycling policies allows for\
    \ turning off buttons for long periods. Finally, the\nprice of this technology\
    \ is meager when agreeing to use them in large quantities at no extra charge\n\
    as in the situation of ISP co-operation.\n•\nGlobal Area Networks (GAN): The global\
    \ network is the most simple solution to deploy because\nit does not need access\
    \ points or speciﬁc infrastructure implementations. Unfortunately, it has\nmany\
    \ other essential features, the ﬁrst being the price: 3G technologies; still,\
    \ the lowest of different\ntechniques is always more expensive than other solutions.\
    \ Furthermore, SIM is used, so\nthey need subscription payments when preparing\
    \ to deploy many of nodes and become\ninsigniﬁcant. Additionally, the energy consumption\
    \ needs to take into consideration that the\naverage modern consumption of the\
    \ third-generation mobile cellular system is many times higher\nthan that of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [37]. Alternatively, a low-power wide-area network module [38]\n\
    may be considered; however, obtaining it is unsuitable for applications with low\
    \ energy use.\nFinally, in the rural areas, some ISP cannot support the Internet\
    \ service for the users.\n•\nNarrowband-Internet of Things:\nNB-IoT is the novel\
    \ technology with a short form of\nNarrowband-Internet of Things and speciﬁed\
    \ in LTE Release-13 [39]. It is developed to meet\nthe requirements of LPWA (Low-Power\
    \ Wide-Area) networks. NB-IoT has a wide variety of\napplications for many ﬁelds\
    \ such as personal, technology and industrial. The applications are\nwearables,\
    \ smart bicycles, event detectors, smart garbage bins, smart metering, smart agriculture,\n\
    and logistics tracking. Mainly, low power and long-range are the absolute essentials\
    \ for IoT\n(Internet of Things), which is a signiﬁcant concern with mainstream\
    \ cellular technologies.\nThe other advantages of the NB-IoT are scalability,\
    \ quality of service and safety related to\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n\
    11 of 22\nunlicensed LPWA networks and design, including the secure connections\
    \ between small energy\ndevices and a gateway.\nTable 3. Technical speciﬁcations\

    UART\n3.2.2. ATmega2560 Microcontroller\nIn this research, the nodes communicate\
    \ with each other via the UART interface. At the gateway,\nit is necessary to\
    \ use two UARTs (the ﬁrst one communicates with the ESP8266 module, and the other\n\
    one is used to communicate with two nodes. In Node 1, it is also necessary for\
    \ two UART interfaces to\ncollect data from the nodes and the gateway, since the\
    \ ATmega2560 is a reasonable choice [40].\n3.2.3. WiFi ESP8266 Module\nThe WiFi\
    \ ESP8266 module from [41–43] is the best choice because the ESP8266 is very ﬂexible\
    \ in\ndata transfer between devices and mobile applications, easy to integrate\
    \ into advanced projects, and\nadaptable within the Arduino embedded development\
    \ environment.\n3.3. Node 1 and Sensor Node 1\nThe same as in gateway, in this\
    \ node, an AC supply has to be converted towards the demanded\nform with the required\
    \ voltage range for storing power supply to various types of devices. We are\n\
    suggesting that the micro-controller and the transmission module need 5 V for\
    \ the powering system\nwith a receive node each, and it is necessary to incorporate\
    \ voltage regulators inside the node. Therefore,\ntwo voltage regulators use 5\
    \ V and 3.3 V regulators, which power the sensors in Figure 4 and the\npowering\
    \ system for the receiver node.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of Node 1, which\
    \ designs the case. It assumes that the water\npump is placed far away from the\
    \ sensor location since there is a sensor node to collect the data for\nNode 1.\
    \ Node 1 receives the data from sensor Node 1. Based on the sensor values, we\
    \ can deﬁne the\nvalue from the application and the sensors located at Node 1.\
    \ Moreover, in this node, there are two\nprimary sensors, which are the pump temperature\
    \ sensor and water level sensor. LoRa module on\nNode 1 communicates to the Gateway.\
    \ We also use RF HC12, a short-range wireless data transmission\nmodule whose\
    \ primary function is to receive data from sensor Node 1 transmitted to Node 1.\
    \ RFID\nperforms the central feature of controlling the pump directly at Node\
    \ 1 to increase the security of the\nsystem, and LCD is designed to display the\
    \ data of Node 1. Sensor Node 1 in Figure 5 shows the\nﬂowchart of details as\
    \ the node power is an external AC–DC converter with 7 V that gives sufﬁcient\n\
    current to power all the components.\nSection 3.3.1 illustrates the details of\
    \ the ATmega328 microcontroller and the sensors connected in\nFigure 8 for Node\

    \ Node 2.\n3.3.1. ATmega328 Microcontroller\nAll of those sensors require the\
    \ involvement of a micro-controller system to perform:\nthis component must be\
    \ implemented to trade off the price, power consumption, and performance\nenergy\
    \ results. According to most elements of low power, modern micro-controllers use\
    \ for a several\nmA, the effects of this element for the typical power consumption\
    \ of the node can be negligible,\nthus providing a higher level of independence\
    \ [43].\nBased on the principle diagram of Gateway and Node 1, it seems that both\
    \ have many common\npoints, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The best selection\
    \ in this study for the integrated design\nfor both Gateway and Node 1 is signiﬁcant.\
    \ Because they save on the costs of printed circuitry, achieve\nfaster circuit\
    \ machining, and quickly ﬁx hardware errors. Figure 6 shows the schematic of an\
    \ actuator\nGateway and Node 1, which contains: an AC–DC converter, ATmega2560,\
    \ LoRa transmission, RFID,\nLCD, and all the sensors. Note that, for the sake\
    \ of simplicity, we proposed all of the integrated circuits\ndepicted in the schematic.\
    \ After that, the printed circuit boards Gateway and Node 1 are designed\nwith\
    \ two layers of wires to make wiring more convenient and help optimize the circuit\
    \ as much as\npossible. The components are arranged in blocks with separate functions,\
    \ making it easier and more\nconvenient to check for errors.\nThe printed circuit\
    \ of Gateway and Node 1 is designed with:\n•\n62 components in which there are\
    \ 59 glued components and three pin components.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019,\
    \ 8, 45\n13 of 22\n•\nThe total number of different lines is 49 lines.\n•\nThere\
    \ are three different line sizes of 80 mils, 25, and 10 mils following different\
    \ wiring\nrequirements.\n•\nLine rules: do not cut wires, report faulty components\
    \ and the minimum distance between wires\nis 10 mm.\n•\nSize: 74.193 × 87.503\
    \ mm.\nFigure 7b shows the overall prototype of Node 1. Node 1 powers with a 5V\
    \ AC–DC converter that\nstores full current energy to control all the components\
    \ and the relay module. Furthermore, the LoRa\nmodule is not put close to the\
    \ converter because it generated the electrical noise and the interference of\n\
    communication links.\nWith the various parameters to be observed in our system,\
    \ in most cases, temperature,\ntemperature–humidity, soil moisture, rain, and\
    \ water level are measured.\n•\nTemperature sensor: DS18B20, [44], the popular\
    \ solution for temperature control in smart\nagriculture systems is the application\
    \ of standard digital sensors, for instance, DS18B20 integrated\ncircuits in this\
    \ research.\n•\nTemperature-humidity sensor: DHT22 [45] is a current sensor, which\
    \ combines the temperature\nand humidity sensor; it provides a wider temperature\
    \ range and better accuracy. In particular,\nit has low consumption and is better\
    \ for most smart farming systems.\n•\nSoil moisture sensor: SKU:SEN0193 [46],\
    \ this soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture levels\nby capacitive sensing\
    \ rather than resistive sensing like other sensors on the market. It is made of\n\
    corrosion-resistant material, which provides a good solution for the user. Moreover,\
    \ the sensor is\nsimple to use—an analog sensor that works at a low voltage.\n\
    •\nRain sensor: LM393, this is an analog sensor that operates at a low voltage,\
    \ and the current sensor\nis for easily detecting rain [47].\n•\nWater level and\
    \ temperature pump: LM393 [48]; this is an analog sensor when the water level\n\
    reaches below the threshold in the tunnel farm and checks the sensors. Our system\
    \ communicates\nto the user and establishes a water pump to its switch on the\
    \ state for sufﬁcient watering of plants\nthroughout a mobile application.\nFigure\
    \ 9 shows the sensor Node 1 electronic schematic, and how total hardware elements\
    \ are\nattached: microcontroller, power, and IC circuit. DS 1307 is used to read\
    \ the real-time with the high\naccuracy, LoRa module transfer data via a serial\
    \ connection, and the module connection is used to\nconnect RF HC12, RFID RC522,\
    \ LCD, sensors, pump, and ATmega2560. Figure 10a shows an actual\nmodel of sensor\
    \ Node 1.\nBesides the hardware, before being discussed, sensor Node 1 needs an\
    \ additional device to\noperate. The general important thing is the power subsystem.\
    \ In the case of the nodes, it was selected\nto power the nodes. Note that, in\
    \ this situation, we also can be used by the power supply unit, which\nis based\
    \ on a 12 W solar panel. The solar panel is linked to the solar charge controller,\
    \ where a solar\ncharge controller manages the power going into the battery.\n\

    \ Tests\nThe proposed smart agriculture system is evaluated using two different\
    \ scenarios in Vietnam:\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the sensors for the\
    \ analysis of temperature, solid humidity in\na research lab; and conﬁrming data\
    \ transmission by using the LoRa channel over a large area\nand distance.\n4.1.\
    \ Tests on the Sensors of the IoT\nThe ﬁrst scenario was set up in the Department\
    \ of Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering of Ton Duc Thang University,\
    \ Vietnam, where the sensing infrastructure was evaluated.\nThe performance of\
    \ the system was tested using a subset of nodes with the Arduino. These sensors\n\
    were used because the presence of other components would not affect the accuracy\
    \ of the measurement.\nIn addition, since the circuit board was furnished with\
    \ the equivalent microcontroller used in the node,\nthis circuit board was chosen\
    \ for speciﬁc tests due to its ease of use, as fast prototyping is required\n\
    and because it can exploit the equivalent microprogramming of an IoT button. Experiments\
    \ were\nperformed using the gate, button 1, and sensor button 1 and button 2 with\
    \ LoRa integrated with\nembedded sensors. An easy-to-read LCD screen was added\
    \ to the mainboard, where it displayed\nthe temperature and humidity measured\
    \ by the sensor as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Furthermore,\nthe accuracy of sensor\
    \ measurements was displayed and conﬁrmed on the LCD screen. Finally,\nsensors\
    \ were calibrated before the test to guarantee the accuracy of data, and to help\
    \ users to eliminate\ndifﬁculties during the setup process the system.\nJ. Sens.\

    sensors on the right.\n4.2. Test on Data Transmission through the LoRa Channel\n\
    In the second scenario, the effectiveness of the LoRa technology for the placement\
    \ of a farm\nmonitoring infrastructure was investigated by examining data transmission\
    \ distances in two real\nfarms as shown in Figure 13. For this purpose, a model\
    \ system infrastructure was set up in the Cho\nLach district, Ben Tre province,\
    \ Vietnam, to demonstrate the usability of an individual star topology\nnetwork\
    \ covering an entirely rural area. The model infrastructure was composed using\
    \ a gateway node\nproduced by a LoRa E32-TTL-1W module connected to a mobile application,\
    \ and by two sensor nodes.\nThe transmission modules were set up with three critical\
    \ measures: the symbol rate of information,\nthe bandwidth of the channel, and\
    \ the information rate were set according to the datasheet provided\nby the manufacturer\
    \ in order to obtain the highest sensitivity.\nBased on the sensor network structure\
    \ presented in the previous sections, the transmission\nranges were checked by\
    \ placing the gateway in the farm. The nodes were located in various areas:\n\
    node 1 covered 2000 m2 at a distance of 700 m from the gateway, while node 2 covered\
    \ 1000 m2 at a\ndistance of 500 m from the gateway. These positions were ﬁxed\
    \ and it was veriﬁed that the actual\ndata was correctly received. Subsequently,\
    \ data were collected from nodes 1 and 2 and sent to the\ngateway during the following\
    \ seven days of the same month, during which 24-h measurements were\nmade. In\
    \ this way, the performance of the system was tested. Figures 14 and 15 show the\
    \ results\nof the two nodes, which present the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\
    \ It can be observed\nthat, based on the threshold of these values, the system\
    \ could automatically switch on the water for\nthe farm. The experimental results\
    \ indicate that the application of a quick procedure for effective\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n17 of 22\nresolution building certainly helps to enhance\
    \ the outcomes of a sensor-based system. Not only does a\nsmart strategy improve\
    \ the performance of IoT-based and sensor-based systems, but the efﬁciency of\n\
    these systems can be increased with the smarter and more accurate choices made\
    \ by such intelligent\nsystems. Our experimental results highlight the procedure\
    \ used by the smart irrigation system to\nsave water in tunnel farming, thus achieving\
    \ higher productivity and the ability to ﬂexibly manage\nthe farm.\nFigure 13.\

    \ humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried out\
    \ on Node 1 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\nData transmission\
    \ is also a crucial issue in the IoT smart system in checking the effect of packet\
    \ loss.\nData transmission is tested by exploiting a model created by internal\
    \ sensors. Node 1, Node 2, and the\ngateway are connected through a LoRa module\
    \ in the prototype as described in Section 4.1. Packages\nare lost from all test\
    \ nodes during transmission. Although packet loss was observed whenever the\n\
    model moved between a test place, this is not a problem because the nodes are\
    \ expected to remain\nat the growing farms in the studied area. Therefore, LoRa\
    \ technology is proven to be effective when\ndeployed in rural areas, without\
    \ having to turn on acceleration mode on the transfer module shown\nin Figure\
    \ 13.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n18 of 22\nFigure 15. Collected soil\
    \ moisture, humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried\

    The smart agriculture system based on an IoT application has the following advantages\
    \ compared\nto the previous approaches:\n•\nThe system can be used to manage two\
    \ or more independent farms on the same mobile application,\nwhich may have different\
    \ growth schedules. The aim of this research was to use devices of the\nIoT system\
    \ with lower prices that are easy to obtain.\n•\nRemoving the need for WiFi on\
    \ the farm with the application of LoRa technology helps to save\nenergy, lower\
    \ costs, improve efﬁciency, and facilitate excellent communication between the\
    \ farm\nand gateway.\n•\nControl data are saved to the system memory to prevent\
    \ power outages that result in data loss.\nFurthermore, the multitude of control\
    \ modes makes it easier for users to manipulate the farm.\n•\nReal-time updates\
    \ are available directly from the Internet in order to enable the system to run\n\
    more accurately.\n•\nA lost WiFi connection can be detected and communicated to\
    \ users for timely processing.\n•\nMany different sensors are integrated to collect\
    \ information related to tree care in order to improve\ncrop productivity. Our\
    \ strategy studies ﬁve parameters: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level.\n•\nNone of the previously mentioned approaches discuss\
    \ and investigate the effect of energy\nconsumption in smart irrigation systems.\
    \ Furthermore, other methods frequently rely on soil\nmoisture to determine the\
    \ water needs of plants.\n•\nThe results of the test and the measurement of our\
    \ smart watering system approach the standard\nwatering procedure as a product\
    \ of high-tech application. It has an economic efﬁciency that is at\nleast 30%\
    \ higher than the used technology.\nIn addition to the advantages presented above,\
    \ our research also has disadvantages, which need\nto be overcome before widespread\
    \ application. For instance, the ESP8266 module is a mid-range\nmodule without\
    \ a high stability, while the system can lose an Internet connection and depends\
    \ on the\nBlynk application.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a solution using\
    \ LoRa module transmission for a low-cost and effective smart\nagriculture system\
    \ for use in Vietnam, which is designed and implemented to control environmental\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n19 of 22\nfactors in agriculture. It is less\
    \ expensive than other solutions with a similar accuracy. The system can\ncontinuously\
    \ observe the measured values and communicate them to users via a network and\
    \ mobile\napplication. Furthermore, the system can send alarms to users and activate\
    \ reduction devices. The IoT\nnode was tested in two separate cases in Cho Lach\
    \ district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam, and was used\nto measure distinct values\
    \ such as moisture, humidity, and temperature. Finally, experiments were\nperformed\
    \ to determine if the embedded electronics and the wireless communication module\
    \ might\ninﬂuence the collected values; there were no signs of interference. In\
    \ summary, the results conﬁrm\nthat the system provides the optimal solution to\
    \ users of smart agricultural control for farmers in\nVietnam. The availability\
    \ of real-time data enables quick use and management at all times from all\nplaces.\
    \ However, when IoT nodes are placed in various places, they generate huge quantities\
    \ of data.\nIn this case, our system requires time to store and analyze data before\
    \ ﬁnding the best solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-Y.N.,\

    Keywords:   Precision irrigation, Variable rate application, Center pivot, Lateral
    move, Wireless communication Continuous move irrigation systems have been modified
    since the 1990s to support variable rate irrigation. Most of these systems used
    PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) technology that did a good job of on-site
    control but were expensive to add remote, real-time monitoring and control aspects
    made possible by wireless sensor networks and the Internet. A new approach to
    control and monitoring continuous move irrigation systems is described. This system
    uses a Single Board Computer (SBC) using the Linux operating system to control
    solenoids connected to individual or groups of nozzles based on prescribed application
    maps. The main control box houses the SBC connected to a sensor network radio,
    a GPS unit, and an Ethernet radio creating a wireless connection to a remote server.
    A C-software control program resides on the SBC to control the on/off time for
    each nozzle group using a time on application map developed remotely. The SBC
    also interfaces with the sensor network radio to record sensors on the irrigation
    system monitoring performance and in the field monitoring irrigation soil and
    crop conditions. The SBC automatically populates a remote data base on a server
    in real time and provides software applications to monitor and control the irrigation
    system from the Internet. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) Share Facebook

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

  explanation: The study used multimodal data streaming from soil sensors, including
    water content (WC) measurements, to infer various physicochemical properties of
    harvested strawberries, such as color, sugar content, firmness, and sweetness.
    Multiple machine learning models, consisting of empirical (neural networks, ensembles
    of neural networks (ENN)) and statistical (Gaussian Process Regression (GPR))
    approaches, were developed and evaluated to establish relationships between these
    properties and soil measurements across different time scales and environmental
    conditions.

    In the world of big data sustained by ubiquitous applications of sensor networks,\n\
    artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) create signiﬁcant opportunities\
    \ in\nmultidisciplinary ﬁelds, including healthcare, ﬁnancial services, and smart\
    \ agriculture.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld and sur-\nrounding industries contributed USD 1.109 trillion to the U.S.\
    \ gross domestic product\nand provided 10.9% of the total employment in 2019 [1,2].\
    \ This paper introduces a holis-\ntic approach, which includes a sensor network\
    \ with real-time connectivity to the cloud,\nalgorithm-driven controllers, and\
    \ advanced machine learning algorithms to enable a fully\nautomated soil conditioning\
    \ system. This paper aims to improve the sustainability of straw-\nberry production,\
    \ which can easily be scaled to other kinds of special crops. Smart farming\n\
    systems use sensory data and real-time monitoring devices to acquire high-resolution\
    \ data\nfrom the ﬁeld and the environment surrounding the crop to improve the\
    \ crop quality and\nquantity while decreasing cost and increasing sustainability.\n\
    Researchers have focused on the yield prediction sector to support the economy\n\
    and develop a sustainable supply across many different crops. Strawberry fruit\
    \ is an\nessential crop for the U.S. economy, as the U.S. is the second-largest\
    \ strawberry producer\nworldwide, contributing to 26.2% of the world’s production\
    \ with 231 tons in 2017–2018 [3].\nThe importance of the strawberry crop worldwide\
    \ provided the motivation to study the\neffects of the natural environment and\
    \ soil physical characteristics on the quality of the\nstrawberry, and not just\
    \ the yield. One of the major factors that has been continuously\ninvestigated\
    \ through different studies is the water content and its effects on the yield\
    \ and\nstrawberry quality [4,5]. Strawberry cultivars have different demands of\
    \ water content and\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23042247\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n2 of 17\nfertilization\
    \ to reach acceptable levels of both quality and yield [4–10]. Previous literature\n\
    reports that a water deﬁcit has a drastic effect on the strawberry yield and marketability\n\
    (size of the fruit) on most strawberry cultivates [4,7]. At the same time, the\
    \ overuse of water\nincreases the cost and subsequently reduces the water resources\
    \ for other areas [11]. The\ndrip irrigation system for strawberry is an efﬁcient\
    \ way to save 50% more water compared\nto the overhead sprinklers [12]. Furthermore,\
    \ the overuse or wrong kind of fertilization\ncan harm the strawberry size and\
    \ sweetness [8,13]. Wu et al. [10] studied the effect of\nfour different factors\
    \ (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and water) on the\nyield and the\
    \ strawberry sweetness ratio (SSC/TTA), where they found a signiﬁcant effect\n\
    on the yield and SSC when they applied the N fertilizer. While the water content\
    \ had\na signiﬁcant effect on yield, P fertilizers had a signiﬁcant effect on\
    \ the sweetness ratio.\nHowever, they noticed a decline in the yield, sweetness\
    \ ratio, and ﬁrmness when they\napplied fertilizer and water extravagantly [10,14].\
    \ The sweetness ratio and the development\nof the strawberry cultivars are reﬂected\
    \ in the ripening stage of the fruit, which affects\nthe strawberry color [15].\
    \ The combination of all the factors, including water content and\nfertilizer\
    \ levels, with optimal irrigation schedule and techniques, still represent an\
    \ open\nﬁeld for research. As the new technologies help explore and adjust these\
    \ combinations,\nmachine learning and data mining help improve the agricultural\
    \ process for applications\nincluding crop prediction, disease, and weed detection,\
    \ and species recognition [16].\nOver the past decade, most of the research (authors\
    \ of this paper included) focused on\nevaluating the quality of strawberries postharvest\
    \ with little attention to how to control the\nquality of the crop pre-harvest.\
    \ This study proposes a holistic system, which is comprised\nof multiple components\
    \ in the form of a wireless sensor network to collect real-time high-\nresolution\
    \ data from the soil, machine learning algorithms to predict potential harvest\n\
    quality from the measured data and a control system to adjust soil parameters,\
    \ including\nwater content (WC) and electrical conductivity (EC) to achieve desired\
    \ physicochemical\ncharacteristics at the point and time of harvest. The high-resolution\
    \ data which match the\nsoil measurements with the postharvest quality analysis\
    \ has been presented in [17]. As\nthe follow-up publication, this paper will focus\
    \ on the data inference part of the project\nusing machine learning tools, including\
    \ both empirical (neural networks, ensembles of\nneural networks (ENN)) and statistical\
    \ (Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)) approaches.\nFigure 1 shows the proposed\
    \ system in full, where the general aim is to regulate the soil\nwater and fertilizer\
    \ levels both in real-time and on-demand for optimal physicochemical\nqualities\
    \ at the harvest. The study’s results so far prescribe several steps that can\
    \ be taken\nto enhance strawberry cultivation through soil sensor-based real-time\
    \ ﬁeld monitoring. For\ninstance, the control algorithm can be tested in a ﬁeld\
    \ where water levels can be monitored\nand adjusted using real-time smart controllers\
    \ at drip line valves, thus optimizing resource\nutilization based on dynamic\
    \ environmental and weather factors. This article will focus on\nthe data collection\
    \ and model training, which are required to ultimately control the smart\nvalves\
    \ at each drip line.\nPrevious studies have shown less than stellar results regarding\
    \ strawberries’ overall\nsensory qualities, which do not always satisfy the customers\
    \ [18]. As was also shown in the\nliterature, local area information has a signiﬁcant\
    \ effect on the model’s accuracy [19–21].\nThis provides a strong incentive to\
    \ ﬁnd the optimal pre-harvest conditions for different\ncultivars and to develop\
    \ a robust algorithm to determine the relationship between the local\nsoil properties\
    \ and the strawberry’s physicochemical characteristics.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n\

    \ is data collection from the\nﬁeld, data pre-processing, and model training.\
    \ (b) The second stage is testing the developed models\nwith new ﬁeld data and\
    \ implementing the control hardware based on the model predictions.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis study was conducted using data collected from an approximately\
    \ 40 acre com-\nmercial strawberry farm in Plant City, Florida. The reader can\
    \ learn more about the data\ncollection process and the statistical analysis of\
    \ the data in the ﬁrst publication of this\nstudy [17]. As shown in Figure 2,\
    \ a bird’s-eye view is provided for the farm with three\ntime-series data loggers\
    \ from three different regions, each with two terminals connected\nto three sensors.\
    \ The markers in Figure 2 represent the location of each logger, which\nwere strategically\
    \ placed to sample from areas of the ﬁeld with high, medium, and low\nhumidity\
    \ levels based on natural elevation. The sensors measured the soil water content\n\
    (m3/m3), electrical conductivity (mS/cm), and soil temperature (◦C), for the whole\
    \ of\nfour months during the 2018–2019 Florida Brilliance strawberry season [22].\
    \ The precip-\nitation rate (inch /day) data for Plant City, Florida, were included\
    \ in this study [23] for\nthat Florida strawberry season in order to see the effect\
    \ of rain on the water content (WC)\nand electrical conductivity (EC). There is\
    \ a relationship between the soil water content\n(WC), the soil conductivity (EC),\
    \ and the precipitation rate, similar to what has been found\nin the literature\
    \ [17,24]. There is a correlation between the WC level with rainwater, WC\nlevel\
    \ with EC level, and EC level with rainwater where the rainwater obviously increases\n\
    the WC along with the ions and minerals in the soil, which is then reﬂected in\
    \ the EC\nlevel, as reported by Friedman et al. [24]. The soil properties such\
    \ as temperature and WC\nare signiﬁcant factors in crop quality and quantity [16,19,25],\
    \ but since Florida Brilliance\nStrawberries were grown on an open ﬁeld in a plastic-covered\
    \ bed, temperature control\nis not feasible. Based on the results of the preliminary\
    \ analysis of the data and what was\npreviously reported in the literature [17,24],\
    \ the WC and EC were selected as the primary\nfactors in training the ML algorithms.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 2247\n4 of 17\nFigure 2. The satellite view of the farm in Plant\
    \ City, Florida, where the real-time data loggers were\nplaced, and the commercial\
    \ harvest was performed.\nThe dataset includes data points for four harvests during\
    \ the four months of the\n2018–2019 strawberry season, where six different points\
    \ in the ﬁeld were harvested to yield\na total of 24 multivariate data points\
    \ after pre-processing the dataset, as shown in Table 1.\nThe 24 multivariate\
    \ data points include the soil measurements and the corresponding fruit\nsensory\
    \ qualities recorded in a collaborating lab at the University of Florida. For\
    \ each of the\n24 samples, the sensory qualities of the harvested strawberries\
    \ used in the study as output\npredictions include color and soluble solids content\
    \ (SSC). Color is an attractive element\nin strawberry evaluation [18,26] and\
    \ the basic external quality factor for the postharvest\nuses of the fruit, as\
    \ well as a natural indicator of fruit ripeness [15,18,27]. The color of\nstrawberries\
    \ was analyzed using a machine vision system [28] consisting of a light box, a\n\
    Nikon D200 digital color camera, and a computer. The camera settings were set\
    \ to 36 mm\nfocal length, ISO 100 sensitivity, 1/3 s F/11 shutter speed, −1 eV\
    \ exposure compensation,\nand direct sunlight white balance. The system was calibrated\
    \ using a standard red plate\nfrom Labsphere. A software program was used to capture\
    \ images and calculate the average\nL*, a*, and b* values of the strawberry surface\
    \ based on ﬁve replicates [17]. The measure\nof redness, “a*”, was taken on the\
    \ red/green coordinate and considered the deﬁnitive\nindicator of strawberry color\
    \ in this study. On the other hand, SSC is an indicator of sugar\ncontent for\
    \ sweetness, another primary consumer preferred attribute. SSC was conducted\n\
    on the homogenized strawberry samples from each harvest. The samples were blended\
    \ in\na high-speed blender for 5 min, then centrifuged at 5000× g for 20 min to\
    \ obtain a clear\njuice, which was ﬁltered through cheesecloth [17]. The SSC of\
    \ the resulting supernatant\nwas determined using a Reicher handheld digital refractometer\
    \ at room temperature [17].\nUltimately, color and SSC was highlighted as the\
    \ consumer and food industry’s main focus\nfor good strawberry quality [29,30].\
    \ There is a correlation between an increase in sugar\ncontent in the strawberry\
    \ as the fruit ripens [31,32]. Furthermore, previous studies have\nreported the\
    \ quality of a strawberry is at the peak around day 28 from the fruit set [15],\
    \ so\na 28-day postharvest time window was determined for this study as well.\n\

    \ The overall framework proposed in this study\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n5 of 17\n\
    takes inspiration from the fact that the causality between sensory variables and\
    \ product\nquality can be used to develop smart control systems for better quality\
    \ and sustainability as\nshown in Figure 1. The ﬁrst phase of the project involved\
    \ the creation of the dataset from\nan operational commercial strawberry farm\
    \ in Central Florida, which included signiﬁcant\ncollaborations between the stakeholders\
    \ including the farm and two collaborating academic\ninstitutions. Once the data\
    \ were collected, they were pre-processed to group the recordings\nwithin a 4-week\
    \ time window prior to each harvest on account of the studies in the literature,\n\
    which discuss how the quality of a strawberry is at its peak between 28–36 days\
    \ from the\nfruit set [15]. After some statistical preliminary analysis [17],\
    \ which demonstrated non-\nlinear relationships between the primary input predictors\
    \ WC and EC, and the primary\nquality attributes SSC and color, two scenarios\
    \ were considered in this study. In the ﬁrst\nscenario, the WC was used as the\
    \ primary input feature to predict associated strawberry\nqualities, color and\
    \ soluble solids content (SSC) as the model outputs. In the second\nscenario,\
    \ the same outputs were predicted using both WC and EC as joint input features.\n\
    The dataset, even though it was collected over a 4-month period with thousands\
    \ of data\npoints for sensory recordings, still has a challenging size, in light\
    \ of the limited harvesting\ncapabilities, which allowed for 4 separate occasions\
    \ for the harvest on the commercial\nfarms. As a result, the dataset has 24 data\
    \ points and a relatively large feature vector, so it\nis extremely important\
    \ to apply the fail-safe measures to prevent the network from over-\nﬁtting, such\
    \ as early stopping and proper cross-validation. Leave-one-out cross-validation\n\
    was applied in training the algorithms, as described below.\nOne of the recently\
    \ introduced strategies used in training the empirical models is\nsplitting training\
    \ data into two partitions, where the ﬁrst partition is used to train model\n\
    parameters and the second partition is used to calculate model accuracy at each\
    \ step. As\nillustrated in Figure 3, two neural network frameworks were employed\
    \ in the form of\nshallow and ensemble (ENN) neural networks, the ﬁrst to tune\
    \ the early stopping condition\nand the second to train and test the dataset.\
    \ Once the early stopping conditions are reached\n(i.e., the accuracy on the validation\
    \ partition starts to drop for N number of consecutive\ntimes), the training is\
    \ stopped, the epoch number is recorded, and the two partitions\nare combined.\
    \ The neural network is then trained from scratch using the same initial\nparameters\
    \ for the same number of epochs using the entire training set. The ﬁnal accuracy\n\
    is reported on the test set, which is not included in any stage of the training\
    \ process and is\nalternated between cross-validations.\nFigure 3. Methodology\

    6 of 17\n2.1.1. Empirical Methods\nThis study includes a thorough comparison between\
    \ different machine learning topolo-\ngies which fall under two main categories:\
    \ empirical and statistical. The ﬁrst step in this\nstudy compares the results\
    \ of a neural network (NN) to avoid over-ﬁtting on a small dataset\nto an ensemble\
    \ of neural networks (ENN), which helps build a more stable algorithm at\nthe\
    \ expense of error rate.\nFor each run, leave-one-out cross-validation was used\
    \ with 23 samples for training and\n1 sample for testing. The root mean square\
    \ error (RMSE) and prediction error percentage\n(PEP) metrics were used to measure\
    \ the models’ performance for both frameworks. The\nPEP is deﬁned as the root\
    \ mean square error of the network over the quality average (QA)\nfor each feature\
    \ to provide a general understanding of the relative accuracy with respect to\n\
    quantiﬁable metrics for each output, as shown in Equation (1) below. The limitations\
    \ of the\ndataset size have ultimately determined the cross-validation size.\n\
    PEP =\nq\n∑N\ni=1(yi− ˆyi)2\nN\nQA\n∗ 100\n(1)\nNeural Network Data Representation:\
    \ Different topologies were implemented in\nthe form of one or two hidden layers,\
    \ with different numbers of neurons in each layer,\nfor an exhaustive analysis\
    \ with all possible combinations. The input in the ﬁrst scenario\nwas presented\
    \ as the WC averages for the 4 weeks prior to each harvest, whereas in the\nsecond\
    \ scenario, the inputs were the WC and EC averages for the 4 weeks prior to each\n\
    harvest. In both cases, the output was different for each experiment depending\
    \ on whether\nunivariate or multivariate scenarios were used, such as predicting\
    \ color separately, or color\nand SSC together. Each experiment was conducted\
    \ 50 times for statistical redundancy\nand the average RMSE on the training and\
    \ testing sets were recorded. The networks used\nhyperbolic tangent functions\
    \ for activation and RMSE as the cost function, whereas PEP\nwas used to evaluate\
    \ the network prediction error.\nEnsemble of Neural Networks: ENN is an enhanced\
    \ form of a singular neural network,\nwhere an ensemble of networks is used with\
    \ different initial parameters to stabilize the\nprediction. ENN was used to deal\
    \ with the randomness of each model and to improve\nthe stability of prediction\
    \ across all the models, especially considering the size of the\ndataset. Combining\
    \ ensembles of neural networks with leave-one-out cross-validation\ngave us an\
    \ unbiased and reliable estimation for the model performance and generalized\n\
    the error [36]. Each experiment was conducted 50 times for statistical redundancy\
    \ and\nrecorded the average RMSE on the training and testing set. The networks\
    \ use hyperbolic\ntangent functions for activation and RMSE as the cost function,\
    \ whereas PEP was used to\nevaluate the network prediction error.\n2.1.2. Statistical\
    \ Method\nA robust and statistical model was added to corroborate this study—the\
    \ Gaussian\nProcess Regression (GPR), which has gained immense popularity in recent\
    \ years—to\nexplore the value of a statistical approach. GPR is a powerful probabilistic\
    \ model to deal\nwith noisy and small datasets [37], gives us well-calibrated\
    \ probabilistic outputs, and\nprovides the prediction with its conﬁdence interval.\n\
    Gaussian Process Regression: GPR is a non-parametric probabilistic model which\n\
    uses the Bayesian approach to give a probabilistic output. It uses independent\
    \ variables to\ndetermine the uncertainty in the model prediction and improve\
    \ the model selection [38].\nGPR uses the mean of the input data, m\n\x10\nX ∼\
    \ Rd\x11\n; in the ﬁrst case, the input data were\nthe WC averages, and in the\
    \ second case, the input data were the WC and EC averages of\nthe 4-week time\
    \ scales prior to each harvest and the covariance kernel matrix, k\n\x10\nx, x\n\
    ′\x11\n, to\ncalculate the prior probability distribution and predict the posterior\
    \ probability distribution.\nGPR maximizes the likelihood of Y given X, while\
    \ ϵ ∼ N\n\00, σ2\nxx\n\x01\nis the noise associated\nwith the data with a zero\
    \ mean and variance σ2\nxx.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n7 of 17\nf (x) ∼ GP(m(x),\

    Working with GPR on a small dataset helps in saving resources, while computing\
    \ the\nkernel matrix as the model complexity, (n3), is tied to the data dimension\
    \ [37–39]. GPR is\nstill sensitive to over-ﬁtting with a small dataset, so the\
    \ squared exponential (SE) kernel\nwas used to calculate the prior in our experiments,\
    \ while adding white noise to overcome\nthe model over-ﬁtting, as described in\
    \ literature [40,41].\nThe leave-one-out cross-validation technique was applied\
    \ to improve the performance\nand avoid over-ﬁtting, where 23 samples were used\
    \ for training and one sample for testing.\nThe input–output pairs followed the\
    \ same pattern as before for each experiment, depend-\ning on whether univariate\
    \ or multivariate scenarios were used, such as predicting color\nseparately or\
    \ color and SSC together. RMSE was used to measure the models’ performance\nfor\
    \ both the univariate and multivariate responses, whereas PEP was used to evaluate\
    \ the\nnetwork prediction error.\n3. Results\nThe results overall suggest that\
    \ the color of a strawberry can be best predicted from\nthe water content (WC)\
    \ of the soil averaged across the 4 weeks immediately preceding\nthe harvest.\
    \ Including the electrical conductivity (EC) in the input space for predicting\n\
    both color and sugar content simultaneously generally resulted in higher RMSE\
    \ values.\nThe RMSE results on the testing set for all neural network topologies,\
    \ including singular\nand ensemble frameworks as well as the GPR models, are shown\
    \ in detail in Tables 2–4.\nThe algorithms use the input representation in the\
    \ form of weekly averages for WC or\nthe weekly averages for WC and EC, 4 weeks\
    \ prior to each harvest, whereas Figures 4–7\nshow the prediction error percentage\
    \ (PEP) and variance across 50 experiments for all\nthe empirical methods for\
    \ visual illustration. The testing RMSE for each experiment is\ncalculated via\
    \ leave-one-out cross-validation due to the limited size of the dataset. The\n\
    mean of RMSE, PEP (error%), and variance of the RMSE for 50 independent runs for\
    \ each\nexperiment are presented for the empirical methods. Where the mean RMSE\
    \ indicates the\noverall performance of a speciﬁc algorithm, PEP indicates the\
    \ prediction error range, and\nthe variance can be used as an indicator of robustness\
    \ in real-life applications.\nFigure 4. (a) Prediction error percentage across\

    \ sophisticated models, as shown in Table 1. For instance, in some cases, when\
    \ the\nnumber of layers and the number of neurons in each layer increased, the\
    \ testing RMSE\nalso increased. Moreover, in most cases, the variance decreased\
    \ as the number of networks\nincreased in the ensemble, as shown in Figure 5b,\
    \ which means an ensemble could provide\nmore robust performance with a trade-off\
    \ in mean RMSE. The color prediction results\nshown in Table 2 display that the\
    \ lowest RMSE is 3.24 and the PEP is 8.9% from the\nexpected range of values,\
    \ at two incidents when NN with one layer and one neuron, and\nan ensemble of\
    \ two neural networks with only one layer and one neuron in each layer\nwas used\

    of predicted versus observed color values for each of the 24 harvest and location\
    \ pairs\nfor the most accurate NN implementations. In a similar fashion, Figure\
    \ 8b is a visual\nrepresentation of the bivariate relationship between the predicted\
    \ and observed color pairs\nfor the same implementation. It is clear that while\
    \ not perfect, the color values have been\npredicted within a reasonable range,\
    \ especially considering the wide dynamic range “a*”\nparameter can take, which\
    \ is the indicator of redness. The highest RMSE is 4.31 and the\nPEP is 11.84%\

    \ seems to have underperformed compared to the\nempirical methods. It is possible\
    \ that the high variance in the case of the GPR could be\ndue to the presence\
    \ of some sample points, which are such outliers that they signiﬁcantly\nimpact\
    \ the statistical ﬁtting than the empirical back-propagation across the dataset\

    \ well compared to the empirical models with an average RMSE\nbelow the best performing\
    \ NN topology for 75% of the observations. The error distributions\nin Figure\
    \ 10 also demonstrate that most errors occur at RMSE values of 2 or less except\n\
    for the outlier points. Figure 10 shows the error histograms for each input–output\
    \ pair\nsetup where the error distributions seem mostly identical. As shown in\

    \ its mathematical importance, combining the color and SSC features together\n\
    can ultimately give us a more precise picture of how to adjust the color and sugar\
    \ content\nfor strawberries and improve the production based on available WC and\
    \ EC averages for\nthe 4 weeks prior to each harvest.\nAs anticipated with small\
    \ data, the RMSE/PEP increases as the number of hidden\nlayers and the neurons\
    \ in these layers increase. However, the population of the ensemble\nseems to\
    \ help the variance of RMSE, as shown in Figure 7b. As can be seen from Table\
    \ 3,\nthe lowest PEP is 14.04% when one NN with one layer and ten neurons was\
    \ implemented\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n13 of 17\nwith a variance of 0.03. The\
    \ highest PEP is 19.04% from the expected range of values, when\nan ensemble of\
    \ one NN with one hidden layer and two neurons with a variance of 0.12.\nThe GPR\
    \ performed better in predicting the color values using only the WC as the\ninput\
    \ compared to using both the WC and EC as input features. Not only is the PEP%\
    \ lower,\nbut also the variance in the root mean square error is smaller. Similarly,\
    \ when predicting\nboth color and SSC, using a univariate input (WC) had a better\
    \ performance than using\nboth WC and EC as inputs, both in terms of error% (PEP)\
    \ and error variance. The reader\ncan ﬁnd detailed numerical values in Table 4.\
    \ This generally matches our observations\nusing empirical models, such as the\
    \ ensemble networks.\n4. Discussion\nOver the past decade, most of the research\
    \ focused on evaluating the quality of spe-\ncialty crops postharvest, whereas\
    \ this study aims to develop a methodology to control\nthe production quality\
    \ of strawberries pre-harvest. Speciﬁcally, this paper discusses the\nalgorithm\
    \ development stage of a sensor-enabled real-time strawberry production moni-\n\
    toring system to improve both resource management and harvest quality. Recent\
    \ studies\ntried to predict the crop yield [16,19,20,34] and classify the quality\
    \ of the harvest based on\ncomputer-vision-developed methods using machine learning\
    \ algorithms [33,43]. One of\nthe studies by Sim et al. (2020) predicted the strawberry\
    \ yield and strawberry growth stage\nusing some environmental parameters (air\
    \ temperature, soil temperature, and photosyn-\nthetic active radiation) and soil\
    \ parameters (soil moisture content, EC, relative humidity,\nand CO2 concentration)\
    \ [44], while Madhavi et al. [45] tried to evaluate the strawberry soil\nnutrition\
    \ from the strawberry leaf color and predict the strawberry growth stage. Another\n\
    study by ElMasry et al. [43] developed multiple linear regression models to predict\
    \ the\nsweetness and acidity of the strawberry crop using hyper-spectral imaging\
    \ in the visible\nand near-infrared regions.\nThis paper presents a nondestructive\
    \ method to predict strawberry quality based on\nappearance (color) and ﬂavor\
    \ (sweetness) from the soil properties (WC and EC) during the\npre-harvest process.\
    \ Compared to the previous studies, the novel contributions of this study\nare\
    \ multi-fold. Speciﬁcally, it introduces both empirical and statistical models\
    \ to ﬁnd novel\ncorrelations between the soil sensory measurements and associated\
    \ multivariate harvest\nquality. Furthermore, it demonstrates that a sufﬁcient\
    \ prediction error can be achieved to\nenable a future real-time implementation\
    \ of a smart controller to exploit environmental\nand climate conditions to reduce\
    \ resource use.\nBased on the structure of the data collected from a commercial\
    \ farm throughout an\nentire Florida harvest season, several predictive models,\
    \ statistical and empirical, were\nproposed to infer the color and sugar content\
    \ of the harvested strawberries from the\nmeasured WC of the soil across a certain\
    \ time period. To the best of our knowledge,\nboth the collected data and the\
    \ subsequently developed algorithms are unprecedented\nin the literature. This\
    \ study demonstrates the performance of the algorithms through\na series of use-case\
    \ scenarios in predicting the univariate and multivariate responses in\nthe form\
    \ of color and sugar content of the produced strawberries as the most important\n\
    physicochemical characteristics for marketability.\nThe average color values in\
    \ the collected data were around 36.4 (a quantitative measure\nfor redness) and\
    \ the average SSC values were 6.4 (a quantitative measure of sugar content).\n\
    To accurately display the performance of each prediction model, these average\
    \ values are\nused to create the PEP metric such that the RMSE values are contrasted\
    \ against the average\nquality values for color and SSC to provide a general understanding\
    \ of the relative accuracy\nwith respect to quantiﬁable metrics for each output.\
    \ In the end, the models were able\nto predict the color and color-sugar content\
    \ within as little as 9% and 14% PEP of their\nexpected range of values, respectively.\
    \ Such accuracy values allow for us to implement the\nnext phase of the project\
    \ in controlling the WC based on predicted color values once the\ndesired quality\
    \ threshold is chosen.\nSensors 2023, 23, 2247\n14 of 17\nThe authors also acknowledge\
    \ the limitations of this study. Speciﬁcally, the data were\ncollected across\

    \ not enough to create a sufﬁciently generalizable input–output relationship for\
    \ the\nprediction models. Even though widely accepted cross-validation methods\
    \ have been\ndeployed and validated, the study can greatly beneﬁt from additional\
    \ data points which\nare projected to be collected in the upcoming strawberry\
    \ seasons.\nThese ﬁndings suggest several courses of action to implement the proposed\
    \ scheme of\nwork shown in Figure 1, as part of a large soil study in improving\
    \ strawberry production\nusing sensor-assisted real-time ﬁeld monitoring. The\
    \ ultimate goal of the project is to be\nable to control the water levels of the\
    \ soil on-demand to achieve the highest possible harvest\nquality in terms of\
    \ the physicochemical characteristics of the fruit. This study is the ﬁrst\nstep\
    \ toward establishing the relationship between water content, electric conductivity,\
    \ and\nthe quality of the strawberries. A natural progression of this work is\
    \ to implement one of\nthe developed algorithms in an experimental ﬁeld where\
    \ water levels can be monitored and\nmanaged, and the harvest quality can be compared\
    \ to the predicted algorithmic outputs.\nFor example, the control algorithm can\
    \ be tested in a real-world environment where the\nwater levels are monitored\
    \ and regulated by smart controllers at the drip line valves,\nmaximizing resource\
    \ efﬁciency based on dynamic environmental and weather conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    This paper presents the second stage of a system that uses sensor networks to\
    \ collect\nreal-time data for the precise monitoring and control of soil conditions\
    \ in a commercial\nstrawberry farm. The sensor network is distributed in the soil\
    \ to gather data that can infer\nthe ultimate physicochemical characteristics\
    \ of the fruit at the point of harvest. Empirical\nand statistical models, such\
    \ as neural networks and Gaussian process regression models,\nare used to predict\
    \ the most signiﬁcant physicochemical qualities of strawberry, such as\ncolor\
    \ and sweetness. The level of accuracy achieved is as low as 9% and 14% of the\
    \ expected\nrange of values, respectively, which will enable the next and third\
    \ phase of controlling soil\nconditions for sustainable and high-quality strawberry\
    \ production.\nThis paper introduces both empirical and statistical models to\
    \ discover new relation-\nships between soil sensor measurements and multivariate\
    \ harvest quality. Furthermore, it\nshows that it is possible to achieve a sufﬁcient\
    \ level of prediction accuracy to implement a\nreal-time smart controller in the\
    \ future to optimize resource use based on environmental\nand climate conditions.\n\
    The limitations of this study mainly include a lack of sufﬁcient harvests to match\
    \ the\notherwise very-high-resolution multimodal data streaming from the soil\
    \ sensors. This\nmismatch in data inputs and outputs limited the complexity of\
    \ the model used for training.\nIn future studies, more harvest points will be\
    \ included and the effects of different cultivars,\nsoil conditions, and temperatures\
    \ across multiple climates will be studied through multi-\nclimate and multiple\
    \ ﬁeld partnerships.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.E. and I.U.;\

  key_findings: The study demonstrated that machine learning models, including neural
    networks, ensembles of neural networks, and Gaussian Process Regression, can be
    effectively used to predict various strawberry physicochemical properties, such
    as color and sugar content, based on real-time soil sensor data. The developed
    models achieved promising accuracy, with prediction errors as low as 9% and 14%
    for color and sugar content, respectively.
  limitations: The study acknowledges limitations in the data collection process,
    with the number of harvests for quality analysis being insufficient to establish
    a sufficiently generalizable input-output relationship for the prediction models.
    Additionally, the authors recognize the need for further data collection to improve
    the models' accuracy and robustness.

    \ techniques characterized by optimal \nmanagement and best collaboration of various\
    \ irrigation factors, attracts great attention and obtains wide employments in\
    \ \ndifferent irrigation conditions or cultivation processes.  Moreover, it becomes\
    \ well-established in major areas of agricultural \nresearches and across the\
    \ broad spectrum of agricultural techniques especially in specific sectors of\
    \ scientific frontiers, \nincluding soil quality, irrigation scheduling, water\
    \ resource distribution, crop productivity, tillage management, climate \nadaptation,\
    \ and environment monitoring, etc.  This paper reviews the research developments\
    \ and integrated applications of \nprecision irrigation in typical domains of\
    \ mechanism and performance, covering key aspects such as process optimization,\
    \ \nschedule modelling, and effectiveness evaluation, indicating that advanced\
    \ irrigation optimization methods support higher \nproductivity of crop field\
    \ and better environmental conditions of soil;  Current schedule modelling techniques\
    \ provide a set of \ninstructive demonstrations and heuristic descriptions for\
    \ the working principles of precision irrigation and the quantitative \nassessments\
    \ of irrigation productivity;  The novel investigation on effectiveness evaluation\
    \ is extremely significant to obtain \nhigher infiltration efficiency, simultaneously\
    \ to achieve the optimized irrigation qualities for water balance condition, soil\
    \ water \nredistribution, and soil moisture uniformity so that the effectiveness\
    \ quality of irrigation infiltration could be improved \nremarkably.  It is concluded\
    \ that precision irrigation owns an outstanding collaborating capability and possesses\
    \ much better \nworking advancement in typical calibration indexes of cultivation\
    \ accuracy and infiltration efficiency, meanwhile, a high \nagreement between\
    \ the predicted and actual irrigation effectiveness could be expected.  This novel\

    \ should be promoted constructively to improve the quality uniformity \nfor precision\

    \ \nenvironmental condition, and excessive water demands[1,2].  It is \nwell known\
    \ that water conservation through precision irrigation, \nalleviates a large portion\
    \ of the burden of water demand[3].  As \nsome adaptive measures in the irrigated\
    \ agriculture nowadays \ninclude fallowing land, shifting cropping patterns, increased\
    \ \ngroundwater pumping, reservoir storage capacity expansion, and \nincreased\
    \ production of risk-averse crops[1], it is important to \n                  \

    introduce precision irrigation techniques to ensure the sustainable \nusage of\
    \ water/soil resource and feed the enormous population all \naround the world[4].\
    \  In this paper precision irrigation is defined as \nthe high-efficient and appropriate\
    \ employment of water and soil \nresources to acquire the optimum growth result\
    \ of crop plants and \nreduce adverse environmental impacts, it is a collaborative\
    \ \nmechanism that controls the land productivity, maximizes the \nrevenue and\
    \ minimizes the conditional impact on surroundings by \nautomating \nthe \ncomplete\
    \ \nirrigation \nperformances[5,6].  \nSimultaneously, as a unique irrigation\
    \ operation, it also involves \nthe optimal management and best coordination of\
    \ all participant \nfactors of the agricultural irrigation process.  This technique\
    \ could \nbe applicable to all operational irrigation methods such as precise\
    \ \ndrip irrigation, subsurface deficit irrigation, and adaptively \nalternate\
    \ irrigation, at appropriate spatial and temporal scales.  \nPrecision irrigation\
    \ comprises a wide range of irrigation systems, \nboth at on-farm plot, or scheme\
    \ levels, corresponding to very \ndifferent agricultural requirements and cultivation\
    \ monitoring \nreality[7,8].  Recently, extensive efforts have been made to survey\
    \ \nthe amount and distribution of irrigation water withdrawals[9], as \nthe soil\
    \ water storage, circulation efficiency of groundwater, \nmoisture distribution\
    \ efficiency, and moisture diffusivity, are all \nnecessary to promote the working\
    \ efficiency of precision irrigation \nremarkably.  It is also imperative to determine\
    \ the exact effect of \nsoil water redistribution for irrigation management, as\
    \ well as with \nJuly, 2021                   Liang Z W, et al.  Review of conceptual\

    \ \nCommunications Technology (ICT) and Internet of Things (IoT) \nmethods, have\
    \ already been used widely in process optimization, \nschedule modelling and effectiveness\
    \ evaluation[10,11], which are \ndiscussed \nin \nthis \npaper. \n \nConsequently,\
    \ \nthe \nfunctional \nclassification of precision irrigation systems is a fundamental\
    \ initial \nstep to serve as a basis for its conceptual and systematic review,\
    \ \ncontributing to the sustainability and stability of irrigated \nagriculture\
    \ demanding high-efficient management of environmental \nresources under existing\
    \ environmental constraints[12].  \nBased on the above-mentioned introduction,\
    \ the rationale and \nsignificance of precision irrigation for agricultural production\
    \ could \nbe fully acknowledged.  In order to demonstrate the conceptual \nand\
    \ systematic progress of precision irrigation techniques, here this \npaper proposes\
    \ a constructive overview concerning its process \noptimization in Section 2;\
    \ then the representative schedule \nmodelling practices of precision irrigation\
    \ are enumerated by \nSection 3; Section 4 discusses the effectiveness evaluation\
    \ of \nprecision irrigation in details, thus its complex influence \nmechanism\
    \ in actual performances could be highlighted; Based on \nthese subsections, Section\
    \ 5 presents the future research trends of \nprecision irrigation; and Section\
    \ 6 concludes this paper eventually. \n2  Process optimization of precision irrigation\
    \  \nIn the interest of implementing persistent aggrandizement of \nprecision\
    \ irrigation effectiveness, which needs high-efficient and \nsupportive irrigation\
    \ equipment that recognizes the conditional \nequilibrium in water-saving operation\
    \ and crop productivity \nintensification[13], the process optimization of precision\
    \ irrigation \nshould be emphasized and realized by balancing the requirements\
    \ \nof condition and cost.  Effective testing and tentative simulation \nare very\
    \ important to facilitate water and energy application for \nsystem design and\
    \ irrigation supervision so that the main objectives \nof irrigation process optimization\
    \ are maximizing water application \nefficiency and distribution uniformity, minimizing\
    \ water loss and \nsoil erosion while keeping the agricultural irrigation costs\
    \ at a \nminimized scale.  \nFrom the review of recently-published literature,\
    \ it could be \nlearned that irrigation optimization should be performed during\
    \ the \ndesigning stage of the irrigation system, including irrigation setups,\
    \ \npumping systems, sprinkler nozzles, irrigation network, and \nintelligent\
    \ control platform.  Table 1 gives a progress \ndemonstration of irrigation optimization.\
    \  There are a set of \ninvestigations concerning the combination of Remote Sensing\
    \ (RS) \nand GIS for precision irrigation.  Various optimization methods \nused\
    \ for actual irrigation, including linear programming (LP), \nnon-linear programming\
    \ (NLP), dynamic programming (DP), \ngenetic algorithms (GA), and simulated annealing\
    \ (SA), have all \nbeen employed frequently for better quality and higher productivity\
    \ \nof crop cultivation.  For example, an optimization method was \npresented\
    \ to improve the water-usage efficiency in tea irrigation \nand analyze the complex\
    \ correlation between irrigation efficiency \nand farming characteristics using\
    \ the Tobit method[39].  Hintsa et \nal.[40] focused on the coefficient coordination\
    \ between crop \nirrigation requirement, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), water use\
    \ \nefficiency (WUE), and field productivity, so that their study \nencourages\
    \ the optimal implementation of precise deficit irrigation \nand reduces a remarkable\
    \ amount of irrigation water by keeping \nstable crop productivity.  A mathematical\
    \ model called Reservoirs \nOperation \nOptimization \nconsidering \nsediment\
    \ \nevacuation \n(RESOOSE) was used to optimize irrigation deficit.  Using \n\
    RESOOSE model the irrigation deficit indexes in soil field could \nbe reduced\
    \ by 16% while maintaining existing benefits[41].   \n \nTable 1  Research progresses\

    equipment for monitoring moisture infiltration \nrate of soil[36-38] \n \nNowadays,\
    \ accurate estimation of soil water balance is \nsignificant to support the availability\
    \ of water resources and \noptimal irrigation management, which makes the process\
    \ \noptimization of precision irrigation necessary.  The determination \nof soil/water\
    \ balance parameters such as precipitation rate, \nevapotranspiration ratio, soil\
    \ moisture, and the leaching behavior of \nenvironmental nutrient phosphorus were\
    \ explained and evaluated \nby the use of lysimeters[42].  Mao et al.[43] and\
    \ Zurweller et al.[3] \nrespectively derived water balance model to simulate both\
    \ \ndownward and upward soil water movement, and optimal Nitrogen \nand irrigation\
    \ management in heterogeneous unsaturated zones.  \nSince the accuracy of soil\
    \ water content and evapotranspiration \nsimulation affect crop yield simulations,\
    \ DSSAT is a useful suite of \nfield-scale, process-based crop models to simulate\
    \ crop growth and \nprocess optimization[44,45].  By comparison, HYDRUS is an\
    \ \neffective hydrological model to investigate the probable effects of \nsubsurface\
    \ drainage on soil water dynamics[46-48].  By using these \ntwo models the scheduling\
    \ procedure of hydrologic needs can be \nsimulated[49,50].  When it comes to the\
    \ utilization of DSSAT \nmodels in precise drip irrigation, DSSAT was used on\
    \ the growth \nand yield occasions of the drip-irrigated crops[2,51].  Accordingly,\
    \ \nBhunia et al.[52], Asfandyar et al.[53], and Feng et al.[54] mapped the \n\
    spatial variation of water resources for irrigation purposes, and the \nimpact\
    \ quantification of center pivot irrigation system uniformity \nas well[4], all\
    \ these endeavors facilitate the process optimization of \nadvanced irrigation\
    \ techniques greatly. \nOn the topic of adaptive process optimization, the optimum\
    \ \nabstraction of groundwater resources was estimated for sustainable \nmanagement\
    \ of precision irrigation[55].  Similarly, a novel \n22   July, 2021         \
    \                Int J Agric & Biol Eng      Open Access at https://www.ijabe.org\
    \                           Vol. 14 No. 4 \nadaptive process optimization for\
    \ the real-time monitoring of \npressurized water irrigation pipeline network\
    \ has been proposed, by \nemploying multi-objective genetic approaches[56].  This\
    \ approach \nrealizes the optimum operational sectoring to increase economic \n\
    profit and decrease consumption cost, whilst satisfies the crop \ncultivation\
    \ demand by considering the temporal balance between \nsoil water content (SWC),\
    \ soil evaporation, and infield spatial \ninfiltration variability.  A novel parameter\
    \ optimization method \nusing Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)\
    \ \nbased upon orthogonal irrigation experiment, which could be \nsuitable to\
    \ the parametric optimization of precision irrigation \nprocess[57]. \nTo summarize\
    \ the process optimization of precision irrigation, \nit could be observed that\
    \ based on these mentioned attempts and \npreparations, more advanced optimization\
    \ techniques for precision \nirrigation were targeted and investigated to obtain\
    \ higher \nagriculture yield and irrigation qualities with a minimum cost; \n\
    especially, it could also be learned that the intelligent optimization \napproaches\
    \ for precision irrigation control, the adaptive equilibrium \nin irrigation parameter\
    \ selection, and the collaborative coordination \nof influential factors for soil\
    \ moisture uniformity and agricultural \ncrop productions, need to be explored\
    \ further in future. \n3  Schedule modelling of precision irrigation \nConcerning\
    \ appropriate schedule modelling of precision \nirrigation, there exist traditional\
    \ researches paid their main \nattentions on scheduling the crop yield per unit\
    \ area, by distributing \napplicable water resource to specific ranged fields\
    \ according to \ntheir corresponding irrigation requirements in soil/water content,\
    \ \nvapor pressure deficit, and groundwater quality for irrigation use.  \nIn\
    \ the past several years, some scholars concluded that those \neffective scheduling\
    \ models characterized by optimum agreement \nbetween their modeled results and\
    \ actual observed outcomes, \ndemonstrate certain inaccuracies and uncertainties\
    \ regrettably[58].  \nIn order to deal with this problem, some recent investigations\
    \ \nacknowledged that a nonlinear system can be simulated by the \nintegration\
    \ of linear sub-systems, which has already been \nconfirmed as a reliable schedule\
    \ modelling technique for the \nauthentication of non-linear optimization systems\
    \ in precise drip \nand alternative irrigation.  Furthermore, Liang et al. have\
    \ paid \ntheir endeavor on the concentration estimation of effectiveness \ncalibration\
    \ for precision irrigation by using turbulent flow \nproperties and neural network,\
    \ thereafter a multi-dimensional fuzzy \ncorrelation computation approach applicable\
    \ for flow energy \ndistribution and clustering characteristics could be provided[59,60],\
    \ \nthus a versatile modelling algorithm for intelligent scheduling of \nprecise\
    \ drip irrigation, covering such indexes as water use \nefficiency, consumption\
    \ of transpiration, saturated hydraulic \nconductivity, and water balance condition,\
    \ could be expected.   \nOn the other side, the new era of big data and ICT make\
    \ it \npossible to have a larger amount of agricultural information \navailable,\
    \ leading to the development and promotion of new \nprediction tools for the schedule\
    \ modelling of precision \nirrigation[61,62].  Besides, some related research\
    \ works on sensor \ncloud have primarily focused on the challenges of Wireless\
    \ Sensor \nNetwork (WSN)-based applications.  Smart irrigation enables the \n\
    collection of agricultural data and employment of automated \nfarming techniques\
    \ so that IoT is introduced widely to give farmers \nquick access to develop schedule\
    \ modelling and smart irrigation \nsystem[63].  IoT has a unique capacity to remotely\
    \ monitor \nessential irrigation variables such as soil moisture and water \n\
    infiltration concentration, and remotely operate the accompanied \nirrigation\
    \ equipment[64,65], it is expected to reduce the number of \nhuman labour required\
    \ and increase the accuracy of schedule \nmodelling.  Through improving soil moisture\
    \ content and \nsaturated hydraulic conductivity, IoT will considerably enhance\
    \ the \nschedule modelling efficiency and agricultural productivity for \npractical\
    \ irrigation performance[66,67].  In this manner, more \nresearch endeavors should\
    \ be made for affecting horticulture to \nbrilliant using IoT progresses in advanced\
    \ irrigation systems[68,69]. \n \nTable 2  Research progresses in the schedule\

    \  According to this novel conception Pawar et \nal.[93] improved water productivity\
    \ and cumulative infiltration ratio \nby using the calibrated AquaCrop model as\
    \ well.  Sepideh et al.[94] \nalso presented a systematic logical model for decision-making\

    water utilization, which was merited by using layer-structured \nmodular consisting\
    \ of a set of applicable schedule modules to \nachieve an unstructured assessment\

    \ relevant studies \nConesa et al.[96] analyzed the constructive influences of\

    \ \n \nBased on a comprehensive survey, Table 2 also presents the \nlatest research\
    \ progresses in the schedule modelling domain of \nprecision irrigation, all these\
    \ mentioned studies contribute greatly \nto the most-developed progress that can\
    \ be employed extensively in \nthe schedule modelling conditions of precision\
    \ irrigation.  \nAlthough most of them only focused on the pure irrigation \n\
    planning and infiltration modelling processes that describe the \ngrowth stage\
    \ of irrigated crop and variation of soil characteristics, a \nmore deliberate\
    \ analysis dealing with inherent characteristics and \ncorrelative influence is\
    \ absent in the current technical development \nof precision irrigation, therefore\
    \ some difficult problems \nconcerning accurate irrigation scheduling and their\
    \ correspondingly \ninfluence \nmechanisms \nare \nstill \nunstudied \nand \n\
    unsettled, \nunfortunately. \n \nAn \nefficient \nand \naccurate \nscheduling\
    \ \nimplementation of precision irrigation will facilitate the cultivation \n\
    monitoring and effectiveness upgrading for crop growth or in-field \nproductivity;\
    \ thereafter, the instructive assessments of correlative \nimpact caused from\
    \ all participant factors of precision irrigation \nschedule modelling, for instance,\
    \ soil water content, surface runoff \nand drainage, infield infiltration rate,\
    \ and water drop penetration \ntime, need to be developed and promoted further.\
    \ \n4  Effectiveness evaluation of precision irrigation \nAs it is well known\
    \ that efficient utilization of water and soil \nresource is becoming increasingly\
    \ essential for irrigation \nprofitability improvement, so that the effectiveness\
    \ evaluation of \nprecision irrigation, especially on water use efficiency, infiltration\
    \ \nrate, moisture diffusivity, cultivation water requirement, and crop \nproductivity,\
    \ is significant and necessary to meet the higher \nrequirements of agriculture\
    \ production nowadays.  In order to \nmake research preparation for the irrigation\
    \ effectiveness \nevaluation, Henrique et al.[100] dimensioned the potential \n\
    effectiveness of drip irrigation using the calibrated Food and \nAgriculture \n\
    Organization \n- \nAgroecological \nZone \nModel \n(FAO-AZM), and paying their\
    \ high attention to the calibrated \nlevels of cultivation water supply simultaneously.\
    \  Similarly, Luo \net al.[101] investigated the quantitative impacts of water-saving\
    \ \nsprinkling on weed growth and plant spread in rice fields, and \nfound that\
    \ the novel water-saving sprinkling method they proposed \nnot only decreases\
    \ irrigation water amount greatly but also \npromotes \nwater \nproductivity \n\
    and \nirrigation \neffectiveness \nremarkably.  According to this realistic demand,\
    \ Christopher et \nal.[102] introduced an innovative effectiveness evaluation\
    \ method \nthat aims to identify predominant geochemical changes in the \ngroundwater\
    \ system, providing a reliable and accurate tool to \ndetermine infiltration opportunity\
    \ time and evaluate irrigation \neffectiveness in the subjects of moisture infiltration,\
    \ water balance \ncondition, and soil water storage.  More relevant researches\
    \ and \non-the-spot investigations on the latest achievements concerning \nthe\
    \ effectiveness evaluation and performance assessment for \nprecision irrigation\
    \ can also be referenced[103].  Some existing \ndifficult problems, such as the\
    \ effectiveness comparisons and \ncorrelative analysis between irrigation schedules,\
    \ the energy \nconsumption of irrigation network, the optimal relative proportions\
    \ \nof deep drainage and tail water, and multi-objective parametric \noptimization\
    \ subject to uncertain agriculture conditions, could be \nsolved in return[104].\

    \ on crop productivity and quality coefficients \nhave already been studied[110].\
    \  Since the remarkable impacts of \nspecific irrigation approaches on plant growth\
    \ are important in the \nstatistic domain, the persistent influences of waste\
    \ water irrigation \non the electrical conductivity of field soil, moisture content,\

    \ field conditions, have been evaluated[114].  Their result \ncomparison shows\
    \ that its effectiveness influences on soil field \nshould be determined according\
    \ to actual site environment.  \nDiscrepancies between them are due to specific\
    \ waste water and \nsoil properties, climate conditions, and moisture evaporation.\

    \  Meanwhile Smith et al.[115] \ndemonstrated the application efficiency using\
    \ a similar irrigation \nmodelling technique for high-flow bay accordingly.  Furthermore,\
    \ \nin order to highlight the constructive impacts of crop cultivation \napproaches\
    \ and precise deficit irrigation, Safi et al.[116] implemented \northogonal irrigation\
    \ experiments concentrating on the treatments \nand evaluations of direct seeding\
    \ and precise deficit irrigation.  \nAccording to the schematic diagram plotted\
    \ by Figure 2, full \nirrigation is recommended first to achieve the highest crop\
    \ yield \nwith low transpiration rate and drainage consumption, then water \n\
    deficit during the later stage is highly recommended for irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ if the economic benefits, water equilibrium condition, \nand irrigation efficiency\
    \ be considered in the studied field region.  \n \nFigure 2  Schematic diagram\
    \ describing the network layout of experimental irrigation plot[43] \n \nAs the\
    \ complicated correlation between soil organic matter, \neffective cation exchange\
    \ capacity (ECEC), exchangeable bases, \nand hydrogen ion concentration (pH) was\
    \ defined, Adejumobi et \nal.[117] determined the effectiveness indexes of precision\
    \ irrigation \non soil quality status.  Since waste water use in precision \n\
    irrigation becomes a widely accepted operation to satisfy the \nrapid-increasing\
    \ water demands in dry areas[118], the crop yield \ncould be promoted remarkably\
    \ during the high-efficient irrigation \noperations in the beginning but reduced\
    \ in the low-efficient \nirrigation operations, as Figure 3 presents their detailed\
    \ evolution \nthroughout irrigation operation processes.  At the same time, \n\

    \           Vol. 14 No. 4   25 \n \nAccording to the development tendency of intelligent\
    \ \nevaluation for precision irrigation effectiveness, Ramesh et al. and \nVinoth\
    \ et al. proposed IoT framework to improve agriculture yield \nby scheduling irrigation\
    \ and fertilization effectively based on the \ncrops’ current requirements[123],\
    \ environmental conditions, and \nweather forecasts[124].  Keswani et al.[125]\
    \ relied on independent \nIoT enabled WSN framework consisting of soil moisture\
    \ (MC) \nprobe, \nsoil \ntemperature \nmeasuring \ndevice, \nenvironmental \n\
    temperature sensor, humidity sensing device, moisture sensor, \ndaylight intensity\
    \ device (light dependent resistor), to acquire \nreal-time farm information of\
    \ irrigation effectiveness through \nmulti-point measurement[9,126].  Moreover,\
    \ IoT and sensors were \nemployed to efficiently record plant data and watering\
    \ needs[127], \nthereafter the effectiveness evaluation approach was implemented\
    \ \nwith a mobile phone application interface that could be used to \ncontinuously\
    \ monitor and control the efficient watering system.  \nSince all these effectiveness\
    \ evaluation technologies have been \nintroduced to the implementation occasions\
    \ of precision irrigation, \ntheir productive influences on the irrigation quality\
    \ and relevant \nworking properties should be discussed for the interests of \n\
    effectiveness promotion. \nSince the identification and assessment of optimal\
    \ irrigation \nperformance should be studied to determine the exact \neffectiveness\
    \ level of precision irrigation, Önder et al.[112] \nintroduced a risk assessment\
    \ procedure to quantify the \nmostappropriate effectiveness indexes in the actual\
    \ irrigation \nprocess.  Based on this assessment Ge et al.[128] took \nrepresentative\
    \ irrigation treatments to learn the complicated effect \nof sprinkling time intervals\
    \ on the crop growth situation.  \nFurthermore, Table 3 demonstrates current research\
    \ progresses in \nthe effectiveness evaluation of precision irrigation.  Using\
    \ a new \ndrought index[129], a set of useful predicted soil moisture data \n\
    could be obtained from a variable infiltration capacity (VIC) \nestimation over\
    \ the irrigated area, they monitored the profound \ninfluence of dry climate on\
    \ surface runoff and drainage, \nsoil\\water redistribution effect, and moisture\
    \ diffusivity by using \napplicable effectiveness evaluation mode.  Pawlowski\
    \ et al.[130] \nalso presented the effectiveness study and practical evaluation\
    \ for \na greenhouse irrigation system.  Figure 5 describes the \ncomparison of\
    \ water volume for precision irrigation management \nand water balance simulation\
    \ model respectively, and Figure 6 \ngives the research progress and equipment\

    \ and characterize specific soil-irrigation \noperations, they have studied the\
    \ complicated influences of \ndifferent effectiveness factors on the obtained\
    \ cultivation outcomes \nor growth stages of objective crop plants; Thirdly, these\
    \ \ninvestigations proposed many effective evaluation methods to \nreveal actual\
    \ effectiveness principle, and made insightful \ndiscussions of effective schedule\
    \ optimization and accurate \ninfiltration-monitoring principles; Finally, all\
    \ these researches \nprovided original suggestions concerning the process control\
    \ and \neffect evaluation for remarkable improvement of irrigation \neffectiveness.\
    \  Thus, the applicable evaluation methods, the \nintegrative designing of irrigation\

    \ mutual \ninfluences between crop cultivation, soil condition, moisture \ninfiltration,\
    \ and irrigation techniques, would be our priority efforts \nin the next few years.\

    \ from Figure 8 that effective irrigation \nscheduling \napproaches, \nincluding\
    \ \nAquaCrop, \nAquaGIS, \nCROPWAT, favorably reduced the amount of water consumption\

    \ methods such as Normalized Sparse \nAutoencoder-Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy\
    \ Inference System \n(NSAE-ANFIS), IoT, and WSN, the service level of irrigation\
    \ \napplication for sustainable crop production has been investigated to \ntest\
    \ the model reliability of water withdrawal and soil evaporation, \nthus the moisture\
    \ equilibrium and groundwater infiltration \nmonitoring could be guaranteed more\
    \ easily.  Their future \nperspectives are promising but three major problems\
    \ exist: \n (1) How to build up a generic precision irrigation system that \n\
    enables the improvement of soil moisture uniformity and \nacceleration efficiency\
    \ for crop cultivation? The inner structure of \nthose optimized irrigation systems\
    \ should be made generic in order \nto standardize the irrigation process and\
    \ ease their functional \ndesign; \n(2) What is the best way to integrate schedule\
    \ modeling in the \narchitecture of precision irrigation systems? As the irrigation\
    \ \ndevelopment is speeding up, the numerical simulation and adaptive \ncontrol\
    \ of irrigation scheduling need to be synchronized.  Also, \nthe triggering of\
    \ schedule modeling based on the behaviour of the \nirrigation system or the adaptive\
    \ control makes the irrigation task \nstill more difficult, as it requires the\
    \ irrigation scheduling \nresponsible for the agricultural production management;\
    \ \n(3) How to define a full set of irrigation effectiveness that is \nrepresentative\
    \ of the diversity of irrigation systems encountered \nand objectives expected?\
    \ To guarantee the high-efficient \nperformance of precision irrigation, effectiveness\
    \ evaluation is \nsignificant with respect to management considerations, considering\
    \ \nthat evaluation of irrigation effectiveness is one of the most \nimportant\
    \ subjects towards the determination of irrigation \ncapability in various experimental\
    \ conditions. \nBased on these problems this section underlines, several \nresearch\
    \ directions could lead to new developments for precision \nirrigation: \n1) Data-oriented\
    \ irrigation technique integrating artificial \nintelligence functions to exploit\
    \ the self-learning ability and to \nensure data connectivity.  Distributed learning\
    \ mechanisms could \nbe integrated into actual precision irrigation in order to\
    \ optimize the \nirrigation process, increase its working effectiveness, and improve\
    \ \nthe efficiency adaptability; \n2) Dynamic process virtualization of precision\
    \ irrigation \ncapable of exhibiting working behaviour and decision making \n\
    support while keeping a certain quality of crop cultivation, thus the \noptimal\
    \ irrigation performance could be obtained based on current \nexperimental irrigation\
    \ conditions; \n3) Real-time feedback capabilities that will integrate \nenvironmental\
    \ information processing with precision irrigation \nsystem, to better monitor\
    \ and plan the operation of controlled \nprecision irrigation system, thereafter\
    \ the high-efficient schedule \nmodelling of irrigation performance could be expected;\
    \ \n4) Interoperability and adaptability of participant components \nin the precision\
    \ irrigation system, which capable of operating \nirrigation system for multi-objective\
    \ crop cultivation services in \nvarious environmental conditions with stable\
    \ working performance \nand secure information exchanges; \n5) Sustainable effectiveness\
    \ management of precision \nirrigation, able to control the resource consumption\
    \ and \nimplementing working effectiveness of irrigation systems while \nfully\
    \ integrating the latest technical developments and practical \nirrigation \n\
    requirements \ntogether, \nincluding \ninfield \nspatial \ninfiltration, water\
    \ drop penetration, and groundwater quality for \nirrigation use as well. \nSince\
    \ Table 4 illustrates the temporal progress of irrigation \nmodels and their influential\
    \ factor contributions, these research \ndirections bring remarkable improvements\
    \ and rapid developments \nto build up a sustainable, secure, integrated, and\

    \  \nIt is worth noting that the novelty of this review lies in the \ncombination\
    \ of theoretical researches and technical employments \nin irrigation practice,\
    \ making it could be conveniently promoted in \na lot of actual applications such\
    \ as irrigation improvement, \nagricultural crop production, and relevant farming\

    \ \ntheir \npromising \noutcomes \nand \ninteractive \nmechanism could also be\

    Mechanism (ACO/LIDM), and genetic algorithm, have been \nexplained, contributing\
    \ to the optimum result of soil water content \nand evapotranspiration simulations\
    \ with higher reliability and \nbetter stability.  The actual optimized results\
    \ demonstrated that \nextraordinary promotions in irrigation performance could\
    \ be \nanticipated through employing appropriate process optimization \napproaches\
    \ when such advanced irrigation techniques of soil water \nbalance models, hydrologic\
    \ models, DSSAT, and HYDRUS \nmodels being applied, therefore the detailed discussions\
    \ and \nconclusive comparisons between objective irrigation influence and \nobtained\

    \ so that a set of novel modelling methods such as IoT, \nWSN, ICT, have been\
    \ proposed and tested to develop schedule \nmodelling and smart irrigation system\
    \ in the past few years, which \nprovided more instructive demonstrations and\
    \ heuristic descriptions \nfor the working principles of precision irrigation\
    \ and the \nquantitative assessments of irrigation productivity, especially in\
    \ \nrepresentative subjects such as soil evaporation rate, soil water \nredistribution,\
    \ and groundwater quality for irrigation use.  \nFurthermore, in this subject\
    \ many new schedule modelling \nalgorithms have been testified for their excellent\
    \ accuracy and \noutstanding efficiency: AquaCrop, AquaGIS, Surface Energy \n\
    Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), 3-D groundwater flow \nmodel (MODFLOW), QUAL2E-UNCAS,\
    \ etc.  It is an obvious \ntendency that more advanced schedule modelling methods,\
    \ would \nbe expected to enhance scheduling efficiency and agricultural \nproductivity\
    \ in the future; \n(3) Recent irrigation researches have focused on the \neffectiveness\
    \ evaluation to confirm their operational mechanisms \nand constructive influences.\
    \  For the purpose of promoting the \nprocessing efficiency and treatment quality,\
    \ reliable integration of \nreal-time farming information is extremely significant\
    \ so as to \nobtain better irrigation effect and higher production efficiency,\
    \ \nsimultaneously to achieve better irrigation qualities in water-soil \nbalance,\
    \ water redistribution, moisture uniformity, etc.  As typical \nevaluation methods\
    \ have already been used, such as CROPWAT, \nParticle Swarm Optimization-Support\
    \ Vector Machine (PSO-SVM), \nIoT, \nWireless \nSensor \nNetwork \n(WSN) \nframework,\
    \ \nand \nNSAE-ANFIS, to monitor and control the efficient watering effect \n\
    for crop plants, a cogent understanding and process analysis of \ncrop-soil interaction\
    \ would be realized, so that an optimum \nintegration of influential factors and\
    \ operational effectiveness is \nguaranteed and therefore the upgraded agriculture\
    \ yield could be \nexpected thereby, otherwise the deteriorated crop growth, inferior\
    \ \nsoil quality, and low circulation efficiency of water resource would \nbe\
    \ obtained. \nThis review turns out that precision irrigation witnesses great\
    \ \ndevelopment prospects and deserves considerable expectations for \nits \n\
    outstanding \nworking \nefficiency, \naccurate \nproductivity \nmanagement, and\
    \ stable product quality.  It drafts the \ncomprehensive development picture and\
    \ latest investigation status \non typical precision irrigation techniques.  The\
    \ conceptual and \nsystematic progress of precision irrigation in process mechanisms,\

    cities contain intelligent things which can intelligently automatically and collaboratively
    enhance life quality, save people''s lives, and act a sustainable resource ecosystem.
    To achieve these advanced collaborative technologies such as drones, robotics,
    artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) are required to increase
    the smartness of smart cities by improving the connectivity, energy efficiency,
    and quality of services (QoS). Therefore, collaborative drones and IoT play a
    vital role in supporting a lot of smart-city applications such as those involved
    in communication, transportation, agriculture,safety and security, disaster mitigation,
    environmental protection, service delivery, energy saving, e-waste reduction,
    weather monitoring, healthcare, etc. This paper presents a survey of the potential
    techniques and applications of collaborative drones and IoT which have recently
    been proposed in order to increase the smartness of smart cities. It provides
    a comprehensive overview highlighting the recent and ongoing research on collaborative
    drone and IoT in improving the real-time application of smart cities. This survey
    is different from previous ones in term of breadth, scope, and focus. In particular,
    we focus on the new concept of collaborative drones and IoT for improving smart-city
    applications. This survey attempts to show how collaborative drones and IoT improve
    the smartness of smart cities based on data collection, privacy and security,
    public safety, disaster management, energy consumption and quality of life in
    smart cities. It mainly focuses on the measurement of the smartness of smart cities,

    I. Introduction In the context of smart cities, the smartness measurement is related
    to quality of life, healthcare, public safety, disaster management, environmental
    aspects (such as energy efficiency, air quality, traffic monitoring, etc.), and
    services. Consequently, advanced and modern Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and robotics play vital roles in making cities
    smarter. These technologies help improve the infrastructure of smart cities and
    make smart services possible in order to improve the overall quality of life of
    the residents. An important aspect of smart cities is the provision of efficient
    infrastructure and the reduction of the cost of services while making such services
    and facilities ubiquitous. Recently, several studies have been conducted to enhance
    the characteristics of smart cities [1], [2] in different domains [3] and different
    aspects [4], [5], and with a focus on sustainability [6], [7]. A common undercurrent
    that runs in all of these studies is the fact that efficient integration of smart
    services and ICT solutions is required. More recently, drone technology has significantly
    contributed to making a city smarter. Presently, it is difficult to envisage a
    smart city without drone services [8]. Drones are autonomous robots that fly in
    the sky and are associated with different applications in civilian society such
    as communication, transportation, agriculture, safety and security, disaster mitigation,
    environmental protection, intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance
    operations. Drones are poised to become an integral part of smart cities and improve
    overall life experience in the sense of monitoring pollution, accident investigation,
    fire-fighting, package delivery, supporting first responder activities, delivering
    medicine, monitoring traffic, and supervising construction sites. Drone technology
    can further lead to enormous secondary benefits such as reducing power consumption,
    conserving resources, reducing pollution, accessing hazardous and disaster areas,
    and increasing preparedness for emergencies. Advances in technologies in the area
    of sensors, data processing, and rechargeable batteries have made drones more
    affordable. Drones can also act as aerial base station (BS) to deliver communication
    services (both uplink and downlink) for the subscribers on the ground. Agility
    and line-of-sight (LoS) are the features that have made drones play an essential
    role in the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. The advent of IoT has enabled
    significant advances in smart cities applications such as smart homes, smart streets,
    smart parking, smart power grids, etc. The main idea of IoT is that everything
    can connect and communicate over the Internet, for example,smartphones, buildings,
    home appliances, vehicles, and even natural objects, creating a smart world and
    vast global infrastructure for an information-driven society. The development
    of such applications has become critical to our lifestyles, the economy, and the
    environment. Apart from economic growth, the overall development of a geographical
    entity is also driven by green technologies which protect the environment from
    harmful emissions and hazardous wastes, conserve natural resources, mitigate the
    consequences of climate change, and reduce pollution and power consumption. A
    massive number of IoT devices which can cooperate, communicate and share information,
    is the needed for modern smart city infrastructure. Considering that a large number
    of interconnected devices is required, the minimization of operating costs and
    power conservation strategies is becoming more and more critical [9]–[11]. Load
    balancing also plays a vital role in enhancing the lifetime of the network by
    reducing the over-consumption of energy by smart devices. Drones can move dynamically
    towards the IoT devices and collect data, establish a real-time connection, process
    the data and transmit information over to the collection nodes or other devices
    [12]. The efficient deployment and mobility of drones to collect data from IoT
    devices on the ground with minimum transmit power and enhanced communication reliability
    and connectivity were investigated in [13], [14]. It was reported that IoT transmitted
    power can be reduced by 45% while increasing the yield to a maximum of 28% [13].
    Also, in another related work, a drone was considered the middleware for energy
    efficient discovery in the IoT and sensor networks [15]. The proposed technique
    provided an efficient energy model to offer IoT and sensor network solutions.
    Furthermore, Motlagh et al. [16] proposed a steering technique among multiple
    4G networks to ensure reliable connectivity of smart devices with drones, which
    supports a high quality of service (QoS) and consumes an acceptable amount of
    energy. Mozaffari et al. [17] proposed a multi-clustering technique of IoT devices
    wherein each cluster was served by one or more drone. Due to the use of drones,
    the transmitted power of the IoT devices reduced by 56% compared to the fixed
    Voronoi deployment method. In this particular case, drones were used to enhance
    the energy efficiency because the transmission range of IoT devices was limited
    [18]. Furthermore, the collaborative wireless network between drones and IoT devices
    plays a vital role in providing an efficient solution to the routing loop problem
    in traditional sensor networks, and enhancing the lifetime of the sensors through
    optimal division of the load. However, these solutions rely on the formation of
    an optimal topology and routing scheme for utilization of the coordination between
    the drones and the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Briefly, as shown in Fig. 1,
    a collaboration between drones and IoT can provide broad applications in smart
    cities such as the monitoring of large areas, border surveillance, data gathering,
    public safety, disaster management, and obstacle avoidance [19]. Figure. 1 shows
    the collaboration of drones and IoT for several applications of smart cities such
    as gathering data from IoT devices for energy efficiency, collecting pollution
    data and predicting the air quality, monitoring sport events, generating high
    resolution 3D maps, providing security, disaster management for saving people’s
    lives, delivering services such as food and blood in real time, and monitoring
    accidents and victims. FIGURE 1. Collaborative drone and IoT for improving the
    smartness of smart cities. Show All A. Related Work Many studies have surveyed
    technologies and strategies related to enhancing the smartness level of smart
    cities by using drones in different applications [17], [20]–[29]. The smartness
    of smart cities has been evaluated on several factors such as smart living, smart
    environment, smart people, smart economy, smart mobility, smart tourism, smart
    governance and so on. Mohamed et al. [24] reviewed the potential applications
    of, and technical issues arising from, integrated drones in smart cities. Furthermore,
    they discussed the enabling technologies which have been developed to support
    the integration of drone in smart cities. The authors of [21] summarized the enabling
    technologies that could be used for green IoT for making smart cities smarter
    and greener. The authors of [23] described drone-enabled intelligent transportation
    for a smart city. They also highlighted the potential applications and challenges
    for drone-enabled intelligent transportation for next generation smart cities.
    Alam et al. [20] presented an architecture of an intelligent transportation system
    with distributed and decentralized decision making to make streets smarter by
    smart parking. Under this system, traffic management would be managed efficiently
    in smart cities by locating the vacant parking slots and communicating this information
    to drivers in a given area. Furthermore, the authors of [29] discussed various
    frameworks for smart cities monitoring based on smart drones. Authors of [22]
    surveyed the potential physical- and cyber-threats which might arise from the
    use of drones in different ways to track, detect, and interdict malicious drones.
    The authors of [28] reviewed various aspects of drone usage such as privacy, cyber-security,
    and public safety in future smart cities. Motlagh et al. [26] highlighted and
    reviewed drone architecture for delivering IoT services from a drone. Furthermore,
    they discussed the use of drones equipped with IoT devices such as Radio Frequency
    IDentification (RFID), sensors, and cameras that are used for data collection.
    The authors of [25] introduced the concept of drones-equipped with IoT devices
    for delivering services to a large coverage area from a drone in the sky. They
    mainly discussed how a drone could be used for crowd surveillance based on face
    recognition. Furthermore, they compared video data processing on the drone payload
    and mobile edge computing node. The findings demonstrated the efficiency of the
    mobile edge computing based offloading technique in the context of processing
    time, and energy consumption. The authors of [17] described how swarm drones could
    be used for collecting data from IoT devices on the ground to minimize the transmission
    power from IoT devices. Each drone was shown to deliver services to a cluster
    of IoT devices on the ground by taking the mobility of IoT devices in smart cities
    into consideration. The authors of [18] extended the collaboration between drone-enabled
    connectivity and IoT. A drone was considered to serve the ground users such as
    download users and device-to-device users. The findings showed that the usage
    of device-to-device users fell with an increase in the drone height because of
    the fact that a greater distance from the drone increased the path loss. Processing
    the collected data onboard a drone is required for several operations such as
    image processing, path monitoring and control, and dynamic sense. The authors
    of [30] designed powerful and useful devices for processing data with low power
    consumption. The authors of [31] applied machine learning schemes to images captured
    by drone-based IoT devices such as cameras. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to identify the exact videos and
    images taken by IoT devices on the drone. Briefly, the surveys conducted in [26]
    and [25] were primarily limited to architectures for delivering IoT services from
    drones. Similarly, the surveys conducted in [20], [23] were restricted to intelligent
    transportation in smart cities by using a drone. The studies in [27] and [22]
    focused on the applications and benefits of drones for wireless telecommunication.
    Furthermore, the studies detailed in [24] and [21] looked at the enabling technologies
    that integrate drones and smart cities to make them smarter and greener. Besides,
    the authors of [28] only discussed the drone applications for privacy and public
    safety, while the monitoring issues in a smart city were discussed in [29]. In
    short, the existing literature on collaborative drones and IoT for smart cities
    applications is fragmented and calls for a comprehensive overview of how the collaboration
    between drones and IoT can indeed be used. Surprisingly, no review has been thoroughly
    carried out considering the importance of drone collaboration and IoT, to improve
    the smartness of smart cities, and its applications. In light of the above discussion,
    a comparison of related work is shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Surveys
    Highlighted and Current Work B. Contribution The main contribution of this paper
    is the provision of a comprehensive overview of collaborative drones and IoT applications
    for smart cities. Toward this aim, the approach is to gather the available research
    contributions from the sparse literature on drone-based IoT, that addresses the
    applications, challenges, and opportunities of drone collaborations with IoT frameworks
    for improving life quality in smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this
    survey constitutes one of the first comprehensive surveys on how to fully exploit
    the potential of collaborative drones and IoT applications for improving the smartness
    of smart cities. Also, we highlight the drone’s potential for delivering IoT services
    from the sky. In order to achieve the aim of this paper, we address the following
    key topics, as shown in Fig. 2: In section II, we present a comprehensive overview
    of the collaboration of drones and IoT. In section III, we provide a discussion
    on security and privacy issues, as well as promising solutions associated with
    the collaboration of drones and IoT for enhancing the smartness of smart cities.
    In section IV, we discuss how collaborations between drones and IoT devices could
    be used to reduce energy consumption and increase the smartness and greening of
    smart cities. In section V, we outline the crucial role of collaboration between
    drones and IoT in gathering data. The collection of smart data and on-board processing
    in real-time plays a vital role in enhancing smart city applications. In section
    VI, we highlight how IoT and drone collaborations could be leveraged for improving
    life quality by controlling the pollution hazards of smart cities. In section
    VII, we discuss issues related to public safety in smart cities, and determine
    how a collaborative arrangement between drones and IoT may help. In Section VIII,
    we introduce the collaboration of drones and IoT for disaster management in smart
    cities. In section IX, we provide a summary of the applications of drone and IoT
    collaboration for smart cities. Lastly, discussion and future directions are highlighted
    in Section X. FIGURE 2. Survey contributions. Show All SECTION II. Overview of
    the Collaboration Between Drones and the IoT Collaboration between advanced technologies
    is about sharing information for performing common tasks effectively and efficiently
    according to needs. The benefits and applications of drones in wireless telecommunication
    were presented in [27]. Therefore, the collaboration of IoT devices for sensing
    data leads to an increase in the accuracy of data collection by exploiting the
    similarity of capturing data from multiple IoT devices [40]. Collaboration within
    the fog cloud of IoT devices was discussed in [33]. The authors of [8] presented
    the applications, challenges, and opportunities for drones in smart cities. Several
    challenges were discussed, such as privacy, safety, and ethical use. Furthermore,
    the issues of cybersecurity, public safety, and privacy of drones for smart cities
    were discussed in [28]. A. Smart Drones A drone has unique characteristics. It
    is dynamic, easy to repair, easy to deploy, and able to measure a multitude of
    quantities from anywhere at any time. It is a low-cost solution for collecting
    and delivering information to intelligent mechanisms/software capable of performing
    the required data analysis (such as analyzing the image or video in real time).
    The usage of the drone will dramatically facilitate the development of farming,
    defense, insurance inspection, law enforcement, emergency aid, pollution monitoring,
    disaster recovery, parcel delivery, and many other industries. Therefore, drones
    play a significant role in our connection with society as well as improving the
    quality of life in smart cities. The number of drones in the air is expected to
    grow rapidly in the coming years. Drones have enormous potential to enable many
    applications related to military, civilian, governmental sector and commercial
    aspects, due to their capability to perform complex tasks effectively and efficiently
    in real time. Jensen [41] introduced the drone phenomenon and its potential application
    for smart cities. He explored the connectivity issues related to drones for smart
    cities and discussed how drones would enhance smart cities applications, such
    as tracking, surveillance, and object detection; general purpose distributed processing
    application; data collection; path planning; navigation; and collision prevention,
    as shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the authors [42] discussed the convergence of
    several machine learning techniques for path planning effectively and efficiently
    to enhance the connectivity, mobility, and QoS. FIGURE 3. Drone applications categories.
    Show All A group of drones represents a cluster which uses the Flying Ad-hoc NETwork
    (FANET) technology for communication among its members, and also for sharing data
    gathered (by the onboard IoT devices) with other IoT devices on the ground. Using
    their inherent properties of ability, mobility, and agility, drones can efficiently
    enhance the QoS of 5G cellular networks. Also, they have been deployed to improve
    wireless capacity and coverage at temporary events such as sports, disaster recovery,
    crime monitoring, etc. [43]. Drones have also been used to enable the communication
    when traditional wireless networks are destroyed to support disaster relief activities
    [44]. Similarly, Merwaday and Guvenc [45] explored the use of a drone BS as a
    temporary station during a disaster relief operation. In addition to the work
    of [44], [45], Bor-Yaliniz and Yanikomeroglu [46] envisioned a drone cellular
    network which is capable of bringing the delivery of wireless networks to anywhere
    based on demand and at any time. Authors of [47] considered drone as a sink node
    in a wireless communication network for collecting data from sensors. The optimization
    of the drone network service area was also investigated. A drone payload may contain
    an on-board computer, and sensors connected to other devices, which allow humans
    to control it. Furthermore, it can be programmed to carry out tasks, and fly itself
    according to the guidance of its internal systems. Also, it can be controlled
    by using remote computers to carry out the tasks of physical security and agriculture.
    Drones can also provide effective help to track deforestation and monitor environmental
    parameters such as air and water quality. Furthermore, small tracking devices,
    which can be monitored through drones, are used to observe and quantify endangered
    species. Smart drones must be designed to achieve the convergence of four aspects
    which are data, connectivity, services, and type of devices used. Smart drones
    are being used to support first responders’ tasks, document accident scenes, and
    monitor construction sites, and therefore, drones are poised to become an integral
    network part of smart cities. By promising a connected society and cheap storage,
    processing, and robotics, drones are leading the way toward a revolution in smart
    cities. B. Drone, ICT, and IoT for Smart Cities Information and Communication
    Technologies (ICT) have evolved into a diverse ecosystem, which combines robots,
    sensors, communication technologies, software, humans and real-time processing.
    For instance, Amsterdam is using ICT for maintaining a sustainable lifestyle,
    while London is using ICT to process waste and ensure proper utilization of resources.
    Furthermore, ICT plays a vital role in improving smart cities, but the security
    challenges need to be managed because of their inherent part of ICT [59]–[61].
    Drone technology is the future of IoT and is slated to provide a revolution in
    IoT developments and applications especially in smart cities. Some researchers
    even consider the drone to be an essential IoT device [62], [63]. Furthermore,
    IoT devices have also been used to enhance the potential tasks of swarm drones
    for providing autonomous cooperation [64]. With the advances in ICT, IoT presents
    a high potential to bolster economic and environmental sustainability [9]. These
    hot and green technologies, such as machine to machine (M2M) communications, sensors,
    RFID, 5G cellular networks, etc., make the cities greener and smarter [14]. An
    evaluation of the impact of ICT on important issues with environmental concerns
    (e.g. power consumption and CO2 emissions) was presented in [21], [65]. 1) Drones
    and RFID RFID is considered one of the most promising wireless communication systems
    used to enable IoT. Furthermore, it does not need LoS and can map the real world
    into a visual map very easily [66]. RFID devices can be classified as passive
    and active [66]. RFID plays a vital role that helps the world to be greener by
    reducing the emissions of the vehicle, saving energy and improving waste disposal,
    etc. Reducing the size of RFID tags and producing energy efficient algorithms
    for optimizing tag estimation are required for green RFID [66]–[70]. Hubbard et
    al. [48] discussed the combination of drone and RFID technologies, and focused
    on enhancing the lifetime of drone battery and RFID reader detection range. The
    advantage of combining drones and RFID is the provision of additional information
    that can be implemented in supply chain management systems. Similarly, the authors
    of [49] proposed a feasibility analysis of how it is possible to recharge a multipurpose
    RFID tag using a drone in an environmental monitoring operations. Furthermore,
    the study in [50] presented a solution for monitoring operation in harsh environments
    using RFID with a drone. It proposed a set of RFID tags that can be equipped with
    various sets of sensors and distributed over the monitored area with a reader
    installed on the drone. The main idea of using a drone is to collect data from
    the RFID sensors scattered throughout the area by directly approaching them, flying
    above them, and downloading measured data [50]. Previous findings show that the
    system works coherently and tags can be powerful monitoring instruments, especially
    where the monitoring is needed for a large area or a harsh environment. Choi et
    al. [51] studied the drone indoor localization technique using passive Ultra-High
    Frequency (UHF) far-field RFID systems. The study aimed to achieve simple and
    cost efficient for drone tracking and localization. 2) Drones and Sensors A sensor
    node is a combination of an enormous number of small sensing devices, power sources,
    processing equipment and communication unit(s), which has been discussed in detail
    in [71]. Sensor nodes are being deployed around the world to measure local and
    global environmental conditions. They have limited power and low processing as
    well as small storage capacity, while Base Station (BS) node is powerful. Each
    sensor node reads parameters such as temperature, sound, pressure, humidity, acceleration,
    etc from its surroundings. Sensors also communicate with each other and deliver
    the needed sensory data to the BS using ad-hoc technology. Mehmood and Song [72]
    discussed smart energy, efficient routing communication protocols for WSN concerning
    the design trade-offs. WSNs have been used in various applications in smart cities
    such as fire detection [73]–[75], object tracking [76]–[78], environmental monitoring
    [52], [71], [79], [80], routing and load-balancing [81], [82], evolving constraints
    in the military [83], control and monitoring of machine health, and industrial
    process monitoring [71]. The idea of green IoT has arisen for keeping sensor nodes
    in sleep mode for most of their life to save energy [84], [85]. WSNs can be realized
    very simply when data communication occurs at ultra-low power. Sensors can utilize
    energy harvested directly from the environment such as the sun, vibrations, kinetic
    energy, temperature differentials, etc. [86]–[88]. Therefore, green WSN is an
    emerging concept in which the lifespan and throughput performance are maximized
    while the CO2 emissions are reduced. The goal of WSN is to supply sufficient energy
    to enhance the system lifetime and contribute to reliable/robust transmission
    without compromising the overall QoS. Zhao et al. [89] proposed a QoS routing
    path selection scheme for wireless community mesh networks in which the quality
    of the channel is monitored and can be used to enhance the communication efficiency
    in smart cities. The study detailed in [11] proposed an optimization method for
    the implementation for an energy efficient and scalable IoT. The technique introduces
    a hierarchical network design, a model for the energy efficient IoT and a minimum
    energy consumption transmission algorithm to implement the optimal model. The
    results show that the technique is more energy efficient and flexible than the
    traditional WSN technique and consequently it can be implemented for efficient
    communication in the green IoT. Similarly, to improve energy efficiency of WSNs,
    the authors of [90] investigated a technique that showed a significant improvement
    in energy savings and reduced the delays. In addition to the work of [11], [90],
    the study in [91] focused on increasing the energy efficiency, extending the network’s
    lifetime, reducing of some relay nodes, and reducing the system budget for green
    IoT. The work was implemented in four steps. First, a hierarchical system framework
    was created and sensor/actuator nodes, relay nodes, and BS were placed. The second
    step was node clustering. The third step was the creation of an optimization model
    to realize IoT, and finally, the fourth step was the calculation of minimal energy
    among the nodes. The findings show that the proposed approach is pliable, energy-saving
    and cost-effective when compared with the existing WSNs deployment scheme. Furthermore,
    the study in [92] investigated wireless energy harvesting, the wake-up radio scheme,
    and error control coding to enable solutions for enhancing the performance of
    green WSNs while reducing their carbon footprint. IoT sensor networks are required
    for a large number of sensors deployed over large areas. The collection of data
    from each sensor in an IoT based sensor network is difficult as it generates a
    tremendous volume of sensing data and requires drones to follow along long routes
    resulting in high energy consumption, higher delays, and exposure to hazardous
    environments. Therefore, the use of drones has been proposed for IoT sensor networks.
    To enhance the functionality of the drones, Malaver et al. [93] presented the
    development of integration of a WSN and a drone-powered by solar energy to improve
    their versatility for different applications. The CO2 concentration was also monitored
    in real-time during data collection by using the integrated system. This system
    was applicable and recommended for different applications such as agriculture,
    mining studies, bush-fires, and zoological and botanical studies [94]. Furthermore,
    the particle swarm optimization technique (PSO) was used to analyze data gathered
    by the integrated system [95]. Also, the collection data with low power and a
    large coverage area using a particular integrated system was discussed in [52].
    During a data gathering process, data may take two paths. First, data can be transmitted
    from the sensors at the ground to the airborne drone. Then, this data is sent
    from the drone to the central analysis station. The bandwidth allocation and energy
    allocation for sensing and transmitting data in the two steps have been considered
    and discussed [53]. Therefore, the combination of drones and WSNs can provide
    a solution for the utilization of energy resources. Drones have the capability
    to control the mode of the sensor network node (sleep or active) for energy efficiency.
    Furthermore, it has been shown that the cooperation of WSNs and smart drones was
    energy efficient, providing a better battery lifetime [54]. 3) Drones and 5G Green
    wireless communication plays a crucial role in green IoT. Green communications
    and networking refer to sustainable, energy-aware, energy-efficient, and environmentally-a
    ware technologies. The idea of a green communication network refers to low CO2
    emissions, low exposure to radiation and energy efficiency. Koutitas et al. [96]
    proposed a genetic algorithm optimized for developing network planning, where
    the findings showed significant reduction in carbon emissions, and cost savings
    and low exposure to radiation. In the same direction, Naeem et al. [97] discussed
    how to maximize the data rate, and minimize CO2 emissions in cognitive WSNs. The
    desig of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has also been proposed to decrease
    energy consumption [98]. The investigated details of the energy efficiency of
    5G mobile communication networks were discussed from three aspects theoretical
    models, technological developments, and applications in [99]. Regarding the next-generation
    network (NGN), Abrol et al. [100] presented the influences, and the growing technologies
    along with the need for energy efficiency. The need for adopting energy efficiency
    and reducing carbon footprint is to fulfill the demands for increasing the capacity,
    enhancing the data rate and providing a high QoS for the NGN. Many types of research
    have been done to save energy by using solar power, and these have also led to
    an enhanced QoS [101]–[106]. Furthermore, the utility-based adaptive duty cycle
    (UADC) algorithm has been proposed to reduce delay, increase energy efficiency,
    and elongate the battery lifetime [107]. The hypertext transfer protocol was used
    to enhance the lifetime and shorten the delay to provide reliable service [108].
    The application of network coding based communication techniques and reliable
    storage was shown to be useful for saving energy for green IoT [109]. The energy
    consumed was minimized by using networked fog centers, the TCP/IP protocol, and
    intra-fog communication [110]. Nowadays, 5G is expected to impact our environment
    and life considerably, in a manner similar to what the IoT promised, to make it
    efficient and comfortable. The 5G applications and its services for our society
    include e-health, robotic communication, interaction of humans and robotics, media,
    transport and logistics, e-learning, e-governance, public safety, automotive and
    industrial systems, etc. The authors of [110], [111] discussed the intelligent
    techniques that are in use for robotic communication to perform tasks effectively
    and efficiently. Chan et al. [112] developed a set of models for evaluating the
    use-phase of power consumption and CO2 emissions of wireless telecommunication
    network services. Furthermore, Motlagh et al. [16] proposed a steering technique
    among multiple 4G networks to ensure reliable and efficient connectivity via drones,
    which supports high QoS and consumes an acceptable amount of energy. Xu et al.
    [55] proposed a single drone as a mobile sink, along with a cluster of sensor
    nodes, and focused on reducing message delays. On the other hand, as energy supply
    on drones is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute towards the
    greening of the network [113]. Therefore, the drone is an emerging and useful
    technique for delivering wireless services to users on the ground, and it is lucrative
    for applications demanding a large coverage area and reduced power consumption.
    The most prominent issues in the next generation heterogeneous network are the
    capacity and coverage. To increase the capacity and coverage of wireless networks,
    Sharma et al. [114] presented an intelligent solution using a drone for accurate
    and efficient placement. The authors of [58] summarized many aspects of communication
    using drones. They investigated the self-adaptive power allocation technique for
    drones based on the minimum data rate and maximum allowable interference. Furthermore,
    technology enabling a drone to be used in a 5G communication network was also
    introduced. The findings showed that drone technology helped to maintain the QoS
    for all users in the drone coverage area. Statistical propagation for predicting
    the path loss between the drone and the terrestrial terminal was given [115].
    The authors of [116] also discussed the prediction of path loss based on the urban
    environment. Mozaffari et al. [18] proposed the coexistence of a drone with another
    IoT device on the ground based on the machine-to-machine (M2M) communication network.
    The integration of a drone and WSN is a useful technology for the utilization
    of energy resources [54], [117]. In addition to cooperation and integration of
    drones and WSN, authors in [56] considered the communication links between drones
    and WSN to optimize scheduling and drone trajectory for minimizing the energy
    consumption in the WSN during data collection. The idea was supported by a study
    in [57], which reveals that transmission energy reduced because the drone is capable
    of moving sequentially close to each node of the WSNs and collecting data from
    them. Rashed et al. [118], [119] highlighted a trade-off between minimizing the
    operation time and maximizing the covered nodes to choose the specific mobility
    pattern. Several studies of the combination of advanced technologies such as drones,
    ICT, and IoT are summarized in Table 2. TABLE 2 Summary on Combination of Drone,
    ICT, and IoT for Smart Cities SECTION III. Privacy and Security Issues in Drones
    and IoT Collaboration Smart cities can not be considered truly smart unless the
    security and privacy concerns of the users have reached an acceptable level. There
    are several challenges in the privacy and security to be addressed for improving
    the smartness of smart cities. Several privacy and security issues solutions and
    challenges have been discussed for different smart city applications in [120],
    [121]. Furthermore, the authors of [121] identified two types of security mechanisms
    in smart cities, operation security and data security, in which the security of
    the data itself depends on the security of the operations. Furthermore in [120],
    smart city applications were introduced, and several security challenges were
    discussed such as secure information processing, privacy leakage, and dependability
    in control. The authors of [122] introduced the security and privacy issues in
    the integration of IoT devices for smart cities. It was deemed essential to guarantee
    the security of end users and information of private and public systems such as
    smart grids and smart mobility. Gong et al. [123] proposed a homomorphic encryption
    technique to guarantee transmission security and evaluate next-generation mobile
    edge computing. Also, Eckhoff and Wagner [59] discussed the applications areas,
    attackers and their data sources, privacy, enabling technologies of a smart city.
    Parvez et al. [60] introduced machine learning (ML) techniques to secure the smart
    grid. For privacy in smart cities, Eckhoff and Wagner [59] introduced the taxonomies
    of privacy for different applications, potential attackers, enabling technologies
    and data sources for attacks. Furthermore, they described the existing privacy
    enhancement technologies in real smart cities and discussed the solutions of various
    challenges. The authors of [35] presented the citizen’s privacy concept based
    on five privacies dimension, viz. identity, location, query, footprint, and owner.
    Several technologies were proposed and combined for enhancing citizen privacy
    in smart cities. The privacy dimensions of smart cities are shown in Table 3.
    TABLE 3 Privacy Dimensions Smart cities include a large number of IoT devices
    such as sensors, cameras, actuators RFID, etc., which are used for data collection
    and transferring the collected data via advanced wireless communication technologies
    into the data center (server) allowing data to be processed and intelligent actions
    to be taken accordingly. Millions of smart IoT devices are distributed in smart
    cities to collect data from different applications, but these devices usually
    have limited computational power which leads to weak cryptography and issues in
    data security. The collected data includes the history of the environment surrounding
    IoT devices. Based on collected data, smart cities can be monitored in real time,
    and intelligent services can be delivered as needed. However, such collected data
    from different applications of smart cities dictates the need for privacy and
    security in order to control smart cities facilities and people’s lives. Otherwise,
    any compromised device may make the entire data collection vulnerable. To keep
    IoT devices in smart cities secure, they should be located in places where unauthenticated
    persons can not reach and access. Furthermore, the IoT network infrastructure
    should be authenticated to collect or send data in a particular network. Gharaibeh
    et al. [37] discussed the integration of various technologies for enabling smart
    cities such as IoT, cloud computing and communication network technologies. Furthermore,
    they identified the techniques applicable for data privacy and security that are
    protected by underlying IoT devices in smart cities. Furthermore, the authors
    of [38] reviewed the security aspects of smart cities and introduced privacy and
    security challenges. They focused on the unique challenges to smart cities applications
    such as smart grids, smart mobility, and IoT. In order to maintain privacy and
    security in smart cities, the authors of [124] proposed an architecture based
    on IoT and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The three general data properties
    that need to be secured for information collected in smart cities, are the confidentiality,
    integrity and availability (CIA) of the data [125]. Further detail is provided
    in Table 4. TABLE 4 Attack Categories in Smart Cities A smart city is not only
    about connected IoT devices and vehicle mobility and their networks, but also
    contains dynamic aspects such as autonomous drones. The security of autonomous
    swarm drones when performing tasks over smart cities was discussed [39]. The authors
    of [39] proposed the SHARK protocol for secured autonomous and heterogeneous swarm
    drones for ensuring the security of swarm drone applications over smart cities.
    Also, the authors of [126] explored a novel solution for securing information
    sharing (and provided a 3D visualization) between swarm drones in a smart city.
    The findings of the proposed technique showed the security prowess of drone context
    exchange validation and provided a secured path for drone to drone collaboration.
    The authors of [127] focused on the examination of cyber security aspects of drone-assisted
    public safety networks in light of the fact that sensitive data could be sent
    over the drone network. The findings showed that security risks and attacks still
    existed. Many studies have discussed drone path attacks such as [128], [129].
    The authors of [130] discussed the dependency of drones on GPS which may get attacked
    and lead to the loss of drone control. For smart cities, drones cyber-attacks
    can be divided into the categories of revelation, knowledge, and disruption as
    shown in Fig. 4. There are several security issues related to drones applications
    in smart cities such as drone-hijacking, waypoint alterations, and signal jamming.
    FIGURE 4. Steps of a typical multi-step cyber-attack on drones. Show All With
    limitless civilian applications, drones need various levels of security features
    according to the type of application. One study [131] provided details of the
    security faults in civilian drones applications such as unsecured WiFi, openly
    accessible Telnet, etc. Furthermore, Pleban et al. [132] highlighted the importance
    of securing communication links with encryption. They classified threats in two
    groups device threats and communication threats. Both of the above studies found
    that civilian drones do not apply cryptographic techniques to secure the connecting
    link between the ground controller and drones. Therefore, civilian drones are
    susceptible to connection denial, remote hijacking, video interception and total
    control (takeover) by adversaries [131]. The authors of [133] proposed the verifierBee
    path planning technique for securing the drones positions and finding the shortest
    path. Furthermore, the authors of [134] introduced future directions and challenges
    for drone safety, security, and privacy in smart cities. It needs to be pointed
    out that securing drones does not only involve securing the communication channel,
    drone environment, and path. Efforts must also be made to secure the controller
    because it is also prone to attacks. Clarke [36] reviewed the drone controls,
    co-regulation, self-regulation and formal laws for various form of surveillance.
    He also identified the shortfall of the regulation framework.Namely, if the controller
    fails to handle the attack, the total drone communication system will be uncontrollable.
    Thus, the authors of [135] proposed an efficient linearly homomorphic authenticated
    encryption technique for controlling multiple drones in real-time operation to
    ensure that they fly autonomously and safely. The proposed technique ensures security
    against forgery and eavesdropping attacks, and therefore, it guarantees the successful
    operation of a multi-rotor flying robot successfully. Also, the authors of [134]
    introduced the issues of privacy, security, and safety in civilian drones. Furthermore,
    they identified the salient drone properties required for secured operation. Interestingly,
    the Internet of Drones (IoD) environment represents a major and emerging technology
    that has enormous civilian applications in smart cities due to real-time data
    access and data accuracy. Several issues regarding security and privacy of the
    IoD environment were discussed in [136]–[138]. It is typically not prudent to
    allow a user direct access to the IoD, as this would give users with malicious
    intentions several chances to attack the IoD environment, for example, through
    jamming, clogging, and hacking [136]. Therefore, the authors discussed how the
    user should access the data collected from the IoD environment in the server securely.
    The server could be placed between the drones and the users, so that users cannot
    access the data from a drone directly, but it can be done via the server to protect
    the IoD environment from attacks. However, some times, the data collected on the
    server is not real-time data. Therefore, the user needs to access the real data
    in the drone environment, so that the user can make intelligent decisions in real-time
    to save people’s life during emergencies. Thus, designing an efficient, secure
    technique for user authentication in IoD is required. An authentication key agreement
    technique was proposed to allow users to directly access the IoD environments
    [138]. Furthermore, Lin et al. [137] provided potential solutions for privacy
    leakage, flexible accessibility and data confidentiality protection, and also
    discussed the architecture needed to gather data with privacy and security in
    the IoD environment. Also, Choudhary et al. [139] proposed a deep neural network
    (DNN) based security framework which provides highly secure and reliable mechanisms
    for IoD. The collaboration of drones and IoT technologies such as RFID, M2M, WSN,
    cloud computing and advanced communication technologies expands the role of collaborative
    drones for many applications in smart cities. Baig et al. [140] surveyed the vulnerabilities
    and associated threats of smart cities and identified components such as building
    automation systems, smart grids, smart vehicles and drones with IoT and cloud
    enabling technologies. Also, the authors of [63] discussed a solution for the
    privacy and security of drone applications in smart cities enabled by 5G and IoT.
    Furthermore, they introduced the security and privacy challenges of collaborative
    drones and IoT, end-to-end (E2E) privacy, prevention and security in real time,
    and the dynamic IoT environment. Ensuring the security off collaborative drones
    and IoT devices in smart cities is complex tasks due to the requirement for an
    efficient combination of various techniques that are associated with drone operations
    and IoT networking aspects. The complexity of collaborative drones and IoT set-ups
    can be enormous, with people and machines interacting with each other in smart
    cities through the complex processes of the ecosystem [134]. In light of this,
    security aspects of IoT along with dronesrequire different techniques for different
    layers such as the perception, link, network and application layers. In the perception
    layer, security threats are mostly related to the possibility of physical damage,
    so the authors of [134], [141] suggested hardware techniques that should be employed,
    such as tamper protection and break-in detection systems. Table 5 illustrates
    the various security threats and the data resources that need protection for drone
    and IoT collaborations. Here, the security involves authorizing the users to access
    data generated by physical objects. Furthermore, E2E communication needs to be
    present to ensure security using advanced techniques such as digital signature
    and lightweight cryptography. In the case of detection systems, co-location proofs
    were proposed to act against routing attacks by [142], [143]. The authors of [143]
    discussed the security services applied in the link layer including E2E security,
    while the authors of [144] proposed secure channel protocols to ensure robust
    communication. TABLE 5 Security Threats and Data Sources in a Drone and IoT Collaborative
    Environment For securing the network layers of drone and IoT collaborative set-ups,
    the authors of [134] discussed secure routing, IP security, and secure transportation.
    Furthermore, the authors of [145] discussed how IPv6 routing could apply for secure
    drones and IoT collaboration for low power protocols [146]. Moreover, routing
    of the data network infrastructure for drone security can provide robust identification
    and ensure objects integrity, as reported in [147]. Such routing can enhance a
    drone’s autonomy, lower its energy consumption, and improve its flying time. On
    the other hand, securing the application layer calls for several techniques such
    as a simple object access protocol, a constrained application protocol [142] and
    intrusion detection systems [148]. Lastly, for drone destination identification,
    path planning, and self-organization, machine learning based computer vision and
    video processing techniques are required [149]. SECTION IV. Drone and IoT Collaboration
    for Energy Efficiency The drone is a critical technology for enabling green IoT
    which will provide energy efficient solutions by minimizing power consumption
    in IoT devices. Standalone IoT devices need high transmission power for sending
    information over long distances. Once the IoT devices are made to collaborate
    with a drone, the agile and flying drone can physically go to the vicinity of
    these IoT devices to collect, process, and transmit data to other nodes/stations
    which are outside the coverage area of the IoT devices. Drones will also use efficient
    communication technologies to transfer/exchange data with each other and with
    IoT devices in the ground through M2M communication. The authors of [150] proposed
    a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for drone-assisted IoT sensor networks based on the sensor
    density, energy consumption and flight time and fly risk level. Furthermore, Mozaffari
    et al. [151] evaluated and argued the optimal altitude values for small drone
    cell clouds which lead to the minimum transmit power and maximum coverage area.
    Incorporating the processing and controlling features in each machine is the primary
    objective of IoT equipment. IoT devices in drones are used to manage, process,
    and deliver data. The co-operative framework for the drone-WSN was introduced
    [117]. It is composed of fixed-group leaders, sensor nodes, and drones-sink. The
    finding of this study was that the energy consumption and complexity of the process
    of group leader election were reduced. The strategies of drone-based WSN for gathering
    data were discussed in [152]. The employed strategies were able to reduce energy
    consumption, flying time and latency of data collection. The authors in [153]
    proposed an algorithm for data gathering in WSNs by employing two technologies:
    mobile agents and drones. Both technologies were used for saving time and energy
    of sensor nodes. A case study was done based on searching for people in a disaster
    (e.g. an earthquake). Also, the proposed work appears to be suitable for gathering
    data in many applications in real smart cities also. Zorbas et al. [156] discussed
    the mathematical formulation of efficient energy management for IoT devices. The
    model was able to detect the events that happened on the ground and minimize energy
    consumption in a particular coverage area. Furthermore, Sharma et al. [54] proved
    the importance of drone and WSN cooperation for providing energy efficient relaying.
    The findings showed that the proposed technique was able to enhance drone routing
    with less delay and a large coverage area with better battery lifetime. The required
    power for the drone system was modeled and it was found that the energy efficiency
    can be improved only by adding more energy efficient components in the emerging
    technologies [157]. Choi et al. [158] determined the energy efficiency of the
    drone-based relay by taking into account the speed and load factors. A wired drone
    docking system has also been proposed to perform many functions through collaboration
    with IoT devices to reduce resources, energy wastage and to also ensure security
    [154]. Seo et al. [159] proposed the use of drone technology over the IoT security
    platform, for monitoring and providing an emergency response in buildings by utilizing
    beacons. For addressing issues related to drone battery life, the authors of [155]
    developed an automatic battery replacement mechanism. Automatic battery replacement
    allowed drones to keep working without manual intervention. The proposed practical
    work successfully assessed the use of drones for continuous surveillance in outdoor
    and indoor environments. A summary of previous studies and techniques used for
    improving the energy efficiency in smart cities by using a collaboration between
    drones and the IoT is shown in Table 6. TABLE 6 Summary on Improving Energy Efficiency
    in Smart Cities SECTION V. Data Collection in Smart Cities Using Collaboration
    of Drones and IoT The most critical asset in a smart city scenario is data. To
    achieve smart city characteristics and cater to the application domains, data
    must be collected, stored, and processed in real-time in order to ensure that
    the required tasks can be performed collaboratively. In many applications of smart
    cities, smart IoT devices (such as cameras, sensors, etc.) are distributed for
    collecting data from the surrounding environment. Smart IoT devices in smart cities
    are small and have limited battery [160]. Therefore, these smart IoT devices are
    not able to transmit the signal over long distances, because of energy constraints
    [12], [13], [17]. To fulfill the promises of eco-friendliness and sustainability
    in smart cities, the reduction of the energy consumption is an absolute necessity,
    and the minimization of pollution and hazardous waste is also required to enhance
    the overall quality of experience [70], [161]. Recently, drones have started to
    represent a microcosm of the entire IoT domain in the sense that these drones
    can interact and respond to their environment much like the other entities in
    the IoT framework. Therefore, they can be deployed to different locations, carry
    flexible loads, measure and provide analytics about anything anywhere and at any
    time. The exciting aspects of drones and IoT collaboration are the lower prices
    and better connectivity and delivery of high QoS. Drone height plays a vital role
    in delivering services to IoT devices and collecting data from IoT devices. Due
    to the advent of drone-based IoT, the IoT equipment on-board a drone may include
    devices such as sensors, digital cameras, actuators, and communication technologies,
    such as Wi-Fi, 5G, LTE, or Ad-hoc networks, as shown in Fig. 5. This equipment
    is used to remotely control the devices, collect data, and deliver services effectively
    and efficiently. Hence, drones can collect data from IoT devices via the equipment
    that has already been added to the drone’s payload. Delivering services from drones
    is performed via wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, LTE, and 5G.
    FIGURE 5. A drone equipped IoT devices for data gathering. Show All Wireless communication
    technologies such as 4G/5G networks offer significant potential for enhancing
    the effectiveness of drones equipped with sensors, cameras, and GPS receivers,
    in delivering IoT services from great heights. Using drones to fly as relays for
    IoT has numerous benefits such as reliability and energy conservation. Drones
    are required to gather data from IoT on the ground to minimize transmission power
    while retaining reliability [17]. Furthermore in such scenarios, the energy consumption
    in IoT devices is significantly reduced, and the drones can serve the ground devices
    for a longer duration. Drones have also been employed to guide search and rescue
    (SAR)teams, where wearable smart devices are connected to drones for guidance
    regarding suitable and safe routes [32]. Furthermore, drones can act as the crucial
    technology component in IoT device communication to collect data from small devices
    such as health-care monitoring equipment, environmental sensors, etc. [160], [162],
    [163]. The authors of [164] considered the use of drones and IoT devices together
    in a disaster response setting and provided the facilities for event detection,
    and automatic network repaired. Smart drones equipped with IoT devices are able
    to collect, store, and process data to enable drones to perform complex tasks
    effectively and efficiently. Because of the energy required for processing IoT
    data and performing IoT tasks urgently, Koulali et al. [165] suggested that the
    processing of data should be done locally, and then the processed data should
    be delivered to the cloud so that the necessary actions can be taken. However,
    the processing and storage of data on IoT devices requires high energy expenditure.
    It is expected that the use of drones will contribute to reducing the energy used,
    and will control the active and sleep modes of IoT devices to produce green IoT
    technology. The various scenarios in which a drone can be effectively used to
    gather data, such as disaster management, public safety, agriculture, etc. are
    summarized in Table 7. Furthermore, drones can be used to gather data in the smart
    cities for many applications such as dynamic coordination and data routing, accident
    monitoring, intelligent transport systems, disaster recovery, public safety, and
    relaying data from isolated ground sensors to a BS, etc. TABLE 7 Summary on Improving
    Data Gathering From Smart Cities The collaboration of drones and IoT for gathering
    data can be leveraged in different ways: (i) drones gathering data from ground
    IoT devices and delivering collected data to the nearest BS [169], (ii) drones
    equipped with IoT devices for gathering data [170] (iii) drone equipped with IoT
    devices and also collecting data from IoT devices in smart cities. For instance,
    drones used for public safety tasks can collect data from wearable devices carried
    by the members of SAR teams. In another case, data gathered by a drone can be
    put to use in the agriculture industry, serving many applications such as crop
    monitoring, drought monitoring, yield estimates, water quality monitoring, disease
    detection, identification of tree species, etc. SECTION VI. Collaboration of Drones
    and IoT for Improving Life Quality Recently, the monitoring and control of air
    pollution have become important issues in the modern industrialized world. Typically
    sensors are used for gathering pollution data which is consumed for monitoring
    purposes. However, the power transmission capabilities of these miniature sensors
    is limited, and often, such sensors are not suitable for sending data in real
    time. To circumvent this issue, the sensors can be carried by drones, and then
    data process and onward transmission can be divided into two parts: the onboard
    sensor can sense/collect pollution data, and the drone’s communication equipment
    with its larger power sources, can easily send the data across over much larger
    distances than those possible using a standalone sensor [171], [172]. In that
    regard, Villa et al. [173] established the best installation points for four gas
    sensors and a Particle Number Concentration (PNC) monitor, onboard a hexacopter.
    They developed a drone system which is capable of measuring point source emissions.
    Their study focused on the air flow behavior, and evaluation of the performance
    of CO2, CO, NO2 and NO sensors for measuring the harmful gaseous emissions in
    a particular geographical area. Several other potential applications of drone
    technology have also been explored for interacting with sensors to perform tasks
    such as soil moisture sensing, remote crop monitoring, infrastructure monitoring,
    water quality monitoring, and remote sensor deployment [174]. For controlling
    the gas emissions from a greenhouse, Hamilton et al. [94] highlighted the importance
    of a solar-powered drone equipped with a CO2 sensing system integrated with a
    WSN. The authors of [175] reviewed the existing drone techniques for monitoring
    the environment. Furthermore, the authors [176] proposed drones equipped with
    off-the-shelf sensors for monitoring tasks, but they did not consider the guidance
    system. To solve this issue, the same authors proposed the adoption of drone-mounted
    pollution control system based on a meta-heuristic and PSO techniques, which allowed
    the user to monitor a specific area and focused on the most polluted zones [177].
    In another pertinent work, [178], the authors proposed using equipment in drones
    such as Pixhawk Autopilot for drone control along with onboard processing and
    storage devices, to sense and store environmental pollution data. Furthermore,
    the authors of [179] developed a modular drone platform that is capable of real-time
    monitoring of multiple air pollutants. Šmídl and Hofman [180] extended the idea
    of mobile stations to autonomously navigated drones for pollution monitoring.
    The work demonstrated the applications of the drone platform in air pollution
    research, focused on roadside air pollution profiling and emergency monitoring
    for air pollution episodes. On the other hand, Zang et al. [181] demonstrated
    the application of drones for the investigation of water pollution in south-west
    China. Drones were shown to be effective in such a climatic scenario because of
    their ability to work in environmental conditions with low air pressure, high
    altitude, severe weather, strong air turbulence, and persistent cloud cover. Gu
    et al. [182] developed and designed a modular drone-based platform which was capable
    of real-time monitoring of air pollution in smart cities. The proposed model included
    drone, sensors, ground station, data acquisition equipment, and a data processing
    module. The proposed system exhibited high precision and was shown to be suitable
    for air pollution monitoring. Furthermore, the authors of [183] designed a long-range
    air quality monitor aboard a drone. The proposed prototype could be used to monitor
    air pollution easily. In this setup, the collaboration between drones was shown
    to be effective in the sense that one drone was sensing the data, and another
    drone was used to send data in real-time to the server. Table 8 depicts a summary
    of the outcomes of the collaboration of drones and IoT for improving life quality
    in smart city. TABLE 8 Summary on Improving Life Quality in Smart Cities SECTION
    VII. Collaborative Drone and IoT for Public Safety in Smart Cities As has been
    discussed earlier, the limited transmission power of miniaturized sensors and
    handheld devices makes them unable to send their captured data over long distances.
    Drone technology, however, can deliver services over a large geographical area
    in real time. The use of drone technology represents the cheapest and most efficient
    way to accomplish tasks such as monitoring a criminal on the run, finding a missing
    person, surveying a disaster scene, etc., especially in time-critical situations.
    Therefore, the best features of collaboration between drone and IoT devices are
    those that are supposed to achieve and provide maximum benefits, such as reprogrammability,
    good sensing capability, ability to interconnect and identify things, ubiquity,
    communication capability, etc. Wearable internet of public safety things (IoPST)
    devices connect in smart cities for public safety and allow first responders to
    share information with command posts and relevant parties. These connected devices
    can help relief and monitoring teams to identify when or where disasters or crimes
    have happened, as shown in Fig. 6. Using this information, the interested parties
    (law enforcement agencies in the case of crimes, rescue teams in the case of disasters)
    can quickly make appreciated decisions in order to track down perpetrators or
    provide aid, whatever the case may be. Figure. 6 shows the capability of a drone
    equipped with IoT technology to capture data in real-time for disaster events
    and send the captured data to the disaster control center to make an appreciate
    decision in real time. Drone 1 is used to capture real information from the disastrous
    fire. Drone 1 is used to communicate with SAR teams, send real-time data about
    the disaster, and guide SAR to reach the disaster area using an accessible and
    safe path. The SAR team members are wearing IoT devices that help the drones to
    identify their location, and suitably guide them according to the disaster situaion.
    Furthermore, drone 1, which happens to be above the disaster area when the tragedy
    occurred can communicate with other drones and forward real-time data. Therefore,
    effective collaboration between drones and IoT devices plays a critical role in
    enhancing the public safety and reducing the impact of disaster in smart city.
    FIGURE 6. Collaborative drone and IoT for public safety [32]. Show All FIGURE
    7. Collaborative smart drone and IoT for smart cities. Show All FIGURE 8. Application
    examples of collaborative drones and IoT in smart cities. Show All The authors
    of [18] analyzed how the deployment of a drone as a BS could deliver communication
    services to a particular area. Furthermore, the coexistence between heterogeneous
    devices and drones was discussed. Fundamental operation and techniques were introduced
    for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of public safety network using IoT technologies.
    The authors of [184] reviewed the techniques and the availability of IoT for disaster
    management. Reina et al. [168] outlined the disaster management and the importance
    of using IoT and big data. The study focused on the use of drones as 0 th responders
    to deliver communication service to victims in a disaster. The main idea of an
    0 th responder is to arrive at the disaster area before the first responders.
    The work was divided into two parts: the collection of data and the use of local
    search to find the optimal position in which the drone could deliver communication
    services to the victims. Furthermore, the work in [168] was supported by [185],
    in which the position of the 0 th responder was considered for delivering communication
    services to victims in disaster areas. However, maintaining the connectivity link
    between the 0 th responder and other responders was not discussed. Therefore,
    Alsamhi et al. [14] developed an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the
    signal strength between the drone and wearable IoT devices or other responders
    on the ground to maintain connectivity for delivering services. A concise summary
    of the effects of effective collaboration between drones and IoT devices for public
    safety in smart cities is shown in Table 9. TABLE 9 Summary of Improving Public
    Safety in Smart Cities SECTION VIII. Collaboration of Drone and IoT for Disaster
    Management Apart from the promise of intelligent services, the concept of a smart
    city also encapsulates effective and efficient planning towards responses to emergency
    and critical situations. This is generally achieved by assigning SAR activities
    to disaster areas in real time. In this context, using AI techniques for image
    analytics plays a vital role in identifying things and events in real time. Visual
    records of disaster areas can have significant effects on the selection of an
    effective disaster response. In that light, Chaudhuri and Bose [186] examined
    the effectiveness of the machine learning technique to manage disasters in smart
    cities. The proposed technique was used to classify images, containing photographs
    of disaster areas, with high accuracy. Sakhardande et al. [187] utilized the various
    communication modes of IoT devices to monitor and manage the SAR activities during
    a disaster. Furthermore, the idea of intelligent transportation with the help
    of cloud computing and VANETs technologies has also been proposed for disaster
    management systems in smart cities [188]. Also, Boukerche et al. [189] proposed
    an IoT based disaster response and detection system for improving SAR activities
    during a disaster. In this context, IoT devices were used for data gathering,
    localing injured people, and identifying hazards. The architecture of the proposed
    system included smart sensors, smart processing, smart responses, and an ad hoc
    communication network. Collaboration among drones and IoT devices such as cameras,
    sensors, and actuators can be used for disaster management and SAR guiding by
    providing high-resolution imagery, and videos of the affected area and extended
    coverage area as well as providing real-time weather records (e.g. wind speed,
    pollution levels, temperature, etc.). Drones flying over or closer to a disaster
    area can communicate amongst themselves, as well as with a central station, to
    facilitate the coordination and surveillance of the event and operations team
    [26]. Real-time processing of the collected data by IoT devices is needed to identify
    the most affected areas and to assist people where human intervention is risky,
    impossible, dangerous, and expensive. A drone equipped with IoT devices can be
    used to collect data from disaster area and its surroundings. Collected data will
    help rescue and relief teams to respond accordingly to ensure tasks are performed
    efficiently. Aljehani et al. proposed drone technology together with IoT devices
    for enabling mobile tracking and image processing [190]. The advanced technology
    was used to capture an image of the disaster event. Image data from a drone helped
    to evaluate damaged areas. A drone equipped with IoT devices such as 3D cameras
    can be used to capture high-resolution images to make relief maps of the region
    under consideration. In this way, a disaster center receives explicit footage
    of the actual scene without having to deploy human/robot ground teams. Also, a
    drone can penetrate places that would otherwise be difficult for rescue teams
    or helicopters to enter and provide close-up views. The most important advantage
    of the map is to understand the impact of the disaster on the region. Afterwards,
    AI techniques can be used for decision making and taking desired actions based
    on the captured map. The desired signal strength from the drone is optimized using
    an ANN [14]. The prediction and estimation of the signal strength is important
    for enhancing the QoS. Furthermore, appropriate communication protocols are required
    for disaster management, because disaster types have different notions of occurrence,
    damage ability, and time mishap. The energy efficiency of IoT protocols plays
    a vital role in discovering local sensor devices and gateways for delivering communication
    services in such a power constrained scenario. Timing is everything in a disaster
    situation. By incorporating IoT data into emergency response plans, public sector
    agencies and responders can use real-time information to make arrangements and
    reach the people who need help. In the case of IoT wearable devices worn by SAR
    teams, the drone can assist the IoT services by carrying sensors, cameras, and
    communication devices, etc. For example, response teams can also use wearable
    sensors for coordination, analytics, outreach strategies, and on-the-ground tactics.
    Also, the drone may also be used as a gateway which can connect to the monitoring
    server as well as, controlling different IoT devices on the drone itself. Furthermore,
    it can carry IoT devices such as thermal imaging devices, multispectral cameras,
    microphones, and sniffers. Motlagh et al. [16] established a steering mechanism
    on the drone payload to decrease the energy consumption and guarantee a higher
    data transmission rate through proper selection of the received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI). The performance of the steering mechanism led to an increase
    in the probability of having a high transmission data rate, high QoS, and acceptable
    energy consumption.Regarding flexible deployment of drone technology, 4G communication
    will help to control multiple drones from anywhere, enabling real-time data transmission,
    processing, and sharing. The work in [191] considered the deployment of drone
    and IoT devices during a disaster for effective and efficient communication and
    data sensing, and the use of integrated technology to help SAR to perform their
    tasks safely. Application areas of such systems include transportation, public
    safety, energy, healthcare, and telecommunication. Table 10 shows a summary of
    previous studies related to collaborative drone and IoT technologies for disaster
    management in smart cities. TABLE 10 Summary on Improving Disaster Management
    in Smart Cities Figure. 6 shows the importance of using drones in collaboration
    with IoT devices for disaster management in smart cites. Drone 1 is equipped with
    IoT sensors to capture data in real-time and forward it to a central unit for
    further decision making and the performance of intelligent actions. Furthermore,
    drone 1 is also used to connect directly with the wearable IoT devices worn by
    the SAR team to guide them along a safe path and protect their lives. SECTION
    IX. Miscellaneous Applications of Collaboration of Drones and IoT Smart cities
    demand smart data. IoT devices are capable of collecting this data. However, distributing
    a massive number of IoT devices will consume energy and incur high costs. Therefore,
    smart drones can be equipped with IoT devices, which can be used to collect data
    from a large coverage area with energy savings and reduced carbon emissions. In
    the near future, a massive number of drones will be used to improve city life,
    document accident scenes, support first responder activities, and monitor construction
    sites. The requirements of drones to make a city smarter were discussed in [34],
    [192], [193]. The authors of [34] associated a critical role to the drone in smart
    cities, wherein the drone was used as a relay station and kept connectivity in
    particular applications such as emergency services and disaster recovery. Furthermore,
    the future directions of research and challenges were discussed in that work.
    Won et al. [194] discussed the need for secure communication protocols for collaboration
    between drones and IoT devices. The protocols involve different types of fixed
    IoT devices or mobile devices with different capacities. The various aspects of
    drones in future smart cities, relating to cyber-security, privacy, and public
    safety were discussed in [28]. Furthermore, the applications of drones for smart
    cities and the opportunities to solve todays problems were also discussed in [41],
    [194]. Recently, the rate of crime in urban areas, such as street crime, vandalism,
    and terrorism has increased. Therefore, anticipating crimes through detection
    and recognition of criminals among crowds of people is vital. In this vein, drones
    with the help of IoT devices can be used to track, detect, and recognize criminals,
    follow criminal movement to discover exact hiding places, and provide immunity
    from any potential hazards that the criminals may pose. To improve the performance
    of disaster sensing while saving energy, the drone-cloud framework was proposed
    for disaster sensing applications under the condition of irregular, intermittent,
    and limited environment networks [195]. In another related work, it was argued
    that providing excellent accuracy is sufficient for real-time disaster relief
    [196]. The use of drones to provide various services was also discussed in [197].
    To secure a smart home, a drone can provide adaptive security by working as a
    home surveillance system. It would use solar-powered sensors to detect physical
    movement, any acoustic signal, and even vibrations on the ground, and would be
    capable of approaching and monitoring the areas of interest once a further investigation
    command is given. Also, apart from the possibility of using solar-powered equipment,
    wireless power transmission techniques can be used to charge the batteries of
    drones and IoT devices in the drone payload. Collaborative drones and IoT devices
    also promise a revolution in agriculture through the combination of big data,
    aerial imagery, and other means to optimize productivity. Wang et al. [174] explored
    several potential applications where drones interact with sensor tags to perform
    tasks such as soil moisture sensing, remote crop monitoring, infrastructure monitoring,
    water quality monitoring, and remote sensor deployment. In their work, a drone
    was equipped with IoT devices and included the capability for seamless connection
    and data collection in the cloud. Collaborative drones and IoT devices can also
    help to monitor power distribution lines, tend to crops, or deliver packages.
    Nowadays, another significant field and application of collaborative drones and
    IoT is doing the often dangerous work of power crews in surveying storm damage
    or maintaining power lines. Therefore, collaboration between drones and IoT devices
    can be used to find and inspect downed power lines faster than manned crew members
    after a storm or hurricane. Furthermore, drones can cover a larger area much faster,
    while keeping crews out of danger. In this particular case, drones can send real-time
    data and live video streams back to smart grid systems, allowing power companies
    to manage potential electrical problems like never before. Therefore, drones reduce
    both inspection time and cost. Collaboration between drones and IoT devices can
    also provide a viable solution for tasks such as the delivery of food aid and
    medical supplies to areas hit by a disaster. Nowadays, humans are probably most
    interested in collaborations between drones and IoT to save people’s lives during
    public safety and emergencies. Therefore, future collaborations of drones and
    wearable/implantable medical devices will revolutionize healthcare, moving closer
    to a model in which IoT sensors monitor health continuously. If patients are not
    able to travel tens or hundreds of miles to receive a diagnosis, collaborative
    drone and IoT devices can be used to treat them. Table.11 illustrates the applications
    of collaborative drones and IoT and its advantages for smart cities. Some of the
    more pertinent applications are further explained below. TABLE 11 A Summary on
    Collaborative Drones and IoT Applications With the Associated Advantages A. Emergency
    Services and Disaster Management Emergency applications in smart cities are a
    very important factor in saving people lives. Some emergency cases occur in difficult
    to access areas, and delays in physically reaching them may impact the response
    performance. Therefore, collaborative drones and IoT can play vital roles in improving
    the emergency response in smart cities. Drones equipped with sensors can perform
    as zero responders for victims in a very crowded area in smart cities. In this
    case, the drone can send the victim’s location, find a smooth path for SAR, and
    update the situation to an emergency response team, while at the same time also
    monitoring the victim’s status. Also, response teams wear IoT devices that keep
    them in contact with drones. Moreover, collaborative drone and IoT can deliver
    on-demand broadband communication services and collect data about the emergency
    environment [198], [199]. Terrorist attacks and natural and man-made disasters
    are examples of disasters that affect smart cities and represent very challenging
    situations. The Control, management and preparation of such disasters is extremely
    important. The sooner the response reaches the affected area, the higher the reduction
    in the overall cost to the economy will be, and the higher the chance that more
    lives are saved will be. The aerial platform has been proposed as one technology
    that can deliver broadband communication services such as the high altitude platform
    [200], [201],and tethered balloon [200], [202]–[204], while drones have more recently
    been put forward as an even more effective and efficient technology for delivering
    broadband communication in disaster monitoring and mitigation [14], [32], [205],
    [206]. Furthermore, due to their agility, drones can also be used to transport
    equipment, and medical supplies to the needy. B. Data Collection Effective collaborations
    between drones and IoT devices can also be leveraged to gather and transfer data
    in real-time. In conventional techniques, the transfer of collected data usually
    occurs via multi-hops and relays, leading to delays and errors [14], [32]. For
    such cases, collaborative drones play a vital role in collecting data from IoT
    devices and transfering data to the main station [207]. Thus, collaborative drones
    can reduce the energy required by the IoT devices, by reducing the distance over
    which data needs to be transmitted (IoT device to nearby drone, instead of IoT
    device to a far-away base station), and thus extending their battery life [14],
    [21], [208]. Several techniques have been developed for efficient data collection
    and communication between drones and IoT devices [32], [63], [95], [209]. C. Monitoring
    Traffic Traffic congestion is considered one of the major issues facing smart
    cities. It occurs due to sudden increases in the number of vehicles for many reasons
    such as rush hour, construction work, large events, or accidents. It may occur
    at any time in any place in a smart city. Therefore, effective and efficient techniques
    and technologies are required to mitigate such situations. Static cameras installed
    on the streets can provide some information, but not a detailed report about the
    congestion [210]. Drone is a crucial technology for collecting congestion data
    and sending it in real time. Several techniques have been used for efficient and
    effective communication and exploration of the data collected by drones, such
    as those presented in [14], [32], [211], [212]. Traffic congestion can also occur
    due to trying to find park spots when there are limited parking spaces. This causes
    drivers to navigate the area several times at low speed. To help in such scenarios,
    D’Aloia et al. [213] proposed drones technology to map the parking area and finding
    empty parking spots. Therefore, collaborative drones and IoT devices in vehicles
    help the driver to find empty parking spots quickly. D. Crowd Monitoring and Security
    In smart cities, drones can assist policemen in security measures and safety enforcement.
    Due to the easy deployment of drones, they can be deployed rapidly to gather real-time
    data and support police operations in various cases such as robbery or traffic
    hit-and-runs [214]. Collaborative drones and IoT technologies such as human behavior
    recognition [215], motion detection [216] etc. can also help make cities smarter.
    Such collaborations between drones and IoT devices could make the surveillance
    process more effective and less expensive, as compared with a human workforce.
    E. Fog Computing The integration of IoT devices and cloud computing will improve
    many smart cities applications due to the cost reduction and elastic resource
    provision. Clouds can be utilized for the data storage of IoT applications in
    smart cities. However, there are some restrictions on the feasible integration
    of IoT applications and cloud servers, such as the latency/response time, mobility,
    difficulty of adding heterogeneous devices, and issues related to context and
    location awareness. Bonomi et al. [217] proposed a fog computing architecture
    to overcome the above restrictions. The concept of a ‘Fog cloud’ deals with improving
    the basic cloud computing service by offering small platforms placed at the network
    edges i.e. closer to IoT devices. Thus, fog computing provides an easy way to
    access the storage services very close to the actual applications. The response
    time is thereby reduced. Fog computing has been proposed to improve the efficiency
    and effectiveness of operation in many applications such as energy management,
    smart grid, smart building, smart transportation, and city monitoring [218]–[220].
    Interestingly, drone-based fog computing is a new concept that was recently introduced
    in [221], while the collaboration between drones and clouds was discussed in [222],
    [223]. The authors of [221] introduced the advantages of collaborative drones
    to support IoT based fog computing based on drone mobility, flexibility and ease
    of deployment in smart cities. Thus, the collaborative drones can be used to load
    a fixed fog unit, or replace a faulty or lost unit in case of a disaster situation
    to support SAR. SECTION X. Discussion and Future Directions Recently, there have
    been various fruitful efforts towards enhancing the smartness of cities using
    advanced techniques and collaboration between different technologies. Drone technology,
    ML and IoT are key to making smart cities smarter, greener, and more sustainable.
    As has been elaborated throughout this paper, a combination of drones and IoT
    devices could be used to perform the following tasks in a more efficient manner:
    data collection and dissemination, pollution monitoring, security and surveillance,
    traffic de-congestion, the provision of on-demand communication links, emergency
    rescue and response team support, agricultural monitoring, and many others. However,
    before the promised collaboration between drones and IoT devices can be made fully
    functional, there are several open issues that need to be addressed. Table 12
    illustrates the open issues and challenges of collaboration between drones and
    IoT for application in smart cities. Table 13 presents a compilation of the directions
    that future research in this field is expected to take, along with a listing of
    future insights. TABLE 12 Summary of Open Issues of Collaborative Drones and IoT
    Applications in Smart Cities TABLE 13 Research Directions, Challenges, and Insights
    The most pressing issues in this field include prolonging the battery lifetime
    of drones, constructing better and reliable communication protocols between the
    drones and the base stations, improving data security, route planning for the
    drones, and incorporating the capability to deal with a wide variety of heterogenous
    devices and sensors, while improving their present ability to make informed and
    intelligent decisions. Related to toward the development of more intelligent and
    privacy-oriented drones, the use of ML for security with attention to privacy
    is mentioned in [226]. To keep the network secure from cyber-attacks, ML may be
    applied between the IoT framework and drones. ML can also be applied to detect
    attacks during training, and to identify security vulnerability using adversarial
    set-ups [227]–[230]., However, the current techniques do not eliminate all types
    of vulnerabilities. Therefore, advanced research is required to find better solutions
    for securing the collaborative networks of drones and IoT devices. Further to
    that, designing secure authentication techniques for heterogenous collaborative
    environment is another challenge. This issue was first identified by the authors
    of [231], who pointed out several shortfalls in the authentication techniques
    of smart cities. SECTION XI. Conclusion Smart cities are made up of intelligent
    things which can intelligently and automatically collaborate to enhance life quality,
    save peoples lives, and sustain resources. Recently, the advent of drone technology
    has played a vital role in enhancing many real-time applications of smart cities.
    Drones can be equipped with IoT devices, and can also be made to collaborate with
    IoT devices to make civilian life better in numerous ways and to protect our environment.
    The collaboration between drones and IoT has the potential to change our lives
    drastically via data gathering and real-time analysis to enhance life quality,
    lower energy consumption, and provide a high QoS, as well as many other advantages.
    This survey differs from the previous efforts in terms of its breadth, scope,
    and focus. In particular, we have focused on the new concept of the collaboration
    of drones and IoT for improving smart city applications. In doing so, we have
    presented a thorough study on the most recent works on drones and IoT collaboration,
    its importance, and its application domains in smart cities. We have also provided
    concise work challenges and research insights, which should be addressed to further
    enhance the effectiveness of such collaboration. Appendix List of Abbreviationss

    India, there is an exponential rise in population nutrition requirement. To meet
    up with both the ends, the agricultural techniques should be perfected for optimal
    yield and quality. Irrigation and soil property monitoring system using sensors
    can be automated and operated wirelessly to achieve optimal water supply control
    and surveillance. The objective of this paper, is to automate the whole wireless
    sensor network (WSN) system with a control over water pumps and dripper valves.
    The humidity, temperature and pH sensor’s percepts provide a feedback, to control
    the water content of the soil. The system has an low-cost and energy reliable
    ZigBee for sensor data transformation, high-range GPRS system for data storing
    and analysis, and the whole system is powered by Solar panels which makes it self-sustainable.

    Control Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction Agriculture in India is still one of the
    largest sectors to contributing 17.9% General Directorate of Pharmaceutical Affairs
    (GDPA) to the economy till 2014. Over 58% of the rural households depend on agriculture
    as their principal means of livelihood. While such a huge population is facilitated
    by this sector it still lacks the considerable amount of modernization and advancement
    to be implemented on field. Such developments would not only serve for a better
    production and quality enhancement but also introduce the much needed ease of
    operation with detailed monitoring. With new advancement in Technology it is required
    to update the conventional systems of day to day matter like Agriculture and especially
    irrigation for better and efficient yield and control. There has been a long tradition
    of measuring crop water use and crop water requirement to assess irrigation performance.
    In Doorenbos et al. [1] related crop water use to reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) and crop coefficient (Kc), which account for all crop-specific variables.
    Kc values calculated by traditional methods by Alan et al. [2] represent average
    to optimum agricultural status under stress-free conditions and fail to describe
    variations within and across fields. Tasumi et al. [3] showed Actual Kc estimates,
    however, have inherent variations because of physical, physiological and management
    factors. A real-time and continuous closed-loop irrigation control system integrates
    soil property monitoring, irrigation scheduling and control for remote and large
    agricultural fields making it a real help for cultivators. Here the research project
    is objectified to evaluate water content along with temperature and pH of the
    soil for targeted crop Potato (also called Solanum tuberosum) and run pump systems
    to provide adequate water and proper monitoring for a healthy and optimal yield.
    The Control is done by a PIC16F877A Microcontroller which is a RISC controller.
    Temperature Humidity and pH as parameter are fed to the evaluating PIC with the
    help of LM35 Temperature sensor, Soil moisture sensor and SEN10972 pH Sensor kit.
    The percept provided by the sensors are sampled and used to evaluate real-time
    weather condition. Thus a proper monitoring system with a valve control can be
    made to run on solar powered system making it self-sufficient in energy requirement.
    For providing better view of this research work this paper is organized in such
    a way that initially the overall system designed is overviewed. The types of sensors
    implemented on the irrigation field are discussed briefly and last the empirical
    evaluation of the observed results and discussed. 2 Related Work With Advancement
    in various fields of technology a number of enthusiastic individuals have tried
    to bind two ends of technological advancement in electronics with trivial practices
    of agriculture. Especially when talking about Irrigation the idea of automated
    and precise watering to conserve water resources and reduce effort is very tempting.
    Consistency of supply with precise monitoring is one of the prime objectives.
    The automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by variable
    frequency speed is based on traditional design method of pipeline irrigation system,
    combines the frequency conversion and automation technologies, and divides the
    field into irrigation subareas according to pressure rating. Each subarea delivers
    water automatically according to appropriate pressure rating, which can greatly
    enhance irrigation uniformity as proved by He et al. [4], Using the advantages
    of remote sensing data regarding any land mass can be gathered in form of images
    portraying their characteristics. The same has been done by Abuzar et al. [5]
    in their paper where they compared the satellite data for satellite-based ET and
    NDVI to derive Kc. Consistency and slight over supply of water was observed as
    the overall product of the experiment. The real work in automation and design
    of the smart irrigation has been done with real time sampling. Reche et al. [6]
    used the WSN with Ad hoc. Humidity and temperature sensing to get large sampling
    rate and direct sprinkler control using the network. Similar ideology has been
    followed majorly worldwide for sensing feedback from moisture sensor and temperature
    sensor to understand current requirement of the soil. Nilesh et al. [7] in IEEE
    2013 INDICON presented a Microcontroller based drip irrigation system presented
    a work with DTMF tones are used for the communication between farmer and monitoring
    station. A low cost method that can be applied to small scale land. In a latest
    attempt over the same subject Vellidis et al. [8] published in Springer 2015 about
    integrated irrigation scheduling decision support system using wireless sensor
    array with center pivot irrigation system. In an extensive and real time project
    Kim et al. [9] used the WSN for real time sampling of data using Bluetooth and
    control of irrigation system. While using this system the Plug and play option
    was offered by for sensor making it versatile for big field. Sensor stations were
    made at particular areas which read real time feed for soil temperature humidity
    nutrition content etc. In another paper Kushal et al. [10] tried a similar monitoring
    technique with pH, humidity and temperature. They cited that precipitation of
    phosphorus present in fertilizers would talk place if the soil already rich in
    calcium and manganese. At the same time pH level when mitigated to form salts
    lead to over salt contents which are again not good fertilization and hence not
    fit for Agriculture it-self. Following the same trend in advance manner Sonali
    et al. [11] found in their research that high pH value soils have toxic value
    of aluminium and manganese. It was also found those soil organisms that help in
    agriculture are hindered by high acidic soils. Crops with moderate fertilizer
    requirements do best overall in soil with pH 5.5–6.5. 3 System Overview This irrigation
    system consists of four main units as shown in Fig. 1. Mainly the irrigation field,
    in the field the designed wireless sensor are implanted in a Mesh topology pattern.
    The percept received from the field is send to the WSN-PPU (wireless sensor’s
    percept processing unit). For cheap and fast mode of transmission Xbee Series
    2, Zigbee sensors were used. The received signal is analysed in WSN-PPU and appropriate
    command to pass to the Wireless sensor network actuator controller (WSN-AC) unit.
    According to the type of field and water availability either sprinkle or Drip
    or surface irrigation methodology [12] can be implemented to water the irrigation
    field. The received precept and the corresponding actuator pair dataset are stored
    in the Sensor’s Data Analysis Unit (WSN-DAU) for further usage. This unit can
    be aided either by internet service controller or by Bigdata service [13]. Fig.
    1 System overall configuration Full size image The overall implementation of existing
    systems that can be seen in Literature surveys has been for research purpose and
    testing only. Also the previous works as specified in the Literature surveys requires
    expensive systems that cannot be afforded by general low scale farmers. There
    is rarely any real implementation of such smart control methods that are seen
    in India. The proposed methodology would be fit for both large scale and small
    scale farmers with more customizable options. For a large scale field, feed from
    multiple humidity sensors can determine the effectiveness of irrigation system
    for uniform distribution of water at the same time conserving water as it only
    supplies required amount as programmed with maintained humidity. As for a greenhouse
    or small scale land such system will reduce the need of skill and other involved
    hardships over irrigation and nutrition testing. In this paper the principle behind
    WSN-PPU is explained in detail with appropriate results. Monitoring WSN nodes
    in the field, are the basic parameter sensors deployed in the monitoring area
    of the soil environment, these units are used to realize the monitoring function.
    The general flow diagram is shown in Fig. 2. The functions of these Nodes are
    defined as follows: Fig. 2 WSN flow diagram Full size image Collecting the temperature,
    Soil moisture and pH data of the soil area to be monitored. The Moisture, temperature
    and pH sensors installed on the monitoring nodes can meet the above needs and
    realize the linearization and temperature compensation for the data collected.
    Setting up a wireless network based on the ZigBee protocol. A great number of
    monitoring nodes and base station a dynamically assembled into a wireless network
    based on the ZigBee protocol, via which the pH, temperature and other data, shall
    be routed to a base station. 4 Sensors on Irrigation Field The proposed field
    environment monitoring system based on a WSN can be divided into three parts:
    base station, monitoring nodes and WSN-PPU for the irrigation area being detected.
    Many number of monitoring nodes, has been distributed in working area to be detected,
    constituting a monitoring network. Now each node can collect parameters such as
    pH, soil moisture and temperature which can indirectly tell us the amount of dissolved
    oxygen, electrical conductivity rate. Also is capable of operating data packaging,
    collected parameter storing in memory and determining the constituents of the
    soil on the basis of pH detected; the data obtained from the nodes is sent to
    the remote monitoring centre by the base station via ZigBee module setup; the
    monitoring centre analyses and processes the soil quality parameters gives a display
    for soil contamination and its suitability, in addition any missing constituents
    in soil, and does the decision making in choosing the type of soil to be cropped
    and the amount of water to be irrigated at different instants of time. The end-user
    can also be implemented with all-weather detection on field area via WSN-DAU.
    The whole setup monitoring system exhibits characteristics like large storage
    capacity, easy display, low power consumption, cheap cost, and no influence on
    the normal environment. With an open effort to many other papers [5] the wireless
    sensor network was found to be predominantly more precise than satellite imaging
    and more favoured for real time sampling. Also a number of controllers were used
    for parameter evaluation and comparison ranging from 8085 to PIC to DSP. It was
    found that apart from humidity and temperature many researchers overlooked the
    Nutritional context of the field probably to be objective specific only i.e. Control
    of irrigation. However pH is a cumulative expression for acidic or basic nature
    of the soil which can be considered as parameter that can be controlled by exploiting
    the acidic or basic concentration of the water that is being used in irrigation.
    The research project prerequisites of few concepts like controller, sensors and
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee, which are essential to the hardware. The
    overall Microcontroller unit is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Overall controller unit
    Full size image 4.1 Soil Moisture Sensor Soil moisture sensor used here is SEN-13322
    that measure the volumetric content of water in the soil indirectly by using some
    other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant,
    or interaction with neutrons as a proxy for the moisture content. There are two
    large exposed pads which function as probes for the sensor, they together act
    as a variable resistor. The more water that is in the soil means the better the
    conductivity between the probes will be and will result in a lower resistance.
    The VCC and GND pins are connected to the PIC. Our analog readings will vary depending
    on what voltage is used for VCC as well as the resolution of the ADC pins. There
    is a comparator inbuilt in the sensor which compares the analog output from the
    soil obtained through the probes. This output ranges from 0 to 5 V, the reference
    voltage is 5 V. The PIC is used to calculate the moisture through a set of coding
    and algorithm defined within a program. The sensor is serially connected to the
    ADC pins of PIC which converts the analog input to digital and the PIC processes
    the input and the comparator process through the algorithm defined. This gives
    the moisture result in the LCD screen. For better result the sensor probes are
    inserted more than half of its length inside the soil and are kept for some few
    seconds. The ADC module of PIC microcontroller which we are using has 8 inputs
    for 40 pin Devices. The conversion of analog signal to PIC ADC module results
    in corresponding 10 bit digital number. PIC ADC module has software selectable
    high and low voltage reference input to some combination of VSS, R1, R2. Here
    analog input is converted to channel 1–10 bit digital number with low voltage
    reference (Vref−) 0 V and high voltage reference (Vref+) 5 V. The output will
    be displayed using one LCD. One can change the Vref− and Vref+ by configuring
    the ADCON1 register. 4.2 Temperature Sensor National Semiconductor’s LM35 IC has
    been used for sensing the temperature. The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit
    temperature sensors, whose output voltage is linearly proportional to the Celsius
    (Centigrade) temperature. The LM35 thus has an advantage over linear temperature
    sensors calibrated in degree Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a
    large constant voltage from its output to obtain convenient Centigrade scaling.
    The LM35 is rated to operate over a −55 to +150 °C temperature range. This makes
    it suitable for field work. The LM35 is calibrated to an accuracy of 1 °C. Its
    measurement range is from −55 to 150 °C. The output is linear and each degree
    Celsius equals 10 mV, thus 150 °C = 1500 mV and −55 = −550 mV. 4.3 pH Sensor pH
    sensor consist of a pH combined electrode with output probe that is connected
    to the PIC with the help of an amplification circuit serially. The best thing
    about the setup is it outputs data from the probe over serial. There is a definite
    need of different buffer solutions to observe the pH value like red for pH 4.0,
    yellow for pH 7.0 and blue for pH 10.0. The pH circuit converts the current generated
    by hydrogen ion activity into the pH. The current that is generated from the hydrogen
    ion activity is the reciprocal of that activity and can be predicted using this
    following Eq. (1) $$E = E^{0} + \frac{RT}{F}\ln \left( {\alpha x_{H + } } \right)
    = E^{0} - \frac{2.303RT}{F}pH$$ (1) where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the
    temperature in Kelvin, F is the Faraday constant. Along with the probe Buffer
    solutions are maintained. For dilution of water in order to maintain the pH level
    of the soil the irrigation water uses is mixed with KCl solution with required
    H+ ion and OH− ions. The concentration of ions are controlled in order to obtain
    two separate pH buffer solution Buffer solution 1 with Acidic nature has pH =
    4 and Buffer solution 2 with pH = 9 has the Basic nature. A simple digital pH
    meter can be made with a very cheap operational amplifier TL082 (with Dual JFET-input),
    two 9 V batteries, a digital multimeter, and a pH probe (SEN 10972). The TL082
    works as a unity gain buffer between the high impedance value of the pH probe
    and the multimeter. Two batteries power a high-input-impedance op-amp. The pH
    probe is connected to the non-inverting input. This proposed circuit is so small
    and so simple that there is no need of a circuit board. In this method, one BNC
    connector is used to connect to the pH probe. In theory, a pH probe produces 41–59
    millivolts (mV) per pH unit and at pH 7, the probe produces 0 V. For acid pH values
    it produces negative voltages and positive for basic pH values. At 7.02 pH calibration
    buffer the voltage is 4.4 mV. With pH 3.00 calibration buffer, the output voltage
    measured with the digital multimeter is 167.9 mV. Hence, 167.9–4.4 = 163.5 mV
    (for 4.02 pH) Thereby, 163.5/4.02 = 40.67 mV (per pH unit) Now for 100 mV, the
    pH is: 100/40.67 mV = 2.45 (pH units difference from 7.01) 7.02–2.45 = 4.57 pH
    In this way the soil testing results in acidic conclusion. This same method was
    tried with different buffer solutions of soil by adding acidic and basic drops
    in specified proportions and the graph in Fig. 7 was obtained. Hence the pH calculated
    is then serially input to the PIC through ADC module. This PIC does the arithmetic
    and other logical operations according to the coding and algorithm defined. The
    output of this is displayed in the LCD screen which is interfaced with the microcontroller.
    4.4 Microcontroller PIC 16F877 is the microcontroller used in the project from
    Microchip family. There are numerous reasons behind selecting this microcontroller.
    It has 14 bit core, 40 pin DIP, works on up to 20 MHz It also has flash memory
    for rewritable purpose. This microcontroller is very easy to be assembled, program
    and also the price is very cheap. The erasing time is almost unnoticeable because
    once new program are loaded into the PIC, the old program will automatically be
    erased immediately. PIC 16F877A already made with 368 bytes of Random Access Memory
    (RAM) inside it. Any temporary variables that are used inside the program are
    stored inside the RAM thus eliminating the need of external memory. The size of
    program code that can be stored is about 8 k words inside PIC16F877A ROM. 1 word
    size is 14 bits which is more than enough for the system. The crystal oscillator
    that can be connected to the PIC microcontroller range from DC to 20 MHz. The
    ADC module of PIC microcontroller which we are using has 8 inputs for 40 pin Devices.
    The conversion of analog signal to PIC ADC module results in corresponding 10
    bit digital number. PIC ADC module has software selectable high and low voltage
    reference input to some combination of VSS, R1, R2. Here analog input is converted
    to channel 1–10 bit digital number with low voltage reference (Vref−) 0v and high
    voltage reference (Vref+) 5 V. The output will be displayed using one LCD. The
    ADC resolution that is the minimum voltage required to change between bits for
    PIC 16F877A is 0.004887 V. 4.5 Solar Power System Solar power is the most abundantly
    available resource the human being can ever get. Though it hasn’t been used even
    up to it’s 5% potential. Nowadays solar panels are put into use in large scale
    even to run a whole building. Solar panel has proven itself in many ways, cooking,
    firing, electricity etc. In our research project we are using a small solar panel
    of 7.5 × 7.5 cm dimensions, which is enough to charge a 12 V rechargeable battery
    which in turn powers the whole circuit including the PIC and the motor valves.
    The solar panel has a discharging current of 200 mA and provides 2 W power. The
    solar panel is connected to the battery through a dc to dc chopper circuit. The
    circuit is responsible to transfer the dc power generated in the solar grids to
    the battery. The battery here serves as the storage device. This battery is connected
    to the power input point of the PIC. Hence there is a continuous supply of power
    to the central unit in case of rain, sun or no sun. The case when there is no
    solar energy available, the recharged battery powers the circuit for 4 h as per
    the practical testing showed. But in order to increase its driving time, one can
    always go for bigger solar panel. The project also includes a solar panel to make
    it-self sustainable. The solar panel charges under the sun and a chopper circuit
    used to store the energy in a chargeable battery and works during day and night.
    Hence there is no need of external power supply whatsoever. The overall implementation
    of this research work is shown Fig. 4. Fig. 4 a Overall hardware view. b Moisture

    The research project implements an Xbee Series 2 hardware that enables several
    different flavours of standards-based ZigBee mesh networking. Mesh networking
    is the heart of creating robust sensor networks, the systems that can generate
    immensely rich data sets or support intricate human-scale interactions. It has
    a typical (indoor/urban) range of 40 m; best (line of sight) range is 120 ms.
    Transmit/Receive current of 40/40 mA and firmware (typical) is a ZB ZigBee mesh.
    There are 11 digital input/output pins and 4 analog input pins. Other features
    are low power, low bandwidth, low cost, addressable, standardized, small and popular.
    It uses a whip/wire antenna sticking up from the body of the radio. It’s simple
    and offers omnidirectional radiation, meaning the maximum transmission distance
    is pretty much the same in all directions when its wire is straight and perpendicular
    to the module [14]. A wireless sensor network consists of receiving and transmitting
    module. The transmitting node can be either in the field or at the base station.
    Unlike Wi-Fi, it’s not an open source. The ZigBee module uses two Xbee modules
    in order to send and receive data. For an application like agricultural monitoring
    system the best suited system is ZigBee because of its appropriate distance range,
    fast data transfer rate and also it is cheap as compared to others. 5.1 Data Transmitting
    and Receiving Process The data transmitting process is nothing but the data to
    be transferred from the monitoring nodes on the field to the receiver at the base
    station. The data transferred are soil moisture, temperature and pH values of
    the soil. The pH setup needs an amplification circuit [15] which has been explained
    earlier in the pH section. The transmitting side has Xbee series-2 module which
    is connected to the receiver side through a local network created in application
    programming interface (API 2) mode. The port A0 to A5 in the PIC is used for collecting
    data purpose. The inputs are given at port A0 to A2 and outputs are collected
    at port A3 to A5. After that the module checks for any further available WSN functions.
    If there exist a signal, the data is transmitted; otherwise the process is repeated
    again. The receiver also has Xbee series 2 module used which resides at the base
    station. The data is transmitted via ZigBee wireless sensor network and is received
    in analog form which is then converted to digital values through ADC converter
    in the PIC. Now the digital values are stored in the database. Then check for
    any reception request signal available from the transmitter side, if yes repeat
    the process otherwise wait for the next signal to be transmitted. Figure 5 shown
    the data flow diagram for data transmission and reception. Fig. 5 Transmission
    and receiving process data flow diagram Full size image The Table 1 shows the
    variations in the different analog values with respect to variation in distance
    from the receiver system. The analog ouput values of the moisture sensor, the
    temperature sensor and the pH sensor output are all tabulated as A1, A2 and A3
    respectively. The receiver side is connected to the system and the transmitter
    side is in the field with the sensors. The RX1, RX2 and RX3 are the received values
    of A1, A2 and A3 pins respectively. The Xbee S2 has the best working range of
    120 m. The output was taken after every 3 m distance up to 120 m and was tabulated
    as shown above. The tabulation concludes that the best working range of Xbee S2
    module is 97 m, since beyond 97 m the output in the LCD screen was either theoretically
    wrong or practically impossible. Hence the display of error values tells that
    beyond 97 the values may or may not be true, but within 97 m the Xbee module can
    be used with accurate measures. Table 1 Transmission and reception percept Full
    size table The project deploys a computer to configure the XBee and to send and
    receive data directly from our laptop. The XBee is made to be soldered directly
    into a printed circuit board. The use of Xbee explorer adapter is made to connect
    it to computer’s USB port using a fairly standard USB cable. The whole setup is
    built over a breadboard and is interfaced through a PIC microcontroller. The transmitter
    side is connected to the soil sensors and receiver side is connected to the evaluation
    board. 6 Empirical Evaluation As a part of this research project, different aspects
    of the hardware along with standalone modules were tested for different conditions
    to analyse sampling scenario efficiency. The Project module was tested in a field
    of area nearly 16 sq. feet with sub terrain soil commonly found in Tamil Nadu.
    The Priority given is most for pH followed by Humidity and temperature at bottom.
    The system first analyses the pH data that is provided by the sensor. The pH rating
    is checked for the ideal pH range (In case of a potato it is from 5 to 6 pH).
    The relative pH, temperature and humidity of the soil once measured were given
    to the soil and a valve control was established with a simple irrigation dripper.
    The pH data gives an account of compatibility of the soil with the crop and fertilizers
    to be used. The farmer can decide from the readings that weather the crop to be
    sown and fertilizers to be used will result in a good yield or not. Soil Moisture
    Sensor has two probes that basically provide a bridge to be facilitated by conducting
    nature of moisture. The probes are distanced by 3 cm and have an effective area
    of radius 28 cm, beyond which sensor is ineffective. The test was done by keeping
    temperature constant first at room temp T = 32 °C and the probe was inserted in
    soil and then water was supplied to the periphery from dry condition to saturated.
    The same experiment was repeated with T = 37 °C. The Moisture content was noted
    and result was shown in graphical form. The Inference made was that the sensor
    nearly shows the uniform character for a temperature with rise of moisture content
    nearly 12%. With sampling done in real time scenario the sampling rate of moisture
    sensor was kept very large to once in every 1 s keep keen surveillance. However,
    knowing that pH change in soil is very time taking process and conserve energy
    consumption the pH of the soil was sampled after every 1 h. The following Table
    2 shows the values obtained on the field testing for 8 days. The minimum and maximum
    values are indicated along with the mean/average value for that particular day.
    Hence from the Fig. 6, the result from this table is that the pH for that particular
    crop ranges from 6 to 6.7, moisture varies from 24 to 61% and temperature varies
    from 24 to 34 °C. Fig. 6 Percept’s average values on the field Full size image
    Table 2 Sensor readings per day Full size table The following graph Fig. 7 illustrates
    the variation of output voltage between the electrode and reference electrode
    with the pH value. The digital pH meter setup explained in the earlier section
    was used to obtain the curve other than the ideal straight line. This curve shows
    the accuracy of the pH electrode which is very slightly deviated from the ideal
    value, hence proving it to be correctly working. Fig. 7 pH Electrode voltage variation
    with pH level Full size image The following graph Fig. 8, displays the hourly
    variation in the humidity of the soil tested for approximately 12 h duration.
    The moisture varied from 24 to 35% on a normal day for a particular crop field
    in Chennai. Fig. 8 Moisture hourly variation in a day Full size image Unlike the
    above graph temperature doesn’t show ups and down in the curve as shown in Fig.
    9. Since, the testing was done on the soil of Chennai, naturally the humidity
    will be high and so will be the temperature. The temperature values are also taken
    on hourly basis and variations were recorded. There is gradual increase and decrease
    in the temperature curve when tested on the same field for 12–15 h duration. As
    shown in the figure below, the temperature varies from 26 °C at 8 am to 33 °C
    in the afternoon and again back to 24 °C in the evening. Fig. 9 Soil Temperature
    hourly variation in a day Full size image The pH value was tested on a field continuously
    for 10–12 days span and the values were recorded. The graph shown below is drawn
    with the help of the data obtained. The pH value varied from 5.5 to 7 as shown
    in the Fig. 10. The crop upper limit and lower limit was specified and there was
    a slight overcoming of the value at pH 7 on the third and fourth day, which can
    be due to many reasons like over watering the plants or cool weather or less fertilizer
    usage, improper ploughing etc. Fig. 10 pH recordings Full size image 7 Conclusion
    The research experiment conducted rendered lot of interesting facts regarding
    the characteristics of the soil. The overall humidity content not only described
    how quickly the soil was losing water but also this loss was making it slightly
    less acidic nature which was loss of H+ ions. Once the pH was found to be out
    of ideal region (5–6) water content was diluted for desired characteristic and
    drippers were turned on. This might overshoot the ideal humidity line. The average
    Soil moisture content was nearly maintained to the desired level. For initial
    level of growth we assumed the moisture content of soil ideally to be 30–31%.
    The average output for the tested soil was found to be 28%. (Note that this value
    is low as it initially required compensate the dryness of the soil. Hence this
    value is below the set ideal value) The overall system provided real time monitoring
    and control to water content, temperature and pH of the soil with acceptable water
    over supply level. As a part of the research project further development can be
    made in User Interface system and design of the mechanical structure. With advancement
    in mobility and communication technology a smart phone app can be designed for
    a well-organized real time data display and other functionality. Again for more
    precise and sensitive control better sensors like ion selective electrodes can
    be used for an extensive research scenario. References Doorenbos, J., & Kassam,

  explanation: The study investigates the role of moisture stress in upland rice production,
    specifically focusing on the impact of varied irrigation schedules and moisture
    levels on yield and yield components. The authors carried out field experiments
    under different irrigation and moisture regimes to evaluate the effects on growth,
    yield, and water use efficiency of upland rice. The results showed that water
    stress caused significant reductions in grain yield, biomass production, and water
    use efficiency, with the extent of the reduction varying depending on the intensity
    and duration of the stress.

    \ \n \n \n338 \n \nABSTRACT \n \nLow yields in upland rice (Oryza sativa L.) are\
    \ frequently linked to poor crop management practices \nalong with a lack of high\
    \ yielding varieties, abiotic and biotic stressors. Drought (lack of water), \n\
    overwatering (waterlogging/flooding), extreme temperatures (cold, frost, and heat),\
    \ etc, all \nnegatively impact crop and other plant growth, development, yield,\
    \ and seed quality. Drought or \nmoisture stress is the most important factor\
    \ affecting upland rice under changing climate. Global \nclimate change also exacerbates\
    \ the vulnerability of upland rice production. Upland rice plants \nundergo physiological\
    \ and biochemical alterations as well as morphological changes as a result of\
    \ \nmoisture stress. Different moisture stress affects the yield of upland rice\
    \ ranging from 18-97% yield \nloss. As a result, crop management with broad, integrative\
    \ and multi-disciplinary methodologies is \nrequired to increase productivity\
    \ and profitability. Different mitigation strategies to overcome \nmoisture stress\
    \ and increase upland rice yields have been addressed in this review.  \n \n \n\
    Keywords: ROS; AMF; PPFM; PGPR and Sensor. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \n \nCrop plants\
    \ are subjected to a variety of \nenvironmental stresses, many of which impair\
    \ \nplant growth and development, reducing crop \nplant yield [1]. Abiotic stress\
    \ is the most \ndamaging element to crop growth and yield \naround the planet.\
    \ According to research, abiotic \nstressors are also more detrimental when they\
    \ \noccur in mixtures of abiotic stress factors. \nDrought, salinity and temperature\
    \ are the most \ncommon abiotic stressors that limit agricultural \ndevelopment\
    \ and productivity around the world. \nThe availability of water is the most critical\
    \ factor \nlimiting the productive potential of higher plants \namong the abiotic\
    \ stressors [2]. Soil moisture \nstress is the most harmful of these factors.\
    \ \nGlobal climate change may exacerbate the \nvulnerability of upland rice production.\
    \ Abiotic \nconstraints account for a large portion of the \ndifference between\
    \ yield potential and actual \nagricultural output, especially in developing \n\
    nations. Drought stress causes physiological              \nand biochemical changes\
    \ in upland rice plants, \nas well as morphological changes which limit \nupland\
    \ rice production [3]. Barrero et al. [4] also \nreported \nwater \ndeficit \n\
    or \nsurplus \nduring                   \nthe \ngrowing \nseason \nand \ntemperature\
    \                    \nextremes \nassociated \nwith \nclimate \nchange       \
    \           \nare abiotic factors that affect upland rice \nproductivity.  \n\
    \ \nUpland rice production uses less irrigation water \nand needs less labour.\
    \ It is suitable for sloping \nfields that are prone to erosion, as well as \n\
    drought-prone locations. Upland rice is currently \nthe daily staple diet for\
    \ about 100 million people. \nAsia accounts for over two-thirds of the world's\
    \ \nupland rice area. Upland rice covers 12% of the \nentire rice-growing area\
    \ in the world. According \nto recent figures, Asia, Latin America, and Sub-\n\
    Saharan Africa accounted for 65, 10%, and 25% \nof total upland rice area across\
    \ 71 nations, \nrespectively, equalling 8.8, 1.2, and 3.2 m ha. In \nAsia, Latin\
    \ America, and Africa, upland rice \naccounted for 6, 19, and 32% of total rice\
    \ area, \nrespectively. In most Asian countries, upland rice \naccounted for less\
    \ than % of total rice \nproduction. It accounts for 13% of India's total \nrice\
    \ growing area of 44.71 m ha [5]. Upland rice \nproductivity is extremely low,\
    \ around 1.0 t ha-1 \ncompared to lowland rice output, which is 5-6 t \nha-1 [6].\
    \ Water stress is a major limitation of \nupland rice and maintaining yield and\
    \ nutritional \nquality under different conditions will require \nextensive research\
    \ on crop selection and \nmanagement [7].  \n \n2. WATER/ \nMOISTURE \nSTRESS\
    \ \nIN \nUPLAND RICE \n \nThe major environmental limitation in lowering \nrice\
    \ yields is a lack of water. When the                    \nwater supply to the\
    \ roots becomes insufficient or \nthe \ntranspiration \nrate \nbecomes \nexcessive,\
    \                \nplants \nexperience \nwater \nstress. \nDrought           \

    \ \nStress \n \nHsiao (1973) classified water stress into: \n \ni. Mild stress:\
    \ plant water potential reduces \nby -5 to -6 bar, corresponding to an increase\
    \ \nof 8-10% in relative water content (RWC) \ncompared to well-watered plants\
    \ under mild \nevaporative demand of the atmosphere. \nii. Moderate stress: plant’s\
    \ water potential \nlowers by -12 to -15 bar or RWC by 10 to 20 \n% compared to\
    \ well-watered plants under \nlow evaporative demand of the atmosphere. \niii.\
    \ Severe stress: plant water potential \ndeclines by more than -15 bar or 20 %\
    \ RWC \ncompared to well-watered plants grown \nunder low evaporative demand of\
    \ the \natmosphere. \n \n2.2 Effect of Drought on Morphological \nCharacteristics\
    \ of Rice \n \n“Drought stress reduces the number of tillers [9], \nimpairs plant\
    \ height” [10] and the germination of \nrice seedlings. “As a result, a common\
    \ adverse \neffect is a reduction in biomass production. Leaf \nrolling is usually\
    \ associated with soil water deficit \nas \nan \neffective \nmechanism \nto \n\
    reduce \ntranspiration \nloss. \nRolling \nrapidly \nreduces \neffective leaf\
    \ area and transpiration, and this is a \nuseful drought-avoidance mechanism in\
    \ arid \nareas” [11]. “High seedling vigour, salt exclusion \nat the root level,\
    \ ion compartmentation in \nstructural \nand \nolder \ntissues, \nhigh \ntissue\
    \ \ntolerance, receptive stomata that close within \nminutes of exposure to salt\
    \ stress but partially \nreopen after acclimatization and upregulation of \nantioxidant\
    \ \nsystems \nare \nkey \nfeatures \nfor \nimproved performance under salinity.\
    \ Tolerant \ngenotypes often tend to exclude salt from flag \nleaves and panicles”\
    \ [12]. \n \n“Upland rice was found to be particularly \nsensitive to water stress\
    \ during the early \nreproductive stages. Stress during this period \nincreased\
    \ the number of growing degree days \nrequired \nnot \njust \nto \nachieve \n\
    the \nnext \ndevelopmental stage, but also to attain maturity, \naffecting the\
    \ development time from seed to \nharvest. When water is retained, the water \n\
    content in the 0-0.6 m soil layer is reduced to \nalmost 50% of the water accessible\
    \ to plants and \nthe stomatal conductance of the axial leaf \nsurface \nand \n\
    leaf \narea \nindex \ndecreases \nsignificantly, indicating severe stress. Farmers\
    \ \nwith limited irrigation water can prevent water \nstress by watering during\
    \ the panicle initiation \n(PI) period and saving water for later periods” \n\
    [13]. “Drought stress at the reproductive stage \nlowered plant height, the number\
    \ of days to \ncomplete heading, flag leaf area, chlorophyll \ncontent, and panicles\
    \ hill by a significant amount” \n[14]. \n \nDrought before and after heading\
    \ significantly \nimpacts brown and milled rice rates by lowering \nquality. It\
    \ also has an impact on tillering, floret \ninitiation and subsequent spikelet\
    \ sterility, as well \nas grain filling and the terminal period of rice \ncultivation\
    \ (Table 1). “Terminal drought is the \nmost destructive abiotic stress factor\
    \ for rice \ngrain yield. Plant antioxidant responses were \naltered in several\
    \ studies on the effects of \ndrought \nstress \nand \ndehydration, \nshowing\
    \ \nphysiological adaptability” [15]. \n \nTable 1. Effect of stress at the reproductive\

    \ \n2.3 Effect on Physiological Aspects \n \n“Drought stress impacts a variety\
    \ of physiological \nsystems in plants and causes a variety of \nphysiological\
    \ responses that enable them to \nadapt to drought stress. \nIncreased \nwater\
    \ \nproductivity during water stress necessitates the \noptimization \nof \nvarious\
    \ \nphysiological \nmechanisms” [17]. The understanding of rice's \nphysiological\
    \ reactions to drought should aid \nongoing \nresearch \ninto \ndeveloping \n\
    drought \nresistance in upland rice. \n \na. Effect on Photosynthesis: Due to\
    \ a \ndecrease in Rubisco activity, a Calvin cycle \nenzyme, severe drought conditions\
    \ inhibit \nphotosynthesis \n[18]. \nHowever, \nas \na \nprotective mechanism,\
    \ the quantity of \nRubisco activase increases during drought \nstress, which\
    \ rescues Rubisco sites [19]. \nThe \nenzymes \ninvolved \nin \nC4 \nphotosynthesis\
    \ are more drought-resistant \nthan those engaged in C3 photosynthesis, \naccording\
    \ to Pandey and Shukla [20]. Over \nreduction of the photosynthetic electron \n\
    transport chain may occur if PSII activity \n \n \n \n \nLangangmeilu et al.;\

    \ \n \n \n \n340 \n \nexceeds demand, which increases the \ncreation of reactive\
    \ oxygen species (ROS). \nAs a result, there must be a balance \nbetween photochemical\
    \ activity and photo \nassimilates demand. Drought drastically \nreduces PSII\
    \ activity in rice plant flag \nleaves, according to Pieters and Souki \n[21].\
    \ “Drought also has a deleterious \ninfluence on photosynthesis by affecting \n\
    photosynthetic \npigments. \nChanges \nin \nphotosynthetic pigment concentrations\
    \ are \ndirectly linked to plant biomass and yield” \n[22]. “Other pigment carotenoids\
    \ play \nfurther roles in the structure of chloroplast \nphotosystems, \nlight-harvesting\
    \ \nand \nphotoprotection, as well as helping plants \nto endure drought” [23].\
    \  \n \n“Plants grown under water-deficient conditions \nhave reduced stomatal\
    \ conductivity to conserve \nwater. Due to decreased stomatal conductance, \n\
    carbon monoxide (IV) fixation is reduced and \nphotosynthesis rate decreased,\
    \ resulting in less \nanabolic production for plant growth and yield. \nThe highest\
    \ stomatal conductance was recorded \nat 77 DAS while the lowest at DAS of upland\
    \ \nrice” [24].  \n \nb. Effect on protein and Lipid synthesis: \nWater deficit\
    \ brings about quantitative and \nqualitative changes in plant proteins. In \n\
    general, proteins in the plant decrease \nduring \nwater \ndeficiency \ndue \n\
    to \nthe \nsuppressed synthesis, more pronounced in \nC3 \nthan \nC4. \nThe \n\
    main \nproteins \nsynthesized in response to water stress \nare late embryogenesis\
    \ abundant (LEA)-\ntype proteins, desiccation stress proteins, \nproteins that\
    \ respond to ABA, dehydrins, \ncold \nregulation \nproteins, \nproteases, \nenzymes\
    \ required for the biosynthesis of \nvarious \nOsmo \nprotectants, \nthe \ndetoxification\
    \ enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX, \nPOD, GR). \n \nWater deprivation affects nitrogen\
    \ metabolism in \nplants and water-deprived plants have been \nfound to initiate\
    \ protein hydrolysis, resulting in an \nincrease in amino acids in plant tissues\
    \ [24].  \n \nABA is a growth regulator, involved in stress \ntolerance. A dynamic\
    \ accumulation of ABA in \nresponse to water stress has been well studied in \n\
    rice. It has a role in mediating plant responses \nagainst drought stress conditions\
    \ through a \nseries of signal transduction pathways.  \nDrought results in the\
    \ variation of fatty acids \ncomposition. Lipid peroxidation is the well-known\
    \ \neffect of drought and many other environmental \nstresses via oxidative damage.\
    \  \n \nc.  Oxidative \nstress \naccompanied \nby \ndrought stress: “Enzymatic\
    \ antioxidants \nare superoxide dismutase (SOD) and \nperoxide dismutase (POD),\
    \ while non-\nenzymatic ones are ascorbic acid and \nalpha-tocopherol. Superoxide\
    \ dismutase \n(SOD) is an enzyme that alternately \ncatalyzes the dismutation\
    \ (or partitioning) \nof the superoxide radical into either \nordinary \nmolecular\
    \ \noxygen \n(O2) \nor \nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Superoxide is \nproduced as\
    \ a by-product of oxygen \nmetabolism and, if not regulated, causes \nmany types\
    \ of cell damage” [24]. The non-\nenzymatic \nplant \nantioxidants \ncan \nbe\
    \ \nclassified into two major types:(1) Ascorbic \nacid AA-like scavengers and\
    \ (2) pigments \nsuch as carotenoids.  \n \n“Defence mechanisms in the crop for\
    \ restricting \nthe damage caused by ROS can be done by \nincreasing antioxidants,\
    \ either enzymatic or non-\nenzymatic antioxidants. These antioxidants have \n\
    a role in protecting the crop from damage due to \noxidative stress” [25]. Boy\
    \ et al. [26] observed \nthat “drought induces the production of ROS and \nantioxidant\
    \ activity of four local upland rice \ncultivars in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.\
    \ Drought \ntolerant cultivars of Habo and Sunggul had \nhigher activities of\
    \ SOD, POD, AAred as well as \nα-Toch with lower content on free radicals of O2\n\
    - \nand H2O2 compared to non-drought tolerant \ncultivars”. \n \n4. MITIGATION\
    \ \nSTRATEGIES \nFOR \nDROUGHT STRESS IN UPLAND \nRICE \n \nIt includes the use\
    \ of drought-resistant varieties, \ntillage, \nmoisture \nconservation \ntechniques,\
    \ \nirrigation scheduling, adjusting the date of \nsowing, seed priming, use of\
    \ growth regulators, \nsilicon, antitranspirants, CaCl2, biofertilizers, etc.\
    \ \n \n3.1 Varieties  \n \nThe first drought tolerant, early duration (90-95 \n\
    days) variety Vandana was developed in 1992 \nfrom Central Rainfed Upland Rice\
    \ Research \nStation of Central Rice Research Institute at \nHazaribag, using\
    \ drought tolerant and high \n \n \n \n \nLangangmeilu et al.; Int. J. Environ.\

    \ \n \n \n341 \n \nyielding indica genotypes. Further efforts led to \nthe development\
    \ of varieties like Anjali (2002), \nVirendra (2006), CR Dhan 40 (2008) and \n\
    Sahbhagidhan (2011). lndira Barani dhan-1 and \nShushk Samrat were developed and\
    \ released \nsimultaneously at IGKV, Raipur, and NDUA&T, \nFaizabad, \nrespectively.\
    \ \nIn \n2005, \nDFID \n(Department for International Development) and \nBirsa\
    \ \nAgricultural \nUniversity \nin \nRanchi \ncollaborated to develop two popular\
    \ upland \ncultivars, BVD109 and BVD110 [27]. Pandey and \nVelasco [28] listed\
    \ the characteristics of upland \nrice varieties such as short duration rice cultivars,\
    \ \nmodified root systems with thicker and deep \npenetrating roots, lodging resistance,\
    \ early vigour \nand drought tolerance. \n \n“Rice cv. Tulsi is recommended for\
    \ Eastern India, \nfor upland ecological cultivation systems where a \ncrop experiences\
    \ natural cycles of water deficit \nand water sufficiency, depending upon the\
    \ \nmonsoon rains” (Srivalli et al., 2003). Jinsy \n(2015) compared four different\
    \ varieties like \nAiswarya, Uma, MAS 946 -1 (Sharada) and PMK \n(R) 3 under flooded\
    \ and aerobic conditions. The \neffect of varieties on water productivity, rooting\
    \ \ndepth and root volume was significant, with MAS \n946 –1 (Sharada) recording\
    \ higher values. \nMagwanga and Kirungu, [24] observed “a \nsignificant reduction\
    \ in yield from two upland rice \nvarieties IRAT 109 and Lemont under water \n\
    deficit but IRAT 109 exhibited a relatively higher \nyield index under water deficit\
    \ conditions. The \nimproved yield could be attributed to the ability to \nescape\
    \ drought conditions due to its ability to \nmature early”. \n \n3.2 Tillage \n\
    \ \nYoichiro et al. [29] investigated how upland rice \nresponded to various agronomic\
    \ approaches and \nfound that harvest index, root length, and grain \nyield were\
    \ all higher with deep tillage and straw \nmulch. While Gopal et al. [30] reported\
    \ that “soil \nstructure is improved in upland rice grown under \nzero tilled\
    \ direct-seeded rice (ZTDSR) due to \nreduced compaction from zero tillage”. Zero\
    \ \ntillage beds also provide the opportunity for \nmechanical weed control and\
    \ improved fertilizer \nplacement as existing weeds are burned down \nby using\
    \ herbicides such as paraquat @ 0.5 kg \na.i. ha-1or glyphosate @ 1.0 kg a.i.\
    \ ha-1. \n \nNo-till with 100% covered surface with residues \nstored (122–172\
    \ mm) more soil moisture (0–40 \ncm soil depth) in comparison with that for the\
    \ \nconventional \ntillage \nwith \n100% \nresidue \nincorporation (110–161 mm)\
    \ and enhanced \nproductivity and profitability of upland rice [31]. \nUpland\
    \ \nrice \ngrown \nunder \nrice–rapeseed \n(Brassica campestris Var. Toria) system\
    \ in \nrainfed conditions with two tillage systems CsT- \nconservation \nand \n\
    CT- \nconventional \ntillage, \nsignificantly showed lower bulk density and \n\
    penetration resistance (0–15 cm) and higher \nwater infiltration rate under CsT\
    \ than CT. The soil \nwater holding capacity (WHC) and soil moisture \ncontent\
    \ (SMC) in rapeseed were significantly \nhigher under CsT than those under CT\
    \ at 0-\n15 cm and 15–30 cm depths according to Das et \nal. [32].  \n \n3.3 Seed\
    \ Priming  \n \nIt is a viable and instant method for establishing \ndrought tolerance\
    \ in rice. Seed priming is the \nprocess of hardening the protoplasm of seeds.\
    \ \nThere are many types of priming such as hydro \npriming, \nhalo \npriming,\
    \ \nosmopriming \nand \nhormonal priming. When compared to non-\nprimed seeds,\
    \ Sheela [33] found that seed \ntreatment with water for 12 hours and KCl (2.5%)\
    \ \nfor 18 hours produced the highest grain and \nstraw production. Brooks et\
    \ al. [34] evaluated the \nbenefit of different seed priming found that seeds\
    \ \nprimed with 0.05% MgCl2 were highly effective in \nimproving a variety of\
    \ attributes such as mean \nemergence time (MET), emergence index (EI), \nvigour\
    \ index (VI), and fresh and dry weight of \nshoot and root. Under normal, mild\
    \ drought \nstress, and severe salinity stress, the METs of \nhydro primed (control)\
    \ seed were 1.08, 4.70, and \n4.70 days, respectively, but the METs of seed \n\
    primed with MgCl2 seed were 0.53, 3.40, and \n1.63 days. The results demonstrated\
    \ that \nosmopriming with 0.05% MgCl2 is an effective \nstrategy for helping upland\
    \ rice seedlings resist \nabiotic stress conditions by improving seed \nemergence\
    \ and seedling growth. \n \n3.4 Sowing \n \nBased on weather forecasting, proper\
    \ planning of \nsowing time is required. Timely sowing ensures \nhigher rainwater\
    \ use efficiency. Early or delayed \nsowing leads to lower rice production. The\
    \ best \ntime to seed direct-seeded rice (DSR) is about \n10-15 days before the\
    \ monsoon begins to \nmaximize the utilization of monsoon rain [35]. \n \n“Method\
    \ \nof \nsowing \nincludes \nbroadcasting, \ndibbling and row seeding by using\
    \ a drum \n \n \n \n \nLangangmeilu et al.; Int. J. Environ. Clim. Change, vol.\

    seeder. Broadcasting needs 80-100 kg seeds ha-\n1. In dibbling seed rate is 80\
    \ -90 kg ha-1. Optimal \nseed rates for row sowing 20 cm apart and \nbroadcast\
    \ under appropriate management were \n300 and 400 seeds m-2 (67.5 and 90 kg ha-1for\
    \ \ncv. Kalinga III) respectively” [36]. According to \nAdigbo (2007) dibbling\
    \ of “pregerminated seeds \nresulted in higher growth attributes and yield. To\
    \ \nensure uniform crop establishment, upland rice \nshould not be drilled deeper\
    \ than 2.5 cm and \nplanting at the optimal time increases total yield \nby 40-50%\
    \ and improves rainwater usage \nefficiency” [35].  \n \n3.5 Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ \n \n“Proper irrigation scheduling enables the farmers \nto schedule water rotation\
    \ among the various \nfields to minimize crop water stress and \nmaximize the\
    \ yield. It reduces the cost of water \nand labour. The most used irrigation scheduling\
    \ \nmethod is the IW/CPE ratio method i.e. the ratio \nof irrigation water (IW)\
    \ applied to cumulative pan \nevaporation (CPE). Narrower the ratio, the wider\
    \ \nthe irrigation interval. Higher grain yield, straw \nyield and biological\
    \ yield were observed when \nirrigated at IW/CPE ratio of 1.2” (Jolly, 2017).\
    \ \nAparna (2017) observed higher grain yield, straw \nyield and HI were observed\
    \ when irrigated at 3 \ncm depth at 10 mm CPE. \n \n“Irrigation schedule for rice\
    \ under limited water \nsources: \nFor \nsummer \nrice \nunder \nlimited \nresources\
    \ of water, phasic stress irrigation can \nbe practiced to the advantage of saving\
    \ a \nsubstantial quantity of irrigation water without any \nsignificant reduction\
    \ in yield. About 20-30% more \narea can be irrigated with the same water \nresources\
    \ by adopting one of the following \nphasic stress irrigations given below. Depending\
    \ \nupon the schedule, water-saving ranges from 24-\n36% of the requirement for\
    \ 5 cm continuous \nsubmergence \nthroughout \nthe \ncrop \ngrowth”          \
    \    \n[37]. \n \nMicro irrigation methods: Nowadays micro-\nirrigation is gaining\
    \ popularity among rice \nfarmers. “Sprinkler and drip irrigation methods \nhave\
    \ the potential to increase irrigation water           \nuse efficiency by reducing\
    \ runoff and deep \ndrainage \nlosses \nand \nevaporation. \nGrowth \nattributes\
    \ such as plant height and tiller              \nnumber hill-¹ were found to be\
    \ higher under \nsprinkler irrigation at 125% Epan” [38]. Anusha et \nal. [39]\
    \ reported that drip irrigation at 2.0 Epan \nthroughout \ngrowth \nstages \n\
    recorded \nhigher \nproductive tillers (no hill-1), panicle length, panicle \n\
    weight, grain and straw yield. \n \n3.6 Moisture Conservation Methods \n \nMulching\
    \ is the one of moisture conservation \nmethods. It will reduce evaporation losses\
    \               \nand thereby increases soil moisture storage. \nOrganic and polythene\
    \ mulches are the two \ntypes used in upland conditions. Ellilot et al. [40] \n\
    reported that rice straw mulch with 3 t ha-1 \nrecorded \nhigher \nroot \nbiomass,\
    \ \nshoot                    \nbiomass and yield compared with no straw \nmulch.\
    \ Yadav et al. [31] also observed that “no-\ntill with 100% covered surface with\
    \ residues \nalong with brown manuring (BM) stored (122–\n172 mm) more soil moisture\
    \ (0–40 cm soil \ndepth), recorded the lowest weed biomass and \ndensity. Therefore,\
    \ the cultivation of upland rice \nusing no-till along with BM mulching enhanced\
    \ \nthe productivity and profitability of rice cultivation \nin Indi”a. \n \n\
    3.7 Use of Silicon and CaCl2 \n \n“Silicon can alleviate water stress by decreasing\
    \ \ntranspiration. Transpiration from the leaves \noccurs mainly through the stomata\
    \ and partly \nthrough the cuticle. As Si is deposited beneath \nthe cuticle of\
    \ the leaves forming a Si-cuticle \ndouble layer, the transpiration through the\
    \ cuticle \nmay decrease by Si deposition” [41]. “Calcium \nhas been shown to\
    \ ameliorate the adverse \neffects of water stress on plants and is involved \n\
    in signalling anti-drought responses. Calcium \nappears to play a central role\
    \ in many defense \nmechanisms that are induced by drought, and \nCa2+ signalling\
    \ is required for the acquisition of \ndrought tolerance or resistance. Application\
    \ of \nCaCl2 (1%) as seed treatment helped in \nmitigating the harmful effect\
    \ of drought stress” \n(Devi, 2013). \n \n3.8 Use \nof \nBiofertilizers \nand\
    \ \nMicroorganism \n \nPink \nPigmented \nFacultative \nMethylotrophs \n(PPFM)\
    \ are methylobacterium that can reduce \ndrought stress by producing ROS scavenging\
    \ \nenzymes, by increased production of proline and \nproduction of ACC deaminase\
    \ which converts \nACC to ammonia and alpha-keto butarate \nwherein normal reaction\
    \ ethylene formation \noccurs. Other biofertilizers like Trichoderma, \n \n \n\

    \ mitigate against stress as \ntheir colonization in the root reduces drought-\n\

    \ \nconducted \n“an \nexperiment using a wireless sensor network for \nlow-cost\
    \ wireless controlled irrigation solutions \nand real time monitoring of the water\
    \ content of \nsoil. Data acquisition is performed by using solar \npowered wireless\
    \ acquisition stations for the \npurpose of control of valves for irrigation.\
    \ The \nBase station unit is programmed to read and to \nevaluate sensors data,\
    \ to control valves and to \ncommunicate with other units. 10 HS coded pre-\n\
    calibrated Soil Moisture Sensor of Decagon has \nbeen used to measure the water\
    \ content of soil. \nThe sensor unit sends moisture data with sensor \nnumber.\
    \ The Valve unit changes the position (on \nor off) after receiving the data from\
    \ Base station \nunit and the irrigation system start to work. The \nobtained\
    \ irrigation system not only prevents \nmoisture stress due to climate change\
    \ but also \ndiminished excessive water usage, ensuring of \nrapid growing weeds\
    \ and derogating salification. \nCost effective solar power can be the answer\
    \ for \nall our energy needs. Solar powered smart \nirrigation systems are the\
    \ answer poor farmer”. \nSimilarly, Harishankar et al. [47] performed “a \ncase\
    \ study on power-efficient water irrigation \nsystem using solar power in which\
    \ the controller \nwas connected to the soil sensor and water \nsupply valve.\
    \ The water valve was turned \nON/OFF based on the water level monitored by \n\
    the \nmoisture \nsensor. \nWhen \nthe \nsoil                      \nmoisture content\
    \ reaches the required value,                \nthe valve is fully closed and power\
    \ to driver \ncircuit is killed and controller is put into                   \
    \       \nsleep \nmode \nfor \nlow \npower \nconsumption.                    \
    \ \nVisa vice, when the moisture in the soil is dried \ndue to high temperatures\
    \ under changing \nclimate. This way the whole system works \nautomatically \n\
    and \nhelps \nto \nmitigate \nthe             \nmoisture stress effect on crops\
    \ under changing \nclimate”.  \n \nSensor-based IoT system was used for water\
    \ \nirrigation by Kansara et al. (2015) in which the \ncontroller controlled the\
    \ opening and closing of a \nsolenoid valve based on the water level of the \n\
    soil. A series of weather alerts were sent to the \nuser via a mobile application\
    \ to update the \ntemperature and humidity of the environment \nunder changing\
    \ climate, which had a direct \ninfluence on the water level of the soil. This\
    \ way \nit helps plants to avoid stress conditions. Using \nATMEGA 328, a water\
    \ sprinkler system for smart \nirrigation \nwas \nreported \nby \nKumar \net \n\
    al.                    \n[48,49] using temperature, humidity and soil \n \n \n\

    \ The water sprinkler was \ncontrolled based on the soil moisture level to \n\
    save \nwater \nand \nthereby, \nreduce \nstress \nconditions. \n \n3.11 Omic Approaches\
    \ \n \n“The intrinsic genes for sophisticated abiotic \nstress in plants may be\
    \ identified as omics \ntechnology \nadvance. \nProteomics \nand \nmetabolomics\
    \ have been demonstrated to be \nquickly growing fields, allowing researchers\
    \ to \nobtain detailed and precise information on \nproteins and metabolites produced\
    \ by plant cells \nin response to environmental issues. Both of \nthese new locations\
    \ are predicted to significantly \nenhance \ncereal \nproduction. \nSimilarly,\
    \ \ntranscriptomics profiling is particularly valuable in \nguaranteeing a full\
    \ understanding of regulatory \nmolecules and networks that are involved in \n\
    stress tolerance communication” [15, 50-54]. \n \n4. CONCLUSION \n \nThe development\
    \ of high-yielding drought-\nresistant cultivars is a mandatory component for\
    \ \nmost rice growers in changing climates. In this \nregard, many researchers\
    \ proved to have some \nscientific \nway \nof \nproper \nmitigating \nand \nmanagement\
    \ to meet the demands of a rising \nglobal \npopulation \nunder \ndifferent \n\
    climatic \nchanges. \nHence, \nmany \ndroughts \nresistant \nvarieties viz. IRAT-109,\
    \ CR Dhan-40, Vandana, \nTulsi, etc. along with the HRD gene that \nundergoes\
    \ SRI (System of Rice Intensification) \ntechnique with low/ reduced tillage operation\
    \ via \nhormonal priming specially PGPR that are sown \nat appropriate early dates\
    \ in the month of May-\nJune using ATMEGA 328, a water sprinkler \nsystem for\
    \ smart irrigation is recommended. In \nthe case of drought sensors, transcriptomics\
    \ \nprofiling is valued in guaranteeing a full \nunderstanding of regulatory molecules\
    \ and \nnetworks that are involved in stress tolerance \ncommunication. Application\
    \ of silica on the rice \nleaves leads to the formation of cuticle double \nlayer\
    \ by influencing the reduction of transpiration \npull which ultimately enhances\
    \ the moisture level \nthat makes it tolerable to drought stress.  \n \nCOMPETING\

  explanation: The paper explores the use of automated systems for real-time irrigation
    management in vineyards. The proposed system integrates sensors, IoT devices,
    and machine learning algorithms to collect and analyze environmental data, make
    informed decisions, and automate irrigation processes. The authors focus on using

    \ affects viticulture by reducing the production yield and the\nquality characteristics\
    \ of its ﬁnal products. In some observed cases, the consequences of climate\n\
    outages such as droughts, hail and ﬂoods are absolutely devastating for the farmers\
    \ and the sustained\nlocal economies. Hence, it is essential to develop new in\
    \ implementation monitoring solutions\nthat offer remote real-time surveillance,\
    \ alert triggering, minimum maintenance and automated\ngeneration of incident\
    \ alerts with precision responses. This paper presents a new framework and\na\
    \ system for vine stress monitoring called Vity-stress. The Vity-stress framework\
    \ combines ﬁeld\nmeasurements with precise viticulture suggestions and stress\
    \ avoidance planning. The key points\nof the proposed framework’s system are that\
    \ it is easy to develop, easy to maintain and cheap\nto implement applicability.\
    \ Focusing on the Mediterranean cultivated table grape varieties that\nare strongly\
    \ affected by climate change, we propose a new stress conditions monitoring system\
    \ to\nsupport our framework. The proposition includes distributed ﬁeld located\
    \ sensors and a novel camera\nmodule implementing deep neural network algorithms\
    \ to detect stress indicators. Additionally, a new\nwireless sensor network supported\
    \ by the iBeacon protocol has been developed. The results of the\nsensory measurements’\
    \ data logging and imposed image detection process’s evaluation shows that\nthe\
    \ proposed system can successfully detect different stress levels in vineyards,\
    \ which in turn can\nallow producers to identify speciﬁc areas for irrigation,\
    \ thereby saving water, energy and time.\nKeywords: precision viticulture; IoT;\

    \ is getting drier, making it even more vulnerable to droughts and\nwildﬁres.\
    \ High-resolution climate data and regional climate models show that in 50-years,\
    \ an overall\nreduction of mean annual precipitation of 39.1–55.1 mm and an increase\
    \ of mean air temperature of\n1.5–2.3 ◦C are imminent. The consequence of these\
    \ changes will be the increase of annual reference\nevapotranspiration to 92 ±\
    \ 42 mm (6.7%) [1,2]. Some researchers and governments may consider the\n50-year\
    \ window span as a long time to plan and react. The news is disappointing as we\
    \ are already\ngoing through the ﬁrst 10 years of this prediction.\nConsider Ensembles’\
    \ climate projections for 2021–2050 forecasting which state that there was\na\
    \ temperature increase of about 1.5 ◦C and a precipitation decrease of about 7.5%.\
    \ The authors of [3]\npredicted an average reduction in annual net revenue per\
    \ hectare of 891.48 €/ha, corresponding\nto a 39% loss. However, it is worth mentioning\
    \ that the losses have an impact in the cultivation.\nIn particular, the annual\
    \ net revenue showed strong reductions equal to 38%. These changes in\nweather\
    \ conditions allowed the European Union to increase advance payments to farmers\
    \ in 15 of the\n27 Member States in 2017 [4].\nIoT 2020, 1, 337–359; doi:10.3390/iot1020020\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/iot\nIoT 2020, 1\n338\nOn the basis of the ofﬁcial document\
    \ of [5], climate change will have serious socio-economic\nconsequences throughout\
    \ Europe in the long term. Depending on the region within the European\nUnion,\
    \ the impacts of climate change will vary and sometimes from one member state\
    \ to another.\nDrought is likely to increase in Central and Eastern Europe. The\
    \ projected increase in drought and heat\nstress risks is estimated to be in the\
    \ period 2023–60 and is expected to result in decreased crop yields.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that annual losses in agriculture in general could rise up to 8–15 billion euros\
    \ by the end\nof the century. Greece, Portugal and Spain are hot spots that are\
    \ likely to suffer from water scarcity.\nIn addition, a study conducted on the\
    \ effects of climate change on grapevines that respond to water\nstress and drought\
    \ has shown the negative effects of droughts start even before one might expect\
    \ [6].\nThere are also suggestions for earlier grape harvest times in the future\
    \ because they have noticed that\nberries are growing under such arid climate\
    \ conditions will be signiﬁcantly stressed, particularly in\nthe Mediterranean\
    \ area. Even though the use of safety nets is not common and expensive, they will\n\
    probably be helpful in cases of hail and heavy rainfall, but with minimum improvements\
    \ in drought\nand temperature levels concerning investment cost/production annual\
    \ revenue.\nThus, the purpose of the current research is to monitor short-term\
    \ and long-term temperature\nrises, and thus detect viticulture stress. For this\
    \ reason, the Vity-stress framework has been developed\nto measure temperature,\
    \ humidity, UV levels and soil moisture to control the quantity and frequency\n\
    of watering vineyards. Additionally, water stress, leaf bleaching, degradation\
    \ and senescence were\ndetected using RGB cameras. We propose a new holistic framework\
    \ for the detection of stressful\nconditions in a vineyard. The proposed framework\
    \ is called Vity-stress and focuses on analyzing\nmulti-source sensory data via\
    \ intelligent statistical techniques and expert knowledge so as to enable\nproper\
    \ delegate actions based on both temporal and spatial variability and information.\
    \ The Vity-stress\nframework includes a decision support engine for viticulture\
    \ cultivation. In addition, an appropriate\nvalidation system is given and validation\
    \ results are discussed.\nSection 2 presents the most common precision viticulture\
    \ systems, devices, indexes and sensors\nused. In Section 3 we propose the Vity-stress\
    \ framework, and the equipment and telemetry protocol\nsupporting the framework.\
    \ In Section 4 the Vity-stress image detection process and metrics are\npresented,\
    \ and in Section 5 experimental scenarios of the proposed system are presented.\
    \ Finally,\nSection 6 concludes the paper.\n2. Precision Viticulture Systems\n\
    This section outlines the major systems and sensors that assist in the occurrences\
    \ of climate change\naccounting and extrapolation of targeted agricultural guidelines.\
    \ This means combining technological\nsystems and sensors with accurate farming\
    \ practices that provide stability and quality compared to\ntraditional ones under\
    \ difﬁcult environmental conditions.\nSpectral measurements with the use of metrics\
    \ in infrared and visible light (400–1400 nm) offer\nsigniﬁcant results regarding\
    \ vine disease detection and stress. Redundant diseases of the vine and\nthose\
    \ with biotic stress show similar occurrences, both affecting the photosynthesis\
    \ phenomenon and\nthe physical structure of the grapevine leaves, thereby altering\
    \ the absorption of light by the surface of\nthe plant. Furthermore, the discrimination\
    \ between disease and stress is a very complex experimental\naspect that depends\
    \ on environmental conditions, variety and cultivation practices used. Thermal\n\
    infrared (TIR) multi/hyperspectral and sun-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF) approaches\
    \ together with\nclassic solar-reﬂective (visible, near and shortwave infrared\
    \ reﬂectance (VNIR)/SWIR) hyperspectral\nremote sensing are the state-of-the-art\
    \ techniques for detecting water stress [7].\nA case study for the development\
    \ of spectral disease indices for the detection of FD disease in\ngrapevines is\
    \ presented in [8]. Even if hyperspectral devices far much narrower bands (10–20\
    \ nm)\nover the same frequency ranges, they offer more precise measurements. However,\
    \ multispectral\ndevices and imagery taken from UAVs, drones (of low resolution)\
    \ or handheld equipment (of high\nresolution) are more commonly used than hyperspectral\
    \ [9], due to their lower costs. Such low cost\ncomes at the price of environmental\
    \ interference and detection errors ranging from 5 to 15% [8].\nIoT 2020, 1\n\
    339\nThe detection algorithms used (hyper or multi) for noise removal and resolution\
    \ reduction are support\nvector machine (SVM), support vector regression (SVR)\
    \ classiﬁers with different applicable kernels,\nfuzzy logic and knowledge-based\
    \ rule set classiﬁers [10].\nAir monitoring is essential for the detection of\
    \ the consequences of climate disruption, such as hail\nor drought. However, such\
    \ detection is governed by sparse area clustering and periodic measurements\n\
    of poor resolution prone to errors due to the UAV’s speed, distance from the vine,\
    \ vertical camera\nlens orientation and focus. Take Sentinel-2 satellites which\
    \ are able to detect the land’s surface [11].\nAs far as camera lens orientation\
    \ is concerned, drones have been proven to be more efﬁcient due\nto their ability\
    \ to stay still and drones’ are capable of ﬂying smaller distances to the viticulture\n\
    stumps. However, GPS navigation issues leave space for handheld multi-spectral\
    \ detectors performing\nsparse measurements.\nBhanarkar et al. suggests a ﬁeld\
    \ of soil salinity and moisture measurement system by wireless\nsensor network\
    \ (WSN) [12]. This system is energy efﬁcient, low cost, portable and small in\
    \ size.\nThe system architecture consists of water sensors in which when soil\
    \ moisture module detects\nlow humidity, outputs are high level, an 8-bit high-performance\
    \ low power microprocessor and\na compatible radio module which is based on IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 protocol, such as XBee [13]. Sensed data\nare wirelessly transmitted\
    \ via concentrators to cloud data logging services, for soil moisture monitoring\n\
    purposes. Subsequently, growers watch the soil moisture on their computer or mobile\
    \ devices and\ncan water the ﬁeld once the values shown in the sensors are high.\
    \ Based on the Bhanarkar approach,\nKontogiannis is proposing a similar cheap\
    \ and WSN system to support irrigation decisions based on\na customized LoRa transponders\
    \ communication protocol that controls the irrigation process using\na FuzzyNN\
    \ algorithm [14].\nVity-stress RGB camera indexes are described in Section 2.1,\
    \ while we propose the Vity-stress\ncamera framework in order to detect stress\
    \ using 3 RGB cameras in Section 4.\n2.1. Precision Viticulture Metrics and Indexes\
    \ towards Stress\nExisting viticulture systems can be categorized into distinct\
    \ categories of macro-area or high-level\nsurveillance and micro-area or dense\
    \ probing surveillance. Macro-area surveillance is performed by\nmeans of remote\
    \ sensing sensors or infrared, multispectral hyperspectral means. Remote sensing\
    \ can\nbe performed using robots, unmanned air vehicles (UAV), GPS autonomous\
    \ vehicles or cameras in the\nvisible spectrum. Proba-1 launched in 2001 for earth\
    \ observations using a compact high-resolution\nspectrometer monitoring 18 user-selected\
    \ visible and near-infrared wavelengths of 8–12 m pixel\nresolution, acquiring\
    \ more than 20,000 environmental science images [15]. GeoEye is DigitalGlobe’s\n\
    high-resolution (1.65-m) imaging satellite, used by Google Maps, the National\
    \ Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) Landsat 7–9 and EO-1 satellites\
    \ [16]. Sentinel-2 from European Space agency\nsatisﬁes of 12.5 m pixel resolution\
    \ [17].\nIn this remote sensing process, data and models acquired from meteorological\
    \ satellites in the\nEU, such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\
    \ (GOES), for the EU and Africa,\nMETEOSAT, Soil Moisture Active Passive satellites\
    \ (SMAP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) satellites\
    \ in accordance with the dense positioning of meteorological and\ngeodesy stations\
    \ monitoring atmosphere water vapor content [18,19], offer solid grid observations\
    \ and\nnotiﬁcations of severe and abrupt weather incidents.\n2.1.1. Spectroscopy\
    \ and High Frequency Measurements\nThe main multi/hyper spectral measures used\
    \ by these algorithms in order to detect vine stress\nare as follows:\nNormallized\
    \ Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI) [7–10,20]\nNDVI uses wavelengths in order\
    \ to detect greenness accuracies, including grasses, bushes and\ntree canopies\
    \ [21,22].\nIoT 2020, 1\n340\nPhotochemical Reﬂectance Index (PRI)\nIt has been\
    \ used to detect plant water stress [23]. This index focuses on bands at speciﬁc\n\
    wavelengths where photosynthetic pigments are affected by water stress conditions,\
    \ such as the\nchlorophyll PRI index that is related to leaves’ xanthophyl. When\
    \ the PRI is high it is a stress indicator\nfor the plant [24].\nLeaf Area Index\
    \ (LAI)\nLAI is a macroscopic index of the estimated leaf area over the ﬁeld area,\
    \ by measuring reﬂected\nlight near the soil by the plants, due to photosynthetic\
    \ plant tasks. Speciﬁcally, for vineyards LAI\nmeasurements can distinguish severe\
    \ stress events only and can be used as an evapotranspiration\nmetric with doubtful\
    \ results for vineyards, due to the plant orientation (layout lines with 1.2–2.4\
    \ m line\ndistances and 30–80 cm vine distances) [25]. Similar to LAI is the visible-band\
    \ difference vegetation\nindex (VDVI), which is calculated based on the three\
    \ bands of the visible light spectrum (RGB) [22].\nSoil-Adjusted Vegetation Index\
    \ (SAVI)\nThe SAVI index aims at enhancing the contrast between soil and vegetation,\
    \ thereby minimizing\nthe effects of illumination conditions [26]. For a speciﬁc\
    \ amount of vegetation, darker soil substrates\nresult in higher vegetation index\
    \ values. SAVI is an aggregation metric of canopy and NDVI [27].\n2.1.2. Viticulture\
    \ Sensors and Metrics\nSensor deployment plays a signiﬁcant role in monitoring\
    \ of vineyard conditions at the stump level,\ncalled micro-vineyard monitoring.\
    \ This is important for the detection of either stressful conditions or\ndisease\
    \ prosperous ones. Letting aside meteorological stations operating and providing\
    \ micro-climate\narea predictions [28,29], this section focuses only on stump\
    \ level vineyard condition monitoring sensors\nand metrics.\nWireless sensor networks\
    \ for micro-vineyard monitoring are only for real-time monitoring tools\nclose\
    \ to the vineyard. Its dense spatial and temporal measurements can offer smooth\
    \ data logging\ncapabilities and timely alert triggering, indicating the exact\
    \ problem areas [30]. As indicated by [31],\nweather swings affecting strawberry\
    \ grape variety can be easily measured using HOBO sensors and\nZigbee transceivers\
    \ in the ﬁeld.\nWireless sensor network deployments offer the advantage of low-cost\
    \ implementations of\nprecise and regular measurements concerning thermal or hyper-spectral\
    \ cameras or satellite images.\nIn addition, hybrid solutions using both WSNs\
    \ and image sensing can achieve better results, no matter\nthe cost of the equipment\
    \ [32] may be. The main beneﬁt of WSN deployment is that its continuous\nmeasurements\
    \ offer the ability of climatic cartography and zoning over geographic information\
    \ system\n(GIS) layers, which can be initially heuristically assigned based on\
    \ elevation, sunbathing and past\nyield references, and thereafter dynamically\
    \ updated by WSN measurements.\nOn the other hand, the deployment of WSN requires\
    \ additional maintenance. The wireless\ntechnologies used by WSN viticulture networks\
    \ in viticulture are ZigBee, LoRaWAN, 3G/4G,\nNB-IoT, Wi-Fi and custom RF. Apart\
    \ from 3G/4G, the technologies used are of low power footprint,\nproviding battery\
    \ operated sensor motes with long lives [33]. However, the existence of standardized\n\
    communication protocol for sensory measurements and alerts makes implementations\
    \ cumbersome\nbetween different types of technology and manufacturers.\nMost of\
    \ the micro-vineyard WSNs include sensors and metrics for temperature, humidity\
    \ and\nleaf wetness measurements and trends near the vine leaf area [34]. Additional\
    \ sensors, including\nopen type rain gauge sensors, wind speed sensors and direction\
    \ sensors [35], whose deployment is\nexpensive, are part of the upper-level micro-climate\
    \ meteorological sensor grid whose measurements\nand predictions can be easily\
    \ acquired either by microclimate meteorological reference points or open\naccess\
    \ meteorological initiatives [29]. Speciﬁcally, for rain fall and precipitation\
    \ measurements, the EU\nIoT 2020, 1\n341\ncountries stationary also utilize their\
    \ global positioning system (GPS) geostationary grids [18], as part\nof the E-GVAP\
    \ EU initiative [36].\nSoil ground sensors measurements for water content play\
    \ a signiﬁcant part in the micro-vineyard\nmonitoring.\nSince vine roots cannot\
    \ reach depths greater than 60–90 cm, their water ground\nreservoirs are considered\
    \ as surface ones and the soil moisture sensors’ deployments are easy to setup,\n\
    and provide temporal predictions by utilizing fuzzy and neural network algorithms\
    \ [14]. There are\nthree types of soil moisture sensors: (1) matric potential\
    \ sensors, (2) time domain reﬂectometry (TDR)\nand time domain transmissometry\
    \ sensors (TDT) and (3) capacitance sensors. Matric potential is\nthe measurement\
    \ of how tightly the water is constrained by the soil and is measured by tensiometer\n\
    devices that use a water-ﬁlled tube and a ceramic holed tip, expressing the tube–soil\
    \ water absorbance\n(tension) to kPa of the tube generated vacuum. The advantage\
    \ of tensiometers is their medium cost\nand high accuracy when properly maintained.\
    \ Their disadvantage is that they require signiﬁcant\nmaintenance, thereby making\
    \ them a fair solution for small vineyards of less than 5000 sq.m.\nBoth TDR and\
    \ TDT sensors use guided electromagnetic waves to measure soil dielectric constant\n\
    and its variations due to soil moisture content [37,38]. TDR sensors measure soil\
    \ reﬂectance using\npulses and measuring pulse response, while TDT sensors use\
    \ closed frequency oscillated wire loops\nand PLL detectors to measure phase shifts.\
    \ These sensors are extremely low priced, 10–20 times lower\nthan the cost of\
    \ a tensiometer sensor, and of medium maintenance, which only includes cleaning\
    \ and\nreplacing of rotten electrodes. In this category of TDR soil sensors, soil\
    \ moisture resistance sensors are\nincluded, which measure direct soil conductivity\
    \ by ampliﬁcation. These sensors are considered by far\nthe cheapest solution,\
    \ costing no more than 5e, but often require monthly electrode replacements in\n\
    order to provide accurate measurements [14]. As far as tensiometers are concerned,\
    \ TDR, TDT and soil\nconductivity sensors can provide accurate multiple soil depth\
    \ adjustments. Finally, capacitance sensors\nare similar to TDR sensors with the\
    \ difference that capacitance sensors determine the dielectric soil\npermittivity\
    \ by measuring the charge time of a two-electrode capacitor, using the soil as\
    \ a dielectric.\nCapacitance sensors are much more expensive than TDR, TDT and\
    \ tensiometers with a cost magnitude\nof 5–10 times more than tensiometer sensors,\
    \ but require even less maintenance, and provide more\naccurate measurements in\
    \ different soil depths.\nSensory measurements of solar intensity and radiation,\
    \ are used for the monitoring of\nmicro-vineyards. To date, some secondary indices\
    \ are recognized, particularly in relation to grapevine\ncultivation. The heliothermal\
    \ index (HI) is the index that uses the daily temperature and solar\nirradiance\
    \ to calculate the mass of leaves’ photosynthetic products. Furthermore, the biologically\n\
    effective degree days (BEDD) is an index that uses the sensory measured daily\
    \ temperature difference\nbetween highest and lowest temperatures over the daily\
    \ micro-climate min-max temperatures [32,39].\nFurthermore, the statistical climate\
    \ indices used to characterize suitability for viticulture: growing\ndegree-days\
    \ (GDD), the Huglin index (HI), the accumulated growing degree days (AGDD—the\
    \ index\nfor predicting the grape growing stage) and the average growing season\
    \ temperatures (GST) can also\nbe calculated from temperature measurements [40,41].\n\
    The solar intensity of reﬂective photosynthetic plant radiation is measured using\
    \ by quantum light\nsensors [42]. These quantum light–photosynthetically active\
    \ radiation (PAR) sensors, or ceptometers\nmeasure the number of photons absorbed\
    \ in 400 to 700 nm band and thus provide a voltage index\nof the photosynthetic\
    \ photon ﬂux density (PPFD) gradient or the LAI metric canopy value [43].\nCeptometers\
    \ and PAR meters are expensive devices due to their ability to self calibrate\
    \ the monitoring\nfrequency range of reﬂective radiation. Furthermore, the solar\
    \ duration time is measured using light\ndependent resistors (LDRs).\nMeasuring\
    \ solar radiation luminescence, manufactured leaf-shaped sensors are commonly\
    \ used\nto quantify emission or reﬂection of ﬂat, diffuse, uniform surfaces (\
    \ cd\nm2 ), and pyranometers measure\nsolar power ( W\nm2 ) in a wide spectral\
    \ range of 500 to 2800 nm. The frequency of measurements taken is\neither daily\
    \ or hourly solar near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), infrared (IR), falling radiation\
    \ and optical\nlight energy that can be absorbed by vineyards. Pyranometer sensors\
    \ can monitor a wide range of\nIoT 2020, 1\n342\nfrequencies of either NIR or\
    \ IR received solar power. Appropriate sensors for solar ionizing radiation\n\
    UVA, UVB and UVC can offer ionizing power measurements in the range 315–400 nm.\n\
    There are also three types of sensors. The ﬁrst one is a CO2 sensor placed in\
    \ a cane near the\ntrunk of a vine plant, in the upper cane area in order to measure\
    \ vineyard anaerobic respiration.\nDendometers, or digital caliper meters that\
    \ are used to measure the swelling and shrinkage, growing\nor ripening canes as\
    \ an indication of growth or plant stress [44]. Finally, a US patent of bipolar\n\
    electrodes wrapped around the canes of a vine plant in order to measure cane nutrient\
    \ ions moving\nfrom cane to the vine leaves and plant potential is proposed by\
    \ [45]. The next section of the Vity-stress\nframework is presented.\nIn Section\
    \ 3 the Vity-stress framework is presented which detects stressful conditions\
    \ in a vineyard.\n3. The Vity-Stress Framework\nThe quantity and frequency of\
    \ watering vineyards are two important factors, especially under\nclimate change\
    \ conditions (decreased water availability, high temperatures and heatwaves, frost,\n\
    etc.). The design of decision support logic takes into consideration all elements\
    \ related to the climate\nchange, like historical and real-time meteorological\
    \ data, weather forecast, water availability and\nquality. Additionally, it takes\
    \ into consideration the age and growth stage of grapevines, the variety\nand\
    \ planting rate, the different growing techniques, the irrigation device, the\
    \ soil quality, the soil\nmoisture from sensors embedded in the ground and plant\
    \ appearance.\nThe framework scheme involves the following application axes and\
    \ assessments as illustrated in\nFigure 1:\nStep 1: Identifying and quantifying\
    \ the impacts of climate change. Concentrating on drought and\nstudying of commonly\
    \ cultivated variety of table vines. Identifying of variability level/extent\n\
    within a viticulture ﬁeld and how climate change affects the qualitative characteristics\
    \ of the\nproduct as well as crop yield are addressed with the use of cheap sensors\
    \ built in a uniform\nsensor network.\nStep 2: Evaluating the effects. Classiﬁcation\
    \ logic using support vector classiﬁer is utilized, based\non the acquired measurements\
    \ from the sensors and micro-climate meteorological station\nmeasurements. The\
    \ signiﬁcance of the measurements are evaluated and ranked accordingly in\nhierarchical\
    \ classes.\nStep 3: Visualising the effects in real-time. An additional presentation\
    \ layer provides classes and\nmeasurement visualization for the appropriate GIS\
    \ service, provided by the framework.\nStep 4: Providing viticulture stump detailed\
    \ output response to farmers. Sensors assist the precision\nprotocols’ selection\
    \ process (assessment methodology as presented at Section 3.1) and facilitate\
    \ their\napplication, using data mining and machine learning processes. Such incorporation\
    \ provides GIS\nreal-time measures’ visualization, alerts to farmers on phenomena\
    \ initiation, predicts its duration,\nalong with indications and sensory trained\
    \ model feedback for the deployed framework WSN.\nThe proposed Vity-stress framework\
    \ decision logic classiﬁcation leads farmers to a proposition\ncalled assessment\
    \ rules. A summary of the assessment rules is presented in Section 3.1.\n3.1.\
    \ Vity-Stress Framework Assessments\nScientiﬁc literature indicates that there\
    \ is a close relationship between territorial factors (climate,\nsoil and viticulture\
    \ practices) and grapevine growth and quality [46]. Precision viticulture is a\n\
    site-speciﬁc, integrated information farming system which recognizes that the\
    \ productivity of\nvineyards can be inherently variable, and consequently that\
    \ is useful to establish zones of different\npractices within a vine plantation.\
    \ Environmentally sustainable wine-making is used to optimize\nthe production\
    \ of vineyards through the use of natural resources, while minimizing unintended\n\
    environmental impacts. This is achieved by collecting measurements related to\
    \ the vine status,\nclimate factors, soil characteristics and micro-vineyard conditions,\
    \ and associate these measurements\nwith assessment plans in order to turn this\
    \ information into assessment policies.\nIoT 2020, 1\n343\nFigure 1. Proposed\
    \ Vity-stress framework that includes (1) sensory packs and a camera module as\n\
    data input; (2) cloud-based decision support logic; and (3) precision farming\
    \ suggestions as delivered\noutput to the farmers via the mobile phone application.\n\
    Rare rainfall and ﬂoods are the number one sources of water in regions that are\
    \ semi-arid or\nfully arid where it is hard to manage water supply. In this section,\
    \ proposed aridity risk assessment\nmethods, parts of an assessment plan or precision\
    \ practices that can be the output of measurements\nbased on support vector classiﬁcation\
    \ machine (SVC), are described. These assessment methods can be\npart of the ﬁnal\
    \ decision output of the proposed Vity-stress framework, in order to prevent soil\
    \ aridity,\nfuture aridity events and abrupt cases that need incentive care.\n\
    The availability of soil moisture affects both the yield and the quality of grapes,\
    \ especially sugar\ncontent and color. For this purpose, we submit a decision\
    \ on the support framework for the monitoring\nof micro-vineyards in cases of\
    \ stress and therefore the scheduling of speciﬁc actions to be taken by\nfarmers\
    \ in the context of the proposed Vity-stress output response.\nControlled Irrigation\
    \ processes\nThese are the most commonly used responses that take into account\
    \ and use existing water\nsurplus, offering time-based irrigation practices or\
    \ water content controlled ones. It is essential for the\nirrigation process to\
    \ tightly couple with the ﬁeld measurements in order to provide more efﬁcient\
    \ smart\nirrigation practices based on fuzzy controllers or pre-trained neural\
    \ networks or both [14]. If no water\nsurplus from rivers, streams, lakes or other\
    \ subterranean cavities is available, then other precision\nmethods need to be\
    \ used.\nWater harvesting\nAnschutz proposes various water harvesting techniques\
    \ in order for growers to cope with soil\nmoisture [47]. Typically, water harvesting\
    \ is a collection of runoff. Runoff may be collected from roofs,\nground surfaces\
    \ or seasonal streams into wells or plastic underground tanks. We point out that\
    \ water\nsystems that harvest runoff from roofs or ground surfaces fall under\
    \ the term rainwater. Systems that\ncollect runoff from seasonal streams are grouped\
    \ under the term ﬂoodwater harvesting.\nIoT 2020, 1\n344\nIrrigating vineyards\
    \ using wastewater\nVineyards can be irrigated by waste water. Etchebarne suggests\
    \ that in order to maintain\nquality, especially for the wine grape, growers should\
    \ maintain a perfect balance between fertilizing\nfactors which are responsible\
    \ for water quality [48]. We carried out an experiment on water quality\nand compared\
    \ their study with other ones derived from the bibliography and showed that the\n\
    nutrients concentrations and contents of the water could be directly linked to\
    \ wastewater origins.\nThe amount of water supplied varies and depends on climatic\
    \ conditions—especially in arid or\nsemi-arid regions—and whether the product\
    \ is wine grapes or table grapes.\nUsing organic fertilizer such as manure\nSamra\
    \ tested the impact of using cattle manure with a low level of mineral nitrogen\
    \ to meditate\nmineral nitrogenous fertilizer for Thompson seedless grapevines\
    \ [49]. The study lasted three years\nbetween 2004 and 2006 and the results showed\
    \ that using cattle manure at 5 kg/vine gave higher\nvalues of leaf area than\
    \ using no organic fertilizers at all. Additionally, the truck thickness was the\n\
    second factor that we examined presenting that cattle manure increased truck thickness\
    \ by about\n6%. Cattle manure increased the berry weight and diameter by about\
    \ 35.5%. That is because cattle\nmanure provides useful organics to the soil,\
    \ as it contains organic matter that helps improve the\nnatural chemical characteristics\
    \ of the soil, increasing water retention while helping to better aerate\nthe\
    \ soil and drainage. Furthermore, pyrolysis generates carbon-rich organic materials\
    \ generate by\nbiomasses, such as biochar [50], without causing side effects in\
    \ the soil, while improving locally soil\nfertility and moisture.\nWater constraint\
    \ natural materials\nAttapulgite is a natural soil clay natural material and its\
    \ characteristic is to enhance soil\nperformance [51]. It is capable of absorbing\
    \ the excess nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium and\nyields all that in the soil\
    \ and the plants. Attapulgite performs high soil aeration and increases the\n\
    soil moisture retention capacity by decreasing water use. Stocks of high quality\
    \ of attapulgite can\nbe found in the South East Grevena (mount Kisavos), in Greece.\
    \ Attapulgite products are a series of\n100% natural, environmentally friendly,\
    \ clay soil improving materials; however, they are rare to ﬁnd in\nnatural mineral\
    \ rock. Due to the very high surface area and absorbency of attapulgite in water,\
    \ if used\nin powder form it can decrease watering needs, enhance nutrient absorption,\
    \ improve soil aeration and\nfertility, increase the strength and growth of plants\
    \ and is suitable for all outdoor and indoor plants,\ne.g., fruit trees, vegetables\
    \ and vine plants. Similarly, zeolite can be easily incorporated in the garden\n\
    or potting soils as a substrate. Due to zeolites’s special characteristics, it\
    \ is an excellent material for\nuse as a water concentrate in vineyards as well\
    \ as in soil mixtures for water preservation [52]. In this\ncategory we include\
    \ any kind of rainwater constrained invention that provides this water to the\
    \ roots\nof the vine plant in a controlled periodic manner with the use of mechanical\
    \ means.\nAppropriate vine pruning techniques\nVine pruning is an assessment to\
    \ be applied for the next seasonal crop rather than to directly\ncountermeasure\
    \ the effects of an ongoing drought. However, it is a signiﬁcant measure for the\
    \ farmers\nto react in the near future.\nSection 3.2 presents the Vity-stress\
    \ system proposed by the authors, supporting the proposed\nframework.\n3.2. Vity-Stress\
    \ Monitoring System\nWe propose a densely deployed sensor network of cheap sensors\
    \ deployed near the vines along\neach vine lane. The proposed sensors include\
    \ temperature, air humidity, leaf wetness and soil moisture\nIoT 2020, 1\n345\n\
    resistance sensors, TDR soil moisture sensors, pyranometer sensors, UV sensors\
    \ and digital calipers,\nas proposed in the framework to implement sensors packs.\n\
    These sensors are provided in autonomous packs in devices that include the following\
    \ sensors:\n•\nTemperature and air humidity sensor pack;\n•\nTemperature and leaf\
    \ moisture sensor pack;\n•\nTemperature and two soil moisture sensors (TDR or\
    \ resistive) pack;\n•\nThree resistive soil moisture sensors pack;\n•\nPyranometer\
    \ and UV (preferably UVA or UVB) sensor pack;\n•\nLeaf wetness and digital caliper\
    \ pack.\nThese low-cost sensor packs include a (Bluetooth Low Energy) BLE sensor\
    \ that transmits data\nperiodically (with a duration of 30–120 s), using the iBeacon\
    \ protocol [53,54] to a central point of\nconnection called Vity-stress concentrator\
    \ (VSC). The entire system of the sensors and concentrator is\ncalled the Wireless\
    \ Vity-stress Network (WVN).\nDue to the short range communication of the BLE\
    \ beacons (no more than 50–100 m) several\nconcentrators need to be placed inside\
    \ a vineyard forming a dense WSN of multiple gateway points.\nThe concentrators’\
    \ cost supporting the Vity-stress framework must be at minimum 10–20 times less\n\
    than the cost of a multispectral camera, thereby minimizing the cost per farmer.\
    \ The VSCs acquires\nmeasurements from sensor motes (packs) called Vity sensor\
    \ beacons (VSBs), spread out in the ﬁeld,\nvia proper Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based\
    \ application telemetry protocol transmitted periodically,\nencapsulated under\
    \ the iBeacon frame [53], which lacks complexity and is more commonly used than\n\
    its predecessor Eddystone TLM [54]. The proposed protocol is called the Vity-Stress\
    \ Protocol (VSP)\nand its functionality is presented at the following Section\
    \ 3.3.\n3.3. Proposed Vity-Stress Protocol\nWe propose a new data transmission\
    \ protocol for the process of receiving of sensory measurements\nfrom the Vity-stress\
    \ sensor packs to the concentrator, called the Vity-Stress Protocol (VSP).\nThe\
    \ Vity-Stress Protocol (VSP) is designed for the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology\
    \ which uses\n2.4 GHz radio frequencies. In order to construct the VSP framework,\
    \ a slightly different approach of\nthe iBeacon protocol is proposed, taking advantage\
    \ of Data Type 2 major and minor ﬁelds. In this\napproach, Data Type 2 is now\
    \ called Vity Class, whilst UUID major and minor values have their initial\nnames\
    \ as they are predeﬁned from the iBeacon protocol. The VSP structure is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Vity-Stress Protocol structure.\nIn this protocol the\
    \ existing iBeacon minor and major ﬁelds are used for the encoding process of\n\
    telemetry data, since these values are rarely used by beacon advertising services.\
    \ A similar approach to\niBeacon major and minor ﬁelds reuse for interactive real-time\
    \ indoor positioning services is presented\nby [55]. The VSP is encapsulated in\
    \ the iBeacon frame [53]. The VSP does not include the default value\nof Data\
    \ Form 2 which is equal to 0xff; that it is a called VSP class and is ﬁxed depending\
    \ on the sensory\ntype used.\nThe high-level architecture communication between\
    \ the beacon sensors and the concentrator is\nillustrated in Figure 3. Our protocol\
    \ suite operates as follows:\n•\nEach beacon device cannot communicate with other\
    \ beacon device and can only communicate\nwith the concentrator.\nIoT 2020, 1\n\
    346\n•\nEach beacon device has a unique identiﬁer (UUID).\n•\nFrames are 30 bytes\
    \ long.\nThe network architecture consists of two entities, the transmitter and\
    \ receiver, as shown at Figure 3.\nThe transmitter (sensor pack) contains an entity\
    \ equipped with arbitrary sensors and a concentrator\nwhich supports BLE version\
    \ in order to collect the results. The sensors takes vine environmental\nmeasurements\
    \ of air humidity, temperature, soil moisture, leaf wetness and solar radiation.\n\
    The purpose of the VSP-capable beacons is to create inexpensive battery-operated\
    \ sensor kits that\nmeasure (e.g., humidity, temperature, soil moisture, leaf\
    \ wetness, solar radiation), taking advantage\nof the major and minor ﬁelds of\
    \ the massively used iBeacon protocol, which for VSP are not ﬁxed,\nunique and\
    \ change based on the values received from the beacon attached sensors. The major\
    \ and\nminor values are 16 bits long, providing up to two 16 bit sensor measurements\
    \ per transmitted beacon\nframe. If more sensors are attached to a beacon frame,\
    \ time multiplexing is applied, according to VSP\nmode 2.\nFigure 3. Vity-Stress\
    \ Protocol entities: sensors and sensor packs used communicating over BLE iBeacon\n\
    protocol with the camera concentrator.\nThe VSP protocol functional states are\
    \ divided into two modes. The ﬁrst mode has the ability to\ntransmit the data\
    \ from speciﬁc sensors (up to two measurements/frame) within an interval beacon\
    \ time\nset to 1–5 min, as shown in Figure 4a. The second mode of operation is\
    \ capable of transmitting sensory\nIoT 2020, 1\n347\ndata more than two sensory\
    \ values, by sending arbitrary time frames per beacon interval, known as\nthe\
    \ beacon interval. For example, in mode 2, temperature and humidity sensor measurements\
    \ can be\ntransmitted in the ﬁrst beacon frame, followed by soil moisture and\
    \ solar radiation measurements that\ncan be transmitted by the second beacon frame\
    \ (as shown at Figure 4b). The VSP classes are conﬁgured\ndepending on the sensor\
    \ type ﬁeld, as shown at Table 1. If the value of the VSP class is conﬁgured\n\
    as 0x01, which equals το b’00000001’, then, the received value is derived from\
    \ a temperature sensor.\nIf the value of humidity is conﬁgured as 0x02, which\
    \ equals b’00000010’, the received value is derived\nfrom the humidity sensor.\
    \ If the value of the VSP class is conﬁgured as 0x04, which equals b’00000100’,\n\
    the received value is derived from the soil moisture sensor. If the value of VSP\
    \ class is conﬁgured\nas 0x08, which equals b’00001000’, the received value is\
    \ derived from the leaf wetness sensor. If the\nvalue of the VSP class is set\
    \ as 0x10, which equals b’00010000’ in the binary system, the received\nvalue\
    \ is derived from the pyranometer sensor. The values 0x20, 0x40 and 0x80 respectively\
    \ are set for\nfuture use.\n(a)\nMode-1: Single VSP frame\nperiodic transmission\n\

    \ priority are in ascending order towards the MSB of the Data Type 2 class\nﬁeld.\
    \ If only one sensor measurement is transmitted, it is stored in the major ﬁeld\
    \ of the VSP. Then the\nminor ﬁeld receives the value of the most negative number\
    \ (0x8000) so that the concentrator BLE\ndecoder recognizes that there is only\
    \ one measurement of the sensor in this frame.\nThe authors’ VSP proposal is for\
    \ an easy to implement version of a protocol using existing\nbeacon protocol implementations.\
    \ Furthermore, the iBeacon protocol maintains a Universally Unique\nIdentiﬁer\
    \ (UUID) ﬁeld that identiﬁes each deployed sensor pack and beacon Tx power to\
    \ determine\nbeacon’s distance. The wavelength of the VSP beacon can be calculated\
    \ using TxPower using the\nreceived signal strength indicator (RSSI).\nValidation\
    \ results of the Vity-stress framework are presented in Section 5.\n3.4. Vity-Stress\
    \ Concentrator Architecture\nWe propose the use of a concentrator device used\
    \ to collect measurements from sensors placed\ninside the vineyard ﬁeld. The concentrator\
    \ will be responsible for: a) collecting periodic measurements\nreceived by the\
    \ nearby VSP capable sensors (beacons) and b) collecting images from the nearby\n\
    vineyard trees with the use of its embedded camera subsystem. The Vity-stress\
    \ concentrator (VSC)\ncamera subsystem utilizes three RGB cameras positioned peripherally\
    \ to cover a viewing angle of 120◦\neach, so altogether they cover a viewing angle\
    \ of 360◦.\nCommunication between sensors and concentrator equipment is one way.\
    \ The concentrator\nequipment receives periodically transmitted iBeacon frames\
    \ and decodes their PDU payloads\naccordingly, based on the proposed Vity-Stress\
    \ Protocol (VSP). Communication is between the\nconcentrator devices and the cloud\
    \ data logging service where the decision logic resides uses either\nNB-IoT or\
    \ 3G/4G cellular technology. The concentrator device includes 3-camera system\
    \ RGB cameras,\nwith infrared capabilities, z-placed 120◦ apart. Figure 5 presents\
    \ the proposed Vity-stress system\nconcentrator prototype equipped with RGB cameras.\n\
    In detail, the illustrated concentrator includes three RGB cameras on the z-plane\
    \ that can be\nattached to a metal pole of 60–90 cm z-axis height, supported the\
    \ metal pole pointy ground penetration\nedge (Figure 5, (3)). The concentrator\
    \ device includes a 6 V, 7–10 Ah battery pack that is charged\nby a 2 W-6 V panel\
    \ placed on top of the concentrator, assuring its autonomous operation. There\
    \ are\nthree RGB cameras placed at 120◦ apart at the same height around the outer\
    \ polygon surface of the\nconcentrator (Figure 5, (5)). These camera modules are\
    \ also equipped with IR night vision capability.\nDue to the energy cost of 6–7\
    \ Ws of the 3-camera component to take a snapshot and a max\ntotal of 2 min in\
    \ order for the Vity-stress image detection process to complete and upload the\n\
    calculated indexes, the Tp period for acquiring a scenery image measurement takes\
    \ more than\n1 h, to avoid battery depletion. The concentrator processing unit\
    \ includes a quad core-ARM RPi\nmicroprocessor with 512 MB of RAM for the image\
    \ detection processing tasks. The processing unit\nalso includes an embedded BLE\
    \ transponder for the reception of VSP protocol beacon frames and\na Wi-Fi transponder\
    \ for close-range communication—uploading to the VSP’s cloud service imagery\n\
    data and sensory measurements.\nIoT 2020, 1\n349\nCommunication between the concentrator\
    \ and the Vity-stress sensory packs spread in the vine\nlines is performed with\
    \ the use of the concentrator’s BLE module. The concentrator operates in sensing\n\
    periods (Tsens). During these periods, camera modules remain mainly inactive,\
    \ keeping them in a low\npower state, and its BLE component (Figure 5, (4)) stays\
    \ in an off state. When the Tsens interval expires,\nthe camera modules are powered\
    \ on sequentially by taking photos. Then the image processing step is\nperformed,\
    \ while the BLE transponders scan and log nearby beacons measurements (up to 60–80\
    \ m\nradius) using the VSP protocol.\nUpon image processing and measurement acquisition\
    \ completion, the external communication\nmodules with the Vity-stress cloud are\
    \ powered on. At ﬁrst, the Wi-Fi transponder (Figure 5, (4))\nsearches for open\
    \ Wi-Fi access points with an Internet connection to transmit its annotated images\
    \ and\nmeasurements, and if that fails using its 3G/4G USB dongle (Figure 5, (7)).\
    \ The protocol used for data\nuploads to the cloud is via JSON and HTTP POSTS.\n\
    The cameras are used to implement a cheap 360◦ panoramic plane image detection\
    \ system that\nuses image pre-processing, mask ﬁltering and deep convolution neural\
    \ networks (CNNs) for the\ndetection of vine stress signs and yield potential.\
    \ The concentrator image detection process and\nproposed metrics are presented\
    \ at Section 4. The cameras are connected via appropriate USB interface\nto the\
    \ processing unit, capable of enabling one camera at a time. The image capturing\
    \ periods are\nset by the Vity-stress cloud service and are propagated to the\
    \ concentrator as feedback parameters\nwhenever the concentrator uploads new measurements\
    \ or images. Since the image detection process\nis performed by the concentrator,\
    \ there is no need for image uploads but detected segments and index\nvalues.\
    \ Nevertheless, image uploads are necessary for the validation purposes. Section\
    \ 4 describes the\nprocess of the image detection as well as the proposal indexes\
    \ derived by vineyard images.\nFigure 5. Vity-stress concentrator device with\
    \ RGB cameras and MCU attached.\nWith respect to existing multispectral camera\
    \ technologies used extensively for the acquisition of\nperiodic on the spot or\
    \ UAV delivered LAI/NDVI/heat measurements, the Vity-stress concentrator\ncan\
    \ offer a much cheaper, closer at real time with high image resolution. This is\
    \ achieved with the\nuse of cheap CMOS RGB cameras and the implementation of convolution\
    \ neural network algorithms\n(CNNs), for vine stress and also yield detection\
    \ [56].\nIn Section 4 the proposed the Vity-stress image detection process is\
    \ presented, which the VSC\ndevices implement.\nIoT 2020, 1\n350\n4. Proposed\
    \ Vity-Stress Image Detection Process\nFor the processing of detecting viticulture\
    \ stress using optical means called Vity-stress\nconcentrators (VSC), we manufactured\
    \ a device. This device is equipped with three RGB cameras\nwith attached infrared\
    \ transmitters, and offers night vision capabilities too. The VSC cameras are\
    \ 120◦\napart, offering a 360◦ vision coverage at a vertical height of 80–120\
    \ cm. We give more details on this\nVSC equipment at Section 5. These VSC devices\
    \ implement the Vity-stress image-detection process,\nas illustrated in Figure\
    \ 6.\nLeaf bleaching occurs at high temperatures, making the leaves take on a\
    \ “bleached” look, due to\nthermal breakdown of the leaf tissue. This process\
    \ is irreversible, and permanently reduces a vine’s\ncapacity for photosynthesis.\
    \ If the water stress continues, embolisms (air pockets) may form in leaf\nvessels\
    \ or shoot xylem, and the leaves begin to disintegrate and become senescent.\n\
    In serious circumstances, vines or shoots collapse. These cases (senescence, bleaching)\
    \ can be\ndetected separately by the use of two separate instance segmentation\
    \ CNNs that estimate: (1) the\ncoverage pixel area of senescence in vineyard contours,\
    \ (2) a probabilistic approximation of leaf\nbleaching of detected leaves over\
    \ total leaf areas in vineyard contours and (3) the yield production\nexpressed\
    \ as a cumulative multiplication of contour detection probability by detection\
    \ area size in\npixels. The proposed process test-bed outcome is illustrated in\
    \ Figure 7.\nFigure 6. Image detection process for the detection of viticulture\
    \ stress.\nThe proposed process uses four independent stages of detection. The\
    \ ﬁrst stage includes the\ncompletion of the ﬁltering, image selection and calculation\
    \ of the vegetated area from the RGB cameras.\nThe second stage includes the segmentation\
    \ and analysis of the viticulture area bounding box and the\nidentiﬁcation of\
    \ the vineyard ROIs areas. From this process the proposed viticulture leaf index\
    \ metric\nis calculated based on Equation (1).\nVLI =\n∑n\ni=1 ECi\nmax {EBBOXCi\
    \ }\n(1)\nwhere EC is the contour areas and Ci is the i = 1 . . . n instance detected\
    \ contours using the Mask-RCNN\nalgorithm [57]. As an improvement of Faster R-CNN\
    \ [58], the masked region-based convolution neural\nnetwork approach (Mask R-CNN)\
    \ focuses on the problem of instance segmentation [57]. The Mask\nIoT 2020, 1\n\
    351\nR-CNN method adds to the Faster R-CNN an object mask prediction process in\
    \ parallel with the\nexisting bounding box R-CNN process. Mask R-CNN is simple\
    \ to train, and adds only a small overhead\nto Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps\
    \ [57,59,60].\nIn order to identify viticulture cultivation regions of stress:\
    \ The leaf regions of stress are indicated\nby the use of (1) a single shot detector\
    \ (SSD) semantic segmentation process [61], for the detection of\nbleaching as\
    \ shown at the top left and top right subﬁgures, 1 and 2, of Figure 7 a color\
    \ mask applied in\nthe previously detected Mask R-CNN ROIs, while calculating\
    \ the areas of discoloration, in order to\ncalculate areas of leaf stress as shown\
    \ at the bottom left subﬁgure, 3, at Figure 7. Then a new proposed\nindex value\
    \ is calculated called viticulture stress index (VSI), based on Equation (2).\n\
    VSI =\n∑m\ni=1 EROIi · pi + ∑l≤n\ni=1 E′\nCi\nVLI · max {EBBOXCi }\n(2)\nwhere\
    \ ROIi, i = 1 ... m are the bounding boxes of the selected by the SSD algorithm\
    \ as regions of\ninterest containing a bleaching leaf area with accuracy pi, expressed\
    \ as conﬁdence probability and\nE′\nCi the pixel areas of the instance ROIs masked\
    \ by an instance segmentation algorithm such as the\nMask-RCNN algorithm [57],\
    \ where: E′\nCi ≤ ECi.\nFigure 7. Image detection test-bed examples of the proposed\
    \ framework detection steps.\nFinally at the forth optional stage the viticulture\
    \ coverage area yield is detected and recorded as\nan absolute number of grape\
    \ bounded contours detected by the SSD algorithm, with conﬁdence more\nthan 0.75\
    \ pi ≥ 0.75, or if the table variety’s yield is of red color as percentage of\
    \ the pixels coverage\narea of the already detected viticulture Mask-RCNN contour\
    \ areas, using appropriate HSV blue or\nred color region mask. For the produced\
    \ yield we propose the viticulture yield index (VYI) value\ncalculated by Equation\
    \ (3).\nVYI =\n∑k\nj=1 EC′′\nj\nVLI · max {EBBOXCi }\n(3)\nIoT 2020, 1\n352\n\
    where C′′\nj are either the detected ROIs of detected grapes with conﬁdence greater\
    \ than 75% using\nSSD [61] or Faster RCNN [58] semantic segmentation, or for red\
    \ varieties the parts of the Ci leaf contour\nareas detected with blue or red\
    \ masked color coverage, and the application on these contours to the\nDouglas–Peucker\
    \ algorithm contour approximation for polygon shape or convex hull.\n5. Vity-Stress\
    \ System Experimentation\nSystem experimentation includes experimentation with\
    \ the VSP and VSP capable sensors’\nexperimental scenarios of coverage and frame\
    \ loss. Our experimentation and a validation of the\nproposed VSC image detection\
    \ algorithm with respect on detecting vineyard water stress follows\nusing RGB\
    \ images, taken from the VSC component.\n5.1. Experimental Scenario and Results\
    \ of the Vity-Stress Protocol\nVity-stress system and protocol experimental scenario\
    \ included the deployment of ﬁve pieces of\nVity-stress sensory equipment as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3, in the 2.83 hectare viticulture ﬁeld of debina\nvine variety [28],\
    \ at the area of Zitsa, Ioannina Greece, owned by the author Dr. Kontogiannis.\n\
    The vineyard consisted of lanes that are 100 m long with inter-lane distances\
    \ of 1.60–1.80 m.\nThe purpose of this scenario was to test the operation of the\
    \ VSP, and determined the maximum\ncoverage area.\nIn order for the VSP to be\
    \ examined, three beacon devices were placed. One of the beacon devices\ncontained\
    \ the VSP class of the VSP that consisted of a soil moisture sensor and a spot\
    \ temperature\nsensor, and the other two of the beacons contained humidity and\
    \ temperature sensors. Those two\nbeacon sensors included one RGB LED each that\
    \ indicates optically the levels of temperature and\nhumidity using red color\
    \ beeps for temperature (1 ◦C resolution) and blue color beeps for humidity\n\
    (5% resolution).\nThe beacons were initially placed in the same lane at distances\
    \ of 20 m (case 1) in order to cover\nas much area of the ﬁeld as possible. Then\
    \ they were switched into different vine lanes at the same\nimaginary line, using\
    \ the same 20 m distance between beacons (case 2). In both cases the received\n\
    signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the frame loss were measured, under a speciﬁed\
    \ frame reception\nwindow using 350 ms beacon interval and a maximum of 36,000\
    \ beacon frames in 1 m beacon distance.\nMeasurements were performed with the\
    \ use of an Android phone application. In this experimental\nscenario the Android\
    \ phone was placed 5 m from the center beacon, thereby having a maximum\ndistance\
    \ of 40 m from the farthest VSP beacon. The results have claimed that both cases\
    \ 1 and 2\nshowed no signiﬁcant variations in frame losses at the same distances.\
    \ The results for cases 1 and 2 are\npresented in Table 3.\nTable 3. Validation\

    \ did not signiﬁcantly affect the loss of signal\nbetween the farmer’s mobile\
    \ phone and the beacon device. From the Table 3 results, an energy\nconserving\
    \ beacon’s deployment scenario indicated a maximum distance between VSC and beacon\n\
    equipment of 20 m. Since the beacons were placed in the vine lanes and the VSC\
    \ must also have\nbeen in a vine lane, a VCS and four beacons occupied an area\
    \ of up to 800 m2, if enforced in a square\nIoT 2020, 1\n353\nplacement conﬁguration.\
    \ If the vineyard area beacon coverage was planned in a less energy efﬁcient\n\
    manner (of 40 m distance between VSC and beacon device) the coverage area using\
    \ one VCS and four\nbeacons can reach up to the 0.60 hectares.\nTable 4 shows\
    \ the Tx power of the beacons frames received by the mobile phone device over\n\
    distance (RSSI value is −59 dBm at 1 m). The deviation of RSSI values for cases\
    \ 1 and 2 has also\nbeen measured.\nTable 4. Received signal strength indicator\

    \ deviation in the RSSI measurement for cases 1 and 2\nwhen the distance between\
    \ beacons and mobile phone is ±7 dBm. Nevertheless, such deviation in the\nsignal\
    \ strength does not signiﬁcantly affect less the packet loss. For the intended\
    \ use this variation can\nbe set as non important.\nFinally, the maximum coverage\
    \ that was tested reached 92 m away in the same vineyard row and\n82 m from the\
    \ beacon device between different vineyard rows (worst case 2). The mean packet\
    \ loss\nin both cases was more than 95%. From the Vity-stress system experimentation,\
    \ the implementation\nsimplicity of the iBeacon protocol on top which the VSP\
    \ protocol operated offered adequate\nmeasurement results even with 60 m distances\
    \ between the collector device and the beacon equipment.\nThe beacon frame interval\
    \ can be increased up to 5–10 min in order for the device to conserve energy.\n\
    The Vity-stress system also presented increased scalability and portability over\
    \ other sensor network\nsystems, since the iBeacon protocol was the most supported\
    \ protocol over BLE, thereby giving the\nability for the system even to operate\
    \ without a concentrator device and just only a mobile phone with\nan appropriate\
    \ data logging application.\n5.2. Validation of the Viticulture Stress Index\n\
    In this scenario the VSC concentrator equipment, as illustrated in Figure 5, has\
    \ been tested.\nAt ﬁrst connectivity and data logging capability of the VSC were\
    \ validated the measurements of\nTable 3. The VSC equipment ARM microprocessor\
    \ included a 4G USB dongle along with the three\nUSB connected cameras in order\
    \ to upload the measurements and images to the Vity-stress cloud\napplication\
    \ service (AS). The VSC concentrator included the image detection logic for the\
    \ calculation\nof the VSI index (see Equation (2)). That is, at ﬁrst it ran the\
    \ SSD image segmentation algorithm\nusing a pre-trained network in order to identify\
    \ ROIs of interest (leaves areas, instances of vines—see\nEquation (1)), and then\
    \ applied on those ROIs only appropriate HSV ﬁlter masks in order to detect leaf\n\
    discoloration (yellowish contour areas indicating stressed leaves). The SSD algorithm\
    \ and its conﬁdence\nlevel thresholds were used for the detection of the vineyard\
    \ area segments per captured image.\nThe calculation of VSI index value was performed\
    \ using the Equation (2) where the nominator included\nonly the masked pixel areas’\
    \ sum of all detected contours of yellow mask ﬁltering discoloration that\noccurred\
    \ inside the SSD vineyard segments detected. Since the max power consumption of\
    \ the\nVSC concentrator during 4G data transmission and image capturing was at\
    \ 1.2–1.3 W, The VSC ARM\nmicroprocessor was programmed to power on once every\
    \ 30 min and to operate for 5 min. During those\n5 min of operation the VSC turned\
    \ on its camera modules; captured three distinct image frames and\nIoT 2020, 1\n\
    354\nexecuted the SSD and mask process for the VSI calculation; calibrated the\
    \ mean from previous snapshot\nvalues and the three cameras distinct frames using\
    \ an EWMA process; and uploaded the masked\nsnapshot images and calculated VSI\
    \ values from the AS.\nIn Figure 8, the top left three images which are indicated\
    \ as the number 1, present a non stressed\nscenario at the tested vineyard. The\
    \ top right image indicated as 2, shows an area in the same vineyard\nwhere low\
    \ water stress was detected, while the bottom right image shows the detection\
    \ of a highly\nstressed vineyard lane, as detected by our algorithm, and indicated\
    \ values of the VSI index. In this\nexperimental scenario the SSD algorithm has\
    \ been used to detect the vineyard areas (bounding boxes)\nin each image and the\
    \ associated prediction conﬁdence level. We set to distinct threshold conﬁdence\n\
    levels for the detection of vineyard segments in images: th = 0.5 and th = 0.7\
    \ accordingly.\nFigure 8. Vineyard stress contours detected at the SSD bounded\
    \ segments by the VSC concentrator:\nin minimum stress cases, low stress cases\
    \ and high stress cases.\nThese threshold values indicate that contour areas detected\
    \ as vineyards with conﬁdence level\nabove the threshold value are taken into\
    \ account in the VSI index value calculation along with their\ndetected conﬁdence\
    \ values expressed as probabilities of occurrence (pi). The VSI index-calculated\n\
    results for the cases of (1) not stressed, (2) low stressed and (3) high stressed\
    \ vineyards are presented at\nTable 5.\nTable 5. Viticulture stress index (VSI)\

    \ have shown that using the SSD algorithm with vineyard conﬁdence level ≥0.5\n\

    \ low-stressed vineyard\nVSI index limits, values ranged from 0.24 and 0.45 and\
    \ for highly stressed ones, VSI index limits\nreceived values that were greater\
    \ than 0.45.\nWhen the detection conﬁdence level for SSD was greater than 0.7\
    \ (previous accurate vineyard\narea detection), for not stressed vineyards, VSI\
    \ index values ranged between 0.01 and 0.15. For low\nstressed vineyards, VSI\
    \ index limits received values from 0.16 to 0.32 and for highly stressed vineyard\n\
    VSI index values were greater than 0.32. However, the proposed image processing\
    \ results would need\nIoT 2020, 1\n355\nfurther validation of the acquired stress\
    \ index values and yield. This additional information would\nbe provided by a\
    \ densely deployed wireless sensor network (WSN) and future VSC deployment and\n\
    planned and funded experimentation.\nLighting differences are a serious aspect\
    \ for the Vity-stress index calculation (for the senescence\ndetection). Since\
    \ part of this process includes the detection of areas of color differences, it\
    \ is highly\nsusceptible to light variations. However, if performed to a speciﬁc\
    \ vineyard ﬁeld, appropriate color\nmark range calibrations are performed with\
    \ the use of farmers’ feedback in cases of erroneous stress\nalerts. Additionally,\
    \ multiple images are taken during the day and the VSI masking process is calculated\n\
    as a mean daily average value.\nVSI CNN segmentation processes (SSD and Mask-RCNN)\
    \ for the detection of leaf areas are much\nmore controlled, since the cloud post\
    \ processing training process depends only on collected and\nannotated images\
    \ from each speciﬁc vineyard where the VSC concentrators are installed. During\
    \ this\ntraining process a series of at least 500 images needs to be collected\
    \ by the VSC devices to the\ncloud application service. Then a ﬁltering and image\
    \ annotation process are performed by hand\nfor the removal of images that are\
    \ of excessive lightning or no lighting and for the annotation\nprocess of vineyard\
    \ and lead areas. The building of the SSD and Mask-RCNN model uses the\npre-trained\
    \ mobile-net v2 models where the additional classes of vineyard and leaf areas\
    \ are added.\nFinally, the trained model for each vineyard is placed on the Vity-stress\
    \ cloud repository and it is\ndownloaded by each VSC component separately. Upon\
    \ downloading the model, the VSI calculation\nprocess is performed in real-time\
    \ by the device and the mean detection process time is also calculated.\nResults\
    \ have shown that using a 1 GHz single ARM core/512MB, the SSD process’s mean\
    \ time range\nis 3–12 s and the Mask-RCNN process’s mean time is from 6 to 18\
    \ s.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes a new framework called the Vity-stress\
    \ framework, for vine stress detection\nand the application of climate change\
    \ mitigation policies towards stress. It focuses on existing\nviticulture techniques\
    \ metrics and indexes used for vineyard monitoring and stress detection.\nTaking\
    \ one step further, we propose the Vity-stress framework, incident detection and\
    \ assessment\nmethodology for the classiﬁcation and assessment of vines’ stress.\
    \ The target of the Vity-stress\nframework is to detect and analyze stressful\
    \ conditions, such as very high temperatures due to climate\nchange, water needs,\
    \ low levels of soil moisture, low air humidity and very high solar radiation.\n\
    The Vity-stress framework is supported by a new proposed real-time system that\
    \ includes sensors\nfor the process of vine climate monitoring and therefore the\
    \ identiﬁcation, quantiﬁcation, evaluation\nand classiﬁcation of the stressful\
    \ occurring events. The proposed system provides response output to\nfarmers according\
    \ to the proposed framework.\nWe proposed the Vity-stress system proof of concept\
    \ implementation is supporting the\naforementioned proposed framework deployed\
    \ with temperature, humidity, leaf wetness, resistance\nsoil moisture, TDR soil\
    \ moisture, pyranometer and UV sensors and digital calipers. Communication\nbetween\
    \ sensors and the concentrator is one way. The concentrator is called the Vity-stress\
    \ concentrator\nand is equipped with three RGB cameras attached to infrared transmitters.\n\
    The Vity-stress image detection process ﬁlter selects and calculates the vegetated\
    \ area, and uses\ndeep learning neural networks algorithms and image masking for\
    \ the detection of the vine location,\nstress and yield. The evaluation results\
    \ of the SSD stress areas segmentation algorithm can successfully\ndetect no stressed,\
    \ low stress and high stress in the vineyard. The purpose is to replace the use\
    \ of\nexpensive multisprectal cameras. The aforementioned Vity-stress concentrator\
    \ receives iBeacon frames\nwithin a beacon interval and decodes the payload based\
    \ on the authors’ proposal Vity-stress telemetry\nprotocol. The Vity-Stress Protocol\
    \ (VSP) takes advantage of the data type of the payload bytes which\nwe use to\
    \ change depending on the sensors’ measurement and the initial conﬁguration.\n\
    Experimental results show both the applicability of Vity-stress beacons (sensors)\
    \ and VSP used\nthat cover vineyard areas and log micro-climate sensory measurements,\
    \ and pinpoint the signiﬁcance\nIoT 2020, 1\n356\nof using RGB cameras to detect\
    \ vineyard stress. The RGB image stress detection process, applied by the\nVSC\
    \ concentrator, successfully detected and classiﬁed the vineyard stress contours\
    \ in three different\ncases: (1) no stress, (2) low stress and (3) high stress.\
    \ The proposed image stress detection algorithm’s\nprocessing time was also calculated\
    \ to be less than 1 min, which signiﬁes the system’s close to\nreal-time functionality.\n\
    The Vity-stress system’s deployment of cheap beacons spread in the viticulture\
    \ ﬁelds and the\nuse of the farmers’ mobile phones in order to acquire notiﬁcations\
    \ and ﬁeld measurements that\nindicate the appearance of abiotic stress are signiﬁcant\
    \ system capabilities. Since irrigation is a key\nconcept for table grape varieties\
    \ for grapevines, the availability of sensory measurements will further\nenhance\
    \ irrigation scheduling. Taking into consideration all elements related to climate\
    \ change from\nﬁeld distributed sensory kits will also provide new irrigation\
    \ practices and precision methods for\nsustainable vineyard agriculture.\nAuthor\

  explanation: The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud infrastructure have the potential
    to revolutionize earthquake early warning systems (EEWS). IoT devices can be used
    to collect real-time data on seismic activity, and cloud infrastructure can be
    used to process and analyze this data to provide timely alerts to people and organizations
    in affected areas. However, there are also several challenges that must be addressed
    to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of these systems.

    Abstract: Earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) are crucial for saving lives\
    \ in earthquake-prone\nareas. In this study, we explore the potential of IoT and\
    \ cloud infrastructure in realizing a sustainable\nEEWS that is capable of providing\
    \ early warning to people and coordinating disaster response\nefforts. To achieve\
    \ this goal, we provide an overview of the fundamental concepts of seismic waves\n\
    and associated signal processing. We then present a detailed discussion of the\
    \ IoT-enabled EEWS,\nincluding the use of IoT networks to track the actions taken\
    \ by various EEWS organizations and the\ncloud infrastructure to gather data,\
    \ analyze it, and send alarms when necessary. Furthermore, we\npresent a taxonomy\
    \ of emerging EEWS approaches using IoT and cloud facilities, which includes\n\
    the integration of advanced technologies such as machine learning (ML) algorithms,\
    \ distributed\ncomputing, and edge computing. We also elaborate on a generic EEWS\
    \ architecture that is sustainable\nand efﬁcient and highlight the importance\
    \ of considering sustainability in the design of such systems.\nAdditionally,\
    \ we discuss the role of drones in disaster management and their potential to\
    \ enhance\nthe effectiveness of EEWS. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the\
    \ primary veriﬁcation and\nvalidation methods required for the systems under consideration.\
    \ In addition to the contributions\nmentioned above, this study also highlights\
    \ the implications of using IoT and cloud infrastructure in\nearly earthquake\
    \ detection and disaster management. Our research design involved a comprehensive\n\
    survey of the existing literature on early earthquake warning systems and the\
    \ use of IoT and cloud\ninfrastructure. We also conducted a thorough analysis\
    \ of the taxonomy of emerging EEWS approaches\nusing IoT and cloud facilities\
    \ and the veriﬁcation and validation methods required for such systems.\nOur ﬁndings\
    \ suggest that the use of IoT and cloud infrastructure in early earthquake detection\
    \ can\nsigniﬁcantly improve the speed and effectiveness of disaster response efforts,\
    \ thereby saving lives\nand reducing the economic impact of earthquakes. Finally,\
    \ we identify research gaps in this domain\nand suggest future directions toward\
    \ achieving a sustainable EEWS. Overall, this study provides\nvaluable insights\
    \ into the use of IoT and cloud infrastructure in earthquake disaster early detection\n\
    and emphasizes the importance of sustainability in designing such systems.\nSustainability\

    \ destroyed southern and central Turkey\nas well as northern and western Syria.\
    \ 37 km (23 miles) west-northwest of Gaziantep is\nwhere the epicenter was. The\
    \ earthquake near Antakya, Hatay Province, peaked with a\nMercalli rating of XII\
    \ (Extreme) as mentioned in [1]. The epicenter of the strong earthquake,\nfollowed\
    \ by the one that occurred on February 6 by nine hours, was 95 km (59 miles) to\n\
    the north-northeast of the most recent one. There was signiﬁcant destruction and\
    \ tens of\nthousands of deaths. At least 57,300 fatalities had been reported as\
    \ of 20 March 2023, with\nmore than 50,000 of those occurring in Turkey and more\
    \ than 7200 in Syria [2].\nIt was the deadliest natural disaster in the history\
    \ of Turkey and the largest natural\ndisaster to hit Turkey in modern times since\
    \ the earthquake in Antioch in 526 [3]. Aside\nfrom being the deadliest earthquake\
    \ since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake in modern-day\nSyria, it was also the worst\
    \ earthquake worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the\nsixth deadliest\
    \ of the twenty-ﬁrst century [4]. The fourth-costliest earthquakes on record,\n\
    damages in Turkey were expected to total USD 104 billion, and in Syria, USD 5.1\
    \ billion [5].\nThere are strong correlations between earthquakes, climate changes,\
    \ and mining activi-\nties [6–8]. Many scientists have predicted that the frequency\
    \ of earthquakes will keep increas-\ning [9]. Figure 1 illustrates the location\
    \ of earthquakes that occurred in the last 12 months\nwith intensity larger than\
    \ 7 Moment W-phase (Mww). In [10], the first paper on the idea of\nearthquake\
    \ early warning systems (EEWS) in 1985 was presented. These systems are networks\n\
    of ground-based sensors that alert users when the earth starts to tremble.\nFigure\
    \ 1. Major earthquakes that occurred in the last 12 months as reported in [11].\n\
    EEWS operates under the assumption that, despite the slow speed at which seismic\n\
    waves move, electronic alerts from the epicenter region may be delivered almost\
    \ instantly.\nThe process is as follows:\n1.\nSeveral types of seismic waves radiate\
    \ from an earthquake’s epicenter. Sensors are\nactivated by P-waves, which are\
    \ weaker but move more quickly. Thereafter, sensors\nsend signals to cloud servers\
    \ for processing.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n3 of 38\n2.\nAlgorithms in\
    \ the cloud server instantly determine the location, magnitude, and\nseverity\
    \ of an earthquake. How big is it? Who will suffer from this?\n3.\nThe technology\
    \ sends out an alert before slower but more destructive S-waves and\nsurface waves\
    \ arrive.\nThose who are close to the epicenter will not receive much, if any,\
    \ warning beforehand,\nwhile those who are farther away could only have a few\
    \ seconds to brace themselves. EWS\nmay help reduce some of the injuries and damage\
    \ caused by large earthquakes when used\nin conjunction with automated countermeasures\
    \ such as stopping trains or turning off\ngas lines.\nRecent years have seen a\
    \ signiﬁcant increase in the number of traditional as well as\ncontemporary technology\
    \ utilized in EEWSs [12–14]. As a consequence of this, effective\nintegration\
    \ of the numerous scientiﬁc ﬁelds is sought after in order to serve such crucial\n\
    systems. In general, actions taken to reduce risks, conduct seismic hazard assessments,\n\
    determine site speciﬁcations, and the like can be of assistance in this regard\
    \ [15–19]. De-\nveloping a reliable EEWS necessitates solving a number of issues\
    \ that are impacted by\nthe ongoing difﬁculties associated with earthquake catastrophes.\
    \ These issues include the\nobservation of earthquake characteristics, and the\
    \ environment type [20–25].\nRadio-frequency identiﬁcation, satellite systems,\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT), network\nfunctions virtualization (NFV), 5G, software-deﬁned\
    \ networks (SDN), data networks, and a\nvariety of other technologies have all\
    \ been the focus of signiﬁcant research in recent years in\nan effort to lessen\
    \ the damage that earthquakes cause [26–34]. For instance, satellite systems\n\
    have been used to track earthquake movements, and IoT sensors have been used to\
    \ detect\nearthquakes and provide early warnings. Furthermore, 5G and SDN technologies\
    \ have\nbeen deployed for real-time communication and data transmission in emergency\
    \ situations.\nThese technologies have greatly enhanced the accuracy and speed\
    \ of earthquake detection\nand warning systems and have improved the response\
    \ time of emergency services.\nMoreover, the integration of robots and the internet\
    \ has the potential to be a signiﬁcant\nbreakthrough in this ﬁeld. According to\
    \ [35], a new integrated system named “robot-\nevent” has been proposed, which\
    \ is able to execute autonomous inspections and emergency\nresponses to a severe\
    \ event. The robot uses real-time image tracking to inspect the indoor\nenvironment\
    \ and help any human victims found on the ground. It operates in structurally\n\
    sound houses with moderate damage, focusing on situations where people are at\
    \ risk from\nfalling furniture. The system was tested indoors to assess its functionality\
    \ and operation\nalongside a smart EEWS. This new technology has the potential\
    \ to signiﬁcantly reduce\nthe risk of human casualties during an earthquake by\
    \ providing timely and accurate\ninformation to emergency responders. Future research\
    \ in this area could explore further\nthe use of robotics, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ and the internet to develop more advanced and\nefﬁcient EEWSs.\nThe research\
    \ conducted in the literature regarding remote sensing applications facili-\n\
    tated by satellite communication systems did not cease with the studies by [36,37].\
    \ It also\nencompassed NFV and SDN, which involved gateways via IoT as well as\
    \ Micro-Electro-\nMechanical systems (MEMS), as noted in [38–41]. The primary\
    \ objective of this endeavor\nwas to provide relief to areas that had suffered\
    \ damage or destruction on a large scale.\nVirtualization played a critical role\
    \ in this, as it could help mitigate the risks posed by\nnatural disasters. As\
    \ highlighted in [42], such networks must be designed to optimize\nnode lifetimes.\
    \ In addition, ref. [43] presented a tragic scenario that showcased an EEWS\n\
    designed to facilitate a safe evacuation plan against disaster risks by combining\
    \ cloud-\nbased IoT with heterogeneous networks. Similarly, the combination of\
    \ IoT and current\ncommunication technologies and techniques could prove to be\
    \ crucial in ensuring the\nsmooth and secure transfer of data, as stated in [44–49].\n\
    The studies mentioned here are accompanied by conventional approaches to earth-\n\
    quake detection and analysis, as well as methods for distinguishing between different\n\
    types of fault ruptures, which have been extensively investigated in the relevant\
    \ academic\nliterature [50]. In [51], a local similarity earthquake detection\
    \ approach based on the near-\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n4 of 38\nest neighbor\
    \ method was proposed to determine whether an earthquake had occurred\nby examining\
    \ the consistency of received signals from the nearest neighbors of targeted\n\
    stations and their closest neighbors. On the other hand, refs. [52,53] focused\
    \ more on\ndetermining the earthquake’s amplitude in the ﬁrst few seconds of its\
    \ occurrence rather\nthan the complete rupture. However, conventional methods\
    \ take a signiﬁcant amount of\ntime to calculate earthquake parameters [54], highlighting\
    \ the need for additional efforts\nand studies. Early research suggests that it\
    \ is possible to accurately predict the magnitude\nand depth of an earthquake\
    \ using a graph CNN model that employs batch normalization\nand attention mechanism\
    \ techniques. This model can be used in any location with any\nseismic nodes.\
    \ The variability of seismic waves and the complexity of the Earth’s structure\n\
    suggest that there is ample room for innovative and adaptable solutions. With\
    \ the help\nof modern technologies, the impact of earthquakes on the studied region\
    \ in [54] can be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced.\nAn increasingly useful technology for\
    \ disaster management is drones. They can\nbe used to gather real-time data and\
    \ give emergency responders situational awareness,\nwhich can aid in improved\
    \ decision-making and more efﬁcient responses. Drones with\ncameras and sensors\
    \ can survey disaster regions swiftly and safely, collecting precise\nimagery\
    \ and data that can be used to assess damage, spot areas that require immediate\n\
    attention, and organize rescue and recovery efforts [55]. Drones can also be used\
    \ to transport\npeople in hazardous or hard-to-reach locations necessary goods\
    \ such as food and medical\nsupplies [56]. Drones are an important tool in emergency\
    \ management because they have\nthe potential to greatly speed up and enhance\
    \ the efﬁciency of disaster response efforts.\n5G and B5G networks offer several\
    \ advantages for emergency communication, includ-\ning faster data transmission\
    \ speeds, lower latency, and improved reliability [57–59]. These\nnetworks can\
    \ enable real-time communication between emergency responders and affected\nindividuals,\
    \ as well as the seamless transfer of data and video feeds from IoT devices, such\n\
    as sensors and drones [60–62].\nIn particular, D2D communication can play a crucial\
    \ role in emergency situations, as it\nallows devices to communicate directly\
    \ with each other without relying on a centralized\nnetwork [63,64]. This can\
    \ be especially useful in scenarios where network infrastructure\nmay be damaged\
    \ or overloaded, as D2D communication can operate on a peer-to-peer\nbasis and\
    \ bypass the need for a central network [65,66]. In an earthquake early warning\n\
    system, D2D communication could allow sensors to share data with each other and\
    \ trigger\nalerts in real-time without relying on a centralized system [67,68].\n\
    Edge computing can also be leveraged to enhance the performance of earthquake\n\
    early warning systems [69,70]. By processing data closer to the source, edge computing\
    \ can\nreduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to centralized servers\
    \ and enable\nfaster response times [71,72]. For example, in an earthquake early\
    \ warning system that\nuses drones to collect data, edge computing could be used\
    \ to process the data on the drones\nthemselves, rather than transmitting it back\
    \ to a central server for processing [73,74]. This\nwould not only reduce the\
    \ amount of data that needs to be transmitted but also enable\nfaster response\
    \ times in the event of an earthquake [75].\nCloud computing helps manage disasters.\
    \ Disaster management ﬁrms can swiftly\ndeploy vital apps and services to assist\
    \ emergency response activities using cloud platforms’\nscalability, ﬂexibility,\
    \ and accessibility. Cloud-based technologies can monitor and analyze\ndisaster\
    \ data in real time, helping emergency responders manage resources. Cloud systems\n\
    can store and handle enormous volumes of data, such as maps, satellite imaging,\
    \ and social\nmedia feeds, to help businesses better analyze disasters. Cloud-based\
    \ communication and\ncollaboration solutions can also help rescuers communicate,\
    \ coordinate, and stay linked\nduring the pandemonium. Cloud computing may make\
    \ disaster management businesses\nmore agile, responsive, and effective in saving\
    \ lives and minimizing damage. Fog and edge\ncomputing are distributed computing\
    \ methods that provide computing resources near data\nsources. Fog computing is\
    \ a dispersed computing infrastructure that processes data near\nits source. Edge\
    \ computing brings computing resources to the end-user or device. Fog and\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n5 of 38\nedge computing are important in natural disaster detection\
    \ and control. Natural disasters\ndamage communication networks, making data collection\
    \ and transmission difﬁcult. Fog\nand edge computing provide local data processing\
    \ and analysis without data centers\nor clouds. In the aftermath of a disaster,\
    \ time is of the essence because communication\ninfrastructure may be compromised\
    \ [76–79].\nFor example, sensors deployed in an area prone to ﬂooding can collect\
    \ data on water\nlevels, ﬂow rates, and other factors that can help predict and\
    \ manage the impact of a ﬂood.\nBy using edge and fog computing, this data can\
    \ be analyzed in real-time, allowing for EWS\nto be put in place and emergency\
    \ responders to be deployed more quickly [80]. Similarly,\nsensors can be used\
    \ to detect seismic activity and predict earthquakes, with data processed\nlocally\
    \ to provide early warning and minimize damage.\nOverall, fog and edge computing\
    \ play an important role in natural disaster detection\nand management by enabling\
    \ real-time data processing and analysis at the edge of the\nnetwork [81]. This\
    \ approach can help improve the speed and accuracy of disaster response,\nultimately\
    \ leading to better outcomes for affected communities.\nVeriﬁcation and validation\
    \ (V&V) techniques are crucial for ensuring the quality, relia-\nbility, and security\
    \ of software systems in the context of IoT and cloud computing [82,83].\nThese\
    \ systems involve a complex network of devices, sensors, and services that must\
    \ work\ntogether seamlessly and securely [84]. V&V techniques provide a framework\
    \ for testing and\nvalidating these systems, ensuring that they meet the speciﬁed\
    \ requirements and perform\nas intended. By implementing V&V techniques, developers\
    \ can identify and correct defects\nand errors before they cause signiﬁcant problems,\
    \ ultimately leading to higher quality and\nmore reliable IoT and cloud systems\
    \ [85].\nIn [86], the authors reviewed geospatial and remote sensing technologies\
    \ in earthquake\nresearch and disaster management, analyzing their historical\
    \ and future applications, limi-\ntations, and methodologies. It provides a framework\
    \ for earthquake hazard, vulnerability,\nand risk analysis using geospatial technologies.\
    \ In [87], the study examined remote sensing\napplications, including Landsat\
    \ satellite imaging, LiDAR, optical satellite photography,\nInSAR, and DEMETER\
    \ in earthquake research. Many other studies [88–90] explore the\nrole of IoT\
    \ in disaster management and compares IoT-based options for various calamities.\n\
    It highlights IoT EWS for ﬁres and earthquakes and advises stakeholders on leveraging\n\
    IoT technology to secure smart cities’ infrastructure and minimize risks. The\
    \ studies also\nevaluate Caribbean DRM (Disaster and Risk Management) systems,\
    \ emphasizing the need\nfor technology and new methods in monitoring disaster\
    \ risks in small island states. It\nassesses technology in the ﬁve DRM pillars\
    \ and proposes improvements for technology\nadoption in the Caribbean subregion.\
    \ The research contributes to the global discussion on\ntechnology and innovation\
    \ in DRM and addresses sustainable development concerns in\nCaribbean SIDS (Small\
    \ Islands Developing States).\nThe review paper [91] explores building damage\
    \ mapping techniques in post-earthquake\nscenarios, emphasizing machine learning\
    \ (ML) and deep learning frameworks. It addresses\nthe drawbacks of manual interpretation\
    \ of remote sensing imagery and identifies research\ngaps. The study of [92] reviews\
    \ remote sensing methods for earthquake risk assessment,\nhighlighting the importance\
    \ of vulnerability assessment and the need for a comprehensive\napproach. In [93],\
    \ satellite remote sensing technology for EEWS is suggested to achieve more\n\
    improvements for EWS. The research of [94] examines post-earthquake damage investiga-\n\
    tion using optical remote sensing data and change detection algorithms, discussing\
    \ their\nchallenges and potential. The authors in [95] analyze how emerging technologies\
    \ improve\ndisaster management processes and call for further investigation. Lastly,\
    \ the work done in [96]\npresents a procedure for managing pre- and post-earthquake\
    \ stages of structure management\nusing digital tools and emphasizes the role\

    Seismic activity is a key subject of investigation. Understanding how different\
    \ types\nof structures respond to earthquake loads and ﬁnding out how to safeguard\
    \ occupants of a\nstructure in an earthquake are both aided by this knowledge.\n\
    The study of seismicity can help us better understand the many seismic wave types\n\
    that are generated, allowing us to map both the regions that are earthquake-prone\
    \ and\nthose that are not. Studying a region’s seismic activity aids in establishing\
    \ minimum safety\nrequirements for that area, making it simpler for life to go\
    \ on after an earthquake [97,98].\nAcoustic energy, known as a seismic wave, can\
    \ move through the Earth or another\nplanetary body. It could be caused by a quake\
    \ (or an earthquake more generally), a volcanic\neruption, the movement of magma,\
    \ a big landslide, or a sizable explosion brought on by\nhuman activity, such\
    \ as mining, which releases low-frequency acoustic energy. Seismolo-\ngists are\
    \ responsible for investigating seismic waves. To record the waves, seismologists\n\
    use accelerometers, hydrophones, or seismometers that are submerged in water [99].\
    \ It\nis important to differentiate seismic waves from seismic noise, also known\
    \ as ambient\nvibration, which is characterized by a continuous low-amplitude\
    \ vibration and can be\ncaused by a wide variety of natural and artiﬁcial sources.\
    \ Arrays of sensors are typically\nused in seismic signal processing, which is\
    \ followed by signal conditioning and data fusion.\nAn ADC converter is then used\
    \ to digitize the gathered data, and a microcontroller is used\nto process it.\
    \ This is referred to as an IoT node in the context of the IoT, and it is shown\
    \ in\nFigure 2.\nFigure 2. IoT sensor node for EEWS.\nIt is possible to differentiate\
    \ between the two types of seismic waves known as body\nwaves, which move through\
    \ the inside of the planet, and surface waves, which move along\nthe surface of\
    \ the planet. Body waves ﬂow through the interior of the Earth in a manner\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n8 of 38\nthat is determined by the paths that are created by\
    \ material properties such as density and\nmodulus (stiffness). Temperature, chemical\
    \ composition, and the state of the material all\nhave an effect on the material’s\
    \ modulus and density. This phenomenon can be compared\nto the refraction of light\
    \ waves. On the basis of how particles move, body waves can be\ndivided into two\
    \ distinct categories: primary and secondary waves. Around the year 1830,\nthe\
    \ French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson identiﬁed this distinction as follows\
    \ [100]:\n•\nPrimary waves, also referred to as P-waves, are longitudinal compressional\
    \ waves that\nmove through the earth in a straight line. These waves are known\
    \ as “primary” waves\nbecause they arrive ﬁrst at seismograph stations, traveling\
    \ faster through the earth\nthan other types of waves. P-waves are pressure waves\
    \ that can travel through any\nmaterial, including ﬂuids, and move at a speed\
    \ that is around 1.7 times faster than that\nof S-waves. In contrast to S-waves,\
    \ which are transverse waves that move side-to-side,\nP-waves are compression\
    \ waves that cause particles in the material they are traveling\nthrough to move\
    \ back and forth in the direction of the wave’s propagation. They take\nthe form\
    \ of sound waves in the air and move at the same velocity as sound waves,\nwhich\
    \ is around 330 m per second on average. The ability of P-waves to travel through\n\
    any material allows them to be used to study the interior of the earth. By measuring\n\
    the time taken for P-waves to travel through the earth from an earthquake’s epicenter\n\
    to a seismograph station, scientists can calculate information about the earth’s\
    \ internal\nstructure. For example, the average speed of P-waves in granite is\
    \ roughly 5000 m per\nsecond, while in water, it is around 1450 m per second.\
    \ This information can be used\nto create a detailed model of the Earth’s interior.\n\
    •\nS-waves, also known as secondary shear waves, are transverse waves that cause\
    \ the\nground to shift in a direction perpendicular to their propagation during\
    \ an earthquake.\nThese waves arrive at seismograph stations after P-waves, which\
    \ are faster. S-waves\nhave a horizontal polarization and move in a horizontal\
    \ direction, causing the ground\nto shift from side to side. However, S-waves\
    \ can only travel through solids since\nliquids and gases do not support shear\
    \ forces. They move through any solid medium\nat a speed that is approximately\
    \ 60% slower than P-waves. The absence of S-waves in\nthe outer core of the Earth\
    \ is consistent with the presence of liquid. This is because\nS-waves cannot propagate\
    \ through liquids, and their absence indicates that the outer\ncore is predominantly\
    \ liquid. However, P-waves can propagate through liquids,\nwhich is why they can\
    \ travel through the entire Earth. The study of seismic waves\nand their behavior\
    \ has provided scientists with valuable insights into the structure\nand composition\
    \ of the Earth’s interior.\nThe path that seismic surface waves take along the\
    \ surface of the Earth [101]. These\nare an example of a type of surface wave\
    \ known as mechanical surface waves. They are\nreferred to as surface waves because\
    \ their strength decreases as they go away from the\nocean’s surface. They move\
    \ at a much slower pace compared to seismic body waves (P\nand S). The amplitude\
    \ of surface waves can reach several millimeters during particularly\npowerful\
    \ earthquakes.\nSeismographs that are situated at a greater distance from the\
    \ epicenter of an earthquake\nare unable to detect the high frequencies of the\
    \ ﬁrst P wave. In contrast, seismographs\nthat are situated closer to the epicenter\
    \ are able to record both the P and S waves that are\ngenerated when an earthquake\
    \ takes place [102].\nThe problems that are associated with seismic data are probably\
    \ unmatched by any\nothers. During the course of the past few decades, the amounts\
    \ of such data have nearly\nmultiplied exponentially [103]. In recent acquisition\
    \ studies, petabits of data are being pro-\ncessed on a daily basis. This requires\
    \ massive processing capabilities. It should, therefore,\nnot come as a surprise\
    \ that data formats have evolved signiﬁcantly over the years and\nthat they have\
    \ been altered to meet particular workﬂows or software solutions, which has\n\
    added to the complexity of managing data [104].\nIn recent years, the industry\
    \ of exploration and production has been dealing with “big\ndata” in the form\
    \ of seismic data [105]. This data is collected during seismic surveys. As\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n9 of 38\nmore and more varieties of data are gathered and reprocessed\
    \ for a variety of purposes, the\namount and volume of data continue to grow at\
    \ an alarming rate. It is necessary to locate\nand manage both ﬁeld and prestack\
    \ data because new insights can be derived from old data\nby applying updated\
    \ seismic processing methods. Because of this, it is important to keep\ntrack\
    \ of both sets of data. Several companies made the decision to store this information\
    \ on\ntapes because of the massive size of seismic data ﬁles and the prohibitively\
    \ expensive cost\nof disk space. However, tapes were difﬁcult to handle and regularly\
    \ went missing, so this\nwas not an ideal solution. Web-based viewers and administration\
    \ tools make it easier to\ndiscover and handle data from anywhere in the world.\
    \ At the same time, tiered storage\nand cloud storage offer new and more cost-effective\
    \ means of keeping enormous seismic\ndatasets [106]. Figure 3 shows the enhancements\
    \ of the utilized earthquake measurement.\nFigure 3. Earthquake measurement evolution.\n\
    Seismic wave analysis is a key component of earthquake early warning systems,\
    \ as\nit enables the detection and characterization of seismic waves in real-time\
    \ [107,108]. One\nof the most widely used signal processing techniques in seismic\
    \ wave analysis is the\nFourier transform, which is used to transform time-domain\
    \ signals into frequency-domain\nsignals [109,110]. In earthquake early warning\
    \ systems, the Fourier transform is often used\nto analyze the spectral content\
    \ of seismic waves, which can provide important information\nabout the location,\
    \ magnitude, and duration of an earthquake [111]. The Fourier transform\nis also\
    \ used to ﬁlter out noise and unwanted signals from seismic data, improving the\n\
    accuracy of earthquake detection and analysis [112].\nAnother advanced signal\
    \ processing technique used in seismic wave analysis is\nwavelet analysis, which\
    \ is used to analyze signals that are both time-varying and non-\nstationary [113–115].\
    \ In earthquake early warning systems, wavelet analysis is often used\nto detect\
    \ and analyze seismic waves that have complex frequency components, such as\n\
    those generated by slow earthquakes or volcanic activity [116,117]. By decomposing\
    \ a\nseismic waveform into its constituent frequency components, wavelet analysis\
    \ can provide\nmore detailed information on the characteristics of seismic waves,\
    \ such as their frequency\ncontent, duration, and amplitude [118,119].\nIn addition\
    \ to these advanced signal processing techniques, earthquake early warning\nsystems\
    \ also rely on a variety of speciﬁc parameters to optimize their performance [120,121].\n\
    These parameters include sampling rates, window sizes, and ﬁlter cutoff frequencies,\n\
    among others. Sampling rates determine how often seismic data is collected and\
    \ stored,\nwhile window sizes determine the length of time over which seismic\
    \ data is analyzed.\nFilter cutoff frequencies determine which frequency components\
    \ of a seismic waveform are\nanalyzed and are often used to remove noise and unwanted\
    \ signals from seismic data.\nIn conclusion, earthquake early warning systems\
    \ rely on a variety of advanced signal\nprocessing techniques and speciﬁc parameters\
    \ to detect and analyze seismic waves in\nreal time. By providing more detailed\
    \ information on these techniques and parameters,\nwe aim to enhance the technical\
    \ rigor of our paper and improve the understanding of\nthe underlying technology.\
    \ By optimizing the performance of earthquake early warning\nSustainability 2023,\
    \ 15, 11713\n10 of 38\nsystems through advanced signal processing techniques and\
    \ speciﬁc parameters, we can\nimprove the accuracy and effectiveness of these\
    \ systems, ultimately helping to save lives\nand reduce the impact of earthquakes\
    \ on communities.\n3. IoT-Cloud Systems\n3.1. IoT Systems\nThe IoT is gaining\
    \ increasing support as a viable new technology throughout the\nworld [122,123].\
    \ An IoT is a system that relies on connected embedded items or gadgets\nthat\
    \ have identiﬁers and are able to interact with one another without the assistance\n\
    of humans using a common communication protocol. It has been reported that there\n\
    are more internet-connected devices on the earth than there are humans, where\
    \ these\ndevices support the smart cities establishment [124–126]. Some smart\
    \ cities are already in\nexistence [127]. The growth of intelligent technology\
    \ is outlined on Statista’s website [128]\nunder Figure 4. As has been suggested,\
    \ an enormous increase in smart homes as well\nas commercial buildings, and important\
    \ requirements for these buildings will include\nintelligent electricity and water\
    \ management [129]. Statista projects that the number of IoT\ndevices will nearly\
    \ triple between 2020 and 2030, going from 9.7 billion in 2020 to more\nthan 29\
    \ billion in 2030. Over 5 billion consumer IoT devices are expected to exist in\
    \ China\nby 2030. Accordingly, it is the nation with the majority of these devices.\
    \ Consumer markets\nmake use of IoT devices; nevertheless, it is anticipated that\
    \ the consumer market will\naccount for more than 60 percent of all IoT-connected\
    \ devices by the year 2020 [128]. For\nthe next decade, it is anticipated that\
    \ this proportion will not change from its current value.\nϬ\nϱ\nϭϬ\nϭϱ\nϮϬ\n\

    dƌĞŶĚ\nFigure 4. Estimated growth of IoT nodes.\nAccording to [130–134], several\
    \ industry verticals now have more than 100 million\nconnected IoT devices, including\
    \ government, retail and wholesale, transportation and\nstorage, electricity,\
    \ steam, gas, air conditioning, waste management, water supply, and\nretail and\
    \ wholesale. It is predicted that by 2030, over 8,000,000 IoT nodes will be employed\n\
    in all industries [128]. In addition, cell phones can represent the best contributor\
    \ to IoT\nnodes. Interestingly, it is expected to reach nearly 17 billion by 2030,\
    \ and more than one\nbillion would be used to connected (autonomous) vehicles\
    \ [128], information technology\ninfrastructure, asset tracking and monitoring,\
    \ and smart grids [135–137].\nWhile conﬁguring an IoT system, the following steps\
    \ should be carried out in accor-\ndance with established industry standards [138–143]:\n\
    •\nProviding the node with an interface that can collect data from the environment.\n\
    •\nProviding a tool for acquiring and analyzing data in order to derive knowledge\
    \ from it.\n•\nTaking action and communicating choices and information to the\
    \ appropriate hubs.\nTo gain a comprehensive understanding of an IoT solution’s\
    \ architecture, it is neces-\nsary to examine multiple IoT systems. As shown in\
    \ Figure 5, an IoT system’s framework\ntypically consists of a sensor network\
    \ that monitors changes in the surrounding environ-\nment. Depending on the required\
    \ transmission speed and distance, the collected stream\nshould be transmitted\
    \ to a centralized or decentralized administration using, e.g., Zig-\nbee, Bluetooth,\
    \ Tmote Sky, 4G, etc. It is important to note that the sensor system needs\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 11713\n11 of 38\na continuous source of electricity, and the choice\
    \ of connectivity is inﬂuenced by power\nconsumption, with mobile service requiring\
    \ more power than WiFi, 474.67 to 576.64 mW\nand 1254.3 to 1540.6 mW, respectively\
    \ [144]. Safety considerations for both hardware and\nconnectivity are also crucial.\
    \ An IoT system’s data is reviewed or saved in the cloud system\nto identify patterns\
    \ and extrapolate information, a critical requirement for any IoT system.\nThe\
    \ data can be simpliﬁed using data visualization, and alert systems can be implemented\n\
    to provide appropriate levels of caution to users. It is essential that IoT system\
    \ design is\nnot limited to industry professionals only.\nFigure 5. A general\
    \ IoT system paradigm.\nThe IoT has the potential to revolutionize methods of\
    \ detecting and managing disasters.\nWith the help of IoT devices, we can collect\
    \ real-time data on various environmental factors\nsuch as temperature, humidity,\
    \ air pressure, and wind speed, which can help us detect\nnatural disasters such\
    \ as hurricanes, ﬂoods, and earthquakes. These devices can also\nmonitor infrastructure\
    \ such as bridges, dams, and buildings for any signs of damage or\nweakness and\
    \ alert authorities before they collapse or fail, preventing further damage and\n\
    loss of life.\nMoreover, IoT can aid disaster management by providing real-time\
    \ updates on the\naffected areas, helping authorities plan and allocate resources\
    \ effectively. Smart sensors and\ncameras can be deployed to assess the extent\
    \ of the damage in disaster-stricken areas, and\ndrones can be used to reach inaccessible\
    \ areas and gather more information. This data can\nbe analyzed using ML algorithms\
    \ to identify patterns and predict future disasters [145,146],\nimproving the\
    \ accuracy of EWS and minimizing the impact of disasters.\nAnother signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of IoT in disaster management is its ability to facilitate\ncommunication\
    \ between emergency responders and victims. Wearable devices and mobile\napps\
    \ can help victims send alerts and SOS messages, and responders can use IoT devices\n\
    to locate and rescue survivors in real time. IoT can also help in tracking the\
    \ movements of\nrescue teams and ensuring their safety.\nThe use of IoT for disaster\
    \ detection and management has the potential to save\ncountless lives and minimize\
    \ the impact of disasters. By leveraging IoT devices to collect\nreal-time data,\
    \ authorities can detect disasters early, manage resources effectively, and\n\
    respond quickly to save lives. However, it is crucial to address concerns about\
    \ data privacy\nand security to ensure the safe and ethical use of IoT in disaster\
    \ management.\nDrones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have come\
    \ a long way\nsince their inception in the early 20th century [147]. Initially\
    \ used for military purposes,\ndrones have evolved and diversiﬁed over time, and\
    \ today they have a wide range of\napplications in various ﬁelds, including photography,\
    \ agriculture, search and rescue, and\ndisaster management [148]. In addition,\
    \ it can be equipped with thermal imaging sensors\nthat can also be used to detect\
    \ the presence of survivors in collapsed buildings or other\nhard-to-reach areas\
    \ [149].\nThere are several types of drones (Figure 6), each with unique characteristics\
    \ and\ncapabilities. The most common types of drones are ﬁxed-wing, rotary-wing,\
    \ and hybrid\ndrones. Fixed-wing drones are similar to airplanes and can ﬂy for\
    \ longer distances, while\nrotary-wing drones, also known as quadcopters, are\
    \ more agile and can hover in place.\nHybrid drones combine features of both ﬁxed-wing\
    \ and rotary-wing drones, providing a\nbalance between endurance and agility.\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n12 of 38\nFigure 6. Different types of UAVs.\n\
    Drones can be involved in various types of communications (Figure 7), including\n\
    visual, auditory, and data communication. Visual communication involves transmitting\n\
    images and videos captured by the drone’s camera to a remote operator or a ground\
    \ station.\nAuditory communication can include transmitting audio messages, such\
    \ as warnings or\ninstructions, to individuals or groups on the ground via a speaker\
    \ on the drone. Data\ncommunication involves transmitting data, such as telemetry\
    \ and sensor readings, between\nthe drone and a ground station or another device.\
    \ Additionally, drones can be equipped\nwith communication technologies such as\
    \ satellite communication, Wi-Fi, and cellular\nnetworks to enable long-range\
    \ communication and control. In [150], the authors exploited\nthe UAVs to collect\
    \ data for disaster management relying on 5G (ﬁfth generation) and B5G\n(beyond\
    \ 5G) systems with their huge capacity in terms of different data types. The authors\n\
    investigated various literature solutions to some UAV issues, such as energy harvesting\n\
    and security. For example, they mentioned a sample method that used UAVs to ﬁnd\
    \ the\nmost suitable localization of the sensor nodes for optimizing Quality of\
    \ Service.\nFigure 7. Possible types of communications between UAVs and end-users.\n\
    In recent years, advances in technology have enabled the integration of new sensing\n\
    and data collection methods into EEWS systems, including the use of drones [151,152].\n\
    Drone-based sensing can provide high-resolution data on earthquake characteristics,\
    \ such\nas ground motion and deformation, which can improve the accuracy and effectiveness\n\
    of EEWS systems [153,154]. The main advantages and limitations of the use of drones\
    \ is\nsummarized in Table 2.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n13 of 38\nTable\

    \ centers and end-users [155]. In\naddition, the integration of EEWS systems with\
    \ IoT and cloud infrastructure can provide\nscalability, fault-tolerance, and\
    \ data processing capabilities [156]. IoT devices, such as\naccelerometers and\
    \ GPS sensors, can provide additional data sources for earthquake moni-\ntoring\
    \ and analysis. In contrast, cloud infrastructure can provide storage and processing\n\
    capabilities for large-scale data analysis and modeling [157]. Coordination between\
    \ these\nvarious technical aspects is essential for the successful deployment\
    \ and operation of EEWS\nsystems, and careful consideration of their capabilities,\
    \ limitations, and interdependencies\nis necessary to ensure their effectiveness\
    \ in mitigating the impact of earthquakes [158].\n3.2. Cloud and Fog Systems\n\
    Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing resources, such as servers,\n\
    storage, databases, and software, over the internet on an on-demand basis [159].\
    \ It provides\nusers with easy access to a wide range of computing resources that\
    \ can be scaled up or\ndown based on demand without requiring users to invest\
    \ in and maintain their own\nphysical infrastructure. Fog computing, on the other\
    \ hand, is a distributed computing\nmodel that brings computing resources closer\
    \ to the edge of the network, closer to where\ndata is generated and consumed,\
    \ and provides real-time processing and decision-making\ncapabilities [160].\n\
    The importance of cloud and fog computing in natural disaster detection and man-\n\
    agement cannot be overstated. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes,\
    \ ﬂoods,\nand wildﬁres can cause widespread devastation and loss of life. The\
    \ use of cloud and fog\ncomputing in disaster management can help to mitigate\
    \ the effects of these disasters by\nproviding real-time data analysis, decision-making,\
    \ and communication capabilities [161].\nCloud computing can be used to store\
    \ and process large amounts of data generated\nby sensors and other devices used\
    \ in disaster management. This data can be analyzed in\nreal-time, providing EWS\
    \ to alert authorities and the public of impending disasters. Cloud\ncomputing\
    \ can also be used to store and share critical data such as emergency response\n\
    plans, evacuation routes, and contact information for emergency services.\nFog\
    \ computing can be used to process and analyze data at the edge of the network,\n\
    near the source of the data. This can provide real-time information about the\
    \ status of\ninfrastructure such as roads, bridges, and buildings, allowing authorities\
    \ to make informed\ndecisions about evacuation and emergency response efforts.\
    \ Fog computing can also be\nused to provide real-time communication capabilities,\
    \ allowing emergency services to\ncoordinate their efforts and communicate with\
    \ each other and the public in real time.\nIn summary, cloud and fog computing\
    \ play a critical role in natural disaster detection\nand management. They provide\
    \ real-time data analysis, decision-making, and commu-\nSustainability 2023, 15,\

    \ and effectively to disasters,\npotentially saving countless lives and minimizing\
    \ the damage caused by these events.\n4. IoT-Cloud-Based EEWS\nThis section will\
    \ highlight the signiﬁcant signiﬁcance that the IoT-Cloud technology\nplays in\
    \ EEWS. In point of fact, the application of IoT-Cloud strategies has been of\
    \ assistance\nto EEWS before and after disasters.\nThe IoT has revolutionized\
    \ the way we interact with the physical world, and one of its\nmost promising\
    \ applications is in the detection and prediction of natural disasters such\n\
    as earthquakes. The basic idea behind using IoT for earthquake detection is to\
    \ deploy a\nnetwork of sensors that can detect seismic activity and transmit the\
    \ data to a central server\nfor analysis. These sensors can be embedded in buildings,\
    \ bridges, and other structures, as\nwell as in the ground itself. By analyzing\
    \ the data from these sensors, it is possible to detect\nthe onset of an earthquake\
    \ and predict its magnitude and location.\nOne of the key advantages of using\
    \ IoT for earthquake detection is that it allows for\nreal-time monitoring of\
    \ seismic activity. Traditional methods of earthquake detection rely\non seismometers,\
    \ which are expensive and require a lot of maintenance. They also typically\n\
    only provide data after an earthquake has already occurred. In contrast, IoT sensors\
    \ can\nprovide continuous data in real-time, allowing for EWS to be put in place\
    \ [162–164]. This\ncan be particularly useful in areas prone to earthquakes, where\
    \ early warning can save\nlives and reduce damage.\nAnother advantage of using\
    \ IoT for earthquake detection is that it can provide more\ndenser data network\
    \ than traditional methods. IoT sensors can be placed in a wider variety\nof locations,\
    \ such as inside buildings or underground, allowing for a more comprehensive\n\
    picture of seismic activity. They can also provide data on other factors that\
    \ can affect the\nimpact of an earthquake, such as soil conditions and building\
    \ materials. This information\ncan be used to develop better models for earthquake\
    \ prediction and to design buildings\nand infrastructure that are more resistant\
    \ to seismic activity.\nThe use of IoT for earthquake detection has the potential\
    \ to revolutionize the way\nwe prepare for and respond to earthquakes. By providing\
    \ real-time data and more com-\nprehensive information on seismic activity, IoT\
    \ sensors can improve our ability to predict\nearthquakes and minimize their impact.\
    \ As the technology continues to develop, we can\nexpect to see more widespread\
    \ deployment of IoT sensors and more sophisticated analysis\ntechniques, leading\
    \ to even better earthquake detection and prediction capabilities.\nA generic\
    \ EEWS architecture typically consists of three main components: the seismic\n\
    network, the processing center, and the alert distribution system [165]. The seismic\
    \ network\ncomprises a set of sensors deployed across a region of interest, which\
    \ detect and record\nseismic waves generated by earthquakes. The sensor data is\
    \ transmitted to the processing\ncenter, where it is analyzed in real-time using\
    \ algorithms and models to estimate the loca-\ntion, magnitude, and other characteristics\
    \ of the earthquake [166]. The alert distribution\nsystem then disseminates the\
    \ earthquake alert to end-users through various channels, such\nas mobile devices,\
    \ sirens, and public announcements [167]. The underlying infrastructure\nof the\
    \ EEWS includes a variety of hardware and software components, including seismome-\n\
    ters, communication networks, computing systems, and databases [168]. The seismometers\n\
    are typically deployed in a dense network to ensure high spatial resolution and\
    \ coverage,\nand they are connected to a communication network that transmits\
    \ the sensor data to the\nprocessing center [169]. The processing center comprises\
    \ a set of computing systems that\nperform real-time data analysis, using a variety\
    \ of algorithms and models to estimate the\nearthquake parameters [170]. The alert\
    \ distribution system includes a set of communica-\ntion channels and protocols\
    \ that disseminate the alert to end-users, as well as a database\nthat stores\
    \ historical and real-time earthquake data [171]. The interactions between these\n\
    components are tightly coordinated to ensure timely and accurate earthquake alerts,\
    \ which\ncan help to mitigate the impact of earthquakes and save lives [172].\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n15 of 38\nIn [173], the authors developed CrowdQuake,\
    \ a DL-based seismic detection system.\nUtilizing a dense IoT network composed\
    \ of MEMS nodes, the system employs a multi-\nhead convolution neural network\
    \ to analyze a large quantity of observed acceleration\ndata. During the model\
    \ validation procedure, the scientists got data from the National\nResearch Institute\
    \ for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) and measured the\nprecision-recall,\
    \ accuracy, and noise level. The developed system could process data from\nup\
    \ to 8000 IoT sensors, and identifying an earthquake required only a few seconds\
    \ of\nprocessing time, according to the researchers. In [174], an advanced EEWS\
    \ supported by an\nIoT network that operates on the basis of real-time alerts\
    \ has been established. The network\nutilized MEMS accelerometers and an Arduino\
    \ Cortex M4 CPU for measuring acceleration.\nThis technique employs ML to improve\
    \ the accuracy and latency in earthquake detection.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ using data gathered locally by the MEMS accelerometer nodes\nthat were installed.\n\
    In [175], IoT acceleration nodes were designed explicitly for earthquake detection.\n\
    Two methods are used to utilize these nodes: a technique of standalone and a technique\
    \ of\nclient-server. The ﬁrst technique is more commonly used, while the client-server\
    \ technique\nis more precise but requires high-performance servers and network\
    \ infrastructure to man-\nage data acceleration from multiple client machines.\
    \ Basic earthquake detection methods\ncan be independently explored on less capable\
    \ mobile nodes. However, this may result in\nfalse alarms. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ a cooperative method that uses a large number of\nmobile phones located in close\
    \ proximity to one another is employed. This creates a seismic\nnetwork that can\
    \ detect earthquakes and monitors any shaking caused by human activity,\nmechanical\
    \ vibrations, earthquakes, etc. By relying on a primary neural network, a motion\n\
    similar to an earthquake detected by a smartphone is transmitted to other cellphones\
    \ in\nthe immediate area using a multi-hop mode. Furthermore, every mobile phone\
    \ in the\nnetwork determines and notiﬁes the network of an earthquake, then triggers\
    \ an alarm after\nobtaining detection data from other smartphones in its immediate\
    \ vicinity. This technique\nimproves the earthquake detection capabilities of\
    \ a standalone method that does not use\nany system or network infrastructures.\n\
    In [176], a predictive model that combines IoT devices and ML techniques was used\
    \ to\ndetect geological landslide occurrences. The predictive model was trained\
    \ with geotechnical\nparameters such as soil shear strength, soil moisture, rain\
    \ intensity, terrain slope, and more.\nThe actual hardware used for this purpose\
    \ consisted of a collection of sensors that gathered\nreal-time information on\
    \ the topography and soil. In [177], the authors proposed a compute\nofﬂoading\
    \ system architecture that can be implemented on Internet-connected drones. They\n\
    conducted an in-depth experimental study to compare the efﬁciency of cloud computing\n\
    ofﬂoading strategy with that of the edge computing strategy for DL solutions in\
    \ the context\nof unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The authors investigated the\
    \ balance between the\ncomputational cost of the two alternative options communications\
    \ in an experiment.\nIn [53], a DL paradigm based on integrating autoencoder (AE)\
    \ and CNN was devel-\noped to immediately determine earthquake magnitude and position\
    \ three seconds after\nthe P-wave begins. The authors referred to it as CNN and\
    \ 3s AE (3S-AE-CNN). The\ndata set used in the study was monitored by three stations\
    \ of the Hi-net seismic network\nin Japan, and the approach was evaluated using\
    \ data from 12,200 separate occurrences\n(109.80 thousand 3 s three-component\
    \ seismic windows). The model simpliﬁes the ex-\ntraction of essential waveform\
    \ properties, resulting in a higher degree of credibility in\nearthquake parameter\
    \ assessment. The suggested model predicts magnitude, latitude,\nand longitude\
    \ with an accuracy of within 28 × 10−6, 3.3 × 10−6, and 100 × 10−6 degrees,\n\
    respectively. That model immediately communicates event features to a sink IoT\
    \ node. It\nprovides guidance to the relevant administration on how to proceed.\
    \ It is noted that AE\nhas proved beneﬁcial in feature extraction regardless of\
    \ the application [178].\nThe framework for earthquake prediction proposed in\
    \ [179] is a novel approach based\non federated learning (FL). This FL framework\
    \ outperformed the previously developed\nML model for earthquake estimation through\
    \ an IoT gateway in terms of reliability and\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n\
    16 of 38\naccuracy. The model achieved an accuracy of 88% by analyzing multidimensional\
    \ data over\na 100 km radial area, excluding the Western Himalayas, and studying\
    \ the data. In [180], an\nEEW based on an IoT and an ML model was suggested to\
    \ predict tsunamis using tsunami\ndata dating back to 2100 BC and was trained\
    \ on earthquake parameters in the dataset. It\nachieved an accuracy of 95% in\
    \ predicting earthquake location, depth, and magnitude.\nIn [181], a DL approach\
    \ that can identify P-waves despite background noise was\ndeveloped using MEMS\
    \ for observing events. The model can detect the probability of\noccurring preceding\
    \ signiﬁcant shocks and accurately predict P-waves between 1.5 and\n2.5 s before\
    \ their arrival. In [182], the authors used detector nodes to detect earthquakes\n\
    locally by probing the environment and assessing data from probes in the surrounding\n\
    area. The method stores all data locally, making it resistant to node failures\
    \ and partial\nnetwork outages, thus increasing privacy. The test network consisted\
    \ of twenty node codes\njoined with ten neighbor nodes chosen at random. The total\
    \ number of detectors was\nsampled every ten seconds. In [183], a Multilayer Perceptron-classiﬁer\
    \ was developed\nto provide a severity-based warning by predicting the possibility\
    \ of an onsite intensity\nexceeding a pre-trained PGA threshold associated with\
    \ damaging intensities on the MMI\nscale—seismic properties observed by the strong-motion\
    \ signal starting from the P-wave in\nthe developed model. The authors of [184]\
    \ proposed an independent model of earthquake\ndetection via low-cost acceleration\
    \ nodes. The model utilized four different sensor types\nfor establishing an EEWS\
    \ with different types of data, e.g., noise from buildings, vibrations,\nand earthquake\
    \ records. To test the sensors, two actual earthquakes were replicated on a\n\
    shake table. The study found that low-cost acceleration sensors can detect earthquakes\
    \ by\nmonitoring differences in acceleration induced by a range between 0.02 g\
    \ to 0.8 g, which\ncan be detected by the sensors. Therefore, the authors used\
    \ scaled data within that range.\nAn ML methodology with earthquake characteristics\
    \ was utilized, as opposed to the\nmore conventional seismic methodologies that\
    \ are typically used [185–187]. The authors\nbroke the detection problem down\
    \ into two distinct groups, namely, static settings and\ndynamic settings. They\
    \ provide the most effective ML approach and input data for the static\nenvironment\
    \ based on an experimental evaluation of numerous features for circumventing\n\
    the issue of discriminating earthquake and noise components to reduce the number\
    \ of false\nalarms. This model was validated with the help of 385 earthquakes\
    \ ranging in magnitude\nfrom 4.0 to 8.0.\nThe authors of the paper [188] introduced\
    \ the Distributed Multi-Sensor Earthquake\nEarly Warning (DMSEEW) system as a\
    \ cutting-edge ML-based technique that includes\ndata from GPS stations and earthquake\
    \ sensors in order to recognize large and medium\nearthquakes. The model relies\
    \ on an innovative stacking ensemble technique that has\nbeen validated by geoscientists\
    \ using a real-world dataset. This approach was used to\nbuild DMSEEW. The architecture\
    \ of the system was designed to be regionally spread,\nwhich allows for both brisk\
    \ processing and resistance to disruptions in some aspects of\nthe underlying\
    \ infrastructure. To be more speciﬁc, these systems combined GPS and\nseismic\
    \ data in order to enhance earthquake detection, which led to the creation of\
    \ an\nefﬁcient EEWS.\nKaracı [189] used vibration sensors for earthquake detection\
    \ according to some thresh-\nold values. If an earthquake has been detected via\
    \ the vibration sensors, a warning system\ntakes place. In this warning system,\
    \ there is a Wi-Fi module for Internet connection to send\na tweet by means of\
    \ the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform service. There is also a sound\nalarm\
    \ via a buzzer for the people staying around the earthquake area. Thus, the electronic\n\
    part of this study covers an Arduino card, Wi-Fi module, Inertial Measurement\
    \ Unit sensor,\nvibration sensor card, and buzzer. The software part involves\
    \ the codes of Processing with\nArduino to obtain the sensor data normalization\
    \ and the difference between sequential\nsensor values for monitoring the threshold\
    \ level.\nBabu and Rajan [190] have studied an IoT solution that alerts for a\
    \ ﬂood or earthquake\ndetection before they happen and living beings being searched\
    \ for during the disasters.\nSensors are connected to a microcontroller, RF transmitter,\
    \ and receiver. Their values are\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n17 of 38\nanalyzed\
    \ in real-time via ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform service [190]. The authorities\n\
    are notiﬁed by GSM messages during a ﬂood or earthquake disaster using the IP\
    \ protocol.\nA water level sensor has been used for ﬂood detection, and four color\
    \ bulbs represent the\ndanger levels. A rain sensor has worked to determine whether\
    \ there is rain. Additionally, a\nvibration sensor has been used for an earthquake.\
    \ The system and the mobile phones are\ncharged with solar energy as a secure\
    \ option for ﬂood environments. ESP Wi-Fi module\nis the gateway as the fundamental\
    \ processing and storage part between the RF receiver-\ntransmitter-bulb system\
    \ and ThingSpeak cloud server for sensor data transmission. This\ndata can be\
    \ followed using a ThingSpeak API that is used for mobile phones, laptops, or\n\
    any other internet-connected device. Wireless communication, especially GPS, is\
    \ used for\nliving being searches.\nWon et al. [191] proposed a high-ﬁdelity vibration\
    \ sensor consisting of a MEMS\naccelerometer with high sampling frequency and\
    \ digital ﬁltering. During the sensing\nprocess, Short-Term Average/Long-Term\
    \ Average trigger is compared with a threshold\nvalue. Over the threshold, data\
    \ acquisition, low-pass ﬁltering, and downsampling to\na frequency are performed.\
    \ After this procedure, if an earthquake is detected with the\nproposed algorithm,\
    \ the system notiﬁes it through a Bluetooth Beacon. The authors\nmentioned that\
    \ the hardware platform was Adafruit nRF52840 Feather Express developed\nbased\
    \ on nRF52840 (Nordic, 2019) board having fast computing and high storage attributes\n\
    provided by CPU, RAM, and ﬂash parts. Additionally, the nRF52840 module has Bluetooth\n\
    5 and Arduino IDE support.\nDuggal et al. [192] mentioned that the literature\
    \ studies could not separate any other\nvibrational noise properly from that of\
    \ earthquakes. They proposed a new method by using\nIoT to eliminate this drawback.\
    \ A Micro Electro-mechanical system sensor is set inside a\nbuilding after ﬁnding\
    \ the most suitable place via structural analysis with the information\non seismic\

    Sharma et al. [89] gave a table for ten different IoT disaster management systems\n\
    based on several properties, such as IoT architecture ownership, cloud-enabled,\

    earthquake warning part, they mentioned the usage of Vibration Sensors (Accelerometer),\n\
    PIC (Peripheral Device Controllers), ZigBee communication procedures, LCD monitors,\n\
    and RS232 cables. An IoT alarm message was sent to smartphones, and an alarm message\n\
    via GSM standard was sent to other cell phones.\nMishra et al. [193] have optimized\
    \ a schedule for distributing relief items using\nIoT technologies, such as smart\
    \ cities. There are some dynamic features dependent on\nthe disaster conditions,\
    \ such as changing relief demand and resource availability. IoT\nis suitable for\

    \ the loss of human life, the implementation of an EEWS is an\nabsolute necessity.\
    \ In order to effectively manage disasters and reduce the danger of earth-\nquakes,\
    \ it is essential to have the ability to promptly detect the features of an earthquake.\n\
    With technologies already in place, such as the IoT network, social media, global\
    \ position-\ning system (GPS), and mobile nodes, these attributes can be sent\
    \ to help mitigate the effects\nof a catastrophic earthquake.\nFigure 8 depicts\
    \ a comprehensive EEWS with many administrations assisting in reliev-\ning the\
    \ earthquake tragedy. The EEWS will include complete statistics regarding hospitals,\n\
    railways, ﬁre services, ambulances, airports, and so on based on these administrations.\n\
    This proposed system does integrate social media, IoT technologies, cloud systems,\
    \ and\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n19 of 38\nmobile systems. It operates in\
    \ two stages. The ﬁrst stage is pre-disaster, as ML models\nare used to detect\
    \ the commencement of the principal wave. This procedure is extremely\nadvantageous\
    \ for risk minimization, such as rapid shutting down of nuclear power plants,\n\
    electrical producers, and so on. The second phase begins after the disaster has\
    \ occurred,\nwith the goal of mitigating/reducing the disaster’s impacts. Using\
    \ an integrated system,\nfor example, allows for more accurate statistics regarding\
    \ the affected people, buildings,\nutilities, and areas. As a result, an effective\
    \ evacuation strategy can be implemented.\nA solution that is both ﬂexible and\
    \ intelligent and that is able to deal with complex\nproblems in a relatively\
    \ short amount of time is required for such a system. ML has the\npotential to\
    \ play a signiﬁcant and critical part in the administrations that are interconnected\n\
    and working on achieving successful EWS among the variety of existing current\
    \ techniques.\nML is a promising method that works regardless of the data type,\
    \ format, length, and other\nfactors such as these.\nFigure 8. A general architecture\
    \ of EWS.\nIndeed, real-time monitoring takes place across all of the dispersed\
    \ organizations\nshown in Figure 8, which serves as the foundation for a reliable\
    \ EEWS. As a consequence of\nthis, the transfer of data between various entities\
    \ needs to be thoroughly investigated and\nestimated. After that, ML models are\
    \ utilized to zero in on the current status of each object\nand even provide an\
    \ estimate for a certain word. As a consequence of this, those institutions\n\
    are capable of making useful contributions prior to, during, and after earthquake\
    \ disasters.\nTo put it another way, a technique such as this can assist with\
    \ the management of earthquake\ncatastrophes, the reduction of earthquake risks,\
    \ and evacuation tactics. As a consequence\nof this, the performance of the EEWS\
    \ improves in direct proportion to the quality of the\nML model. Figure 9 provides\
    \ a visual representation of the interaction between trains as\na speciﬁc administration\
    \ used in the process of full EEWS, the data processing, and the\nresearch done.\
    \ To be more precise, earthquake data is monitored to be sent for processing\n\
    using the IoT network in order to carry out the desired check and determine the\
    \ correct\ndecision to send to the railway system for suitable action using an\
    \ ML model and the\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n20 of 38\nrailway information\
    \ of the disaster location. This process is repeated until the appropriate\ndecision\
    \ is made.\nFigure 9. A pattern of Iot-based EEWS.\nThe authors of [197] mentioned\
    \ the same approach of beneﬁting from UAVs as Aerial\nBase Stations (ABSs) to\
    \ provide connectivity instead of traditional base stations. They\nproposed two\
    \ trajectory planning algorithms using a k-value selection method and K-\nmeans\
    \ centroids for UAVs. These UAVs served to the clusters of user equipment. By\n\
    enhancing the study, the authors also gave two methods for cluster head selection\
    \ to\nsupport continuous connectivity via UAVs and cluster heads.\nThe authors\
    \ of [198] suggested a system to ﬁnd the damage degrees of various earth-\nquake\
    \ region parts such as roads and riverways. They used single-rotor and six-rotor\
    \ UAVs\nand took visible light images of the region parts. Once the image quality\
    \ evaluation was\ndone according to the image contrast, the image blur, and the\
    \ image noise formulas, the\naerial images were analyzed with Gray Level Cooccurrence\
    \ Matrix, the Tamura, and the\nGabor wavelet features. Lastly, the SVM classiﬁer\
    \ was used to obtain the damage levels.\nThe authors of [199] proposed to use\
    \ UAVs for monitoring earthquake impacts after\nthe disaster occurrence. The damage\
    \ to the buildings was derived with the help of one ﬁxed-\nwing UAV and two multirotor\
    \ UAVs. The aerial mapping gathered from the UAVs was\ncompared with a physical\
    \ ﬁeld survey. The buildings’ structural properties were extracted\nfrom the damages\
    \ on different parts of the surfaces, such as walls, roofs, and perimeter\ncolumns.\
    \ Additionally, the liquefaction situation was seen from the area investigation\
    \ that\nalso presented the damage levels of the settlements.\nOverall, the use\
    \ of drones in earthquake disaster detection and management has the\npotential\
    \ to save lives, speed up response times, and improve the efﬁciency of emergency\n\
    services. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that drones will become\
    \ an even\nmore important tool in disaster management, helping to mitigate the\
    \ effects of earthquakes\nand other natural disasters. Figure 10 shows the role\
    \ of UAVs for three scenarios of pre,\nduring, and post-disaster situations.\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n21 of 38\nEvaluating the performance and reliability\
    \ of IoT-enabled earthquake early warning\nsystems (EEWS) is crucial for ensuring\
    \ their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. There\nare several techniques that\
    \ can be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the\nperformance and reliability\
    \ of these systems, including simulation testing, ﬁeld testing, and\ndata-driven\
    \ analysis:\n•\nSimulation testing involves creating a virtual environment that\
    \ simulates real-world\nconditions, including seismic activity and sensor data\
    \ [200,201]. Simulation testing\nallows researchers to test the performance of\
    \ an EEWS system under different scenar-\nios, such as different magnitudes and\
    \ distances of earthquakes and different types of\nseismic waves [202]. This technique\
    \ can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of\ndifferent algorithms and\
    \ parameters used in the system [203].\n•\nField testing involves deploying an\
    \ EEWS system in real-world conditions and col-\nlecting data on its performance\
    \ and reliability [204,205]. Field testing can provide\nvaluable insights into\
    \ the system’s performance under actual operating conditions,\nwhich may differ\
    \ from those in a simulated environment. Field testing can also help to\nidentify\
    \ potential issues with the system, such as sensor malfunction or communica-\n\
    tion failures [206]. This technique can be time-consuming and resource-intensive,\
    \ but\nit provides valuable data on the system’s performance and reliability in\
    \ real-world\nscenarios [207].\n•\nData-driven analysis involves analyzing large\
    \ datasets generated by an EEWS system\nto identify patterns and trends, which\
    \ can provide insights into its performance and\nreliability [208]. Data-driven\
    \ analysis can be used to identify correlations between\nsensor data and earthquake\
    \ characteristics, such as magnitude, duration, and inten-\nsity [209]. This technique\
    \ can also be used to identify anomalies in sensor data, which\nmay indicate issues\
    \ with the system’s performance or reliability [210]. Data-driven\nanalysis can\
    \ provide valuable insights into the performance and reliability of an EEWS\n\
    system over long periods of time [211].\nBy using a combination of these techniques,\
    \ researchers can gain a more comprehen-\nsive understanding of the performance\
    \ and reliability of IoT-enabled EEWS systems. This\ncan help to identify areas\
    \ for improvement and ultimately improve the effectiveness of\nthese systems in\
    \ mitigating the impact of earthquakes.\nIntegrating advanced technologies such\
    \ as ML algorithms, distributed computing, and\nedge computing into EEWS systems\
    \ can improve their accuracy and effectiveness. How-\never, there are several\
    \ challenges and considerations associated with these technologies. For\nexample,\
    \ ML algorithms require large amounts of data and computational resources to train\n\
    and optimize, which may be difﬁcult to obtain in the context of EEWS systems [212,213].\n\
    Distributed computing can improve the scalability and fault tolerance of EEWS\
    \ systems,\nbut it also introduces additional complexity and overhead in terms\
    \ of communication and\ncoordination [214–217]. Edge computing can improve the\
    \ responsiveness and efﬁciency\nof EEWS systems by processing data closer to the\
    \ source. Still, it also requires careful\nmanagement of resources and trade-offs\
    \ between processing power and energy consump-\ntion [218,219]. In addition, the\
    \ implementation of these advanced technologies can be\ncomplex and may require\
    \ signiﬁcant expertise and resources. Furthermore, there may be\nlimitations associated\
    \ with the hardware and software infrastructure of EEWS systems,\nsuch as sensor\
    \ networks and communication protocols, which may need to be upgraded or\nmodiﬁed\
    \ to support these technologies. Therefore, while integrating advanced technologies\n\
    into EEWS systems has the potential to improve their accuracy and effectiveness,\
    \ careful\nconsideration of the trade-offs and implementation complexities is\
    \ necessary to ensure\ntheir successful deployment and operation.\nSustainability\

    5. Validation and Veriﬁcation Aspects\nValidation and veriﬁcation (V&V) are essential\
    \ for ensuring the quality, reliability,\noptimization, and safety of systems\
    \ and products [220–222]. They involve rigorous evalu-\nation against requirements\
    \ and standards, identifying and correcting defects, improving\nperformance, and\
    \ ensuring compliance. In the context of IoT systems, V&V is crucial\nfor addressing\
    \ complex behaviors, identifying vulnerabilities, and complying with regu-\nlations\
    \ [223,224]. For cloud systems, V&V ensures dependability, security, performance\n\
    optimization, and adherence to standards [225–227]. Overall, V&V is vital for\
    \ constructing\ntrustworthy, resilient, compliant systems that meet user and societal\
    \ expectations [228].\n5.1. Different Categories of V&V Techniques\nThere are\
    \ several types of validation and veriﬁcation techniques that can be applied to\n\
    these systems [229,230] (Figure 11). One common technique is functional testing,\
    \ which\ninvolves testing the system’s functions to ensure that they perform as\
    \ expected [231]. This\ntesting can be done manually or through automated testing\
    \ tools. Another technique is\nperformance testing, which involves testing the\
    \ system’s ability to handle a certain level\nof workload or trafﬁc [232]. This\
    \ can include stress testing, load testing, and capacity\ntesting [233,234].\n\
    Security testing is another important technique for IoT and cloud systems [235–237].\n\
    This involves testing the system’s security features and protocols to identify\
    \ vulnerabilities\nand ensure that sensitive information is protected [238–240].\
    \ Penetration testing is a type\nof security testing that involves attempting\
    \ to hack into the system to identify weaknesses\nand potential security breaches\
    \ [241–243].\nUsability testing is also important for these systems, as they must\
    \ be user-friendly and\neasy to navigate [244]. This testing involves gathering\
    \ feedback from users to identify areas\nof the system that can be improved to\
    \ enhance the user experience [245].\nRegression testing is another important\
    \ technique for IoT and cloud systems [246,247].\nIt involves retesting the system\
    \ after making changes or updates to ensure that the changes\nhave not introduced\
    \ new defects or issues in previously tested areas [248]. Regression\ntesting\
    \ can be done manually or through automated testing tools, and it is important\
    \ to\nperform regularly to ensure that the system remains stable and reliable\
    \ throughout its\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n23 of 38\nlifecycle [249,250].\
    \ By conducting thorough regression testing, developers can identify and\nﬁx issues\
    \ early on, ultimately leading to a more robust and reliable system for users\
    \ [251].\n\x18ŝĨĨĞƌĞŶƚ\x03\n\x12ĂƚĞŐŽƌŝĞƐ\x03\nŽĨ\x03sΘs\x03\x03\ndĞĐŚŶŝƋƵĞƐ\n\

    \ (Figure 12) are another important set of techniques that can be used\nfor validation\
    \ and veriﬁcation of IoT and cloud systems [252,253]. Formal methods involve\n\
    the use of mathematical models and logic to verify the correctness and reliability\
    \ of a\nsystem [254]. This technique can be used to check the consistency of the\
    \ system design and\nits speciﬁcations, as well as to identify potential errors\
    \ and defects in the system [255,256].\nFormal methods can also be used to ensure\
    \ that the system meets certain performance and\nsafety requirements [257–259].\
    \ While formal methods can be more time-consuming and\ncomplex than other validation\
    \ and veriﬁcation techniques, they can provide a high level\nof conﬁdence in the\
    \ correctness and reliability of the system [260–262]. Therefore, formal\nmethods\

    \ are also validation and verification techniques\nspecific to cloud systems.\
    \ For example, validation techniques for cloud systems may\ninclude compliance\
    \ testing to ensure that the system complies with industry standards\nand regulations\
    \ and testing the system’s ability to handle real-time data processing\nand communication.\n\
    Overall, validation and veriﬁcation techniques are critical for ensuring the reliability,\n\
    security, and efﬁciency of IoT and cloud systems. By applying these techniques,\
    \ developers\ncan identify and address issues early in the development process,\
    \ ultimately leading to\nbetter-performing and more secure systems for users.\n\
    5.2. Adaptation of V&V Techniques for EEWS\nVeriﬁcation and validation (V&V) techniques\
    \ are crucial for ensuring the reliability\nand effectiveness of earthquake detection\
    \ and warning systems in the context of IoT.\nThese systems use a combination\
    \ of sensors, data analysis algorithms, and communication\ntechnologies to detect\
    \ and respond to earthquakes in real time. However, the adaptation of\nV&V techniques\
    \ for these systems presents unique challenges and opportunities.\nOne challenge\
    \ is the need for a robust and reliable sensor network. EEWS relies on a\nsensor\
    \ network to detect and measure seismic activity. These sensors must be calibrated\n\
    and tested regularly to ensure that they are functioning correctly. V&V techniques\
    \ can\nhelp to ensure that the sensor network is reliable and accurate by providing\
    \ a framework\nfor testing and calibration. More precisely, to ensure the reliability\
    \ and accuracy of the\nentire sensor network, a statistical calibration and testing\
    \ approach can be employed. This\ninvolves validating a representative sample\
    \ of sensors rather than individually testing\neach sensor, given the large number\
    \ of sensors typically used. Statistically, the majority of\nsensors will be sufﬁciently\
    \ calibrated and functioning properly at the time of an earthquake.\nAnother challenge\
    \ is the desirability of real-time data analysis and action plans. In\nearthquake\
    \ detection systems, timely and accurate decision-making is critical for minimiz-\n\
    ing damage and saving lives. V&V techniques can help to ensure that the data analysis\n\
    algorithms used in these systems are accurate and reliable. This can involve testing\
    \ the\nalgorithms under a variety of conditions and scenarios, as well as ensuring\
    \ that they are\nable to operate in real time.\nIn addition to challenges, there\
    \ are also opportunities for the adaptation of V&V\ntechniques for IoT earthquake\
    \ systems. One opportunity is the use of simulation and\nmodeling. V&V techniques\
    \ can be used to create simulations and models of earthquake\nscenarios to test\
    \ and validate the performance of the detection and warning systems. This\ncan\
    \ help to identify potential weaknesses in the system and inform improvements.\n\
    Another opportunity is the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science. V&V techniques\n\
    can be used to validate and integrate data from citizen scientists and volunteers\
    \ who\ncontribute to earthquake detection and warning systems. This can help to\
    \ improve the\naccuracy and reliability of the system while also engaging the\
    \ public in the process.\nIn conclusion, the adaptation of V&V techniques for\
    \ IoT earthquake systems presents\nboth challenges and opportunities. By leveraging\
    \ V&V techniques, developers can ensure\nthat these systems are reliable, accurate,\
    \ and effective in detecting and responding to seismic\nactivity. This can help\
    \ to minimize damage and save lives in the event of an earthquake.\n5.3. Cost\
    \ and Limitations of V&V Techniques\nVeriﬁcation and validation (V&V) techniques\
    \ are crucial in ensuring the quality and\nreliability of software systems for\
    \ IoT and cloud computing systems. However, these\nsystems come with unique challenges\
    \ and limitations that must be considered when\nimplementing V&V techniques.\n\
    One cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the sheer scale of these\n\
    systems. These systems can involve thousands or even millions of interconnected\
    \ devices,\nmaking it difﬁcult to perform comprehensive testing and validation.\
    \ Additionally, the het-\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n25 of 38\nerogeneity\
    \ of these systems, with devices from different manufacturers and with different\n\
    capabilities, can complicate the veriﬁcation and validation process.\nAnother\
    \ cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the need for specialized\n\
    testing environments and tools. These systems require highly specialized tools\
    \ and environ-\nments for testing and validation, such as simulators, emulators,\
    \ and testbeds. These tools\ncan be expensive to implement and maintain and may\
    \ require highly skilled personnel to\noperate effectively.\nFurthermore, there\
    \ are limitations to the effectiveness of V&V techniques for IoT\nand cloud systems.\
    \ One limitation is the difﬁculty of testing for security and privacy\nvulnerabilities.\
    \ These systems often involve sensitive data and critical infrastructure,\nmaking\
    \ security and privacy a top priority. However, it is challenging to test for\
    \ all possible\nsecurity and privacy vulnerabilities, especially as new threats\
    \ emerge constantly.\nAnother limitation is the challenge of testing for real-time\
    \ and low-latency require-\nments. IoT and cloud systems often require real-time\
    \ performance and low-latency commu-\nnication, which can be difﬁcult to test\
    \ and validate. These systems may involve complex\ninteractions between devices\
    \ and services, making it challenging to ensure that they meet\nthese requirements.\n\
    In conclusion, V&V techniques are crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability\
    \ of\nsoftware systems for IoT and cloud computing systems. However, these systems\
    \ have\nunique challenges and limitations that must be considered when implementing\
    \ V&V\ntechniques. By understanding these costs and limitations, software developers\
    \ can imple-\nment V&V techniques more effectively and efﬁciently, ultimately\
    \ leading to higher-quality\nsoftware systems.\n6. Open Challenges, Conclusions\
    \ and Future Directions\nThe use of IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents\
    \ signiﬁcant opportunities for\nimproving the speed and accuracy of earthquake\
    \ detection and response. However, there\nare also several challenges that must\
    \ be addressed to ensure the reliability and effectiveness\nof these systems (Figure\
    \ 13).\n•\nSensor network reliability and accuracy: One of the primary challenges\
    \ in implement-\ning IoT and cloud-based EEWS is ensuring the reliability and\
    \ accuracy of the sensor\nnetwork. These systems rely on a network of sensors\
    \ to detect and measure seismic\nactivity, making it essential to ensure that\
    \ the sensors are functioning correctly.\n•\nReal-time data processing and decision-making:\
    \ EEWS require fast and accurate\ndata processing and decision-making capabilities\
    \ to provide timely alerts to people\nand organizations in affected areas. This\
    \ requires sophisticated algorithms and real-\ntime data processing capabilities,\
    \ which can be challenging to implement in IoT and\ncloud-based systems.\n•\n\
    Secure communication channels: The transmission of data between sensors, cloud\n\
    facilities, and other components in an EEWS must be secure to prevent unauthorized\n\

    \ systems is a\nsigniﬁcant challenge, particularly in regions with limited resources.\n\
    •\nUsability and accessibility: EEWS must be usable and accessible to people and\
    \ orga-\nnizations in affected areas, including those with limited literacy or\
    \ technical skills.\nEnsuring the usability and accessibility of these systems\
    \ is a signiﬁcant challenge,\nrequiring careful consideration of user needs and\
    \ preferences.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n26 of 38\n•\nPrivacy and ethical\
    \ concerns: The collection and processing of data in EEWS raise\nprivacy and ethical\
    \ concerns, particularly as these systems become more sophisticated\nand widespread.\
    \ Ensuring that these systems comply with relevant regulations and\nethical principles\
    \ is a signiﬁcant challenge.\n•\nInterference from environmental factors: EEWS\
    \ can be affected by environmental\nfactors such as electromagnetic noise and\
    \ weather conditions, which can interfere\nwith the accuracy and reliability of\
    \ the sensor network. Ensuring the robustness and\nresilience of these systems\
    \ is a signiﬁcant challenge, requiring careful consideration of\nenvironmental\
    \ factors.\n•\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance: IoT and cloud-based EEWS\
    \ require con-\ntinuous monitoring and maintenance to ensure system performance\
    \ and reliability.\nEnsuring the continuous monitoring and maintenance of these\

    \ IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents a signiﬁcant opportunity for\nimproving\
    \ the speed and accuracy of earthquake detection and response. However, ad-\n\
    dressing the challenges outlined above is essential to ensure the reliability\
    \ and sustainability\nof these systems in the long term. This survey has highlighted\
    \ the potential beneﬁts of\nusing IoT and cloud technologies in EEWS, including\
    \ real-time data analysis, improved\nsensor networks, and faster decision-making.\
    \ However, the survey has also identiﬁed\nseveral challenges that must be addressed,\
    \ such as the need for reliable and accurate sensor\nnetworks, real-time data\
    \ processing, and secure communication channels. Overall, the\nsurvey underscores\
    \ the importance of continued research and development in this area, as\nwell\
    \ as the need for rigorous veriﬁcation and validation techniques to ensure the\
    \ reliability\nand effectiveness of these systems. Below, we propose some interesting\
    \ future directions:\n1.\nDevelopment of more efﬁcient and accurate sensors: Research\
    \ and development\nshould focus on developing more efﬁcient and accurate sensors\
    \ that can accurately\ndetect and measure seismic activity while also being cost-effective\
    \ and scalable.\n2.\nIntegration of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and ML: The integration\
    \ of AI and ML can\nhelp to improve the accuracy and reliability of data analysis\
    \ algorithms used in EEWS.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 11713\n27 of 38\nThis can\
    \ lead to faster and more accurate decision-making, improving the effectiveness\n\
    of these systems [264,265].\n3.\nStandardization of communication protocols: The\
    \ standardization of communication\nprotocols can help to ensure the interoperability\
    \ and scalability of IoT and cloud-based\nEEWS. This can simplify the integration\
    \ of different devices and services, reducing\nthe complexity of these systems.\n\
    4.\nAdoption of free, open-source software: The adoption of free, open-source\
    \ software\ncan help to reduce the cost and complexity of developing EEWS while\
    \ also encourag-\ning collaboration and innovation in this area.\n5.\nEngagement\
    \ with local communities: Engagement with local communities can help\nto ensure\
    \ that EEWS are developed in a form that meets the needs and preferences\nof people\
    \ and organizations in affected areas. This can improve the usability and\neffectiveness\
    \ of these systems in real-world scenarios.\n6.\nDevelopment of new funding models:\
    \ The development of new funding models, such\nas public–private partnerships,\
    \ can help to ensure the sustainability and scalability\nof EEWS. This can provide\
    \ the necessary resources and expertise to develop and\nmaintain these systems\
    \ over the long term.\n7.\nThe “last kilometer” problem: This problem is the difﬁculty\
    \ of assuring prompt and\nefﬁcient warning, communication, and reaction systems\
    \ to people and communities in\nthe ﬁnal seconds before the occurrence of powerful\
    \ and devastating S-wave shaking\nduring an earthquake. In particular, it requires\
    \ addressing densely populated areas\nwhere the window for preparation and evacuation\
    \ is constrained, where there is a\ngap between earthquake EEWS and the capacity\
    \ to reach and notify individuals in the\nimpacted area. In order to protect people’s\
    \ safety and well-being in the ﬁnal crucial\nseconds before the arrival of the\
    \ destructive seismic waves, this topic focuses on the\nnecessity for the effective\
    \ broadcast of alerts and emergency instructions.\nIn conclusion, continued research\
    \ and development, as well as collaboration and inno-\nvation, will be essential\
    \ in addressing the challenges and realizing the potential beneﬁts of\nusing IoT\
    \ and cloud facilities for EEWS. By addressing these challenges and implementing\n\
    future directions, it is possible to develop more reliable, accurate, and effective\
    \ EEWS that\ncan save lives and minimize damage in the event of seismic activity.\n\

    \ for good crop growth, while traditional\nfarmland irrigation techniques cannot\
    \ fully consider the impact of factors such as natural precipitation\nand crop\
    \ transpiration on crop growth, which can, to a certain extent, result in poor\
    \ irrigation\ndecisions and a complex farmland environment that cannot be monitored\
    \ promptly, thereby reducing\nfarmland production efﬁciency. This study designs\
    \ a farmland irrigation control system based on\na composite controller. Firstly,\
    \ an irrigation control method is proposed to establish a prediction\nmodel for\
    \ future rainfall and crop transpiration using historical meteorological data.\
    \ The composite\ncontroller is designed based on the prediction model to realize\
    \ an irrigation control operation with\nan irrigation value as the control quantity,\
    \ a water and fertilizer machine, and a solenoid valve as\nthe actuators. Secondly,\
    \ an intelligent irrigation control cloud platform based on Java language\nis\
    \ designed to monitor farm information and irrigation operation records in real-time\
    \ to facilitate\nvisual management. Finally, the prediction accuracy is high,\
    \ based on the prediction model results,\nwhich can provide a speciﬁc reference\
    \ basis. The superiority of the proposed controller is veriﬁed\nby simulation\
    \ using MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the proposed controller can be\
    \ well\nsuited for nonlinear control systems and has good control performance\
    \ while ensuring high tracking\naccuracy, strong robustness, and fast convergence.\n\

    \ scarcity is a global concern. As an industry that requires more water resources,\n\
    the research on water-saving irrigation technology is the most urgent. Many scholars\
    \ at\nhome and abroad have conducted extensive in-depth research on water-saving\
    \ irrigation\ntechnology, and a large number of research results have been achieved.\
    \ Regarding the\ndemand to model crop waters, some experts have developed the\
    \ management-oriented\ncropping system model MODERATO [1]. Tolomio et al. [2]\
    \ proposed a dynamic crop\nsimulation model to predict future interactions between\
    \ water and crop. An et al. [3] used\nthe Pearson correlation coefﬁcient method\
    \ to analyze the intrinsic linkage and inﬂuence\nbetween soil–crop–environment\
    \ and tomato water demand patterns. The inherent asso-\nciation and impact between\
    \ the regularity and the regression function of water and crop\nphysiological\
    \ parameters were constructed by combining the through-path analysis and\nmultiple\
    \ regression methods. Zhang et al. [4] proposed a coupled water–crop growth\n\
    (CHC) model to overcome the oversimpliﬁcation of the crop and irrigation modules\
    \ in\nthe water model. Q. Li [5] introduced a new approach named the Sparse Fractional\
    \ Levy\nQuaternion Extended Kalman Filter (SFLQEKF) for predicting stochastic\
    \ time series. It\nhas also been found that natural conditions, such as measuring\
    \ crop physiological parame-\nters, are more efﬁcient than indirect conditions,\
    \ such as measuring soil environment for\nirrigation scheduling methods, by comparing\
    \ asparagus crop studies [6]. A mathematical\nActuators 2023, 12, 81. https://doi.org/10.3390/act12020081\n\

    \ of maize crop and stage water relations under catchment recharge irrigation\
    \ condi-\ntions was developed using the BP neural network, which reﬂects the sensitivity\
    \ of water\nrequirements at each developmental stage of maize [7]. These research\
    \ methods have laid a\nsolid foundation for crop–water interrelationships. Consequently,\
    \ the ability to measure\nthe parameters involved in the individual model accurately\
    \ becomes a key factor.\nThe development of sensor technology has provided technical\
    \ support for accurate\nmeasurements [8]. Vijayakumar et al. [9] used wireless\
    \ sensor network (WSN) technology\nto collect data for accounting and analysis\
    \ to enhance the intelligence of irrigation sys-\ntems with the help of machine\
    \ learning algorithms. Jitendra Kumar et al. developed and\nevaluated a soil moisture\
    \ sensor [10]. Soulis et al. [11] determined the effect of soil mois-\nture sensor\
    \ positioning and the accuracy of soil moisture-based drip irrigation scheduling\n\
    systems under different conditions. It emphasized the selection of suitable soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors for speciﬁc crop needs. Luca Bondesan et al. [12] compared\
    \ the difference between\nirrigation scheduling and variable rate irrigation with\
    \ the inclusion of sensors and conven-\ntional uniform irrigation to demonstrate\
    \ the importance of sensors in irrigation decision\nmaking. In the context of\
    \ research on water-saving irrigation equipment, Djalilov et al. [13]\nstudied\
    \ the main factors of vibrations occurring in electric motors in irrigation facilities.\n\
    They developed a virtual tool to detect and analyze vibrations. Yang Yang et al.\
    \ [14] propose\na crop rows detection algorithm based on the autonomous extraction\
    \ of ROI (region of\ninterest), which can achieve high accuracy and the robust\
    \ extraction of ROI in various maize\nﬁelds. The proposed algorithm can provide\
    \ a new solution to the machine vision-based\nnavigation technology for agricultural\
    \ machinery. The system for driving irrigation equip-\nment using solar photovoltaics\
    \ has also been investigated and proposed [15]. An electronic\npre-wetting detector\
    \ was developed for irrigation scheduling, which can improve irrigation\naccuracy\
    \ [16]. In the study of control methods, Mahmoodabadi [17] proposed a robust fuzzy\n\
    adaptive integral sliding mode controller for nonlinear uncertain chaotic systems\
    \ based on a\nmulti-objective grey wolf optimization algorithm. In the paper,\
    \ a multi-objective gray wolf\noptimization algorithm was used to improve the\
    \ performance of the proposed controller.\nThis method can effectively obtain\
    \ the correct parameters of the proposed controller and\navoid the trial-and-error\
    \ process. J Torres et al. [18] proposed two anti-winding algorithms\nin the framework\
    \ of sliding mode control to restart the necessary action without affecting\n\
    the control action behavior. Alvaro Javier Prado et al. [19] introduced two anti-winding\n\
    control algorithms in the framework of sliding mode control to reset the integral\
    \ control\naction in the discontinuous mode promptly without inhibiting the robustness\
    \ of the whole\ncontrol system against disturbances. Zhang Yang et al. [20] proposed\
    \ a unicycle robot and\ndesigned an adaptive fuzzy controller based on its dynamics\
    \ model to achieve equilibrium\ncontrol. These studies provide effective equipment\
    \ for irrigation. The development of\nnetwork technology is essential for how\
    \ irrigation equipment can be adapted to intelligent\nirrigation systems.\nThe\
    \ rapidly developing wireless network technology has been widely used in people’s\n\
    lives and work in recent years, such as the design of ofﬁce automation systems\
    \ based on\nInternet of Things technology, the research of ﬁre information based\
    \ on computer network\ntechnology, and the research of Chinese medicine health\
    \ rehabilitation [21–23], which helps\nto solve diversiﬁed problems encountered\
    \ in different ﬁelds. Xu et al. [24] present a natural\nlanguage query and control\
    \ interface for LoT platforms that effectively parses natural\nlanguage commands\
    \ entered by users, enabling them to perform more complex operations.\nTace et\
    \ al. [25] proposed an intelligent irrigation system that integrates LoT technologies\n\
    and machine learning algorithms in intelligent irrigation systems. A system based\
    \ on deep\nlearning algorithms was developed to monitor the number and height\
    \ of moso bamboo\nshoots through image acquisition and YOLOv4 modeling [26]. An\
    \ Arduino-based irrigation\ncontrol system was proposed by conducting extensive\
    \ experimental trials to automatically\nadjust soil water content within a speciﬁc\
    \ depth range [27]. Rathod et al. [28] designed\nand developed an automatic irrigation\
    \ system for greenhouses to optimize water use.\nLing Zhu et al. [29] designed\
    \ a ZigBee-based automated irrigation system to achieve real-\nActuators 2023,\
    \ 12, 81\n3 of 18\ntime monitoring, remote monitoring, and alarm functions, providing\
    \ an intuitive on-site\nmanagement platform for irrigation users. Wireless sensor\
    \ network systems have also\nsupported irrigation research in recent years. Ndunagu\
    \ et al. [30] proposed an innovative\nirrigation system using drip irrigation\
    \ methods, which was designed and implemented\nusing wireless sensor networks\
    \ and Thingspeak.com to manage water resources effectively.\nScholars also developed\
    \ wireless sensor networks for drip irrigation systems and multi-\nintelligent\
    \ body automatic irrigation systems [31,32].\nIn summary, with the development\
    \ of technology, intelligent water-saving irrigation\nmethods and systems will\
    \ be the future trend, and research results in this area will be grad-\nually\
    \ applied. Although these controllers are effective, they have certain limitations.\
    \ Their\nmodel designs are often universal and cannot effectively combine the\

    The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model predicts future da\n\
    rainfall. The ARIMA model requires the time series to be smooth, and if a non-smoo\n\
    time series is obtained, the first step is to make a difference of order d until\
    \ the data is s\nand the number of disagreements made is the parameter d. The\
    \ expression is: \n∇\U0001D451\U0001D465\U0001D456 = ∇(∇\U0001D451−1\U0001D465\

    \ … , \U0001D461) is the predicted value and \U0001D451(0, 1, 2, … ) is the number\
    \ of diff\nences. \nThe lagged values were then fitted with p (autoregressive\
    \ term) and q (moving av\nage term) as parameters, and the present and lagged\
    \ values of the model random erro\nwere regressed to build the model [33]. The\
    \ prediction equation of the ARIMA model w\np, d, and q as parameters can be expressed\
    \ as: \n \U0001D44E\U0001D461 = \U0001D7030 + \U0001D7111\U0001D44E\U0001D461\

    \ operation, the soil moisture and other information in the\nfarmland are fed\
    \ back to the sensors and weather stations in real-time to achieve closed-loop\n\
    irrigation control. The composite controller can calculate whether the soil environment\n\
    meets the suitable conditions for crop growth and development after the actual\
    \ irrigation\noperation through the feedback data. The irrigation operation can\
    \ be stopped when the\nsoil conditions reach the appropriate growth range.\n2.3.\
    \ Rainfall Prediction Model\nThe autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)\
    \ model predicts future daily\nrainfall. The ARIMA model requires the time series\
    \ to be smooth, and if a non-smooth time\nseries is obtained, the ﬁrst step is\
    \ to make a difference of order d until the data is soft and\nthe number of disagreements\
    \ made is the parameter d. The expression is:\n∇dxi = ∇\n\x10\n∇d−1xi\n\x11\n\
    =\nd\n∑\ni=0\n(−1)iCi\ndxi−1\n(1)\nwhere xi(i = 1, 2, . . . , t) is the predicted\
    \ value and d(0, 1, 2, . . .) is the number of differences.\nThe lagged values\
    \ were then ﬁtted with p (autoregressive term) and q (moving average\nterm) as\
    \ parameters, and the present and lagged values of the model random errors were\n\
    regressed to build the model [33]. The prediction equation of the ARIMA model\
    \ with p, d,\nand q as parameters can be expressed as:\nat = θ0 + ϕ1at−1 + ϕ2at−2\
    \ + · · · + ϕpat−p + εt − θ1εt−1 − θ2εt−2 − · · · − θqεt−q\n(2)\nwhere a2 is the\

    parameters; εt is a zero-mean white noise sequence.\nThis model can use the information\
    \ criterion method to determine the parameters\nof p and q. First, the AIC criterion\
    \ (Akaike Information Criterion) is used to weigh the\ncomplexity of the estimated\
    \ model and the accuracy of the data ﬁtted by the model.\nAIC = −2 ln(L) + 2K\n\

    The method proposed in this study still has some limitations. Because there are\

    \ we only adopted soil\nmoisture, rainfall, and evapotranspiration for modeling\
    \ in this paper. Consequently, there\nare still some things that could improve\
    \ irrigation estimation. The following work will\nsufﬁciently consider more relevant\

      certain limitations. The system's reliance on universal model designs can lead
      to errors in irrigation operations, and the proposed solar photovoltaic system
      and electronic pre-wetting detector are not directly related to the core concepts
      discussed in this paper. Therefore, the overall relevance of the paper to the
      specific point in the review is considered as 0.8 out of 1.

  data_sources: Soil moisture measurements from the IoT tensiometer
  explanation: This study presents the design and laboratory validation of a low-cost
    Internet of Things (IoT) tensiometer to measure soil moisture and create a real-time
    online soil water potential curve. The tensiometer utilizes an isolated BMP180
    barometric pressure sensor and an ESP32 microcontroller, which enables the system
    to measure soil water potential up to -80 kPa and wirelessly transmit data to
    a cloud-based platform (ThingSpeak). The system also features deep sleep functionality,
    allowing for energy autonomy and extended operation with a solar panel and Li-ion
    batteries.
  extract_1: Being relatively cheap (76 USD) the prototype allows for more extensive
    measurements and, thus, for several potential applications such as soil water
    matric potential mapping, precision irrigation, and smart irrigation scheduling.
  extract_2: In terms of energy, the prototype is totally autonomous, using a 2400
    mAh Li-ion battery and a solar panel for charging, knowing that it uses deep sleep
    feature and sends three data points to the cloud each 6 h.

    \ scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, is becoming a fast-spreading threat\n\
    impacting livelihood, food security, economic development, and social stability.\
    \ Globally,\nirrigated agriculture represents 70% of freshwater consumption [1,2],\
    \ acting as both a major\ncause and a casualty of water scarcity. Thus, efforts\
    \ towards enhancing on-farm irrigation\nmanagement are crucial to face such challenges\
    \ for the ﬁnite resource.\nOne of the main obstacles that hinders such efforts\
    \ is the lack of cost effective and\nreliable data monitoring systems. Putting\
    \ into consideration the spatially variable nature of\nagricultural systems, the\
    \ availability of low-cost energy autonomous data collection means\nis crucial;\
    \ spatial features mapping being an essential step towards more precise planning\n\
    (scheduling), monitoring, and evaluation of irrigation events [3]. In fact, a\
    \ combination\nof monitoring and modelling techniques is needed to both understand\
    \ spatial variability\nimpacts and assess the accuracy of the models [4]. In this\
    \ study, a low cost IoT soil mois-\nture tensiometer is introduced and lab validated\
    \ to enable soil water potential mapping,\nvisualizing, and archiving in real\
    \ time on a cloud service platform.\n1.1. Soil Water Potential: A Key Parameter\n\
    Together with soil moisture content, soil water potential is key information to\
    \ describe\na soil’s moisture condition which has an essential importance in dictating\
    \ engineering, agro-\nnomic, geological, ecological, biological, and hydrological\
    \ characteristics of the soil mass [5].\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 263. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14020263\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 263\n2 of\
    \ 11\nIt could be deﬁned as the energy that is needed to be exerted by plant roots\
    \ to draw\nwater from the soil, or it could be viewed as the force exerted by\
    \ the soil matrix to hold the\nwater [6]. The potential energy of soil water could\
    \ be represented by Equation (1):\nψ = ψm + ψo + ψp + ψg\n(1)\nwhere ψ is the\
    \ potential energy per unit mass, volume, or weight of water and the subscripts\n\
    m, o, p, and g are the matric, osmotic, pressure, and gravitational potentials,\
    \ respectively [7].\nIrrigation scheduling based on soil water potential—obtained\
    \ usually by tensiometers—is\na profound practical solution for rational use of\
    \ water in irrigated agriculture [8]. Thomp-\nson et al. [9] deﬁne the soil water\
    \ potential threshold for a speciﬁc crop-soil system as\nthe threshold below which\
    \ cultivated plants begin to suffer as a consequence of the de-\ncrease in the\
    \ available soil water content. This eventually impacts the plants’ physiological\n\
    well-being due to water stress [10]. Thus, identifying the appropriate soil water\
    \ potential\nthreshold for different crop-soil systems is an essential step towards\
    \ more efﬁcient irrigation\nmanagement [6,9–12]\nSoil water content must be coupled\
    \ with the soil water potential readings to avoid\nover irrigation due to the\
    \ inaccuracy of tensiometers under high tensions (80–100 kPa)\nespecially in ﬁne\
    \ texture soils [5]. Other factors impacting soil water potential include soil\n\
    texture, organic and inorganic content, and soil structure [6].\nThe applications\
    \ of soil moisture tensiometers in irrigation management is well stated\nin the\
    \ literature and several studies have discussed optimization of water productivity\n\
    and irrigation scheduling based on recommended ranges of soil water potential\
    \ for vari-\nous crops [9,13–15].\n1.2. Tensiometers: Advantages and Drawbacks\
    \ of Widely Used Devices\nSoil moisture tensiometers are one of the oldest and\
    \ most widely adopted devices for\nmeasuring soil water tension, comprising a\
    \ porous cup and a vacuum gauge for measuring\nthe equivalent negative pressure\
    \ or water tension in unsaturated soils [16]. Under saturation\nconditions, the\
    \ reading on the vacuum gauge (usually a mechanical manometer) will be\nequal\
    \ to the atmospheric pressure (pointing to zero). As soil moisture decreases,\
    \ water\nis transferred from the tensiometer’s tube to the soil through the porous\
    \ cup creating a\nnegative pressure vacuum until equilibrium is reached. This\
    \ negative pressure is detected\nby the manometer and represents the current soil\
    \ water potential [17–19]. The porous cup\nwall should be permeable to water and\
    \ have an air entry value greater than one atmospheric\npressure even when it\
    \ is saturated, to allow the air to escape once the soil moisture content\nis\
    \ increasing again.\nSince they are relatively cheap, easy to use, accurate, less\
    \ prone to soil tempera-\nture and salinity, tensiometers are widely adopted for\
    \ in-situ monitoring of soil moisture\nconditions [20–22]. However, one of the\
    \ main drawbacks is water cavitation inside the\ntensiometer tube under high tensions\
    \ (80–100 kPa) which can lead to inaccurate readings.\nThus, periodical monitoring\
    \ and maintenance are required to reﬁll the tensiometer with de-\naired water\
    \ following cavitation [23–26]. Another important drawback is the small sensing\n\
    area [2] which raises the need for multiple well-placed measuring points to account\
    \ for the\nspatial variability caused by soil inhomogeneity, plant vigor, and/or\
    \ low irrigation distri-\nbution uniformities, resulting from poor irrigation\
    \ management/infrastructure. Dabach\net al. [27] studied the tensiometer’s optimal\
    \ placement in relation to the spatial variability\nof the soil hydraulic properties,\
    \ root growth patterns, and plants’ root architecture under\nburied subsurface\
    \ drip irrigation systems in sandy loam soil. The coefﬁcient of variation\n(CV)\
    \ for the tension ranged from 10% to 20% when the tensiometers were placed 10\
    \ and\n20 cm from the drippers, while it was found to be lower (CV = 0–5%) when\
    \ the tensiometers\nwere placed at distances of 0 cm and 30 cm from the drippers.\n\
    As above-mentioned, the small sensing area coupled with vulnerability to cavitation\n\
    has made regular systematic monitoring of a ﬂeet of tensiometers scattered through\
    \ the\nﬁeld a common practice, yet a tedious one. Thus, several efforts had been\
    \ dedicated to\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 263\n3 of 11\nautomate soil moisture tensiometers.\
    \ Thalheimer [19] developed a low-cost (72 euros) easy-\nto-build electronic soil\
    \ moisture tensiometer using Arduino Uno microcontroller (MCU)\nand the piezoresistive\
    \ differential pressure transducer MPX5100D (NXP simiconductors,\nEindhoven, The\
    \ Netherlands). The main objective was to reduce the costs and complexity\nof\
    \ the prototype to facilitate rebuilding by potential users, thus data retrieval\
    \ was done\nusing the memory of the MCU board and collected by a mobile pc in\
    \ situ every two weeks.\nPereira et al. [28] built on the same concept using Arduino\
    \ Mega MCU, pressure transducers,\nreal-time clock, and an SD card module. The\
    \ prototype was capable of measuring and\nrecording the tension readings as a\
    \ .txt ﬁle on the SD card coupled with a time stamp.\nIt was then used to automate\
    \ a drip irrigation system under various soil types using\ndifferent tension thresholds\
    \ according to each soil water retention curve. Sanches et al. [29]\nprogressed\
    \ the idea further by adding a DHT22 (AZDelivery—DHT2231—China) air\ntemperature\
    \ and moisture sensor to correct the ﬂuctuations in the transducer readings due\n\
    to the changes in the ambient temperature.\nAlthough these efforts improved monitoring\
    \ of soil water potential by automating peri-\nodical readings of the tensiometers\
    \ along with data collection and storage in a cost-effective\nway, none found\
    \ in the literature have considered developing an IoT-tensiometer capable\nof\
    \ uploading the results into an easily accessible cloud service for real-time\
    \ monitoring by\nfarmers, operators, or researchers.\nThe aim of this work is\
    \ to develop, and lab validate a low-cost, energy autonomous\nsoil moisture tensiometer\
    \ capable of measuring, recording, cloud storing, and visualizing\nsoil water\
    \ tension measurements in real time, on a web service platform.\n2. IoT Tensiometer:\
    \ Development of the Prototype\nThe IoT-tensiometer uses an isolated BMP180 (ZHITING,\
    \ Shenzhen, China) barometric\npressure sensor placed at the top of the tensiometer\
    \ tube just below the closing cap. The\nsensor is connected to the microcontroller\
    \ (ESP32) by four thin wires (0.55 mm in diameter)\nusing an inter-integrated\
    \ circuit interface (I2C). The logic voltage for the BMP180 is 3.3 V\nand it can\
    \ sense barometric pressure up to 110 kPa with high resolution (2 pa), making\
    \ it\nideal to sense any relative variation in the tensiometer vacuum. The brain\
    \ of the prototype\nis the ESP32-WROOM-32D MCU (Espressif Systems, Shanghai, China)\
    \ which is a low-cost\npowerful microcontroller module with an integrated WiFi\
    \ and dual-mode Bluetooth. In\nthis study, the deep sleep feature of the ESP32\
    \ was used to save energy consumption and\nguarantee the autonomous performance\
    \ of the prototype. The ESP32 wakes up every 6 h\n(i.e., time slot is 6 h) to\
    \ sense the tension in the tensiometer’s vacuum via the BMP180\nsensors, write\
    \ the data on the SD card, and send three points to the ThingSpeak cloud\nservice,\
    \ before going back into sleep mode. If the MCU does not ﬁnd any available network\n\
    for 30 s (i.e., “threshold” is 30 s), it prints the following string message as\
    \ a .txt ﬁle on the\nSD card: “NOT able to establish connection”. It then goes\
    \ back to sleep and wakes up again\nafter 6 h. The same happens if the MCU could\
    \ establish the connection but could not ﬁnd\nthe sensors, but the string message\
    \ printed as .txt ﬁle indicates in this case: “Sensor x is not\nconnected”. Figure\
    \ 1 illustrates the code algorithm written in C++ language using Arduino\nIDE\
    \ environment.\nThe prototype is powered by two Li-ion batteries, 3.7 V each and\
    \ connected in series,\nthus giving 7.4 V. The batteries are being charged by\
    \ a 1.1W solar panel through a MT3608\nDC–DC voltage regulator to stabilize the\
    \ input charging voltage coming from the panels\nto 9 V. MT3608 is a small-sized,\
    \ low-cost step-up booster converter module, built for\nconverting or boosting\
    \ voltage as low as 2 V up to 28 V DC. As the ESP32 has two I2C\nconnections,\
    \ two sensors could be connected to each MCU, thus two tensiometers could be\n\
    connected to each MCU Node. Figure 2 shows the connections scheme done with Fritzing\n\
    software. All the components were mounted on a designed and 3D-printed platform\
    \ using\npolyethylene terephthalate glycol material (PTEG). The design considered\
    \ outdoor working\nconditions by minimizing any openings or holes, and by inserting\

    \ The experiment started at soil saturation and stopped when −80 kPa\ntension\
    \ was reached, as this is the operating range of a soil moisture tensiometer.\n\
    4. Results\nThe data, downloadable as an CSV, were received periodically (at least\
    \ daily) over the\ndedicated ThingSpeak ﬁeld (Figure 5). The deep sleep feature\
    \ made the prototype fairly\nautonomous: it consumes less than one mA in sleep\
    \ mode (0.8 mA) and 50 mA in 5 s, while\nuploading the data every 6 h. The solar\
    \ panel charging current is around 100–120 mA\non sunny days. Thus, a 2400 mAh\
    \ Li-ion battery was more than sufﬁcient to supply the\nprototype on dim cloudy\
    \ days or at night during the test period (40 days from the end of\nMay to the\
    \ middle of July in south Italy).\nThe prototype was able to detect the tension\
    \ in the whole expected operating range\n(from 0 to −80 kPa). As shown in Figure\
    \ 6, the IoT tensiometer readings were almost\nidentical to the one with mechanical\
    \ gauge, under both soil depths with R2 = 0.99 in all\nfour trials proving its\
    \ overall reliability while the RMSE ranged between 0.7 to 1.1. This is\nmainly\
    \ due to the variation in level of accuracy as the sensor can measure the tension\
    \ with\nan accuracy of 2 pa while the minimum readable variation on the mechanical\
    \ manometer\ndial is 1 kPa. Although previous studies achieved similar results\
    \ using transducers where\nR2 = 0.99 [28,29], the added value of this prototype\
    \ is its capability of uploading the results\nto a web platform in an energy independent\
    \ cost-effective way.\nThe cost of the proposed prototype was relatively low (76\
    \ USD) as shown in Table 1,\nputting into consideration that the upgrade kit (the\
    \ cap and the data collection node) could\nbe attached to any matched tensiometer\
    \ tube with a suitable diameter.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 263\n8 of 11\n1 \n \n\

    \ electronic technologies have provided researchers with access to low-cost,\n\
    solid-state sensors, and programmable microcontroller-based circuits. Coupled\
    \ with 3D\nprinting potentials, prototyping for automating data collection has\
    \ become much more\nfeasible. In this study, an easy to assemble, cost effective,\
    \ energy autonomous prototype for\nan IoT tensiometer was introduced and lab validated.\
    \ The tensiometer is able to: measure\nthe soil water potential with high accuracy\
    \ (R2 = 0.99) up to −80 kPa; write the measured\npoints on an SD card as a .txt\
    \ ﬁle; and upload the data to a ThingSpeak ﬁeld as a visualized\nonline soil water\
    \ potential curve which can be accessed using any mobile device (phone,\nlaptop,\
    \ tablet, etc.).\nSuch a prototype facilitates online soil water potential mapping\
    \ in a cost-effective\nway and opens the door for more precise understanding of\
    \ soil moisture spatial variability.\nMoreover, it supports studies on allowable\
    \ water potential thresholds for various crop-soil\nsystems, an essential parameter\
    \ for better on-farm irrigation management. However, it is\nhindered by the reliability\
    \ of the internet connection in remote areas, and thus could be\nfurther enhanced\
    \ by using low-power wide-area network modulation techniques that do\nnot depend\
    \ on internet availability.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.A. and\

  explanation: "This document provides a review of the general water situation in\
    \ the world.\n\nIt further highlights that automated irrigation scheduling systems,\
    \ which have been applied primarily to intensive greenhouse production systems,\
    \ are increasing in popularity across intensive horticultural operations. These\
    \ systems utilize soil moisture measurement devices, plant water sensing techniques,\
    \ or a combination thereof. As a result, this has enabled real-time monitoring\
    \ and maintenance of optimal soil moisture, reducing water consumption and associated\
    \ costs.\n\nThis work points out that while tensiometers, gypsum blocks, and neutron\
    \ probes are widely used to measure soil moisture content, many of these techniques\
    \ exhibit limitations when applied to soilless substrates. The lack of standardized\
    \ soil moisture measurement techniques and devices for use in such applications\
    \ has further hampered the adoption of automated irrigation scheduling systems.\
    \ Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to provide a cost-effective,\
    \ user-friendly wireless sensor network (WSN) system capable of providing quality\
    \ data for minimal cost across various production systems.\n\nTo achieve this\
    \ goal, several scientific, engineering, and socio-economic objectives have been\
    \ established. From a scientific and engineering perspective, the team aims to:\
    \ \n\n1.  Further develop and adapt commercially-available WSN hardware and software\
    \ to meet the monitoring and control requirements for field (soil-based), container\
    \ (soilless), and environmental (green roof) systems.\n2. Determine the performance\
    \ and utility of soil moisture and electrical conductivity sensors for precision\
    \ irrigation and nutrient management.\n3. Determine spatial and temporal variability\
    \ of sensors to minimize the number of sensors required and optimize system cost.\n\
    4. Integrate various environmental sensors into WSNs to enable real-time modeling\
    \ of microclimatic plant ET.\n5. Integrate soil and environmental data into species-specific\
    \ models to better predict plant and system water use.\n6. Develop best management\
    \ practices for the use of sensors, working with commercial growers to capture\
    \ needs-based issues during on-farm system development.\n7. Quantify improvements\
    \ in water and nutrient management and runoff, plant quality, and yield.\n8. Evaluate\
    \ the private and public economic and environmental impacts of precision sensor-controlled\
    \ practices.\n9. Identify barriers to adoption and implementation of these practices.\n\
    10. Engage growers and the industry on the operation, benefits, and current limitations\
    \ of this sensor / modeling approach to irrigation scheduling and management.\n\
    \nThe successful execution of the above scientific and engineering objectives\
    \ will allow for the development of a scalable, adaptable, and reconfigurable\
    \ WSN system which should provide the following benefits: \n\na. Safety\nb. Cost\
    \ savings\nc. Improved irrigation scheduling\nd. Reduced water runoff and nutrient\
    \ leachinge. Disease and pest reductionsf.  Improved crop healthg. Increased crop\
    \ yieldsh. Improved production efficiencyi. Reduced environmental impact\n\nIn\
    \ conclusion, this paper highlighted the urgent need for the development of precision\
    \ irrigation scheduling systems, which is critical for sustainable water management\
    \ in the agricultural sector. The research team behind this work has outlined\
    \ several innovative objectives and strategies which have the potential to overcome\
    \ many of the challenges currently faced by the agricultural industry, particularly\
    \ in intensive horticultural operations."

    \ \nUniversity of Maryland, College Park  \nUSA \n1. Introduction  \nWorldwide,\
    \ irrigation uses about 69% of available freshwater resources (Fry, 2005). In\
    \ the \nUnited States, 82% of freshwater resources are used for irrigation purposes.\
    \ Major concerns \non future planetary freshwater resources are the effects of\
    \ climate change on changing sea \ntemperature and levels, annual snowpack, drought\
    \ and flood events, as well as changes in \nwater quality, and general ecosystem\
    \ vulnerabilities (US Global Change Research Program, \n2011). Changes in the\
    \ extreme climatic events are more likely to occur at the regional level \nthan\
    \ show in national or global statistics. The unpredictability of climatic events\
    \ is of key \nconcern to farmers in all countries, since the availability and\
    \ cost of irrigation water is likely \nto be compounded by increased regulations\
    \ and competition. Over the past 50 years, the \nurban demand for freshwater in\
    \ the United States has also been increasing (Hutson et al. \n2004), while the\
    \ quality of both surface and groundwater has been decreasing due to \npollution\
    \ from both point and nonpoint sources (Secchi et al. 2007). Nitrogen, phosphorus\
    \ \nand many other inorganic and organic pollutants such as pesticides and herbicides\
    \ are being \nfound at increasing concentrations in groundwater under agricultural\
    \ areas (Guimerà, \n1998). As demands on water and the cost of purification increase,\
    \ the cost of freshwater \nresources will increase and the availability will likely\
    \ decrease for agriculture. Population \ngrowth in the 20th century increased\
    \ by a factor of three while water withdrawals increased \nby a factor of seven\
    \ during the same time, with little hope of these rates slowing in the near \n\
    future (Agarwal et al. 2000). \nIn view of increased competition for resources\
    \ and the need for increased agricultural \nproduction to ensure national and\
    \ global food security, it is clear that we need to increase \nour efficiency\
    \ of irrigation water use, to adapt to these changing conditions. Not only do\
    \ we \nneed to increase the overall efficiency of irrigation water use to optimize\
    \ crop yields, but \nthere is also a need to provide farmers with better information\
    \ on root zone water \navailability and daily crop water use, especially at critical\
    \ times during flowering, fruit set \nand fruit or seed development. Although\
    \ crop yield is oftentimes related to water use, most \ngrowers don’t know the\
    \ water requirement of the crop they grow at any real level of \nprecision. Since\
    \ irrigation costs in developed countries are usually a small fraction of total\
    \ \nproduction costs, there are few incentives for growers to optimize their use\
    \ of irrigation \nwater. Therefore, the amount of water applied is mostly based\
    \ on the availability, rather \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives\
    \ and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n \n234 \nthan actual crop\
    \ water needs (Balendock et al., 2009). The development of precision (low \nvolume)\
    \ irrigation systems  has played a major role in reducing the water required to\
    \ \nmaintain yields for high-value crops, but this has also highlighted the need\
    \ for new methods \nfor accurate irrigation scheduling and control (Jones, 2008).\
    \ For high-value horticultural \ncrops, there is also significant interest in\
    \ using precision irrigation as a tool to increase \nharvest quality through regulated\
    \ deficit irrigation, and to reduce nutrient loss and fungal \ndisease pressures.\
    \ In the near future, farmers will likely have to make decisions on how to \n\
    optimize water use with crop yield, in order to remain competitive. Achievement\
    \ of any \noptimal irrigation capability will depend not only on the use of precision\
    \ irrigation systems, \nbut also on the tools that can help the farmer monitor\
    \ and automate irrigation scheduling, \napplying water precisely to satisfy crop\
    \ water requirements. \n1.1 Scope of the chapter \nThe intent of this chapter\
    \ is not to provide the reader with an exhaustive review of the \nsensor network\
    \ development literature. A simple online search of the keywords “wireless, \n\
    sensor, network, irrigation” provides links to over 1500 journal articles just\
    \ within the \nengineering and biological fields. However, two recent articles\
    \ do provide excellent current \nreviews (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009) and practical\
    \ advice (Barrenetxea et al., 2008) for readers \nwanting more explicit engineering\
    \ and technical advice on the development and \ndeployment of wireless sensor\
    \ networks for irrigation, environmental and other (animal and \nfood safety)\
    \ applications. It is apparent from these and many other articles that the \n\
    development of operational wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for large-scale outdoor\
    \ \ndeployment has many challenges; an excellent discussion of many of the pitfalls\
    \ is given by \nBarrenetxea et al., (2008). For many of the reasons they and others\
    \ have outlined, most \nresearch in the field of sensor networks for irrigation\
    \ scheduling has focused on the \ntechnical challenge of gathering reliable data\
    \ from wide area networks. Barrenetxea et al. \n(2008) note that there are two\
    \ primary components for successful WSN deployments: \n(1) gathering the data\
    \ and (2) exploiting the data. Generally, the engineering component of \nany WSN\
    \ project is tasked with providing hardware that reliably accomplishes the first\
    \ task. \nHowever, understanding the biological and/or environmental domain is\
    \ vital to maximize \nthe trustworthiness of sensor data. Interdisciplinary projects\
    \ and partnerships are more \nlikely to have a greater chance of success, since\
    \ the primary objective of all WSN’s is to \ngather data for a specific use, and\
    \ all partners are focused on that task. However, if we are \ngoing to successfully\
    \ commercialize and deploy sensor networks on farms, the end-user \nmust be involved\
    \ during all stages of the project: from node deployment, to sensor \nplacement\
    \ and calibration, through to data analysis and interpretation (Tolle et al, 2005;\
    \  \nLea-Cox et al., 2010a). It is this part of the process that has often received\
    \ scant attention \nfrom researchers and developers; the successful integration\
    \ of sensor networks and decision \nsupport systems (software tools) is probably\
    \ one of the greatest barriers to successful \nimplementation and adoption of\
    \ these systems by farmers. For this reason, any tools that are \ndeveloped should\
    \ be thoroughly vetted by the end-user for ease-of-use, interpretation and \n\
    applicability. Perhaps most importantly, we should learn from past mistakes where\
    \ various \nwater-saving technologies have often not achieved any real economic\
    \ benefit for the grower, \nin terms of water savings, improved yield, labor cost\
    \ or other use. Sometimes technology \nmerely adds another “management layer”\
    \ that requires additional expertise to interpret and \nwww.intechopen.com\n \n\
    Using Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n235 \n\
    use the information, in order to make a decision. We therefore need to bear these\
    \ \nconsiderations in mind when we develop any irrigation scheduling system that\
    \ aims to \nimprove upon current irrigation management techniques. \nThis chapter\
    \ will firstly summarize the pros and cons of certain sensors and techniques that\
    \ \nprovide promise for use in WSNs for precision irrigation. It will review WSN\
    \ deployment \nand progress, but focus primarily on intensive nursery and greenhouse\
    \ production, since \nthese environments provide some extreme challenges with\
    \ spatial and temporal sensor \nmeasurement, to accurately predict plant water\
    \ use. We recognize that there are many \naspects of plant physiology that provide\
    \ both feedback and feedforward mechanisms in \nregulating plant water use, and\
    \ these may radically change in a crop, pre- and post-anthesis. \nThis chapter\
    \ is not focused on these challenges; it will however attempt to illustrate the\
    \ \npotential of sensor networks to provide real-time information to both farmers\
    \ and \nresearchers — often at a level of precision that provides keen insights\
    \ into these processes. \nOur research and development team (Lea-Cox et al, 2010b)\
    \ is actively working on deploying \nand integrating WSNs on farms, but concurrently\
    \ developing the advanced hardware and \nsoftware tools that we need for precision\
    \ irrigation scheduling in intensive horticultural \noperations. We will illustrate\
    \ some of our progress with these WSN’s in container-\nproduction and greenhouse\
    \ environments, as well as in field (soil-based) tree farms which \nhave soil\
    \ water dynamics more akin to field orchard environments. Finally, we will discuss\
    \ \nchallenges and opportunities that need to be addressed  to enable the widespread\
    \ adoption \nof WSN’s for precision irrigation scheduling. \n1.2 Intensive production\
    \ system irrigation scheduling  \nThe most widespread use of automated irrigation\
    \ scheduling systems are in intensive \nhorticultural, and especially in greenhouse\
    \ or protected environments (Jones, 2008). \nCurrently, many greenhouse and nursery\
    \ growers base their irrigation scheduling \ndecisions on intuition or experience\
    \ (Bacci et al., 2008; Jones, 2008; Lea-Cox et al., 2009). \nOftentimes the most\
    \ basic decision is —“do I need to irrigate today?” While this question \ncould\
    \ seem trivial, plant water requirements vary by species, season and microclimate,\
    \ \nand depend upon any number of environmental and plant developmental factors\
    \ that \nneed to be integrated on a day-to-day basis. Add to these factors the\
    \ number of species \ngrown in a ‘typical’ nursery or greenhouse operation (oftentimes\
    \ >250 species; Majsztrik, \n2011), the variety of container sizes (i.e. rooting\
    \ volume, water-holding capacity) and the \nlength of crop cycles (a few weeks\
    \ to several years), it quickly becomes obvious why \nprecision irrigation scheduling\
    \ in these types of operations is extremely difficult (Lea-Cox \net al., 2001;\
    \ Ross et al, 2001). If done well, daily irrigation decisions take a lot of time\
    \ and \nan irrigation manager often faces complex decisions about scheduling,\
    \ which requires \nintegrating knowledge from many sources. Although these intuitive\
    \ methods for \nirrigation scheduling can give good results with experience, they\
    \ tend to be very \nsubjective with different operators making very different\
    \ decisions. Many times, even \nexperienced managers make an incorrect decision,\
    \ i.e., they irrigate when water is not \nrequired by the plant. It is also surprising\
    \ how many “advanced” irrigation scheduling \nsystems automate irrigation cycles\
    \ only on the basis of time, without any feedback-based \nsensor systems. Thus,\
    \ even with advanced time-based systems, the decision to irrigate is \nagain based\
    \ solely on the operator’s judgment and the time taken to evaluate crop water\
    \ \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural\
    \ Water Management \n \n236 \nuse and integrate other information, e.g. weather\
    \ conditions during the past few days and \nimmediate future. \nThere are many\
    \ sensor technologies that have been used over the years to aid this \ndecision\
    \ process. Various soil moisture measurement devices are available, e.g. \ntensiometers,\
    \ gypsum blocks and meters that directly sense soil moisture; additionally \n\
    pan evaporation, weather station or satellite forecast data can be incorporated\
    \ into \nevapotranspiration (ET) models. However, the widespread adoption of most\
    \ of this \ntechnology has not occurred in the nursery and greenhouse industries,\
    \ for good reasons. \nMany \nsensing \ntechnologies \nwhich \nwere \noriginally\
    \ \nengineered \nfor \nsoil-based \nmeasurements have been applied to soilless\
    \ substrates. Many have failed, largely because \nthese sensors did not perform\
    \ well in highly porous substrates, since porosity is an \nimportant physical\
    \ property that is necessary for good root growth in containers (Bunt, \n1961).\
    \ Even when a technology has been adapted successfully to container culture (e.g.\
    \ \nlow-tension tensiometers), often the technology has been too expensive for\
    \ wide-scale \nadoption, difficult to incorporate into WSNs, or there have been\
    \ precision or maintenance \nissues. Cost and ease of use are key aspects to the\
    \ adoption and use of any tool by \ngrowers, who are often time-limited. \n1.3\
    \ Wireless sensor network development objectives \nIt was imperative to establish\
    \ a list of global objectives for the development of WSN tools \nand strategies\
    \ for our project (Lea-Cox et al, 2010b). Jones (2008) documented the features\
    \ of \nan ‘ideal’ irrigation scheduling system for intensive horticultural production\
    \ systems. He \nnoted that any system should be (1) sensitive to small changes,\
    \ whether in terms of soil \nmoisture content, evaporative demand, or plant response;\
    \ (2) respond rapidly to these \nchanges, allowing for continual monitoring and\
    \ maintenance of optimal water status and \nresponding in “real time” to changing\
    \ weather conditions; (3) readily adaptable to different \ncrops, growth stages\
    \ or different horticultural environments without the need for extensive \nrecalibration;\
    \ (4) robust and reliable; (5) user-friendly, requiring little user training;\
    \ (6) \ncapable of automation, thus reducing labor requirements, and (7) low cost,\
    \ both in terms of \npurchase and running costs.  \nIn addition to these universal\
    \ requirements, Lea-Cox et al. (2008) proposed a number of \nmore specific WSN\
    \ requirements, where (1) users should be able to rapidly deploy sensors \nin\
    \ any production area, to maximize utility and minimize cost; (2) sensor networks\
    \ should \nbe scalable, thereby allowing an operation to begin with a small, low-cost\
    \ system and \nexpand/improve the network over time; (3) nodes (motes) should\
    \ have low power (battery) \nrequirements, preferably with rechargeable power\
    \ options; (4) sensor data should be \nreliably transmitted using wireless connections\
    \ to the base station computer (or internet) \nwith little or no interference\
    \ over at least 1000m; (5) the software interface should \nautomatically log and\
    \ display real-time data from the sensor nodes, in a form that provides \nthe\
    \ user with an easily interpreted summary of that data, preferably as a customizable\
    \ \ngraphical output (6) any software control functions should include relatively\
    \ sophisticated \ndecision tools and discretionary options, to allow for maximum\
    \ flexibility in scheduling / \nactuating irrigation solenoids or other control\
    \ devices.  \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling \n \n237 \nThese engineering objectives are the foundation\
    \ for our specific scientific, engineering and \nsocio-economic objectives (Lea-Cox,\
    \ 2010b), to: (1) further develop and adapt commercially-\navailable wireless\
    \ sensor network hardware and software, to meet the monitoring and \ncontrol \n\
    requirements \nfor \nfield \n(soil-based), \ncontainer \n(soilless) \nproduction\

    \ utility of soil \nmoisture and electrical conductivity sensors for precision\
    \ irrigation and nutrient \nmanagement; (3) determine spatial and temporal variability\
    \ of sensors, to minimize the \nnumbers of sensors required for different environments\
    \ at various scales; (4) integrate \nvarious environmental sensors into WSNs to\
    \ enable real-time modeling of microclimatic \nplant ET; (5) integrate soil and\

    \ \nsystem development; (7) quantify improvements in water and nutrient management\
    \ and \nrunoff, plant quality, and yield; (8) evaluate the private and public\
    \ economic and \nenvironmental impacts of precision sensor-controlled practices;\
    \ (9) identify barriers to \nadoption and implementation of these practices; and\
    \ (10) engage growers and the industry \non the operation, benefits and current\
    \ limitations of this sensor / modeling approach to \nirrigation scheduling and\
    \ management. \n2. Irrigation sensing approaches \nThe main approaches to irrigation\
    \ scheduling in soils and the techniques available have \nbeen the subject of\
    \ many reviews over the years. Specific reviews have concentrated on \nmeasuring\
    \ soil moisture (e.g. Dane & Topp, 2002; Bitelli, 2011), physiological measurements\
    \ \n(e.g. Jones, 2004; Cifre et al., 2005) or water balance calculations (e.g.\
    \ Allen et al., 1998). The \nconventional sensor-based approach has typically\
    \ scheduled irrigation events on the basis of \nsoil moisture status, whether\
    \ using direct soil moisture measurements with capacitance or \nTDR-type sensors\
    \ (Topp, 1985; Smith & Mullins, 2001), tensiometers (Smajstrla & Harrison, \n\
    1998) or soil-moisture water balance methods using daily ET estimates (Allen et\
    \ al., 1998). \nSome automated greenhouse systems have used load cells for the\
    \ estimation of daily plant \nwater use (Raviv et al., 2000). However, these load\
    \ cell systems have to be programmed to \naccurately correct for increasing total\
    \ plant mass over the crop cycle, or to adjust to changes \nin wind and temperature\
    \ changes, if deployed in outdoor environments. Nevertheless, if \noperated correctly,\
    \ most of these systems enable much greater precision and improved \nwater use\
    \ efficiency over traditional time-based irrigation scheduling methods. \nJones\
    \ (2004) summarized the main sensor techniques that are currently used for irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling or which have the potential for development in the near future\
    \ in some detail \n(Table 1). The current debate centers around using soil moisture\
    \ sensing techniques, plant \nwater sensing techniques or a combination of both\
    \ techniques. Soil irrigation sensing \napproaches (Table 1) can either be based\
    \ on direct measurement of soil moisture content (or \nwater potential), or by\
    \ using sensors to provide data for the water balance method, which \naccounts\
    \ for inputs (rainfall, irrigation) and losses (ET, run-off and drainage) from\
    \ the \nsystem. The emphasis on using soil moisture content for irrigation decisions\
    \ has been based \non the perception that water availability in the soil is what\
    \ limits plant transpiration, and \nthat irrigation scheduling should replace\
    \ the water lost by plant water uptake and \nevaporation from the rootzone (Jones,\
    \ 2008). \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural\

    \ 2004). Reproduced with kind permission \nof the author and Oxford University\
    \ Press.  \n2.1 Measuring soil moisture \n2.1.1 Water potential or volumetric\
    \ water content? \nSoil (substrate) water content can be expressed either in terms\
    \ of the energy status of the \nwater in the soil (i.e. matric potential, kPa)\
    \ or as the amount of water in the substrate (most \ncommonly expressed on a volumetric\
    \ basis; % or m3 • m-3). Both methods have advantages \nand disadvantages. Soil/substrate\
    \ matric potential indicates how easily water is available to \nplants (Lea-Cox\
    \ et al, 2011), but it does not provide information on how much total water is\
    \ \npresent in the substrate. Conversely, volumetric water content indicates how\
    \ much water is \npresent in a substrate, but not if this water is extractable\
    \ by plant roots. This is especially \nimportant for soilless substrates, since\
    \ mixtures of different components means that \nsubstrates have very different\
    \ water-holding capacities and moisture release curves \n(deBoodt and Verdonck,\
    \ 1972). Sensors that estimate water content (e.g. capacitance and \nTDR-type\
    \ sensors) tend to be more reliable than those sensors measuring water availability\
    \ \n(tensiometers and psychrometers); (Jones, 2008; Murray et al, 2004). A major\
    \ disadvantage \nof almost all soil sensors, however, is their limited capability\
    \ to measure soil moisture \nheterogeneity in the root zone, since they typically\
    \ only sense a small volume around the \nsensor. Variation in soil water availability\
    \ is well known, primarily as a function of variation \nin soil type, soil compaction\
    \ and depth, among many sources of variation (e.g. organic \nmatter content, porosity\
    \ and rockiness). The use of large sensor arrays which may be \nnecessary to get\
    \ good representative readings of soil moisture tends to be limited by cost, \n\
    but this could be overcome by sensor placement strategies.  \nwww.intechopen.com\n\
    \ \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n\
    \ \n240 \nSoilless substrates are used by the nursery and greenhouse industry\
    \ for a multitude of \nreasons, primarily to reduce the incidence of soil-borne\
    \ pathogens, increase root growth, \nand reduce labor, shipping and overall costs\
    \ to the producer (Majsztrik et al., 2011). Over \nthe years, many studies have\
    \ shown large differences between soil and soilless substrates in \nthe availability\
    \ of water to root systems (Bunt, 1961; deBoodt and Verdonck, 1972). Soilless\
    \ \nsubstrates, which in most cases have larger particle sizes and porosity, tend\
    \ to release more \nwater at very low matric potentials (Ψm=-1 to -40 kPa) which\
    \ is 10 to 100 times lower than \nsimilar plant-available water tensions in soils\
    \ (Lea-Cox et al., 2011). Plant-available water \n(PAW) is the amount of water\
    \ accessible to the plant, which is affected by the physical \nproperties of the\
    \ substrate, the geometry (height and width) of the container and the total \n\
    volume of the container (Handreck and Black, 2002). Container root systems are\
    \ usually \nconfined within a short time after transplanting, and shoot : root\
    \ ratios are usually larger \nthan those of soil-grown plants, for similarly-aged\
    \ plants. For all these reasons, maintaining \nthe optimal water status of soilless\
    \ substrates has been recognized as being critical for \ncontinued growth, not\
    \ only because of limited water-holding capacity, but also because of \nthe inadequacies\
    \ of being able to accurately judge when plants require water (Karlovich & \n\
    Fonteno, 1986). Although it is likely that mature plant root systems can extract\
    \ substrate \nmoisture at Ψm less than -40 kPa, Leith and Burger (1989) and Kiehl\
    \ et al. (1992) found \nsignificant growth reductions at substrate Ψm as small\
    \ as -16 kPa (0.16 Bar). This has major \nimplications for choosing appropriate\
    \ sensors for use in soilless substrates (see next section), \nas well as the\
    \ measurement and automatic control of irrigation in these substrates.  \n2.1.2\
    \ Types of soil moisture sensors \nJones (2004) noted the various types of soil\
    \ moisture sensors available at that time. The \nvariety of soil moisture sensors\
    \ (tensiometric, neutron, resistance, heat dissipation, \npsychrometric or dielectric)\
    \ has continually evolved since then; the choices are now \noverwhelming, since\
    \ each sensor may have specific strengths and weaknesses in a specific \nsituation.\
    \ Tensiometers have long been used to measure matric potential in soils (Smajstrla\
    \ \n& Harrison, 1998) and in soilless substrates (Burger and Paul, 1987). Although\
    \ tensiometers \nhave proven to be valuable research tools, they have not been\
    \ adopted widely in greenhouse \nand nursery production, mainly because of the\
    \ problems with using them in highly porous \nsoilless substrates. Tensiometers\
    \ rely on direct contact between the porous ceramic tip and \nsubstrate moisture.\
    \ If the substrate shrinks, or the tensiometer is disturbed, this contact may\
    \ \nbe disrupted. Air then enters and breaks the water column in the tensiometer,\
    \ resulting in \nincorrect readings and maintenance issues (Zazueta et al., 1994).\
    \ A number of next-\ngeneration soil moisture sensors have become available  in\
    \ the past decade from various \nmanufacturers., e.g. Theta probe and SM200 (Delta\
    \ T, Burwell, UK) and  EC5, 5TM and \n10HS sensors (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman,\
    \ WA, USA) which provide precise data in a \nwide range of soilless substrates.\
    \ These sensors determine the volumetric moisture content \nby measuring the apparent\
    \ dielectric constant of the soil or substrate. These sensors are easy \nto use\
    \ and provide highly reproducible data (van Iersel et al., 2011). The Decagon\
    \ range of \nsensors are designed to be installed in soils or substrates for longer\
    \ periods of time and all \ninterface with Decagon’s range of EM50 nodes, datastation\
    \ and Datatrac software \n(http://decagon.com/products). Dielectric sensors generally\
    \ require substrate-specific \ncalibrations, because the dielectric properties\
    \ of different soils and substrates differ, \naffecting sensor output. The conversion\
    \ between water potential and volumetric water \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n241 \ncontent\
    \ (VWC) varies substantially with soil type. It is possible to inter-convert matric\
    \ \npotential to volumetric water content (Lea-Cox et al, 2011) for various sensors\
    \ using \nsubstrate moisture release curves. However, such release curves are\
    \ substrate-specific, and \nmay change over time as the physical properties (e.g.\
    \ pore size distribution) of the substrate \nchanges (van Iersel et al., 2011)\
    \ or root systems become more established. Fortunately, in \nmost irrigation scheduling\
    \ applications, the objective is simply to apply a volume of water \nthat returns\
    \ the soil moisture content to its original well-watered state. Changes in this\
    \ total \nwater-holding capacity (i.e. the maximum VWC reading) can easily be\
    \ monitored for \nchanges over time, i.e. after significant rainfall events or\
    \ by periodically saturating the \ncontainer with the embedded sensor.  \nMore\
    \ recently, hybrid ‘tensiometer-like’ sensors have been developed which use the\
    \ \nprinciple of dielectric sensors to determine the water potential of substrates\
    \ (e.g., \nEquitensiometer, Delta T; MPS-1, Decagon Devices) (van Iersel et al.,\
    \ 2011). An advantage of \nsuch sensors is that they do not require substrate-specific\
    \ calibrations, since they measure \nthe water content of the ceramic material,\
    \ not that of the surrounding soil or substrate. \nUnfortunately, the sensors\
    \ that are currently available are not very sensitive in the matric \npotential\
    \ range where soilless substrates hold most plant-available water (0 to -10 kPa;\
    \ \ndeBoodt and Verdonck, 1972). In addition, it is not clear whether these sensors\
    \ respond \nquickly enough to capture the rapid changes that can occur in soilless\
    \ substrates (van Iersel \net al., 2011). \n2.2 Measuring plant water status \n\
    Automated irrigation techniques based on sensing plant water status are mostly\
    \ in the \ndevelopmental stage, in large part because of the variability of sensor\
    \ readings and the lack \nof rugged sensors and reliable automated techniques\
    \ (Table 1). It is usually necessary to \nsupplement indicators of plant stress\
    \ with additional information, such as crop evaporative \ndemand (Jones, 2008);\
    \ it is also hard to scale up these automated systems for many \nhorticultural\
    \ applications, since a detailed knowledge of crop development is required. \n\
    Plant water use (transpiration) is a key process in the hydrologic cycle, and\
    \ because \nphotosynthetic uptake of CO2 and transpiration are both controlled\
    \ by stomata, it is strongly \nlinked to plant productivity (Jones & Tardieu,\
    \ 1998). Models that can accurately predict \ntranspiration therefore have important\
    \ applications for irrigation scheduling and crop yield. \nHowever, previous evidence\
    \ (Jones, 2004) suggests that leaf water status is not the most \nuseful indicator\
    \ of plant water stress, and cannot therefore be used as the primary indicator\
    \ \nof irrigation need as has sometimes been suggested. In fact leaf water status\
    \ depends on a \ncomplex interaction of soil water availability and environmental\
    \ and physiological factors \n(Jones, 1990). It is now clear that in some situations\
    \ soil water status is sensed by the roots \nand this information is signaled\
    \ to the shoots, perhaps by means of hydraulic signals \n(Christmann et al., 2009)\
    \ and chemical messengers such as abscisic acid (Kim & van Iersel, \n2011). Another\
    \ general limitation to plant-based methods is that they do not usually give \n\
    information on ‘how much’ irrigation to apply at any time, only whether irrigation\
    \ is \nneeded or not. None of the plant-based methods illustrated in Table 1 are\
    \ well-adapted for \nautomatic irrigation scheduling or control because of the\
    \ difficulties measuring each \nvariable (Jones, 2008). Typically, the use of\
    \ any plant-based indicator for irrigation \nscheduling requires the definition\
    \ of reference or threshold values, beyond which irrigation \nwww.intechopen.com\n\
    \ \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n\
    \ \n242 \nis necessary. Such threshold values are commonly determined for plants\
    \ growing under \nnon-limiting soil water supply (Fereres and Goldhamer, 2003),\
    \ but obtaining extensive \ninformation on the behavior of these reference values\
    \ as environmental conditions change \nwill be an important stage in the development\
    \ and validation of such methods.  \n2.3 Hybridizing sensing and modeling techniques\
    \ for precision irrigation scheduling \nWater budget calculations are relatively\
    \ easy to use in scheduling irrigations, since there are \nsimple algorithms available\
    \ to calculate crop ET (typically using Penman-Monteith or other \nmethods) that\
    \ use local meteorological station or pan evaporation data (Fereres et al., 2003).\
    \ \nAll methods are based on calculating a reference ET that is multiplied by\
    \ an empirically-\ndetermined crop coefficient (Kc) for each crop. At present\
    \ there are good estimates of Kc \nvalues for many horticultural crops, even though\
    \ most research has been conducted on the \nmajor field crops (Allen et al, 1998).\
    \ However, there are virtually no KC values for \nornamental species and most\
    \ estimates of woody perennial crop water use are quite \nvariable. Inaccuracies\
    \ in Kc values can result in large potential errors in estimated soil \nmoisture\
    \ contents (Allen et al., 1998). The approach therefore works best where it is\
    \ \ncombined with regular soil moisture monitoring techniques that can help reset\
    \ the model \n(e.g. after rainfall). A particular strength of book-keeping and\
    \ volumetric soil-based \napproaches is that they not only address scheduling\
    \ issues about “when to irrigate” but also \nabout “how much to apply”. Although\
    \ useful for soil-based irrigation scheduling, there may \nbe limitations on how\
    \ quickly these calculations can be manually performed. This is \nespecially important\
    \ for greenhouse and container-nursery operations who may be cyclic \nirrigating\
    \ containerized plants from 4-8 times per day (Tyler et al., 1996) to maintain\
    \ \navailable water in the root zone on hot, sunny or windy days. \nPrevious studies\
    \ with a variety of crop, ornamental and turf species have reported that the \n\
    use of appropriate scheduling methods and precision irrigation technologies can\
    \ save a \nsignificant amount of water, while maintaining or increasing yield\
    \ and product quality \n(Bacci et al., 2008; Beeson & Brooks, 2008; Blonquist\
    \ et al., 2006; Fereres et al., 2003). Many of \nthese empirical approaches have\
    \ successfully incorporated environmental variables into \nvarious models, to\
    \ further increase the precision of irrigation scheduling (e.g. Treder et al.,\
    \ \n1997). It is imperative that we connect our capability for precision water\
    \ applications with a \nknowledge of real-time plant water use. We need to improve\
    \ our ability to predict plant \nwater use in real-time using various technologies.\
    \ As an example of this approach, van \nIersel and his group have shown with various\
    \ studies (Burnett and van Iersel, 2008; Kim and \nvan Iersel, 2009; Nemali and\
    \ van Iersel, 2006; van Iersel et al., 2009; 2010; 2011) that \nautomated irrigation\
    \ using soil moisture sensors allows for the very precise irrigation of \ngreenhouse\
    \ crops in soilless substrates. In addition, they maintained very low substrate\
    \ \nmoisture contents at very precise levels which advances our capability to\
    \ use precision \nirrigation scheduling for  regulated deficit irrigation (RDI)\
    \ techniques (Jones, 2004), to \nincrease fruit crop quality (Fereres et al.,\
    \ 2003), and aid in precision nutrient (Lea-Cox et al, \n2001; Ristvey et al,\
    \ 2004) and disease management (Lea-Cox et al, 2006).  \nMost recently, Kim and\
    \ van Iersel (2011) have demonstrated that the measured daily \nevapotranspiration\
    \ of petunia in the greenhouse can be accurately modeled with \nmeasurements of\
    \ crop growth (days after planting, DAP), daily light integral (DLI), vapor \n\
    pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature. All these environmental fluxes obviously\
    \ affect \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling \n \n243 \ntranspiration on a continuous basis. Ambient\
    \ light affects plant water use due to its effects \non evaporation and stomatal\
    \ opening (Pieruschka et al., 2010). Vapor pressure deficit is the \ndriving force\
    \ for transpiration and also affects stomatal regulation (Taiz and Zeiger, 2006)\
    \ \nwhile temperature affects ET and plant metabolic activity (Allen et al., 1998;\
    \ van Iersel, 2003). \nThe importance of Kim & van Iersel’s empirical modeling\
    \ approach is how they have \ndemonstrated the sensitivity of plant water use\
    \ to these four easily-measured variables. \nThus, with a few inexpensive sensors\
    \ (temperature, relative humidity and photosynthetic \nphoton flux, PPF) and some\
    \ simple software tools that can integrate these variables on short \ntime-scales,\
    \ it now appears possible to predict hourly plant water use for greenhouse crops\
    \ \nwith real precision. It should be noted however, that these models still require\
    \ rigorous \nvalidation for production conditions. \nHowever, for these types\
    \ of models to work in an external environment, it is likely that the \ncomplexity\
    \ of our predictive water use models will have to increase, to incorporate \n\
    additional variables. Water use by perennial woody crop species is much more complicated\
    \ \ndue to external environmental conditions (for example how VPD and leaf temperature\
    \ are \naffected by wind speed and boundary layer effects on canopies; LAI effects\
    \ on PPF \ninterception). For example, Bowden et al. (2005) outlined an automated\
    \ sensor-based \nirrigation system for nurseries that could calculate plant water\
    \ consumption from species \nand genotype-specific plant physiological responses.\
    \ The MAESTRA [Multi-Array \nEvaporation Stand Tree Radiation A] model (Wang and\
    \ Jarvis, 1990) is a three-dimensional \nprocess-based model that computes transpiration,\
    \ photosynthesis, and absorbed radiation \nwithin individual tree crowns at relatively\
    \ short time (15-minute) intervals. The model is \ndescribed more fully by Bauerle\
    \ & Bowden (2011b) and has been modified and previously \nvalidated to estimate\
    \ deciduous tree transpiration (Bauerle et al., 2002; Bowden & Bauerle, \n2008)\
    \ and within-crown light interception (Bauerle et al., 2004). The model applies\
    \ \nphysiological equations to sub-volumes of the tree crown and then sums and/or\
    \ averages \nthe values for entire canopies. Additionally, species-specific physiological\
    \ values can be \nincorporated into model calculations, potentially yielding more\
    \ accurate estimates of whole \ntree transpiration. The model holds potential\
    \ advantages for nursery, forest, and orchard \nwater use prediction in that structural\
    \ parameters such as tree position, crown shape, and \ntree dimensions are specified.\
    \  \nBowden et al. (2005) briefly illustrated how the model estimates of water\
    \ use and plant \nwater requirements are outputted from MAESTRA and used to both\
    \ make irrigation \ndecisions (command executed by a sensor node) and visualize\
    \ model updates via a graphic \nuser interface (Bauerle et al., 2006). Within\
    \ each 15-minute time step, the model adjusts \ntranspiration based on interactions\
    \ between environmental, soil moisture, and plant \nphysiological response. The\
    \ substrate moisture deficit calculation is described in Bauerle et \nal. (2002).\
    \ An updated substrate moisture value is carried into the next time step for input\
    \ \ninto the substrate moisture deficit sub-routine. The calculated moisture deficit\
    \ value is one \nof the input values required to calculate the amount of stomatal\
    \ conductance regulation and \nhence, interacts with other equations to derive\
    \ whole plant water use. Overall, this GUI \n(Bowden et al., 2005; Bauerle et\
    \ al., 2006) provides a user friendly interface to a complex set \nof calculations.\
    \ In this way, whole tree water use estimates can be rapidly visualized for \n\
    either sensor node or human based irrigation decision management. Bauerle and\
    \ his group \nare actively working to further refine the MAESTRA model for incorporation\
    \ into the \nirrigation scheduling decision support system in our current project\
    \ (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b). \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and\
    \ Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n \n244 \n3. Utilizing the power\
    \ of sensor networks \n3.1 Wireless Sensor Networks \nA WSN is typically comprised\
    \ of radio frequency transceivers, sensors, microcontrollers and \npower sources\
    \ (Akyildiz et al., 2002). Recent advances in wireless sensor networking \ntechnology\
    \ have led to the development of low cost, low power, multifunctional sensor \n\
    nodes. These nodes can be clustered in close proximity to provide dense sensing\
    \ capabilities, \nor deployed in a more distributed fashion (Fig. 1). We shall\
    \ describe the commercially-\navailable Decagon Devices WSN, since we have the\
    \ most experience with that system, \nalthough there are other commercial companies\
    \ that have similarly available irrigation and \nenvironmental WSN systems, e.g.\
    \ Adcon Telemetry Int. (Klosterneuburg, Austria; \nhttp://adcon.at), Delta-T Devices\
    \ (Cambridge, UK; http://delta-t.co.uk) and PureSense \n(Fresno, CA; http://puresense.com).\
    \  \nFigure 1 shows the type of WSN that we have deployed in multiple research\
    \ and \ncommercial sites. Whenever necessary, the accumulated data is transmitted\
    \ from each of the \nsensor nodes in the production area using a 900 MHz radio\
    \ card (although other companies \nuse other frequencies), to a ‘base’ datastation\
    \ connected to a personal computer on the farm. \nIncoming data is inputted into\
    \ a software program (e.g. DataTrac v.3.2; Decagon Devices) \nthat is installed\
    \ on a low-cost computer. The software then plots and displays the sensor \ninformation\
    \ from each of the nodes. Data is appended to existing data, so information can\
    \ \nbe graphically displayed over multiple time scales, depending on user preference.\
    \ \nAlternatively, data from a field node can be transmitted directly to a server\
    \ via the internet \nusing a 3G wireless node (e.g. EM50G, Decagon Devices). The\
    \ logged data is then accessed \nfrom the server over an internet website, using\
    \ the same DataTrac software previously \ndescribed. In this way, a grower can\
    \ develop a scaleable network of sensors that allows for \nthe monitoring of soil\
    \ moisture and environmental data, in real time. The advantages of \nthese WSN’s\
    \ are fairly obvious – they provide information at the “micro-scale” which can\
    \ be \nexpanded to any resolution, determined for a specific production operation,\
    \ for specific \nneeds. This system also provides a mechanism for local (i.e.\
    \ a decision made locally by the \nnode, based on local sensor readings /setpoints)\
    \ or the global control (information relayed \nto the nodes from an external database)\
    \ of irrigation scheduling (Fig. 1) , depending upon \ngrower preferences and\
    \ needs (Kohanbash et al, 2011). We are currently in the process of \ndeploying\
    \ and testing next-generation nodes  with these various capabilities. \nAny combination\
    \ of environmental sensors, including soil moisture and electrical \nconductivity,\
    \ soil and air temperature, relative humidity, anemometer (wind speed and \ndirection),\
    \ rain gauge and light (PPF and net radiation) sensors can be connected to the\
    \  \nnodes, according to user needs. Decagon nodes collect data every minute,\
    \ which is averaged \nand logged on a 1, 5- 15-min or greater time scale, according\
    \ to required precision. Longer \nsampling times result in a considerable increase\
    \ in battery life, but power consumption will \nalso vary greatly with different\
    \ systems. With Decagon EM50 nodes, a 15-min average \nsetting typically results\
    \ in > 12-month battery life from 5 ‘AA’ batteries under normal \ntemperature\
    \ (-5 to 40°C) conditions (J.D. Lea-Cox, pers. obs.). Battery life is also affected\
    \ by \nthe number of times the field nodes are downloaded and the settings employed;\
    \ typically \nnodes are downloaded 1-10 times a day. \nwww.intechopen.com\n \n\
    Using Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n245 \n\
    \ \nFig. 1. A schematic of a farm-scale WSN for precision irrigation scheduling\
    \ (adapted from \nBalendock, 2009), to illustrate networks deployed by our group\
    \ (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b). \n3.2 Scaleable, adaptable and reconfigurable capabilities\
    \ \nOne of the most important features of these WSNs is that a grower can purchase\
    \ a small \nnetwork and scale up and/or reconfigure the sensor network to meet\
    \ specific needs, over \ntime. These networks can provide a fixed capability,\
    \ but networks can be more fully utilized \nif a “nimble networks” concept is\
    \ used. In this way, growers can move sensor nodes quickly \nand easily within\
    \ the production area for shorter periods of time, to address current issues \n\
    and problems, e.g. to address the water requirements of a specific indicator species\
    \ in a \ndrought, or to monitor irrigations to reduce the incidence of disease\
    \ in a crop (Lea-Cox et al., \n2006). This nimble network approach can more fully\
    \ utilize WSN capabilities and is one of \nthe most powerful ways of realizing\
    \ a quick return on investment in equipment. We think \nthat there are many situations\
    \ where a grower could have a payback period for a small \nnetwork within a single\
    \ crop cycle, if the information is utilized for better irrigation and \ncrop\
    \ management decisions.  \n3.3 Wireless sensor network development for irrigation\
    \ scheduling \nA number of WSN’s with various topologies (e.g. star, mesh-network)\
    \ have been developed \nand investigated by different researchers in the past\
    \ decade (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009), \nincluding WSN’s for irrigation scheduling\
    \ in cotton (Vellidis et al., 2008), center-pivot \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems,\
    \ Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n \n246 \nirrigation\
    \ (O’Shaughnessy & Evett, 2008) and linear-move irrigation systems (Kim et al.,\
    \ \n2008). The first reported greenhouse WSN was a bluetooth monitoring and control\
    \ system \ndeveloped by Liu & Ying (2003). Yoo et al. (2007) describes the deployment\
    \ of a wireless \nenvironmental monitoring and control system in greenhouses;\
    \ Wang et al. (2008) also \ndeveloped a specialized wireless sensor node to monitor\
    \ temperature, relative humidity and \nlight inside greenhouses. Our group (Lea-Cox\
    \ et al., 2007) reported on the early deployment \nof a WSN within a cut-flower\
    \ greenhouse, where a number of soil moisture and \nenvironmental sensor nodes\
    \ were deployed for real-time monitoring of crop production by \nthe grower. \
    \ \nWith regards to large on-farm WSN deployments, Balendonck et al., (2009) reported\
    \ on the \nFLOW-AID project that has many of the same objectives that we are focused\
    \ upon, i.e., \nproviding growers with a safe, efficient and cost-effective management\
    \ system for irrigation \nscheduling. The FLOW-AID project is integrating innovative\
    \ monitoring and control \ntechnologies within an appropriate decision support\
    \ system (Balendonck et al., 2007; \nFerentinos et al., 2003) that is accessible\
    \ over the internet, to assist growers in long-term \nfarm zoning and crop planning.\
    \ It is especially focused on providing growers with \nregulated deficit irrigation\
    \ and soil salinity management tools. To support shorter-term \nirrigation scheduling,\
    \ a scheduling tool is being developed which allocates available water \namong\
    \ several plots and schedules irrigation for each plot (Stanghellini et al., 2007;\
    \ \nAnastasiou et al., 2008). To assist this advanced scheduling tool, a crop\
    \ response model is \nbeing developed and used to predict crop stress (Balendonck\
    \ et al., 2009). \nWe outlined the major engineering and scientific goals of our\
    \ WSN project earlier in this \nchapter (Lea-Cox et al., 2010a). To explain further,\
    \ this interdisciplinary project is taking a \ncommercially-available WSN product\
    \ (Decagon Devices, Inc.) and retooling it to support the \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ requirements of field nurseries, container nurseries, greenhouse \noperations\
    \ and green roof systems, as analogs for many intensive agricultural production\
    \ \nand environmental management systems. Our global goals are to develop a more\
    \ \nintegrative and mechanistic understanding of plant water requirements, to\
    \ more precisely \nschedule irrigation events with WSN technology. We are working\
    \ across various scales of \nproduction, using small and large commercial farms\
    \ which allow us to take a systems \napproach to defining the hardware and software\
    \ required to meet the needs of these highly \nintensive specialty crop systems.\
    \ In addition to the ornamental industry, there are many \nparallel needs that\
    \ we are addressing for WSN adoption by field-grown fruit, nut and berry \nproduction,\
    \ as well as field and greenhouse vegetable production. As part of the project,\
    \ \neconomic, environmental and social analyses will identify costs and benefits\
    \ of WSN \ntechnology to the industry and society, including barriers to adoption.\
    \ The project directly \ninvolves commercial growers throughout the process, using\
    \ deployments in commercial \noperations as test sites. This will help ensure\
    \ product satisfaction of the next generation of \nhardware and software developed\
    \ by our various teams (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b; \nhttp://www.smart-farms.net).\
    \ Each farm and research test site is instrumented with a sensor \nnetwork(s)\
    \ to provide real-time environmental data for scientific and technological \n\
    development. Data streams are monitored on a day-to-day basis by growers, engineers\
    \ and \nscientists, which drives a daily dialogue between the growers and various\
    \ working groups.  \nThe role of the engineering team is to develop, deploy and\
    \ maintain the next generation of \nwireless sensor networks (Fig. 1). Their major\
    \ task is to develop the hardware and software \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n247 \ncapable\
    \ of supporting advanced monitoring and control of irrigation scheduling, \nimplementing\
    \ a hybrid sensor and modeling approach. A major focus of this effort is the \n\
    development of advanced software which will provide advanced user control, in\
    \ addition to \ndatabase filtering and analysis. The software will refine incoming\
    \ data and provide an easy-\nto-use computer program for a non-expert user to\
    \ easily visualize the information from the \nWSN, and schedule irrigation events\
    \ based on user preference, or utilizing automatic (set-\npoint) control. The\
    \ scientific modeling group (Bauerle et al., 2011a; Kim and van Iersel, 2011;\
    \ \nStarry et al., 2011) are developing and validating the various models, which\
    \ form the basis \nof the species- and environmental-specific software. These\
    \ models interface with the WSN \ndatabase via an open application programming\
    \ interface, which integrates the models with \nthe irrigation scheduling monitoring\
    \ and control functions. This will enable more predictive \n(feed-forward) management\
    \ of water use, based upon the underlying plant and \nenvironmental water-use\
    \ models.  \nThe role of the scientific and extension teams is to ensure that\
    \ the precision and accuracy of \nthe data gathered (and hence the quality of\
    \ the models incorporated in the decision support \nsoftware) are of the highest\
    \ possible quality and reliability. There are a number of critical \nresearch\
    \ objectives that span the various production environments: (a) characterize the\
    \ \nspatial and temporal variability of environmental parameters in both root\
    \ and shoot \ncanopies, since we need to place sensors for maximum precision and\
    \ economic benefit; (b) \ncharacterize sensor performance and precision, so we\
    \ match the right sensor with the right \napplication; (c) integrate the knowledge\
    \ gained from (a) and (b), to ensure that the irrigation \nscheduling decisions\
    \ made (either manually or automatically) satisfy plant water \nrequirements in\
    \ real-time, while placing a minimum burden on the grower for managing \nthe system.\
    \ We elaborate further on some of these critical objectives below in section 3.4.\
    \ \nHowever, our primary project objective is to provide a cost-effective WSN\
    \ that provides \nquality data for minimal cost to growers, both small and large.\
    \ Our grower’s production \nareas range from 0.5 to over 250 ha in extent, with\
    \ multiple irrigation zones / crop species. \nTo that end, our economic and environmental\
    \ analysis team members are gathering specific \neconomic, resource use and environmental\

    \  \n3.4 Sensor network deployment issues and strategies \n3.4.1 Spatial and temporal\
    \ variability \nUnderstanding spatial and temporal variability of environmental\
    \ data is one of the most \nimportant aspects of deploying WSNs in any real-world\
    \ application, since these dynamics \nnot only determine the appropriate position\
    \ of a sensor, but the precision of the sensor data \nis of course greatly affected\
    \ by the immediate environment and the forces acting on that \nenvironment. This\
    \ is the realm of environmental biophysics (Campbell and Norman, 1998; \nJones,\
    \ 1992) and environmental plant physiology (Nobel, 2009) which forms the basis\
    \ of our \nefforts to sense and model the environment.  \nwww.intechopen.com\n\
    \ \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural Water Management \n\
    \ \n248 \nFigure 2 illustrates soil moisture variability from 10HS soil moisture\
    \ sensors at two depths \n(15 and 30cm below the soil surface) in five replicate\
    \ Acer rubrum (Red maple) trees from \nMay through Sept., 2009 (Lea-Cox, unpublished\
    \ data). Sensors were calibrated to the \nspecific soil type found on this farm\
    \ (Lea-Cox, Black, Ristvey & Ross, 2008).  \n \nFig. 2. Soil moisture dynamics\
    \ at 15cm and 30cm depths in the root zone of five replicate \nAcer rubrum trees\
    \ from May through September, 2009. Stacked data from two nodes is \ngraphically\
    \ displayed using an earlier version of DataTrac (v. 2.78, Decagon Devices). \n\
    As can be seen, 15cm data were more variable throughout the entire season (Fig.\
    \ 2). Trees \nwere irrigated for 1-2 hours with drip irrigation on a daily basis\
    \ throughout most of the \nstudy (Lea-Cox, Black, Ristvey & Ross, 2008), except\
    \ after major rainfall events restored the \nsoil water contents above 0.25 m3\
    \ • m-3 (Fig. 2). Changes in daily water content (tree uptake) \nare evident immediately\
    \ after these rainfall events, particularly in the 15cm dynamics. Soil \nmoisture\
    \ dynamics at the 30cm depth were much less variable between trees at all times\
    \ \nduring the season, and soil moisture at this depth did not fall below 0.20\
    \ m3 • m-3 during this \nyear, despite relatively low rainfall totals during the\
    \ summer (data not shown).  \nFigure 3 shows similar soil moisture data from 10HS\
    \ sensors at 15cm depth from Cornus \nflorida trees, but these trees were grown\
    \ in a pine bark soilless substrate in 56-liter containers \nin a container-nursery\
    \ operation. Firstly, note that the average substrate moisture is around \n0.5\
    \ m3 • m-3, since this organic substrate has a high water-holding capacity and\
    \ also because \nthis grower typically irrigates 2-3 times per day, with small\
    \ low-volume microsprinkler \nevents (1.5L in 6 minutes) during summer months.\
    \  \nNote also how quickly substrate moisture decreases with plant uptake when\
    \ morning and \nearly afternoon irrigation events are skipped, due to the relatively\
    \ low amounts of total \nwater in the container (Fig. 3). Note also that real-time\
    \ irrigation applications per tree are \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks for Precision Irrigation Scheduling \n \n249 \neasily measured\
    \ using a small tipping rain gauge with a rain cover, with an additional \nmicrosprinkler\
    \ head inserted under the cover (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b). The volumes displayed\
    \ \n(Fig. 3) give the grower instantaneous feedback and tie soil moisture contents\
    \ directly to \nirrigation events and the volumes applied. We are using the same\
    \ tipping rain gauges to \ngive leaching volumes from pot-in-pot containers with\
    \ an underground drainage system, to \nprovide approximate daily irrigation water\
    \ budgets (i.e. Irrigation + Rainfall - Leaching = \nδVWC ≈ ET) for additional\
    \ indicator species on the farm (Lea-Cox et al., 2010b).  \n \nFig. 3. Typical\
    \ container moisture dynamics before and after irrigation events in four Cornus\
    \ \nflorida trees. Data is graphically displayed using the most recent version\
    \ of DataTrac (v. 3.2).  \n3.4.2 Sensor placement  \nChanges in substrate VWC\
    \ due to daily water use of a crop can be used to control irrigation \nevents,\
    \ but placement of sensors is very important in container production, because\
    \ of the \nnon-uniform distribution of water within a soilless substrate and container.\
    \ van Iersel et al. \n(2011) illustrated this point, by calculating the rate of\
    \ change in substrate VWC. They noted \nthat the maximum rate of decrease in VWC\
    \ occurred at the bottom of the container in a \ngreenhouse study and closely\
    \ followed changes in solar radiation, suggesting that changes \nin VWC were driven\
    \ by root water uptake from the lower part of the container. However, \nthe vertical\
    \ gradient in substrate VWC also changed over time i.e., the VWC of the bottom\
    \ \nlayer decreased much more rapidly than that of the upper layers, likely because\
    \ of the root \ndistribution within the container. Apparently, the lack of roots\
    \ in the upper part of the \nsubstrate resulted in little water uptake from that\
    \ substrate layer, and vertical water \nmovement in the container was not fast\
    \ enough to prevent the middle layers from getting \ndrier than the upper layer.\
    \ If these findings can be generalized for other container-grown \nspecies, it\
    \ would greatly increase our understanding for correct sensor placement in root\
    \ \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of Agricultural\
    \ Water Management \n \n250 \nzones, simplifying placement and increasing the\
    \ precision of information for controlling \nirrigation events. However, since\
    \ root distribution is affected by irrigation method, optimal \nplacement of soil\
    \ moisture sensors for irrigation control may depend on how the crop is \nirrigated\
    \ (van Iersel et al., 2011). \nSensor placement is especially challenging for\
    \ crops grown in large containers over \nrelatively long periods of time. Barnard\
    \ et al. (2011) examined the spatial and temporal \nvariation in VWC among 10\
    \ tree species in large containers in a container nursery, and \nfound significant\
    \ differences within containers and among species. Based on their initial \nresults,\
    \ they recommended species-specific sensor deployment. For such crops, where root\
    \ \ndistribution within the container may change dramatically throughout the production\
    \ \nperiod, it may be necessary to move the soil moisture sensor as root distribution\
    \ changes, or \nit may be possible to use a soil moisture sensor that can sense\
    \ the substrate water content \nthroughout most of the container. It is therefore\
    \ likely that a hybrid sensor and crop water \nuse model approach will have greater\
    \ degree of precision for automated irrigation \nscheduling, a feature desired\
    \ by many greenhouse and container-nursery growers. \n3.4.3 Using indicator plant\
    \ species \nFor many ornamental operations, it is unlikely that we will be able\
    \ to sense the water needs \nof all crop species being grown. Many growers however\
    \ are familiar with the concept of \nusing indicator species (i.e., species that\
    \ have high and low water use, on average), which \nare used to inform irrigation\
    \ schedules for similar types of plants (Yeager et al., 2007). For \nthis reason,\
    \ we are developing crop models which include a number of these indicator \nspecies\
    \ in the decision support software. Part of this strategy is also to engage the\
    \ larger \nresearch community in the development and incorporation of additional\
    \ specific crop \nmodels (e.g. Warsaw et al., 2009) in future irrigation decision\
    \ support systems. \n3.4.4 Microclimatic data \nThe gathering and seamless integration\
    \ of real-time environmental data is integral to the \ndevelopment and implementation\
    \ of crop-specific (Bauerle et al., 2010; Kim and van Iersel, \n2011) and environmental\
    \ models (Starry, 2011). Typical microclimatic data which is \ngathered by “weather”\
    \ nodes is displayed in Fig. 4. Tools within DataTrac v.3.2 now allow \nfor the\
    \ calculation and plotting of integrated data, such as vapor pressure deficit,\
    \ daily light \nintegral and accumulated degree days, as simple derivatives of\
    \ this instantaneous data. \nApart from the integration of this data into various\
    \ crop, environmental and disease \ndevelopment models, this microclimatic data\
    \ has many other direct practical benefits for \nproducers, e .g. the use of real-time\
    \ T/RH and wind speed data for precision timing of spray \nschedules in the field.\
    \ Longer-term seasonal information for light, precipitation and \nmaximum/minimum\
    \ air and soil temperatures are very informative for growers to assess \ncrop\
    \ growth development and other production variables e.g. residual soil nutrient\
    \ values. \n3.4.5 Predictive irrigation scheduling \nThe integration of real-time\
    \ microclimatic data into crop-specific and environmental water \nuse models is\
    \ the next step in our development path; we have successfully parameterized \n\
    petunia (Kim and van Iersel, 2011), red maple (Bauerle et al., 2011b) and green\
    \ roof  \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks for Precision\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling \n \n251 \n \nFig. 4. Weather data from a sensor node\
    \ with a typical suite of environmental sensors, \nincluding total radiation (black),\
    \ photosynthetic photon flux (purple), relative humidity, RH  \n(blue), air temperature,\
    \ T (red) and wind speed (green). \nstormwater runoff (Starry et al, 2011) models,\
    \ and we are verifying and validating those \nmodels with  current research projects.\
    \ Our modeling and engineering teams are interfacing \nthese models with a testbed\
    \ sensorweb system (Kohanbash et al., 2011). In their paper, they \npresent a\
    \ framework for integrating physiological models into WSN for advanced irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling. They note that the ability to gather high resolution data, interpret\
    \ it, and create \nan actionable conclusion is a critical ability for a WSN. \
    \ \nKohanbash et al. (2011) outlined our irrigation scheduling programming logic\
    \ where \ngrowers create a schedule for when water needs to be applied, and then\
    \ the schedule is \ninterrupted as needed. This system provides growers with four\
    \ operating modes: (1) a \nschedule-based controller very similar to what is commonly\
    \ used in the industry. Within the \nschedule, there are two different options\
    \ to over-ride the schedule to decrease the irrigation \ntime (a) a local setpoint\
    \ controller and (b) a global controller. The schedule + local setpoint \ncontroller\
    \ enables the sensor node to make local control decisions based on sensors attached\
    \ \nto the node. The schedule + global controller allows the grower to use data\
    \ from any node in \nthe network, calculated data or model data to control the\
    \ irrigation and consequently \ndetermine if the schedule should be interrupted.\
    \ The fourth mode is a manual override \nmode that allows the grower to water\
    \ in traditional mode, for a given number of minutes. \nThis irrigation scheduling\
    \ flexibility gives a grower the ability to control how water gets \napplied to\
    \ an irrigation zone, with various user-defined parameters. The user can choose\
    \ \nbetween a mode where water will be applied slowly with small delays between\
    \ irrigation \nwww.intechopen.com\n \nProblems, Perspectives and Challenges of\
    \ Agricultural Water Management \n \n252 \nevents to allow water to reach subsurface\
    \ sensors (micro-pulse irrigation; Lea-Cox et al., \n2009) or a mode in which\
    \ water is applied continuously for a specified period of time.  \n4. Challenges,\
    \ opportunities and conclusions \nOf course there are many areas where we need\
    \ additional research and development, to \nprovide the maximum cost benefit of\
    \ WSNs for growers. Challenges include standardizing \nWSN protocols and communication\
    \ frequencies, as they can be confusing for growers and \nresearchers alike. Nodes\
    \ operating at lower frequencies (900 MHz) typically have an \nincreased range\
    \ and can penetrate tree canopies better than higher frequency (2.4 GHz) \nnodes\
    \ with reduced packet loss. Battery-operated nodes are typical; integrating rechargeable\
    \ \ncapabilities into sensor nodes is important, especially if control capabilities\
    \ are going to \nbecome standard, since this will greatly increase power requirements.\
    \ Another challenge is \nworking with large datasets. We have to educate ourselves\
    \ as to the resolution required for \noptimum precision in each environment, keeping\
    \ the ultimate use of the data in mind.  \nThe maintenance and calibration of\
    \ sensors and equipment is an ongoing concern, particularly \nfor growers who\
    \ may be uncomfortable with the technology and equipment. We definitely see \n\
    an opportunity for paid consultants to maintain and remotely monitor WSNs for\
    \ optimum \nperformance. As part of our project, we are developing an online knowledge\
    \ center, to provide \nassistance and guidance about various aspects of WSN deployment,\
    \ sensor use, strategies and \nbest practices. We need to integrate better data\
    \ analysis tools to handle large volumes of data \nfrom sensor networks. We also\
    \ need to do a thorough user interface study on how growers \nactually use computer\
    \ interfaces and to determine what features are needed. Predictive \nmodels for\
    \ plant water use, environmental and disease management tools are rapidly being\
    \ \ndeveloped for growers, but we need to validate and verify these models for\
    \ use in different \nenvironments. Incorporation of models into WSNs for decision-making\
    \ appears to be \nrelatively easy, but there are many details which have yet to\
    \ be worked out.  \nThere are many layers to the socio-economic analysis our economic\
    \ team is performing. Of \ncourse there are many direct benefits of precision\
    \ irrigation scheduling that can be accrued \nby the grower, such as saving on\
    \ water, labor, electricity, and fertilizer costs. However, there \nare many indirect\
    \ (e.g. reduced disease incidence, fungicide costs) and societal benefits \n(reduced\
    \ nutrient runoff, groundwater consumption) that may have much larger benefits\
    \ \nover the long-term for all agricultural producers. Most importantly, we need\
    \ to quantify the \nreturn on investment that a grower could expect to achieve,\
    \ and to be able to scale those \nbenefits for small producers, along with scaling\
    \ WSN deployments. We are also interested \nin documenting perceived and real\
    \ barriers to adoption. Our socio-economic team is \nactively surveying a large\
    \ number of growers with a detailed survey, to compare the use of \nsensor technology\
    \ and irrigation decisions by early and late adopters.  \nIn conclusion, we believe\
    \ that there have been some real advances in WSNs for precision \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ in recent years. Of course many challenges still remain, but we believe \nthat\
    \ WSNs are a fast-maturing technology that will be rapidly adopted by many growers\
    \ in \nthe near future.  \n5. Acknowledgements \nWe gratefully acknowledge grant\

    Agriculture plays an important role in the making and development of a country.\
    \ In India, agriculture is \nthe primary source of living for more than about\
    \ 60% of its population. The agriculture-related issues \nalways hinder the development\
    \ of a country. The enhancement of traditional agriculture methods and \nits modernization\
    \ towards smart agriculture is the only solution for agriculture problems. Hence,\
    \ by \nconsidering this issue, a framework is presented for smart agriculture\
    \ using sensor network and IoT. The \nkey features of this system are the deployment\
    \ of smart sensors for the collection of data, cloud-based \nanalysis, and decision\
    \ based on monitoring for spraying and weeding. The smart farming approach \n\
    provides valuable collection of data, high precision control, and automated monitoring\
    \ approach. \nThe proposed system presents smart agriculture monitoring system\
    \ that collects and monitors the \nsoil moisture, environmental temperature, and\
    \ humidity. The measured soil moisture, temperature, \nand humidity are stored\
    \ in ThingSpeak cloud for analysis.\nKEywoRdS\nInternet of Things (IoT), Precision\
    \ Agriculture, Productivity, ThingSpeak Cloud Platform, Wireless Sensor \nNetworks\
    \ (WSNs)\n1. INTRodUCTIoN\nPrecision agriculture is a method in which farmers\
    \ optimize inputs such as water and fertilizer for \nthe enhancement of productivity,\
    \ quality and yield (Srbinovska et al., 2015). The term precision \nagriculture\
    \ also encourages for minimizing pests and diseases through specially target application\
    \ \nof precise amount of pesticides. Smart agriculture or precision agriculture\
    \ is an integrated farm \nmanagement framework which constitutes a holistic management\
    \ approach aiming to optimize the \nyield per unit of farming land. Increasing\
    \ the quantity and quality of agricultural products while \nutilizing less inputs\
    \ such as fertilizers, water, pesticides, energy, etc., results in cost reduction\
    \ with \npositive environmental impact (Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017). Therefore,\
    \ rather than applying the \nsame amount of fertilizers over the entire agricultural\
    \ field or applying fertilizers to specially target \narea helps in overall cost\
    \ reduction. The smart agriculture solution measures the variation in field \n\
    conditions and adapts the fertilization or feed strategy accordingly (TongKe,\
    \ 2013). Farmers as the \nprincipal stakeholders usually make complex decisions\
    \ without proper information and execute the \nInternational Journal of Agricultural\
    \ and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n\
    2\ndemanding field operations. Therefore, smart agriculture solutions are best\
    \ designed considering \nfarmers at the center of the process. The solutions of\
    \ smart agriculture complements and transforms \nthe skills and experiences gained\
    \ naturally through the generations (Chhetri et al., 2017). The smart \nsolution\
    \ can complement the farmer’s capabilities in three main processes. The three\
    \ sub-processes \nare presented in Figure 1. The sub-processes are data collection,\
    \ decision making, and intervention. \nThe data collection is a part where remote\
    \ sensing and sensor networks are utilized. In the decision \nmaking part, expert\
    \ systems and machine learning can be exploited. The third part is an intervention\
    \ \nwhere intelligent machinery and robotic agents can be utilized for field operations.\
    \ The complete \ntypical process cycle includes data collection for measuring\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, PH, \nhumidity, or multi-spectral images.\
    \ The data collection process is followed by the data analysis which \nproduces\
    \ a description for the pesticides, irrigation, fertilizers, and harvest. The\
    \ last component of \nthe process is an automated intervention which executes\
    \ the description maps on the field area using \nvariable rate technology machinery.\
    \ This cycle can monitors the possible areas of concern like soil, \nvegetation,\
    \ or the environment. In addition to this farmer, related sub-processes smart\
    \ agriculture can \nbe designed to provide extra benefits. The benefits for external\
    \ functions such as soil and environment \nmonitoring, traceability of food, and\
    \ specific bookkeeping facilitating national planning (Mekala and \nViswanathan,\
    \ 2017). The recent survey presents the decreasing level of waters and drying\
    \ up of major \nwater resources such as rivers and tanks, presents efficient utilization\
    \ of water resources (Veena et \nal., 2018). The technological evolution of WSNs\
    \ and IoT made it possible to monitor the environment \nand agricultural fields\
    \ for gaining the production (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). \nThese technologies are\
    \ in different levels of maturity and adoption across all over the world. \nTherefore,\
    \ more than often technology introduction to different communities needs to be\

    \ should account for the wide \ndiversity of agriculture for the following characteristics\
    \ particularly farm size, farming types, farming \npractices, level of yield,\

    \ \n(Elijah el al., 2018). On the other hand, smart agriculture solutions affect\

    \ woRK\nThe major rising issues of agriculture such as decreasing water levels\
    \ (rivers and tanks) and \nenvironmental factors that need to be addressed and\
    \ requires a solution based on smart agriculture. \n(Liqiang et al., 2011) presented\
    \ a system for monitoring crops utilizing temperature and moisture \nsensors.\
    \ (Ocampo et al., 2017) developed an algorithm based on temperature and soil moisture\
    \ values \nand the sensed information is processed through the gateway for controlling\
    \ water quantity. Their \nproposed system has duplex communication links and power\
    \ through photovoltaic panels. Their \nsystem utilizes a cellular network interface\
    \ for data transmission and its calculations for irrigation \nscheduling. The\
    \ advancement in the field of wireless sensor networks has helped the evolution\
    \ of \nmany approaches for precision agriculture applications. (Chaudhary et al.,\
    \ 2011) have presented a \nsystem that utilizes WSNs for monitoring and controlling\
    \ greenhouse parameters. It is observed from \nthe study of different agriculture\
    \ fields that outcomes from agriculture are decreasing day by day. The \nadoption\
    \ of new technologies for precision agriculture promises an increase in production\
    \ rate and \nalso reduces the extra manpower requirements. There exist many studies\
    \ contributing to the benefit \nof farmers which provides an efficient system\
    \ based on new technologies for increasing the overall \nproduction rates (Varman\
    \ et al., 2017). (Keshtgari and Deljoo, 2011) developed a system that uses a \n\
    distributed wireless sensor networks system. Their proposed system is designed\
    \ for providing real-\ntime monitoring of the agriculture field and controlled\
    \ irrigation scheme for increasing productivity \nutilizing water resources efficiently.\
    \ The system provides the design in detail including real-time \nfield sensing\
    \ and controlled irrigation utilizing the software. The designed system provides\
    \ a low-\ncost efficient solution for irrigation control using WSNs. The system\
    \ using WSNs for precision \nagriculture highly depends on the field parameters\
    \ such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity \nlevels. Sensor nodes were\
    \ deployed below the soil for the collection of parameters and these sensor \n\
    communicates among others using communication protocols and transmits their measured\
    \ data to the \ncontrol station through the sink node. (Zhao et al., 2017) have\
    \ designed a communication protocol \nfor quick transmission of the sensor data\
    \ to the sink node. Their proposed design delivers very few \nduty cycles and\
    \ results increase in the lifetime of the monitoring system. (Bachuwar et al.,\
    \ 2018) have \ndeveloped a system that utilizes sensors and UART (universal asynchronous\
    \ receiver transmitter) \ninterface. The transmission is carried out through hourly\
    \ sampling, buffering of data, its transmission, \nand at last the validation\
    \ of status. The experimental results present attenuation in radio frequency \n\
    signals because of sensor deployment under the soil and the deployment cost is\
    \ comparatively high. \n(Gayatri et al., 2015) presents a solution for monitoring\
    \ agricultural fields along with the irrigation \nInternational Journal of Agricultural\
    \ and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n\
    4\ncontrol utilizing GPS (global positioning system) enable sensors. Their system\
    \ is capable for providing \ntimely response but the drawback is deployment cost\
    \ and the attenuation which caused by deploying \nsensors under soil. (Dan et\
    \ al., 2015) presented a greenhouse monitoring system based on WSNs and \nIoT\
    \ integration with cloud. Their system is capable of logging and storing data\
    \ in cloud periodically \nand present an effective solution for greenhouse monitoring.\
    \ \n(Heble et al., 2018) have presented a cost-effective solution of farming where\
    \ the water resources \nare limited. The designed system considers low-cost sensors\
    \ and easy circuitry and designed an \nautomatic water flow control system. The\
    \ real-time monitoring considers sensing of temperature and \nhumidity and displaying\
    \ them on LCD. Their designed system provides the water efficiently to the \n\
    needed plants measured according to the present moisture level. (Reche et al.,\
    \ 2014) have proposed \nan irrigation scheduler system based on low cost and time-dependent\
    \ microcontroller. Their designed \nsystem comprises of sensor network for the\
    \ detection of soil moisture and temperature levels. The \nreal-time sensed data\
    \ is processed to the users through SMS using GSM module.\n(Nawandar and Satpute,\
    \ 2019) presented an irrigation system consists of soil moisture sensors and \n\
    irrigation controllers. Their system provides a wireless link among the farmer\
    \ computer and irrigation \ncontroller. The designed system can be adopted where\
    \ the water quality is poor or limited. They have \nimplemented a decision support\
    \ system for the optimization of irrigation control, the use of fertilizers, and\
    \ \nwater for the development of crops. (Channe et al., 2015) designed a smart\
    \ agriculture system based on \ncloud computing and the Internet of Things. The\
    \ cloud platform is utilized for achieving load balancing \nand resource’s dynamic\
    \ distribution. (Rajeswari et al., 2017) presented a system based on the control\
    \ \nnetwork and IoT platform. Their design also presents an information management\
    \ system for storing and \nprocessing data. The stored data can be accessed to\
    \ facilitate various researches on agriculture. Table 1, \npresents the comparative\
    \ study of a conducted literature survey of different agriculture approaches.\
    \ Most \nof the solutions provided for smart farming or precision agriculture\
    \ does not provide a cost-effective \nsolution for farming. The system for irrigation\
    \ presented by (Reche et al., 2014) is the most efficient \nsolution for smart\
    \ agriculture as their approach provides the real time analysis of data. The designed\
    \ \nmodel presents a cost-effective solution for smart agriculture. The proposed\
    \ system measures the real-\ntime field parameters and stores the data in a cloud\
    \ platform for real-time analysis.\n3. SySTEM dESIGN\nThe prime objective behind\
    \ our design is to present a smart agriculture system based on IoT and \nsensor\

    5\ndesign requires soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and air monitoring sensors\
    \ for designing a \nsystem without human interventions. Figure 2, presents the\
    \ proposed framework for smart agriculture \nbased on sensor networks and IoT.\
    \ The proposed design consists of four layers of operation which \nare sensor\
    \ deployment, middleware, communication, and application layer.\n3.1 Sensor deployment\
    \ Layer\nSensor deployment in the agriculture field is the first layer of operation.\
    \ The proposed system uses a \nsoil moisture sensor, temperature, and humidity\
    \ sensor and air monitoring sensor for the collection of \nfield data. The deployed\
    \ sensor nodes are presented in Figure 3. These sensor nodes are responsible \n\
    for collecting real-time field data and regular monitoring of the agriculture\
    \ field. The soil moisture \nsensor measures the soil moisture level, temperature,\
    \ and humidity sensor to measure the relative \ntemperature and humidity levels.\
    \ Similarly, an air monitoring sensor is used to estimate wind speed \nand directions.\
    \ These sensor nodes communicate with each other and transfer the sensed information\
    \ \nto the sink or master node. \nThe sink node is Arduino Uno based microcontroller,\
    \ which is responsible for collecting field \ndata and transferring information\
    \ further to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for storage and its \nanalysis. The\
    \ hardware used for the experimentation collects data in real time (soil moisture\
    \ level, \nrelative temperature & humidity and wind speed). The sensor nodes communicates\
    \ with each other \nwirelessly and transfers sensed data to sink node which is\
    \ GSM enabled. This sink node is responsible \nfor gathering the field information\
    \ and transferring data to the cloud for analysis and storing.\n3.2 Middleware\
    \ Layer\nMiddleware is the second operation layer of our proposed system. This\
    \ layer is responsible for \ncontrolling the actuators and automating the agriculture\
    \ process. The collected values beyond the \nthreshold are transferred to the\
    \ controller for their analysis in the ground station. These operational \nlayers\
    \ carefully monitor the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and wind speed as\
    \ these factors \nFigure 2. IoT based framework for smart agriculture\nInternational\
    \ Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue\
    \ 2 • April-June 2021\n6\ndirectly impact agricultural yields. The system is configured\
    \ considering three factors; in the first \nfactor when the soil moisture is observed\
    \ below its threshold value an alert message is generated and \nsend to the user\
    \ through e-mail. The automated system then generates a query for turning ON the\
    \ \nwater motor for soil irrigation. When the required irrigation level is covered\
    \ the system automatically \nturns OFF the water motor. The factor considers the\
    \ rise in relative temperature and humidity values \nbeyond the threshold. The\
    \ system sends an automated generated alert and suggests to open the flap \nof\
    \ greenhouse or poly-house for maintaining the ambient atmosphere. The third factor\
    \ is the wind \nspeed and its direction which is monitored by air monitoring sensors.\
    \ When air monitoring value \nsucceeds threshold, systems generate an alert for\
    \ covering the region and targeted plants, protecting \nthem from harm. The middleware\
    \ layer is responsible for above mentioned three operations. These \noperations\
    \ are carried out in the ground station using the ThnigSpeak platform based on\
    \ the real-\ntime analysis of sensed field data. Controlling these three factors\
    \ in the targeted agriculture region, \nincrease the overall crop production with\
    \ efficient use of resources.\n3.3 Communication and Cloud Analysis Layer\nThe\
    \ third operational layer of the proposed system is the communication layer. This\
    \ layer uses \nArdunio Uno based microcontroller and responsible for communicating\
    \ with the deployed sensors. \nThe collected data is transferred to the base station\
    \ through this gateway wirelessly as it is comprised \nof the GSM module. This\
    \ module is WiFi-enabled and communicates the information wirelessly. The \ndeployed\
    \ sensor monitors the field data such as moisture, temperature, humidity, wind\
    \ speed, and \ncommunicates them to the gateway node. An IP protocol is running\
    \ in the controller gateway which \nsends the collected information to ThingSpeak\
    \ cloud for analysis and making decisions.\n3.4 Application Layer\nThe advancement\
    \ in the field of cloud computing and edge computing provides an effective solution\
    \ \nfor the issues of smart agriculture application. The designed model uses the\
    \ ThingSpeak cloud platform \nfor the collection of field data and provides efficient\
    \ storage and analysis. In this operational layer, \nFigure 3. Deployment of Sensors\
    \ for data collection\nInternational Journal of Agricultural and Environmental\
    \ Information Systems\nVolume 12 • Issue 2 • April-June 2021\n7\nvarious channels\
    \ are created for specific field parameters that represent their regular monitoring\
    \ and \nstoring of data fields with time and date. The gateway node transmits\
    \ the particular measured data to \ntheir respective channels. Table 2 represents\
    \ the sample of an observed dataset from the agricultural \nfield in the ThingSpeak\
    \ Platform. In table 2 column 1 represents the time and date of recorded instance,\
    \ \ncolumn 2 represents their entry numbers. The rest of columns represents values\
    \ of soil moisture in \npercentage (amount of water present in soil), temperature\
    \ (in degree Celsius), humidity in percentage \n(amount of moisture present in\
    \ air) and wind speed (in meters per second). The data is analyzed using \nMATLAB\
    \ in ThingSpeak cloud for calculating irregularities and predicting the results.\
    \ These data \nvalues are plotted using MATLAB for its time-based analysis in\
    \ the ground station. The agricultural \nfield data can be monitored from anywhere\
    \ at any time, remotely using web service.\n4. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe performance\
    \ of the system is realized by deploying sensor modules in the agriculture field\
    \ and \nanalyzing real-time collected in ThingSpeak IoT Platform. The hardware\
    \ setup consists of Arduino \nUno and other various sensors for collecting field\
    \ data. The hardware and software utilized for \nexperimentation are discussed\
    \ below and presented in Figure 3.\n4.1 Hardware Used\nArduino Uno Microcontroller\n\

    \ Sensor\nThe soil moisture sensor is deployed for calculating the percentage\
    \ of water quantity present in the soil. \nThe required average percentage of\

    \ The moisture sensor is used to measure \nthe percentage of water in the soil\
    \ and to transfer the collected measurement to the controller for \nmaking control\
    \ actions in terms of turning On/Off Water motors. The soil moisture sensor consists\
    \ of \ntwo attached electrodes that need to be placed in the upper layer of soil.\
    \ The soil moisture sensor is \nan analog sensor and it provides an analog output\
    \ to the controller. The output of the moisture sensor \nis converted to a digital\
    \ value (10 bit) and hence the average percentage is calculated.\nTemperature\
    \ and Humidity Sensor\nVarious crops are evolved as temperature and humidity sensitive.\
    \ DHT11 a digital sensor is utilized for \nmeasuring temperature and humidity\
    \ values. This sensor provides the early detection of temperature \nand humidity\
    \ values so that some precautionary steps or preparations can be implemented for\
    \ the \nupcoming season to increase crop production. The temperature and humidity\
    \ values play an important \nrole in deciding the accurate cultivating time of\
    \ crops. \nAir Monitoring Sensor\nFresh air is very much important for the nourishment\
    \ of crops and plants. The amount of polluted air \nmay degrade the growth or\
    \ may sick crops and plants. Therefore, the monitoring of air quality is an \n\
    important parameter for the growth of plants and crops. MQ135 air monitoring sensor\
    \ is used which \nprovides an analog output. This sensor detects the wind speed\
    \ and the presence of toxic gases in the air. \nThe output in the form of analog\
    \ is converted to 10-bit digital form and then presented in percentage.\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi\nRaspberry Pi provides the sensor interface to the gateway node and performs\
    \ computing and networking \noperations. It is the most important part of the\
    \ Internet of Things platform. It provides the wireless \ntransmission of sensed\
    \ information to the cloud so that the data can be accessed remotely. The Pi \n\
    model B is utilized for this framework which has a quad-core ARM processor, HDMI\
    \ and USB ports, \nGSM module and storage SD slot. \n4.2 Software Used\nThingSpeak\
    \ IoT Platform\nThingSpeak Cloud platform is used for the real time analysis of\
    \ ground data. This cloud platform \nprovides the facilities for processing of\
    \ data in case of any adversaries. An observed sample of ground \ndata is presented\
    \ in Table 2. It is used to plot the sensed information of field in terms of soil\
    \ moisture, \ntemperature, humidity and air quality.\nMATLAB Function\nMATLAB\
    \ function of ThingSpeak platform is utilized for presenting the comparative study\

    information such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These\
    \ sensed instances \nare transmitted to the cloud system for their timely analysis.\

    \ representation of sensed agricultural field data. The \nfield information is\
    \ visualized in real-time utilizing cloud applications. It is observed from Figure\
    \ \n4, that the field data is updated and plotted through ThingSpeak analysis.\
    \ The graph represents the \nvariation in the sensed values in different instances\
    \ and plotted accordingly. Field 1 is set for soil \nmoisture channel, field 2\
    \ corresponds to temperature channel, field 3 for humidity, and field 4 for air\
    \ \nquality measurement. The different fields update their data and stores every\
    \ upcoming value every \n3 to 6 minutes.\nThe MATLAB function of the ThingSpeak\
    \ platform is utilized and a MATLAB code is executed \nfor the visualization of\
    \ temperature comparison for three days and to find the relation between the \n\
    relative temperature and wind speed. Figure 5, presents the MATLAB based visualization\
    \ of three days \nmeasured values of temperature and relative temperature values\
    \ with wind speed. This visualization \nhelps in predicting the upcoming weather\
    \ for considering changes and implementing operations for \nimproving crop production.\
    \ In agriculture, the efficient use of water is an important factor. This system\
    \ \nmainly focuses on the effective utilization of water in agriculture along\
    \ with the weather prediction. \nThe work is mainly based on the moisture content\
    \ of the soil, and relative temperature and humidity \nvalues. This system allows\
    \ a sufficient supply of water to the agriculture field and accurate prediction\
    \ \nof weather for increasing the crop yields. \nThe prediction of upcoming weather\
    \ plays an important role in maximizing crop yields. The \nproposed system based\
    \ on the MATLAB analysis of recently recorded temperature values of three \ndays\
    \ predicts the weather report. Figure 6, presents the histogram of temperature\
    \ variation at different \ntemperature ranges. The weather prediction is calculated\
    \ using the MATLAB analysis of recorded \ntemperature values. \nFigure 4. Generated\

    \ and this further helps in \npredicting the percentage of moisture content in\
    \ soil for the coming days. Weather prediction helps \nin calculating the percentage\

    \ user through notification whenever the soil is in dry condition means high resistance.\
    \ Based on \nthe threshold values of moisture sensor an automatic operation of\
    \ soil irrigation through water motor \nis initiated. \nThe soil moisture content\
    \ varies for different types of agricultural fields. The designed system is \n\
    capable of pumping water to the field whenever required. The automated operation\
    \ of the water motor \nturns off automatically when the percentage wet level of\

    \ system is capable of \nproviding continuous monitoring of the agricultural field\
    \ and triggers the operation of the motor as \nper the requirement. The performance\
    \ of the system is evaluated considering two major performance \nmetrics. Average\
    \ response time and standard deviation at the same cloud platform and different\
    \ cloud \nplatforms. The response time and standard deviation are measured for\
    \ the same clod platform and \ndifferent cloud platforms for the evaluation of\
    \ the overall system’s performance.\nTable 3, presents the analysis of the proposed\
    \ framework for average response time and standard \ndeviation at the same cloud\
    \ and different cloud platforms. The observed standard deviation and \nresponse\
    \ time of the system for the same clout platform are 10.63 milliseconds and 13.57\
    \ milliseconds. \nSimilarly, for different cloud systems, the standard deviation\
    \ and response time are recorded as 16.24 \nmilliseconds and 25.17 milliseconds.\
    \ These observed results are compared with other cloud-based \napproaches (Reche\
    \ et al., 2014; Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) and it is analyzed that the performance\
    \ of \nthe proposed framework is better than others and concludes that the system\
    \ is efficient for continuous \nmonitoring of agricultural fields.\n6. CoNCLUSIoN\n\
    In this paper, a framework for agricultural field monitoring and irrigation control\
    \ is proposed \nusing the concept of IoT. Internet of Things provides an efficient\
    \ solution for smart agriculture and \nproves its importance for helping farmers\
    \ by increasing the overall productivity. This framework is \ndesigned using sensor\
    \ networks and cloud platforms for storing and analyzing data in real-time. The\
    \ \nsystem senses different field information like soil moisture, temperature,\

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations

  explanation: 'The study investigated the potential of using automated, real-time
    irrigation management systems to improve water and agricultural productivity.
    The researchers set up a field experiment at a farm in Zimbabwe, comparing the
    performance of a newly developed wireless-based irrigation system to three conventional
    irrigation methods: manual scheduling, tensiometer-based scheduling, and weather-based
    scheduling. The wireless-based system used a locally designed soil moisture sensor,
    and data from the sensors was transmitted to a base station controller. The base
    station processed the data and operated relays that controlled the opening and
    closing of electronic valves to regulate water flow. The study found that the
    wireless-based irrigation system saved up to 25% more water compared to typical

    1. Introduction\nGlobally, the demand for freshwater resources has been in-\n\
    creasing, largely driven by a growing population, industrial\nexpansion, and agricultural\
    \ production [1]. When considered\ntemporally and spatially, there are large variations\
    \ in the\navailability of fresh water across diferent regions of the world. In\n\
    Sub-Saharan Africa, it has been observed that the average rainfall\nreceived in\
    \ semiarid zones has been on the decline in the last two\ndecades. Tis is largely\
    \ attributed to the upsurge in drought years\nas a result of climate change and\
    \ global warming [2].\nTe inclement weather conditions characterizing the\nSub-Saharan\
    \ Africa region necessitated investments in ir-\nrigated agriculture [3–5]. Given\
    \ that the bulk of existing\nirrigation systems in small-scale farming is traditional\
    \ food,\nwater canals, and sprinkler systems, high rates of water loss\nhave been\
    \ experienced. For instance, a study of Mutorahuku\nirrigation scheme showed that\
    \ approximately 8m3/hr of\nwater was lost due to damaged canals [6]. Tis is further\n\
    exacerbated by the observation that irrigators assume that\nthe water requirement\
    \ of each plant across a feld is the same\nand ignore diferences in crop water\
    \ requirements due to\nHindawi\nAdvances in Agriculture\nVolume 2022, Article\
    \ ID 8820764, 11 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8820764\nspatial factors,\
    \ which include plant genetics, soil type, and\ntopography [7–9], resulting in\
    \ a blanket application of water.\nSuch anecdotes give credence to the need to\
    \ improve water\nuse eﬃciency in smallholder irrigation systems [10, 11].\nFurthermore,\
    \ eﬃcient water management strategies become\nnecessary to improve agricultural\
    \ productivity to meet food\ndemands for a growing population.\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is often identiﬁed as a solution\nto the myriads of ineﬃciencies related to\
    \ water, fertilizer,\nand herbicide use [12, 13]. Irrigation scheduling, in\n\
    particular, aﬀords farmers the opportunity to use scarce\nwater resources in an\
    \ optimal manner [14, 15]. Over the\nyears, numerous irrigation scheduling techniques\
    \ have\nbeen developed, ranging from satellite-based/arial, soil-\nbased [16–19],\
    \ and microwave-based sensors to those\nbased on evapotranspiration [20, 21].\
    \ However, most of\nthese approaches are implemented in the developed\ncountry\
    \ context, with limited literature for developing\ncountries.\nSeveral authors\
    \ [22–24] also focused on control systems,\nwhich are based on the prediction\
    \ of soil moisture content\nand atmospheric conditions, but without much attention\
    \ to\ndeveloping intelligent agriculture systems that are less costly\nand eﬃcient\
    \ in terms of water and energy use.\nTis paper focuses on wireless-based sensor\
    \ systems for\ncommercial irrigated wheat production at the University of\nZimbabwe\
    \ Farm. Wireless sensor systems and real-time soil\nmoisture data for irrigation\
    \ control are a potential solution\nto the optimization of water application.\
    \ Typically, this is\nachieved by remotely accessing in-ﬁeld soil water conditions\n\
    and\nsite\nspeciﬁcally\ncontrolling\nirrigation\napplicators\n[25–27]. Previous\
    \ studies have demonstrated that optimal\nsensor placement in the ﬁeld can be\
    \ achieved through di-\nviding the ﬁeld into management zones using Electromag-\n\
    netic (EM) mapping [28]. EM mapping allows for the\nsimultaneous collection of\
    \ geo-referenced apparent soil elec-\ntrical conductivity and accurate elevation\
    \ data that can be\ninterpolated to yield a relationship between soil and ﬁeld\
    \ el-\nevation, which reﬂects on the water storage and movement.\nTe aims of this\
    \ paper are twofold: (i) to determine the eﬀect of\nthe wireless-based sensor\
    \ technology or wireless sensor net-\nworks (WSNs) in irrigated wheat on water\
    \ use eﬃciency and\n(ii) to compare the yield of wheat crop between a control\n\
    system using the conventional irrigation system and the\nproposed new treatment\
    \ (wireless sensor technology).\nWSNs comprise systems with radio frequency (RF)\n\
    transceivers, sensing devices, controllers, and power sources\n[29]. Advances\
    \ in wireless sensor technology have brought\nabout the development of multifunctional\
    \ sensor nodes that\nare aﬀordable and use less power. Sensor nodes in a network\n\
    are capable of performing some data processing and the\ngathering of sensory information\
    \ that can be communicated\nwith other connected nodes in the given network. Many\n\
    types of sensors are available, including those that can sense\nphysical properties\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pressure,\nmoisture content, or radiation. Tese\
    \ allow monitoring of\ndiﬀerent environments and are capable of networking with\n\
    other sensor systems for the purposes of exchanging data\nwith external users\
    \ [30, 31].\nWSNs are used for gathering the information needed by\nintelligent\
    \ systems, smart cities, industrial applications, or\nsmart healthcare just to\
    \ mention a few [32, 33]. WSNs\nsupport deployment of networks while covering\
    \ commu-\nnication needs with ﬂexibility in time and space without the\nrequirement\
    \ for a ﬁxed infrastructure [34]. Currently, there\nare several wireless technologies\
    \ that are available on the\nmarket. Tese are ZigBee, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth, which\
    \ enable\neasier deployment compared to wired ones, thus avoiding\nany need to\
    \ wire building structures, and thus decrease the\ncosts and drawbacks normally\
    \ associated with the setup\nphase. Te wide possibilities provided by WSNs actually\n\
    allow developing a wide range of applications that include\nenergy cost control,\
    \ ability to monitor environmental data,\nsecurity and control of access environments,\
    \ among others\n[35]. In this regard, sensing actually makes it possible to\n\
    obtain information about the users and their environment.\nTis allows oﬀering\
    \ users customized online services with\nrespect to the state of their environment.\n\
    Another advantage of using wireless transmission is the\nconsiderable reduction\
    \ and simpliﬁed wiring over and\nabove, saving the cost of the wires. Wireless\
    \ sensors also\nallow users to collect data from otherwise impractical sensor\n\
    applications such as keeping a check on hazardous, unwired,\nor remote locations.\
    \ Wireless sensor technology contributes\nextensive installation pliability for\
    \ sensors and an improved\nnetwork robustness [36, 37]. Furthermore, an added\
    \ ad-\nvantage of using wireless sensor technology is the trans-\nportability\
    \ of the sensors, as they can be moved around in\nvehicles to monitor the environment\
    \ “on-the-go.” In ad-\ndition, wireless sensor technology lessens the maintenance\n\
    diﬃculties and costs incurred. Transmission of signals in\ndigital form ensures\
    \ that the noise pickup is minimum, and\nthis becomes a less serious problem.\
    \ Consequently, wireless\nsensors have been deployed in agriculture to aid with\
    \ site-\nspeciﬁc application of irrigation to crops in the ﬁeld.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nIn this section, we present the design of wirelessly connected\n\
    soil sensors for automated irrigation control. Subsequently,\nwe present the ﬁeld\
    \ testing of the sensor in comparison with\nother known sensors and methods of\
    \ irrigation scheduling.\n2.1. Experimental Design and Setup. Field experiments\
    \ were\nconducted on winter wheat at a Research and Development\nstation of the\
    \ University of Zimbabwe, situated at a farm on\nthe north of Harare city during\
    \ the 2016, 2017, and 2018\nwinter seasons. Te topography is mainly a plain ﬁeld\
    \ with\nless than 8 per cent in-ﬁeld elevation diﬀerences that result\nin ponding\
    \ of lower elevation areas. Soils are mostly clay\nloam, and these are inﬂuenced\
    \ by the variability of a ﬂuc-\ntuating water table both in space and time. Although\n\
    electrical conductivity (EM) surveys were not carried out to\nquantify soil variability\
    \ largely based on soil texture and\nmoisture content, an equally versatile method\
    \ of grid\nsampling was used to divide the ﬁeld into management\nzones [38]. After\
    \ spatial data analysis, the soil and land\n2\nAdvances in Agriculture\nsurface\
    \ were partitioned into 3 classes (zones) using the\nk-means clustering algorithm.\
    \ In order to carry out the\ninvestigation of irrigation scheduling, a ﬁeld capacity\
    \ (FC)\nindex was adopted corresponding to speciﬁc irrigation\nthresholds. Irrigation\
    \ scheduling occurred when root zone\nsoil moisture was depleted by the crop with\
    \ the speciﬁc\nthresholds initially set.\nA plot design with 0.25-hectare ﬁeld\
    \ under drip irri-\ngation was developed and implemented to test whether a\nnew\
    \ wireless-based irrigation system performed better than\nconventional irrigation\
    \ methods in terms of water use ef-\nﬁciency and yield. It was hypothesized that,\
    \ compared to\nconventional methods, this automated system could send\ncontinuous\
    \ soil moisture data to a base station programmed\nto open and close valves when\
    \ irrigation was necessary, and\nsigniﬁcant water use savings would be achieved\
    \ without\ncompromising yield. To test this hypothesis, seven irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ were set up on the plot as shown in Table 1, with\neach treatment having three\
    \ replicates. Te seven types of\nirrigation treatments for drip irrigation presented\
    \ in the\ntable show the type of sensor and irrigation set points used in\nthis\
    \ research.\nTe treatments were applied to wheat plants belonging to\na local\
    \ variety of wheat (SC Nduna). Tis variety was chosen\nbecause a local commercial\
    \ seed company (Seed Co. Zim-\nbabwe) recommended it based on its superior performance\n\
    in terms of yield.\n2.2. Wirelessly Connected Soil Sensor System. Te architec-\n\
    ture used to implement the wirelessly connected soil sensor-\nbased system is\
    \ shown in Figure 1. Te system had a low cost,\nlocally designed (Munyaradzi M.\
    \ and Masocha M., Uni-\nversity of Zimbabwe, Deed of Assignment 2020) soil\nmoisture\
    \ sensor, which gave a reliable performance for the\napplication under consideration.\n\
    Te automated system implemented used an ATme-\nga328P microcontroller. Te data\
    \ read by the sensors would\nbe relayed to wireless sensor nodes deployed in the\
    \ plot\nbefore being routed to a base station controller housed in a\npump house\
    \ some 130m away from the nearest node. Te\nbase station controller carried out\
    \ the local processing and\nanalysis needed to predict crop water requirements\
    \ before\noperating relays that control the opening of electronic valves\nallowing\
    \ water to ﬂow to the ﬁeld. Processed information\nfrom the base station is transferred\
    \ to a Web or mobile\ndevice via a GSM/GPRS module. Te hardware settings are\n\
    elaborated in the following section.\n2.3. Hardware Settings. Te WCSS system employs\
    \ some\nsensors for gathering data from the environment and in turn\ntransfers\
    \ it to sensor nodes for further transmission to a local\nbase station. A GSM\
    \ module SIM808 was used to transfer the\nvalues to a mobile/Web server. A data\
    \ SIM card was inserted\nin it to enable real-time data transportation. A resistance\n\
    sensor was used for soil moisture measurement, while for air\nmoisture, an AM2302\
    \ DHT22 (temperature/humidity)\nsensor was used. Teir details are described as\
    \ follows.\n2.3.1. Wireless Sensor Nodes. Te wireless sensor nodes used\nin this\
    \ study operated on license-free radio frequency\n(2.4 GHz) with mesh networking\
    \ capability to assure re-\ndundancy of the communication path with the base station\n\
    in the event of another node’s failure. Tese wireless sensor\nnodes comprised\
    \ the sensors, a microcontroller, RF module,\nand a solar power source with a\
    \ battery that could operate\nwithout sunlight for up to three weeks. Figure 2\
    \ shows a solar\npowered sensor node in the wheat ﬁeld.\n2.3.2. Base Station Controller.\
    \ Te Base Station controlled\nthe electronic valves through which the diﬀerent\
    \ treatments\nwere irrigated. Figure 3 shows a wireless base station in the\n\
    control room. Raspberry pi3 was used to connect to sensor\nnodes through ZigBee\
    \ protocol and to users through the\nInternet or GSM/GPRS module. Mobile interface\
    \ and Web\ninterface provided remote monitoring of the treatments. An\nXBee module\
    \ was conﬁgured as coordinator within the\nRaspberry Pi and connected to the XBee\
    \ module via a USB\ncable. Te Raspberry Pi’s MySQL database received data sent\n\
    by the sensor nodes in the ﬁeld for local processing. For this\nirrigation method,\
    \ two values were programmed to open at\n415 millivolts (mV) and 450 mV, respectively.\
    \ Te two\ntreatment levels are hereafter referred to as WCSS415 and\nWCSS450.\n\
    2.3.3. Locally Built Soil Moisture Sensor. For the detection of\nsoil moisture\
    \ content, we used a locally built resistance\nmoisture sensor. Figure 4 shows\
    \ the soil moisture sensor.\nTe purpose of using the resistance moisture sensor\
    \ was due\nto its low cost nature, and comparable accuracy to other\nexisting\
    \ expensive soil moisture sensors. Tis sensor was\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ of soil moisture content in our\nexperimental setup. Te output voltages of the\
    \ sensors varied\naccording to the amount of water in the soil. If there was\n\
    high moisture content in the soil, the output voltage would\ndecrease, but if\
    \ there was soil moisture depletion, the output\nvoltage would increase. Te soil\
    \ moisture sensor output\nsignal was analog in nature, and a conversion to digital\
    \ was\ndone by the microcontroller. Te processed output was then\nused to control\
    \ the water application through electronic\nvalves. Soil moisture sensors were\
    \ attached to the wireless\nsensor nodes to measure soil moisture at a depth of\
    \ between\n20 mm and 30 mm. Soil moisture measurement was im-\nportant in order\
    \ to obtain information with regard to the\nexact amount of water required to\
    \ irrigate the wheat crop.\n2.3.4. AM2302 DHT22 Sensor. Te DHT22 sensor is a\n\
    common temperature-humidity sensor used to determine\ntemperature and humidity\
    \ in the air (Figure 5). Te DHT22\nsensors are made up of two parts: a humidity\
    \ sensor and a\ntemperature sensor. Te DHT22 sensor is a low-cost device,\nwhich\
    \ is good for 0–100% humidity readings (2–5% accu-\nracy) and good for −40 to\
    \ 80°C temperature readings of\n±0.5°C accuracy. Te DHT22 sensor consumes a maximum\n\
    of 2.5 mA while requesting data and has a body size of\napproximately 15.1 mm\
    \ × 25 m × 7.7 mm, of which 4 pins\nAdvances in Agriculture\n3\nhave 0.1 mm spacing\
    \ between them. Tese variables were\nmeasured at 15-minute intervals and relayed\

    \ water.\n2.4. Manual Human Scheduling (TFP). For typical farmer\npractice (TFP),\
    \ a ﬁeld is irrigated 12 hours per week as\nfollows: 4 hours every Monday, 4 hours\
    \ every Tursday, and\n4 hours every Saturday starting at 1000 hours. At each ir-\n\
    rigation event, one liter of water is applied over an hour from\neach emitter.\
    \ Tere were 82 standard emitters spaced 30 cm\napart in a line. In this experiment,\
    \ there were seven treat-\nments, and each had three replications.\n2.5. Tensiometer\
    \ Irrigation Treatment (T10 and T25). In this\nﬁeld experiment, two tensiometer\
    \ treatments were used for\nautomated irrigation. Irrigation was triggered at\
    \ two suction\nthresholds, that is, 10 kPa and 25 kPa. Tus, this treatment\nhad\
    \ two levels, hereafter referred to as T10 and T25 corre-\nsponding to the two\
    \ suction thresholds. Te total amount of\nwater used per drip line for T10 and\
    \ T25 was 13776 liters and\n14108 liters, respectively, for the 2016 season, followed\
    \ by\n14672 liters and 14289 liters, respectively, for the 2017\nseason, and ﬁnally\
    \ 13967 liters and 14178 liters, respectively,\nfor the 2018 season.\n2.6. Evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) Irrigation Treatment (ETc0.75\nand ETc1.0). Te crop water requirement\
    \ is also called crop\nevapotranspiration and is usually represented as ETc.\n\
    Evapotranspiration combines evaporation of water from\nthe ground surface or wet\
    \ surfaces of plants and tran-\nspiration of water through the stomata of leaves.\
    \ Te water\nrequirement can be supplied by stored soil water, pre-\ncipitation,\
    \ and irrigation. Irrigation is required when ETc\n(crop water demand) exceeds\
    \ the supply of water from soil\nwater and precipitation. As ETc varies with plant\
    \ devel-\nopment stage and weather conditions, both the amount\nand timing of\
    \ irrigation are important. Estimates of ETc\ncan be included in a simple water\
    \ balance (accounting)\nmethod of irrigation scheduling to estimate the required\n\
    amount and timing of irrigation for crops. Tis method\ncan be used if initial\
    \ soil water content in the root zone,\nETc, precipitation, and the available\
    \ water capacity of the\nsoil are known.\nTe weather-based drip irrigation method\
    \ (Figure 6) also\ncomprised two treatment levels. For this method, an au-\ntomatic\
    \ weather station was installed at a site located about\n300 m from the experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. Te relays were set to\ntrigger and open the valves at two thresholds,\
    \ that is, crop\nevapotranspiration (ETc = 0.75), here called ETc0.75, and\n(ETc\
    \ = 1.0), here called ETc1.0. Tese treatments are referred\nto as ETc0.7and ETc1.0.\
    \ In a season, the total amount of water\napplied per drip line for (ETc = 0.75)\
    \ and (ETc = 1.0) was\n15350 liters and 13985 liters, respectively, for the 2016\n\
    season, followed by 16531 liters and 13450 liters, respec-\ntively, for the 2017\
    \ season, and 15190 liters and 14896 liters,\nrespectively, for the 2018 season.\n\
    2.7. Seeding and Fertilizer Application Rates. Te crop was\nplanted at a seed\
    \ rate of 150 kgs/ha. Tere were three\nreplicates for each of the treatments.\
    \ Drilling method was\nused for planting at a rate of 2.2 kg of seed per each\n\
    treatment with three replicates in rows 25m long. An\ninterrow spacing of 0.30\
    \ m was used. Preplant dry fer-\ntilizer (compound D) was broadcasted at a 1860\
    \ kg/ha to\neach row of the treatments together with the seed. Fig-\nure 7 illustrates\
    \ the rows that were 25m long. Irrigation\nwas supplied with drip lines (T-TAPE\
    \ TS × 508-12-450,\nT-systems International, Calif with 0.015-m internal\ndiameter,\
    \ 0.30 m emitter spacing, 1.0-L/h emitter dis-\ncharge at 69 kPa, and 0.002-m\
    \ thickness) approximately\n0.50 m apart on either side of the wheat row. Planting\
    \ was\ndone between the 7th and 9th of July for all three seasons\n2016, 2017,\
    \ and 2018. A uniform amount of water was\napplied to both tensiometer treatments\
    \ in the ﬁrst two\nweeks\nof\nplanting.\nTereafter,\nirrigation\noccurred\naccording\
    \ to the threshold levels set on the tensiometers.\nAfter ﬁve weeks, urea fertilizer\
    \ was broadcasted to each\nrow of the two treatments at a rate of 1720 kg per\
    \ hectare.\nWater application was terminated two weeks before\nharvesting the\
    \ wheat crop.\n2.8. Field Installation and Test on Wheat Crop. Te drip\nirrigation\
    \ ﬁeld test and winter wheat crop layout are given in\nFigure 7.\n3. Results\n\
    3.1. Plant Height. Figure 8 shows the achieved average plant\nheight (cm) for\
    \ all treatments in the three seasons for drip\nirrigation. WCSS450 and WCSS415\
    \ treatment had the highest\nplant heights at 76.7 cm and 75.56 cm, respectively.\
    \ Te\nETC1.0 had the lowest average plant height at 71.73 cm over\nthe three seasons.\
    \ Tis shows that our Wirelessly Connected\nSoil Sensor (WCSS) design had the largest\
    \ average plant\nheight over the three seasons. It is, however, important to\n\
    note that the average plant height for all treatments was very\nclose, and none\
    \ of the treatments caused stunted growth.\n3.1.1. Irrigation Water Use Eﬃciency\

    \ 9 shows a\nplot of the amount of water used to produce a kilogram of\nyield\
    \ versus the various treatments for the 2016, 2017, and\n2018 seasons.\nTe WCSS415\
    \ treatment was associated with the least\namount of water (1.54 kg/m3, 1.41 kg/m3,\
    \ and 1.4 kg/m3) in\nthe three years 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Tis\n\
    translates to an average water use eﬃciency of 1.45 kg/m3. It\nwas closely followed\
    \ by the WCSS450 treatment, which had\n1.436 kg/m3. Te ETC0.75 treatment had the\
    \ least water use\neﬃciency at 1.133 kg/m3, which was even lower than the\nfarmer\
    \ practice or control (TFP) at 1.19 kg/m3. All other\nautomation treatments had\
    \ higher water use eﬃciency when\ncompared with the control.\nTese results were\
    \ further conﬁrmed by one-way anal-\nysis of variance (ANOVA). When compared to\
    \ farmer\npractice (TFP), both wireless connected soil moisture sensors\n(WCSS415\
    \ and WCSS450) were more eﬃcient in terms of\nwater use (p < 0.005). Similarly,\
    \ WCSS415 and WCSS450 were\nmore eﬃcient\nwhen\ncompared\nwith\nETc0.75 ETc1.00\n\
    (p < 0.005). Te mean for WCSS415 versus tensiometer at\n25kpa (T25) was statistically\
    \ diﬀerent (p \x88 0.016), while\nWCSS450\nagainst\nT25\nwas\nalso\nstatistically\n\
    diﬀerent\n(p \x88 0.041). Tis indicates that WCSS system performed\nbetter than\
    \ all other treatments in terms of water use eﬃ-\nciency. Both WCSS415 and WCSS450\
    \ versus T10 showed that\nthere were no statistical diﬀerences in the average\
    \ values\nwith p values of 0.209 and 0.306, respectively. Tis implies\nthat the\
    \ tensiometer at 10 kPa performed well in terms of\nwater use eﬃciency.\n3.2.\
    \ Yield. Figure 10 indicates that high yields were obtained\nfrom all treatments\
    \ with no signiﬁcant diﬀerence to tradi-\ntional farmer practice for all three\
    \ seasons. Average yields for\nwinter wheat in Zimbabwe range between 1 ton/ha\
    \ and 7\ntons/ha (Farm Management Handbook, V1-43), with the\nyields for all treatments\
    \ falling within the expected range.\nTe WCSS415 and WCSS450treatments’ average\
    \ yields at\n3.26 tons/ha and 3.24 ton/ha were slightly higher than the\nyields\
    \ for other treatments for the three seasons.\nAn ANOVA test was also used to\
    \ test for diﬀerences in\nobserved average yields. Te comparison of WCSS415 and\n\
    WCSS450 versus farmer practice (TFP) showed no statistical\ndiﬀerence in the mean\
    \ yield for both WCSS treatments with\np values of 0.916 and 0.979, respectively.\
    \ Tis result was at\nvariance with our a priori expectation with respect to yield.\n\
    Tis could have been as a result of system breakdowns that\noccurred in the WCSS\
    \ treatments during the experimental\nseasons. Nonetheless, the WCSS system still\
    \ performed\nbetter than TFP in terms of IWUE.\nFurther\nanalysis\nindicated\n\
    that\nWCSS415\nand\nWCSS450were similar to T10 in terms of average yield with\
    \ p\nvalues of 0.523 and 0.714, respectively. A possible expla-\nnation to this\
    \ is related to the intermittent breakdowns that\noccurred in WCSS treatments\
    \ between seasons when the\nexperiment was being carried out. In addition, Qualia\
    \ birds\nwere also always a menace some weeks before wheat harvest\nat the end\
    \ of each season, thus reducing the yield.\nComparison of both WCSS415 and WCSS450\
    \ versus evapo-\ntranspiration treatments (ETc0.75 ETc1.00) yielded p ≤ 0.001,\n\
    meaning that the means were statistically diﬀerent. WCSS415\nversus T25 also showed\
    \ averages that were statistically dif-\nferent with p-value of 0.012, while WCSS450\
    \ against T25 gave\na statistical diﬀerence with p-value of 0.028. Tis shows that\n\
    WCSS system performed better than all these other treat-\nments in terms of yield.\n\
    4. Discussion\nTe main objective of this research was to assess the\nperformance\n\
    of\nwireless\nsensor\nconnected\nsystems\n(WCSS), viz-a-vis other methods, that\
    \ includes tradi-\ntional farmer practice, in terms of IWUE, yield, and plant\n\
    height. Te analysis should be understood in a national\ncontext where the country\
    \ requires about 400,000 tons of\nwheat with the current production level of approximately\n\
    180,000 tons per year [39]. Furthermore, the country has\nbeen increasingly faced\
    \ with erratic rainfall patterns due\nto climate change. Terefore, the need to\
    \ increase input\neﬃciency in cropping systems is a critical component in\nincreasing\
    \ national agricultural throughput.\nStudy ﬁndings showed that wirelessly connected\
    \ sensor\nsystems (WCSS) performed better than other irrigation\nscheduling methods\
    \ used locally in terms of water use ef-\nﬁciency. Average IWUE indices associated\
    \ with WCSS415\nand WCSS450were 17% higher than TFP. Comparable results\nhave\
    \ been found in Sub-Saharan Africa. For example, a study\nin Ethiopia indicated\
    \ that the use of wireless sensors in\nmaize-based systems achieved signiﬁcant\
    \ gains compared to\nmethods anchored on evapotranspiration. IWUE values\nachieved\
    \ are comparable to those that have been obtained in\nother parts of the globe\
    \ [40]. It has been reported that,\ngenerally, wheat IWUE ranges between 0.40\
    \ and 1.83 kg/m3\nglobally when considering yield. For example, irrigation\nwater\
    \ use eﬃciency values of 0.70–1.51 kg/m3 were reported\nin North China Plain [41,\
    \ 42]. High IWUE values are quite\nimportant for farmers and other irrigation\
    \ agencies in areas\nthat have water scarcity. It could be argued that WCSS\n\
    resulted in precise water availability in the root zone and\nthus a positive eﬀect\
    \ on crop growth. By providing the water\nneeded by the crop based on temporal\
    \ and geographical\nscales, the WCSS system produced higher yields than the\n\
    farmer practice (TFP).\nOne of the major factors to consider is the economic\n\
    implication of the type of irrigation used by the farmer. As\nreported in the\
    \ results section, the average irrigation water\nuse eﬃciency (IWUE) for the wireless\
    \ connected sensor\nsystems (WCSS) treatment was higher than that of other\ntreatments.\
    \ On average, WCSS saved up to 25% water\ncompared to typical ﬁxed irrigation\
    \ schedule rates used by\nwheat growers during the winter growing season [43].\
    \ Tis\nimplies that wheat farmers can save about 0.15 USD per kg\nor 450 USD to\
    \ produce about 3 tons of wheat per hectare.\nResults on IWUE also showed that\
    \ high values could be\nrealized either by saving water using WCSS drip irrigation\n\
    system or simply improving yield through optimized uti-\nlization of water. Te\
    \ cost saving associated with the use of\nAdvances in Agriculture\n7\nWCSS is\
    \ likely to increase the probability of long-term\nadoption by commercial wheat\
    \ farmers in the country.\nTere were small diﬀerences in yield between the treatment\n\
    and control across the three seasons. In this regard, WCSS415 and\nWCSS450 had\
    \ 2.14% and 15% higher wheat yield than the TFP. A\nnumber of previous wireless\
    \ sensor-based studies have achieved\nvarying levels of yield increases depending\
    \ on the context. In\ntheir analysis conducted in Texas, onion yields were 93%\
    \ higher\nfor the drip irrigation system compared to the ﬂood irrigation\nsystem\
    \ [44]. It was observed that the earlier ensured that water\navailability had\
    \ been synchronized with the underlying crop\nwater needs. In our study, there\
    \ were external factors that could\nhave resulted in low wheat yield diﬀerence\
    \ across treatments.\nQualia birds were a constant menace in the early stages\
    \ of grain\nﬁlling and could also have a contribution in reducing harvestable\n\
    yield. Te diﬀerences in yield among all treatments could also be\nattributed to\
    \ yield decrease with crop stress, especially in the\ninitial stages when it becomes\
    \ diﬃcult for plant roots to extract\nadequate soil water from considerable depth,\
    \ thus restricting its\nwater uptake capability [45]. Te result is that plant\
    \ growth and\nyield are aﬀected.\nIn wheat production, plant height is an important\
    \ parameter\nthat aﬀects grain potential and other characteristics including\n\
    spike length [46–52]. Findings from this research revealed that\nWCSS450 had the\
    \ highest plant height, while ETC1.0 had the\naverage lowest plant height at 71.73cm\
    \ over the three seasons.\nAlthough no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in\
    \ terms of\nplant height across treatments, this parameter has been shown to\n\
    have a positive eﬀect on wheat grain yield [53]. Moreover, wheat\nresidues can\
    \ also be used for other purposes such as cattle feed\nand bedding for livestock.\
    \ Tis enhances the linkages between\nthe crop and livestock sectors on the farm\
    \ [54, 55].\nTe main aim of this research was to design a low cost,\nwirelessly\
    \ connected, automated controller with soil moisture\nsensors for irrigation scheduling.\
    \ Te researchers designed and\nconstructed a reliable low cost intelligent controller\
    \ that is af-\nfordable by low-income farmers. Te results of this research are\n\
    similar to those of [56–58] who concluded that information-\nbased irrigation\
    \ scheduling is inevitable for tightening the\nspatial-temporal variability of\
    \ the ﬁeld in the advent of global\nwarming. Te control system developed was made\
    \ from cheap\noﬀ-shelf components found abundantly in local laboratory\nstores\
    \ and electronic retail shops with the potential to provide\nmaximum water use\
    \ eﬃciency by monitoring soil moisture at\noptimum levels. Tis is in sync with\
    \ [59–61] among others, who\nfound a 50% reduction in water use in tomato plants\
    \ using soil\nwater-based automatic irrigation system in comparison to daily\n\
    manually irrigated treatments.\n5. Conclusion\nTraditional irrigation schemes\
    \ found in Sub-Saharan Africa\ngenerally have a ﬁxed supply of water irrespective\
    \ of crops,\ntheir stage of growth, and underlying soil conditions. In this\n\
    study, an experiment was carried out to evaluate the per-\nformance of a new wirelessly\
    \ connected sensor system, for\ndrip irrigation scheduling, and its eﬀects on\
    \ plant height,\nirrigation water use eﬃciency, and yield of winter wheat\ncompared\
    \ to other irrigation scheduling methods that are\nnormally used by farmers in\
    \ the region. Te results obtained\nshow that irrigation scheduling methods had\
    \ notable eﬀects\non growth and the yield of winter wheat. Te newly designed\n\
    automatic irrigation controller treatments, WCSS415 and\nWCSS450, respectively,\
    \ used much less water compared to\nother irrigation treatments employed in this\
    \ research. WCSS\nsaved up to 25% water on average, while maintaining yields\n\
    compared to typical ﬁxed irrigation schedule rates used by\nwheat growers during\
    \ the winter season. Considering the\nnecessity for water saving and to achieve\
    \ sustainable food\nproduction, it becomes prudent for irrigation managers to\n\
    move from rigid irrigation delivery schedules to more\nﬂexible delivery systems\
    \ that are more eﬃcient. WCSS ir-\nrigation scheduling also gave higher wheat\
    \ average yield\ncompared with other irrigation scheduling methods (+8%,\n+15%,\
    \ and +29% for typical ﬁxed farmer practice, tensi-\nometer, and weather-based\
    \ treatments, respectively). A\n2.70\n2.80\n2.90\n3.00\n3.10\n3.20\n3.30\nT10\n\

    \ noticed for irrigation water use\neﬃciency (+25%, +12%, and +30%, respectively).\
    \ Tis in-\nnovation is appropriate for both small-scale and large-scale\ncommercial\
    \ wheat growers as it can be manufactured using\nlocally available materials such\
    \ as scrap metal. Given the\nintermittent power cuts in the country, the WCSS\
    \ sensors\nshould ideally use a stable and green source of energy such as\nsolar\
    \ power. In addition, farmers must have a basic un-\nderstanding of how to use\
    \ such an ICT based irrigation. It\ntherefore\nbecomes\nimportant\nto\nprovide\n\
    appropriate\ntraining schedules for wheat farmers to increase ICT literacy.\n\
    5.1. Future Work. In this study, we have been able to im-\nplement wireless technologies\
    \ and Internet of Tings (IoT)\nfor eﬃcient irrigation of a wheat crop in Sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa.\nAs for future work, research work must continue with more\nﬁeld trials\
    \ in order to prove that precision irrigation can\nprovide\ngreater\nbeneﬁts\n\
    than\nconventional\nirrigation\nscheduling. Te combination of wireless sensor\
    \ technologies\n(IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence, and Cloud Computing should\nprovide\
    \ a precision irrigation system with robust and low-\ncost sensing capabilities,\
    \ identiﬁcation of sensing locations,\ndata gathering, and eﬃcient transfer for\
    \ storage and pro-\ncessing. In addition, more research work has to focus on an\n\
    improved optimization model in order to further reduce the\nwater usage.\nData\

  explanation: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can collect data from the field and
    are used in a variety of precision agriculture (PA) applications, such as monitoring
    soil moisture, temperature, and plant health. Specifically, WSNs can be used to
    deploy a heterogeneous network of IoT sensors to collect real-time data on soil
    moisture (e.g., capacitive, tensiometric), temperature (e.g., thermocouples, thermistors),
    humidity (e.g., capacitive, resistive), and plant health (e.g., sap flow, leaf
    wetness).

    \ \nAbstract—The present state of agriculture and its demand is \nvery much different\
    \ than what it used to be two decades back. \nHence, Precision Agriculture (PA)\
    \ is more in demand to address \nthis challenging demand. With consistent pressure\
    \ to develop \nmultiple products over the same agricultural land, farmers find\
    \ \nPA’s adoption the best rescue-based solution with restricted \nresources.\
    \ PA accelerates the yield and potentially assists in \ncatering up the demand\
    \ of scarcity of demands of food. With the \nincreasing adoption of PA-based technologies\
    \ over farming, there \nare best possibilities to explore efficient farming practices\
    \ and \nbetter decision-making facilitated by real-time data availability. \n\
    There isan evolution of various novel technologies to boost \nagricultural \n\
    performance, \ni.e. \nvariable \nrate \ntechnology, \nGeomapping, remote sensing,\
    \ automated steering system, and \nsatellite positioning system. Apart from this,\
    \ it is also observed \nthat Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Network\
    \ \n(WSN) have been slowly penetrating this area to acceleratePA's \ntechnological\
    \ advancement. It is noticed that the adoption of \nsensing technology is a common\
    \ factor in almost all the \ntechniques used in PA. However, there is no clear\
    \ idea about the \nmost dominant approach in this regard. Therefore, this paper\
    \ \ndiscusses existing approaches concerning standard conventional \nPA and sensing-based\
    \ PA using WSN. The study contributes \ntowards some impressive learning outcomes\
    \ to state that WSN \nand IoT are extensive to boost PA. \nKeywords—Precision\
    \ agriculture; smart farming; wireless \nsensor network; internet-of-things; remote\
    \ sensing; variable rate \ntechnology \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nTechnological advancement\
    \ has penetrated agriculture in \nthe present time, right from small to large\
    \ scale farming [1]. \nTwo decades back, the Global Positioning System (GPS) usage\
    \ \npermits the farmers to collect necessary farming data, which \nfacilitates\
    \ autonomous steering control system development \n[2]. However, the present times\
    \ make use of more advanced \ntechnologies, e.g., fixed solutions for Internet-of-Things\
    \ (IoT), \naerial devices, sensors, etc., to carve the progressive path of \n\
    Precision Agriculture (PA). The prime goal of PA is to \nachieve, i) opt for the\
    \ appropriate crop to ensure increased \nquality yield and make more revenue in\
    \ the commercial \nmarket, ii) using the proper data to assess the performance\
    \ of \nthe farming land, iii) improve the economics of farming and \nanother offer\
    \ better sustainability towards the environment, and \niv) making a prediction\
    \ of climatic fluctuations and taking \nnecessary countermeasures to protect from\
    \ upcoming threat \ntowards agriculture [3]-[5]. The significant beneficial aspectof\
    \ \nPA is minimizing and controlling crop waste and adverse \ninfluence over the\
    \ environment.Farmers are facilitated with the \nappropriate \nanticipated \n\
    yield \nfor \ntheir \nfarming \nland. \nInvestigation towards PA could offer potential\
    \ insight towards \nsolving the crisis of food demand globally [6]. Farmers are\
    \ \nnow able to identify the beneficial aspects of PA introduced by \nIoT. The\
    \ return of investment and quality of decision-making \ncan be ensured by adoption\
    \ PA by business owners.There is the \ninclusion of various metrics to carry out\
    \ PA, e.g., fertilizer \ninput, a sample of soil, nutrient availability of soil,\
    \ rainfall \nlevel, temperature, etc. [7]. \nAcquisition of this information via\
    \ sensors can lead to \nprecision decision-making by the farmers. It can also\
    \ furnish \nvarious real-time data of their farming land, identifying \nspecific\
    \ production patterns or identifying any associated risk \nfactors during cultivation\
    \ and harvesting season. Adopting PA \nalso facilitates exclusive access to the\
    \ agricultural records via \ncloud-based resources where the data can be accessed\
    \ anytime \nand anywhere [8]. It also leads to an adequate formulation of \nmeasures\
    \ towards crop protection. Usage of sensors can \nquickly identify the health\
    \ statistics of a plant concerning soil \npressure, presence of chemicals, environmental\
    \ impact, pest, \netc. [9]. This information leads to a better decision in planning\
    \ \nfor fertilizer input by the farmer. The most potential benefit of \nPA is\
    \ associated with irrigation management. Any form of the \ncrop demands an adequate\
    \ water supply in appropriate \nquantities and channel them throughout the farming\
    \ land. \nUsage of various controllers, actuators, and sensors further \noffers\
    \ relevantwater supply statistics for better irrigation \nmanagement. To effectively\
    \ operational, PA demands the use \nof progressive technologies, i.e., usage of\
    \ sensors [10], \nprecision farming software [11], connectivity protocols [12],\
    \ \nand location monitoring tools [13]. Irrespective of PA’s known \nbenefits,\
    \ it is still yet to get a discloser about the research \nprogress regarding more\
    \ insights over challenging state of \nfarming, minimal resource waste, identifying\
    \ the unique \npattern of production or risk. Therefore, this manuscript offers\
    \ \nan exhaustive review of standard and upcoming potential PA \napproaches to\
    \ providea more precise research state. The \nsignificant contributionsin the\
    \ proposed paper aredescribed as \nfollows: \n The present state of conventional\
    \ approaches in PA is \nhighly scattered. So this paper contributes towards \n\

    \ Finally, Section VI summarizes \nthe overall contribution of the proposed review\
    \ study and briefs \nabout future work direction in precision agriculturebased\
    \ on \nstudy findings. \nII. PRECISION AGRICULTURE \nPrecision Agriculture (PA)\
    \ targets improving crop \nproduction with the adoption of advanced technologies.\
    \ This \nconcept deals with improving agricultural management based \non various\
    \ scientific observations [14]. The primary aim of \nprecision agriculture is\
    \ to construct an appropriate decision-\nmaking system capable of optimizing productivity\
    \ without \nconsuming expensive resources [15]. It is believed that crop \nproduction\
    \ is significantly affected by the terrain features \nstudied in the phytogeomorphological\
    \ mechanism [16]. The \nevolution of the phytogeomorphological mechanism is due\
    \ to \nthe realizationthat the hydrological factors of farmland are \ncontrolled\
    \ by geomorphic components [17].The proliferation of \nvarious satellite navigation\
    \ systems has further boosted the \nadoption of precision agriculture [18]. Adopting\
    \ such a \nnavigation system helps localize an appropriate location of the \n\
    agricultural land suitable for production. Such geographic \ninformation obtained\
    \ from satellite navigational system also \nfurnishes spatial information of land\
    \ concerningactual contents \nrequired for cultivation viz. potassium, manganese,\
    \ pH level, \nnitrogen level, moisture level, crop yield, etc. [19].  A sensory-\n\
    based satellite navigation system helps further more data \ncollection, right\
    \ from a degree of water in the soil to the level \nof chlorophyll. More granularity\
    \ can be obtained from \nhyperspectral imaging in this regard. At present, there\
    \ are \ndifferent forms of variable rate technology (e.g., sprayers, \nseeders)\
    \ that are used along with satellite images for \noptimizing the resources [20].\
    \ However, the current advances \nin technologies are more inclined to use sensors\
    \ planted within \nthe soil. This sensor can directly forward the aggregated data\
    \ to \nthe user autonomously without any dependency on human \ninteractivity.\
    \ \nThe adoption of airborne vehicles is also used in precision \nagriculture\
    \ due to their cost-effective nature and does not \nrequire specialized skills\
    \ to make them airborne. Such \napproaches make use of photogrammetric techniques\
    \ by using \ndifferent forms of the camera (for both color and hyperspectral \n\
    images) are used over airborne vehicles to extract information \nassociated with\
    \ the field images [21]. The images obtained by \nthis technique can be used for\
    \ evaluating the different forms of \nvegetative index [22]. Apart from this,\
    \ a different form of other \ninformation, e.g.,the elevation of land, can also\
    \ be captured by \nairborne \nvehicles \nsubjected \nto \nvariousconditions \n\
    of \nsophisticated software models for constructing topography \n[23]. Therefore,\
    \ a better probability of enhancing crop \ncultivation can be achieved by studying\
    \ such a topography \nmap. This information can be used for improving the inputs\
    \ \ntowards healthy cultivation, e.g., growth regulators, different \ntypes of\
    \ chemicals, fertilizers, water, etc. Therefore, using \ndifferent forms of technologies\
    \ in precision agriculture is used \nto study crop science, accelerate the economics\
    \ associated with \nthe production, and protect the environment by controlling\
    \ \ndifferent possibilities of risk and agricultural footprints. \nA. Standard\
    \ Taxonomies of Technologies in PA \nThe novel approaches of agricultural practices\
    \ are now \nfacilitated by the advent of different technologies in PA. The \n\
    optimization is now possible for PA for both profitability and \nproductivity\
    \ \nbased \non \ndecision-making \nand \nreal-time \ninformation over the field.\
    \ The prime targets of the \ntechnologies used in PA are mainly to control the\
    \ agricultural \ninput along with environmental protection. On this basis, it\
    \ is \nseen that there are five standard taxonomies of precision \nfarming,including\
    \ 1) Satellite Positioning System, 2) Variable \nRate Technology, 3) Geomapping,\
    \ 4) Automated Steering \nSystem, and 5) Remote Sensing as in (Fig. 1). \nIn Satellite\
    \ Positioning System, the prime technological \ncontributor is the Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS), mainly \nusing data associated with geo-references of production\
    \ and \nauto-steer system. The agricultural machines (e.g., tractors) are \nbetter\
    \ controlled with accuracy using GPS inbuilt within the \nmachine. The farming\
    \ operation is improved when the driver is \nprovided with error-free information\
    \ with machine movement \npatterns (Fig. 2). \nTechnologies \nin PA\nAutomated\

    \ agricultural inputs are \ncontrolled by farmers. Adopting this standard technology\
    \ \noffers planting density to be optimized while increasing the \napplicate rate's\
    \ efficiency towards nutrients and pest protection. \nThis significantly minimizes\
    \ the farming cost as well as \neffectively control the adverse impact onthe environment.\
    \ \nWhen variable rate technology is integrated with application \nequipment,\
    \ the system offers precise information about the \nfield’s location and appropriate\
    \ time for obtaining input for \nrates corresponding to the region-specific application.\
    \ Fig. 3 \nhighlights the soil map used for variable-rate technology to \nfind\
    \ the different nutrients needed in the soil. \nIn Geomapping and Remote Sensing,\
    \ sensors are usually \nused to construct a map with the different crop and soil\
    \ \nconditions, e.g., pest, soil pH, type of soil, nutrient level of the \nsoil.\
    \ Sensors are attached to different machines and vehicles to \nbe dominantly used\
    \ for creating soil maps. Sensors collect the \ninformation from the field and\
    \ GPS to assess the health \nstatistics of crops and soil. This information is\
    \ then passed on \nto a specific location in an area. Farmers can carry out \n\
    identification of specific events or any significant alteration in \nthe properties\
    \ of soil. Fig. 4 highlights the mapped field which \nis used by the sensors built\
    \ over the agriculture machine. \nIn the Automated Steering System, the vehicles\
    \ used in \nagriculture are involuntarily steered by the navigation system. \n\
    This \ntechnology \nreduces \nhuman-related \nerrors \nwhile \ncontrolling the\
    \ movement of the vehicle. It also permits \neffective management of the field\
    \ by providing overhead \ntuning andcontrolling the machinerybased on edge information.\
    \ \nThe existing system uses differential correction for real-time \nkinematics\
    \ to offer accuracy in the form of centimeters. Fig. 5 \nhighlights overlapping\
    \ factors of auto-steering system and \nmanual machine. \nHowever, to offer higher\
    \ accuracy for the machinery over \nthe deployed path, installing a specific communication\
    \ system \nwith a base station is required. A precise point positioning \nsystem\
    \ does not require any form of data communication in the \nauto-steering system\
    \ [24]. On the other hand, machinery can \nalso be allowed to be moved using GPS\
    \ based navigation \nsystem. \nFiled Name:\nFiled 1\nArea: 23.47 Ha\nPotassium\n\

    \ \nB. Review of Studies on Conventional PA Technologies \nThis section discusses\
    \ the various research work being \ncarried out towards different standard technologies\
    \ in PA \nbriefed in the prior section. \n Satellite Positioning System:  This\
    \ approach uses two \nprominent techniques, i.e., GPS (Global Positioning \nSystem)\
    \ and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite \nSystem). It is found that GPS, when\
    \ integrated with the \nrobotic application, could significantly contribute \n\
    towards PA. However, the GPS signal’s availability \ncould be impacted due to\
    \ occlusion towards GPS-\nenabled Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) in farming. This \n\
    problem is addressed in Levoir et al. [25] by evolving \nout with a smart rover\
    \ that uses sophisticated image \nprocessing \nand \nstatistical \nanalysis \n\
    to \nperform \nlocalization tasks by the rover. Further studies show \nthat integrating\
    \ GPS with the sensory application could \nimprove the data acquisition with more\
    \ accuracy \n(Rodriguez et al. [26]). A prototype was developed for \nherbicide\
    \ ballistic technology integrated with sensors \nand GPS to automate data acquisition.\
    \ Prototyping-\nbased modeling is evolving in an existing system \nwhere \nGPS\
    \ \nis \nintegrated \nwith \na \nmicro-\nelectromechanical system.The idea was\
    \ to offer a \nprecise steering angle of the agriculture vehicle (Si et \nal.\
    \ [27]). An unscented Kalman filter did the \ncomputation of the steering angle.\
    \ Existing study \ntowards the adoption of GPS has mainly emphasized \nachieving\
    \ better accuracy for the receivers (Dabove et \nal. [28]).It should be noted\
    \ that GPS is an integral \nsection of GNSS with variable ranges of transmission\
    \ \nfrequency. Literature has also studied the adoption of \nGNSS towards precision\
    \ farming (Marucci et al. [29]); \nhowever, it does not work effectively in hilly\
    \ regions. \nThere is still a better possibility of improvement when \nthe GNSS\
    \ system is combined with different \ntechnologies to overcome this issue. GNSS\
    \ is also \nfound with various artifacts, e.g., multipath error, \natmospheric\
    \ \ninterference, \nsatellite \nconfiguration \n(Stombaugh et al. [30]). \n Variable\
    \ Rate Technology: This kind of technology is \nused for managing crop production\
    \ specific to the \nfarming region (Rubio and Mas [31], Ayaz et al. [32]). \n\
    The recent work carried out by Nordblom et al. [33] \nhave used variable rate\
    \ technology in PA focusing on \nnitrogen fertilizer input. The study integrates\
    \ such \napplication with Geographic Information System (GIS) \nand rainfall data\
    \ to determine the reason for \nwaterlogging in a specific geographic area. The\
    \ study \nhas also simulated data distribution of financial risk in \npredictive\
    \ mode to signify variable rate technology. A \nsimilar direction of work is also\
    \ carried out by Steffani \n[34], where a statistical model is used for analyzing\
    \ \nlint. The idea is to emphasize adequate control over the \nenvironment and\
    \ maximization of profit, as discussed \nin the study of Kweon et al. [35]. A\
    \ study carried out \nby Colaco [36] has analyzed the impact of this \ntechnology\
    \ on yield, the fertility of the soil, and \nfertilizer consumption. The study\
    \ outcome shows that \nthe variability factor can successfully achieve increased\
    \ \nproduction without much dependency on excessive \nfertilizers. A study carried\
    \ out by Nawar et al. [37] \nhighlights that this technology, when integrated\
    \ with \nregion delineation management approach then it could \nlead to better\
    \ efficiency in farming in contrast to \napplication with uniform rate. At present,\
    \ the \nimplementation of variable rate technology is further \nboosted by the\
    \ proliferation of novel solutions by \nmanufacturers of farming equipment. The\
    \ work carried \nout by Thomasson et al. [38] has discussed the \nfrequently adopted\
    \ manufacturers using crop sensors \nassociated with this technology of nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers. \nThe study also suggestsusing automatic differential \nharvesting\
    \ as another promising actuation process for \npromoting the harvesting process\
    \ over the field. \nAdoption of differential harvesting process is reported \n\
    in Sethuramasamyraja [39], where infrared sensors \nwere used over vineyards to\
    \ analyze the quality of \ngraph based on anthocyanin present in berries. The\
    \ \nimplementation is carried out as follows viz. \ni) anthocyanin contents of\
    \ the grapes are sensed, ii) a \ncertain level of the threshold for this content\
    \ is \nconsidered to generate a quality map for this data, and \niii) forwarding\
    \ the generated map to the user \n(harvester). \n Geomapping and Remote Sensing:\
    \ There are various \nforms of Geomapping and remote sensing approaches \nused\
    \ towards PA (Kim et al.[40]). This approach leads \nto the generation of agroecological\
    \ zones where \ndifferent attributes are subjected to analysis (Muthoni \net al.\
    \ [41]). The imageries obtained from satellite \nimages are studied for boundary\
    \ delineation using \nfeature extraction and image segmentation method \n(North\
    \ et al. [42]). The existing study has also \nwitnessed increased adoption of\
    \ Sentinel-2 data in PA \n(Sharifi [43]) for analyzing nitrogen usage. Nitrogen\
    \ is \nthe essential input for PA has also been studied by Yao \net al. [44] using\
    \ an active crop sensor.  Apart from \nthese conventional approaches, the advanced\
    \ integrated \napproach of drone technology and Internet-of-Things \nare also\
    \ deployed in precision farming (Uddin et al. \n[45]). Another interesting study\
    \ carried out by Xu et al. \n[46] has used data from cameras and terrestrial laser\
    \ \nscanning to monitor crop health in PA. The majority of \nthe approaches associated\
    \ with Geomapping and \nremote sensing are associated with capturing the field\
    \ \nimage followed by performing analysis. Proximal \nsensing is most recently\
    \ integrated with remote sensing \nfrom multiple sources to study the leaf area\
    \ index \n(Asad et al. [47]). This work connects the health \nstatistics of the\
    \ leaf with the topographical map of the \nearth. This model has three distinct\
    \ modules viz. i) data \nprocessing with semantic segmentation of ground \nimages,\
    \ ii) training using deep learning model, and iii) \nperforming prediction. The\
    \ study outcome suggests \nthat it is capable of performing better prediction\
    \ even \nwith images with low resolution. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 2, 2021 \n308 | P\
    \ a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThe current study has also discussed spectral\
    \ feature usage, \nwhere the prime challenge is to address the issues associated\
    \ \nwith data collection and training. This issue is addressed in \nAshourloo\
    \ et al. [48], which carried out a comparative study of \ndifferent variants of\
    \ spectral bands. The outcome shows \nsupport vector machine to be useful for\
    \ large scale of data \nusing time-series approach.  However, such an approach\
    \ is less \nutilized for computing as well as predicting yield. This \nproblem\
    \ is addressed in the work of Fieuzal et al. [49] \nconsidering leaf area index.\
    \ The data considered for this \nanalysis is from synthetic aperture radar, where\
    \ multiple \nsources are considered for analysis for evaluating a crop’s dry \n\
    mass. A similar study is also carried out by Zalite et al. [50], \nwhere time\
    \ series is considered. The study limits its evaluation \nfrom the wetlands, which\
    \ is another research challenge found \nin current times. The prime cause of this\
    \ challenge is spectral \nsimilarity and the degree of heterogeneity involved\
    \ in \nlandmasses. A study to address this challenge is seen in \nHempattarasuwan\
    \ et al. [51], where quantitative analysis is \ncarried out over historical data.\
    \ The study implements a \nclassification \napproach \nby \ncombining \nthree\
    \ \nstandard \napproaches, i.e., Mahalanobis distance, maximum likelihood, \n\
    and decision tree. The outcome shows a decision tree to offer \nbetter classification\
    \ performance. A study concerning leaf area \nindex is also carried out by Pan\
    \ et al. [52], where water content \ninformation is also used for modeling. The\
    \ emphasis on water \nattributes was also seen in the study of Patil et al. [53].\
    \ The \ncurrent study also claims that useful classification can be \ncarried\
    \ out using a PA's deep learning approach (Sun et al. \n[54]). From an approach\
    \ perspective, the random forest has \nalso registered itself to be assisting\
    \ in the classification of \nsatellite images of land (Zafari et al. [55]). In\
    \ such an approach, \na unique classifier is designed for constructing a similarity\
    \ \nkernel. There are also studies where correlated factors, e.g., \ndevelopment\
    \ stage and fractal dimension,are studied (Shen et \nal. [56]). Such study mainly\
    \ explores different factors that \naffect production, i.e., soil background and\
    \ different farming \npractices. A unique study carried out by Dong et al. [57]\
    \ has \nused chlorophyll index for assessing the internal processing of \ncrops\
    \ in PA.  The study carried out over simulated environment \nshows the potential\
    \ linear correlation among different variants \nof vegetation index. The study\
    \ contributes towards the impact \nof red edge reflectance associated with chlorophyll\
    \ during \nphotosynthesis. Such models emphasize the internal processing \nof\
    \ plant nutrients but do not focus on balancing them. \nBalancing the nutrient\
    \ demand is essential when it comes tothe \nmanagement of agricultural land in\
    \ PA. Such an approach was \ndiscussed by Gimenez et al. [58],where remotely sensed\
    \ data is \nintegrated with the model for land management. The study \ncontributes\
    \ towards yielding useful information associated with \nfarm practices and balancing\
    \ the nutrients demands on it.  \nExisting studies have also evolved with a unique\
    \ clustering \napproach on its features over the standard scale to assess the\
    \ \nmonitoring of crops in PA (Yuzugullu et al. [59]). The work \ncarried out\
    \ by Ali et al. [60] has developed a model for remote \nsensing where multitemporal\
    \ attributes have been used for \nevaluating biomass. The study has used an integrated\
    \ machine \nlearning approach where neuro-fuzzy logic, neural network, \nand linear\
    \ regression have been used over remotely sensed data \nto extract biomass estimates.\
    \ \n Automated Steering System: The research work \ntowards this approach is\
    \ mainly associated with \ndeveloping agricultural machinery to give them a \n\
    direction towards its orientation. The existing system \nhas used fuzzy logic\
    \ (Duan et al. [61]), manual priority \n(Fu et al. [62]), renewable energy (Ghobadpour\
    \ et al. \n[63]), proportional integral derivative (Liu et al. [64], \nYin et\
    \ al. [65]), designing electro-hydraulic circuit \n(Mungwongsa et al. [66]), field\
    \ robots (Gonzalez-de-\nSantos et al. [67]), and automatic pilot system (Wang\
    \ \net al. [68]). The idea of the majority of such \nimplementation orients about\
    \ developing a system that \ncan assist the agricultural machinery to accomplish\
    \ \nspecific objectives while farming. It reduced iterative \nhuman efforts andcan\
    \ undertakea specific task that is \nnot feasible for humans to carry out for\
    \ a given \nconstraint of extensive agricultural lands. However, \nmost of the\
    \ approaches are associated with hardware-\nbased development, and less advancement\
    \ is done on \nthe computational model. \nTable I highlights the summary of the\
    \ most significant \nconventional PA-based approaches studied above-concerning\

    \ of the dominant adoption of sensors, \ncurrent research work towards PA has\
    \ been revolutionized \nmore toward incorporating smart sensing. One of the prime\
    \ \nmotivations towards this research trend is the increasing \nawareness of Internet-of-Things\
    \ (IoT), where sensors are \nintegral. IoT is one dominant research topic for\
    \ improving \nagricultural yields (Kour and Arora [69]). It has contributed \n\
    towards opening avenues for smart farming and PA, although \nthere is some dominant\
    \ research gap (Kour and Arora [69]). In \nthis aspect, various forms of sensors\
    \ have also been \ninvestigated towards PA, where it is found that support vector\
    \ \nmachine and random forest are dominant classification \napproaches (Kamath\
    \ et al. [70]). Apart from this, there is also \ndedicated research work being\
    \ carried out where machine \nlearning approaches are claimed to optimize IoT\
    \ performance \nin PA to facilitate predictive operation for farming. \nWith the\
    \ adoption of various sensors for capturing field \ninformation, the data are\
    \ forwarded using various IEEE \nstandards of the family (e.g., 802.15.4/11 as\
    \ seen in the work of \nKone et al. [71]), which further forwards it to the gateway\
    \ node \nand then to cloud where the application of analytics resides \n(Ahmed\
    \ et al. [72]). The study offers some specific information \nthat was not found\
    \ in conventional PA-based approaches, e.g., \ni) energy being one of the practical\
    \ constraintsof using sensors \nin PA, and ii) routing and topology is another\
    \ essential \noperation, which is also challenged in adverse environmental \n\
    condition. There are various MAC protocols in wireless sensor \nnetworks [72],\
    \ but they do not combine to ensure downlink \nscheduling, multi-hop decisions,\
    \ heterogeneous duty cycles, \nand traffic adaptive. To perform a full scenario\
    \ to capture \nenvironment information of farming process, all this \ncharacteristic\
    \ is demanded in IoT. The adoption of IoT \ntechnology in PA is depicted in Fig.\
    \ 6. The figure shows how \nsensor devices, gateways, and WiFi technology integrated\
    \ with \ncloud infrastructure enableIoT-PA ecosystems. There are \nbasically severalwireless\
    \ sensor nodes deployed in the farm \nand agriculture fields in rural regions.\
    \ The sensor nodes capture \nsignificant events related to agriculture and send\
    \ them to the \ncloud computing system via WiFi and gateway-based \nnetworking\
    \ systems. The sensed data collected to the cloud is \nfurther stored and processed\
    \ by an analytics engine and fog \nnetworking to enable framers managing farms\
    \ to boost the \nquality and quantity of products and optimizes the cost \nassociated\
    \ with human labor required. However, in this \nscenario, the biggest impediment\
    \ is a trade-off concerning \nsupportability and efficiency between the protocols\
    \ in IoT and \nWireless Sensor Network (WSN). \nCloud \nWiFi Node\n10 KM Link\n\

    \ PA. \nThe most recent study carried out by Gulec et al. [73] has \ndiscussed\
    \ improving the lifetime of WSN focusing on PA in a \ndistributed environment.\
    \ The study uses connected dominating \nsets as a backbone of communication in\
    \ WSN considering \nharvester and regular sensors in farming. The study outcome\
    \ is \nobtained from both experimental and simulated versions stating \nthat the\
    \ proposed system is energy efficient. Existing research \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 2, 2021\
    \ \n311 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nshows certain dedicated attempts\
    \ to model WSN in PA with \nuniform sensory node distribution over the farming\
    \ area. The \nwork carried out by Bacco et al. [74] has developed a channel \n\
    model that is used by the ground sensors to perform data \ntransfer. However,\
    \ the emphasis was more on the usage of \nIEEE standards and less on WSN. Adopting\
    \ the heterogeneous \nsensor network is witnessed in Sylvian et al. [75] and \n\
    Kaiwartya et al. [76]. In this work, prototyping is carried out \nusing different\
    \ sensors to capture different information \nassociated with farm fields and crops.\
    \ \nFurther, WSN also claims to offer a decision support \nsystem for facilitating\
    \ water usage (Khan et al. [77]). A \nprototype is designed where the temperature\
    \ is used for \nenvironmental monitoring in PA. The study analyzes the \nconsumption\
    \ of current while functioning over different \ndegrees of temperatures. Importance\
    \ over plant water is \nanother investigation in the existing system, an essential\
    \ part of \nthe leaf sensing system in WSN with PA. The current study \nclaims\
    \ that the adoption of backscatter-based sensor nodes \ncould enhance the PA performance\
    \ from the perspective of \npower-saving (Daskalakis et al. [78]). The study has\
    \ also used \nMorse code, which is computationally cost-effective for carrier\
    \ \nsignal modulation. Focus on power saving can also be \nimplemented using non-orthonormal\
    \ multiple access in WSN \n(Hu et al. [79]). The study outcome shows that this\
    \ mechanism \nsignificantly controls outage probability and the rate of \nsummed\
    \ data. \nThe majority of the existing studies emphasize estimating \nsoil parameters\
    \ in PA; however, the modeling attributes are \nless emphasized towards power.\
    \ A study on such issues is \ncarried out by Estrada-Lopez et al. [80], where\
    \ a WSN \ntopology is constructed using both cloud and IoT considering \nsoil\
    \ parameters. The data analysis is carried out by an artificial \nneural network\
    \ followed by using a unique power management \nscheme. Apart from the terrestrial\
    \ application, the adoption of \nWSN is also carried out over the underground\
    \ ecosystem. \nSalam et al. [81] have developed such a system to model \nchannel\
    \ impulse. The study has also analyzed various time-\ndomain attributes, e.g.,\
    \ gain in multipath power, channel \ncapacity, delay, etc. A study on a similar\
    \ direction towards the \nunderground ecosystem is also investigated by Castellanos\
    \ et \nal. [82], where soil parameters are collected using a narrow-\nband communication\
    \ scheme of Long Term Evolution (LTE). \nThe study uses unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ to collect data from \nunderground sensors over the potato crop field. Another\
    \ study \nof the underground ecosystem is carried out by Sambo et al. \n[83],\
    \ where a path loss model is presented along with \npredictive framework development\
    \ using a complex dielectric \nconstant. \nDeployment of WSN in PA was also claimed\
    \ to enhance \nproductivity by using dataloggers and actuators (Lozoya et al.\
    \ \n[84]). The current study of WSN is also focused on \nincorporating intelligence\
    \ in the process of irrigation in PA. \nThe work carried out by Jamroen et al.\
    \ [85] has developed an \nirrigation scheduling mechanism using fuzzy logic in\
    \ WSN. \nThe outcome witnessed an increase in crop yield. The current \nstudy\
    \ also discusses the usage of WSN for assisting in \nlocalizing in PA. Sahota\
    \ and Kumar [86] have implemented a \nmodel where the received signal strength\
    \ has been used for \ndistribution over WSN. The study develops a node localization\
    \ \nmodel considering distance propagation invarious degrading \neffective over\
    \ the signal considering fading and path loss \nmodel. The study contributes to\
    \ predicting loss in nitrogen. A \nsimilar received signal strength-based approach\
    \ for assisting in \nlocalization has also been carried out by Abouzar et al.\
    \ [87]. \nThis study has used a spanning tree for developing belief \npropagation.\
    \ \nA unique concept towards promoting energy harvesting in \nPA is discussed\
    \ by Konstantopoulos et al. [88]. According to \nthis study, the electric potential\
    \ produced within a plant is used \nas a power source for WSN. The study uses\
    \ nonnegative matrix \nfactorization to process this electric potential signal.\
    \ From the \nviewpoint of power saving, it is also found that data registers'\
    \ \nfrequency plays a crucial role. The energy-saving in WSN can \nbe facilitated\
    \ using this data register frequency variation to \nimpact PA (Santos and Cugnasca\
    \ [89]). Another essential \nfactor to be considered is the presence of partitioned\
    \ sensors in \nPA, which leads to disruption in the network. The work carried\
    \ \nout by Maheswararajah et al. [90] hypothesizes that the \npresence of such\
    \ nodes leads to noise in the measurement. A \nKalman-filter-based optimization\
    \ strategy is developed to \nrestore such nodes. Existing literature further hypothesizes\
    \ that \nmonitoring environmental values is essential when deploying \nWSN in\
    \ PA. The work of Kampianakis et al. [91] has \npresented a prototype that employs\
    \ the networking principle of \nsensor nodes (especially modulation of analog\
    \ frequency) \nalong with software-defined radio. \nThe summary of the practical\
    \ approaches in WSN in PA is \ntabulated in Table II. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ trend, it is seen that IoT, \nalong with the inclusion of software and different\
    \ variants of \nsensing technology, is going to minimize the skilled labors in\
    \ \nagriculture in the coming days. The global market is not \nconsistently evolving\
    \ with the rise of real-time kinetic \ntechnology, remote sensing technology,\
    \ networking, variable \nrate technology, robotics, and fertilizers and sprayer\
    \ \ncontrollers. \nA. Trend in PA Research \nThe last decade has witnessed approximately\
    \ 1710 research \npapers in PA approaches while only 230 are found to be \njournals\
    \ in IEEE Xplore digital library. A nearly similar trend \nis found in other reputed\
    \ publishers like ACM digital library, \nSpringer, ScienceDirect, and Elsevier.\
    \ There are very few \nstudies towards automated steering systems, while more\
    \ \nstudies are populated in the adoption of satellite positioning \nsystems (GPS,\
    \ GNSS). Not much work is carried out towards \nvariable rate technology. However,\
    \ some potential work in a \nlarge number has been carried out towards remote\
    \ sensing and \nsoil mapping. More inclination is seen towards remote sensing\
    \ \napproaches using hyperspectral images or other equivalent \nforms of images\
    \ from an unmanned flying object (drones).  \nHowever, the trend is more on adopting\
    \ a single crop field is \nextensively more investigated, and multi-crop land\
    \ is less \nfound in consideration, which could impedeupcoming research \nwork.\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 is an upcoming standard for automating \nPA; however, studies\
    \ show few implementations associated \nwith such upcoming standard formulation.\
    \ Image processing \nremains the dominant approach, and its adoption is consistently\
    \ \nincreasing; however, there is a shift of this approach with data-\ncentric\
    \ technologies in IoT. \nB. Trend in Technological Adoption \nThe present scenario\
    \ of implementation in PA is highly \nscattered. More work is carried out using\
    \ prototyping, and less \nmathematical or computational modeling is noticed. Adoption\
    \ \nof machine learning or artificial intelligence is also found to be \nless\
    \ prominent in this aspect. Although machine learning has \nbeen used in existing\
    \ studies, it is not evaluated fromits \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 2, 2021 \n313 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \ncomputational complexity. The engineering area, e.g.,\
    \ robotics, \nembedded system, machinery compilation, etc. is more \nfocused,\
    \ limiting investigation strength and giving less \nexposure to unknown challenges\
    \ in PA. Adopting IoT and \nWSN has just started its research work, and it has\
    \ more way to \ngo to achieve its state of maturity as a research standard model.\
    \ \nThe development of a test-bed for analyzing farming data is \nanother inclusive\
    \ research trend in PA. \nC. Trend in Target Issues \nThe issues mainly considered\
    \ in the existing system in PA \nare mainly associated with environmental monitoring.\
    \ The \nexisting research trend is also to consider a specific issue \nconnected\
    \ with a specific crop, making the model heavily case-\nspecific and less applicable\
    \ to different environments. Data \nacquisition is another target issue considered\
    \ in the existing \nresearch trend in PA. Different techniques have been carried\
    \ \nout towards acquiring data. However, less emphasis is offered \nto analyze\
    \ this collected data. The trend towards analytics over \nmulti-crop land is less\
    \ found. Adopting sensors integrated with \ndifferent networking principles also\
    \ assists in data acquisition; \nhowever, there are various open-end challenges\
    \ associated, \ne.g., non-inclusion of the energy model makes such a solution\
    \ \nlimited to theoretical concepts. \nV. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVE \nBased on\
    \ the observation being carried out towards \nconventional approaches used in\
    \ PA and the upcoming \nadoption of WSN in PA, it is noticed that there are various\
    \ \nconcluding remarks associated with the overall techniques used \nin PA. This\
    \ section briefs about the learning outcomes of the \nproposed review work as\
    \ follows: \n A \ntradeoff \nbetween \nDemands \nand \nAvailable \nTechnology:\
    \ A closer look into the available \napproaches shows that PA needs to consider\
    \ multiple \nattributes simultaneously, e.g., soil health, plant-related \nfeatures,\
    \ surrounding environment, and weather. There \nare many more sub-attributes for\
    \ this core attribute, \nwhich require equal attention for improved crop \ncultivation\
    \ and environmental risk reduction. All the \nexisting approaches using a conventional\
    \ approach or \nWSN based approaches use only a limited number of \nsuch attributes\
    \ in modeling its PA. On the other side, \nthere has been an immense advancement\
    \ in prototyping \nas \nwell as computational \nmodeling. However, \nprototyping\
    \ is the most dominant approach in PA in \nexisting studies. Hence, the demand\
    \ to offer productive \nPA performance is immensely more which are not \nfound\
    \ to be considered while modeling with existing \ntechnological advancement. \n\
     Lack of Uncertainty-based Modelling: There are \nvarious \nattributes \nlike\
    \ \ncrop \nhealth, \nrainfall, \ntemperature, soil health, etc. they are stochastic.\
    \ \nExisting approaches focus on modeling predefined \necosystems, which is more\
    \ or less impractical than \nreal-world scenarios. There isa various uncertain\
    \ \nscenario that could develop either using conventional \nor WSN based approaches,\
    \ e.g. rate of energy \ndepletion,incoming \nstreamed \ndata, \nmobile \nof \n\
    machinery, occlusion in GPS-based data, etc. Until and \nunless such uncertainty\
    \ conditions are not included in \nthe modeling, the outcome may eventually result\
    \ in \noutliers.  Apart from this, various studies where \nmachine learning has\
    \ been used do not consider this, \nleading to its solution inapplicable to real-time\
    \ \napplication. \n Use Case Specific Study: Almost all the existing PA \napproaches\
    \ have considered a specific use case of crop \nor study environment (e.g., soil\
    \ health, water, \ntemperature, etc.). On the other side, the conventional \n\
    study approach has focused on the adoption of specific \nmachinery. The modeling\
    \ is carried out considering a \nspecific form of crops using any of the approaches\
    \ in \nPA. This means that there is no generalized algorithm \nto solve a similar\
    \ problem when environmental \nvariables change. It also incurs more cost when\
    \ it \ncomes to deploying commercial products and their \nadoption. It is only\
    \ cost-effective of a simplified model \n(or product) that can address multiple\
    \ PA problems \naltogether. \n Less Emphasis over Routing: Routing or deploying\
    \ a \ncommunication protocol is significant usingthe larger \nfarming \narea \n\
    with \nchallenging \ncommunication \nscenarios (e.g., forest, terrain, etc.).\
    \ It is already \nobserved that the adoption of the hybrid approach is \nthe most\
    \ effective one to mitigate the limitation of \nsingle-approach. For example,\
    \ GPS integrated with \nsensor nodes or drones could offer more effective data\
    \ \ncapture than considering any of them. This also means \nthat there isa good\
    \ possibility of hybridizing different \ntypes of machinery and different nodes\
    \ to facilitate an \neffective data transmission in PA. However, this \nchallenge\
    \ can be addressed if a unique routing protocol \nis designed and developed for\
    \ such a scenario. No \nstudies are being carried out in evolving a novel \nrouting\
    \ scheme in PA;instead, it reuses the adopted \ntechniques' routing scheme. This\
    \ also offers more \nimpediments towards data transmission when the farm \nenvironment\
    \ is subjected to priority-based data \ntransmission \nor \nexercising \nspecific\
    \ \ntime-critical \napplications. \n IoT and WSN still in the Nascent Stage:\
    \ IoT is slowly \nmaking its entry from the roof of research and \ndevelopment\
    \ to the commercial world. Apart from this, \nthe study shows that most PA approaches\
    \ have a \ndeployment of sensor nodes for soil mapping, remote \nsensing, etc.\
    \ (conventional approach in PA), but they \ndo not have a deployment of WSN, which\
    \ makes a \nnetwork of sensors. With the inclusion of automation \nstandard 4.0,\
    \ there is a need for smart farming using \nIoT, which is still under development.\
    \ Apart from this, \nWSN is an integral part of IoT. However, there has \nbeen\
    \ immense work towards addressing multiple \nproblems in WSN in past decades,\
    \ and their solutions \nare not directly applicable in IoT. There is always a\
    \ \ntradeoff between IoT and WSN with the inclusion of \nIoT based routing scheme\
    \ and WSN based routing \nscheme that requires smooth integration. Hence, \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 2, 2021 \n314 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ncurrent approaches\
    \ in WSN on PA aresignificantly less \nand insignificant in contrast to conventional\
    \ PA \napproaches. \n Lack of inclusion of Resource: Sensor nodes of any \nform\
    \ are characterized by the limited capability of \nprocessing as well as they\
    \ have limited availability of \nresources too (e.g., memory, channel capacity,\
    \ energy, \netc.). None of the existing studies where WSN is \nconsidered in PA\
    \ has any inclusion of novel resource \nmanagement model exclusively focusing\
    \ on constraints \nassociated with PA's farming environment. Without the \ninclusion\
    \ of the resource factor, modeling any solution \nwill be more impractical. \n\
     Few Studies towards Optimization: By optimization, it \ncan represent a technique\
    \ that offers increased \nperformance yield with low inclusion/dependencies of\
    \ \nresources. Machine learning has been used for this \npurpose to some extent.\
    \ At present, many optimization-\nbased approaches fit on solving various problems\
    \ \nassociated with PA. A closer look into the existing \nsystem \nalso \nshows\
    \ \nthat \nit \ndoes \nnot \nensure \ncomputational cost-effectiveness in its\
    \ algorithm. \nHence, the adoption of appropriate optimization \ntechniques is\
    \ highly demanded. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nThe manuscript discusses the PA approaches\
    \ and \ntechniques that are mainly associated with implementing a \nmanagement\
    \ scheme towards facilitating effective responses \ntoward crops, measurement,\
    \ and observation towards animals \nand fields. Adoption of PA leads to enhanced\
    \ yields in the \ncrop, cost reduction, and process input optimization. However,\
    \ \nthere are various challenges associated with it. There is an \ninclusion of\
    \ higher initial capital to implement PA in real-time, \nand such investment is\
    \ carried out for long-term plans. In order \nto reach the PA implementation maturity\
    \ stage, several years \nmay be consumed prior to even possessing adequate data\
    \ to \nimplement even the conventional approaches completely. The \nfinal challenge\
    \ in PA implementation is its data aggregation \nfollowed by an analysis, which\
    \ could be an extensively \ndemanding task. Based on the presented findings of\
    \ existing \nresearch work, it could be just said that effective \nimplementation\
    \ of PA demands i) precise management, \nii) identification and adoption of appropriate\
    \ technology, and \niii) data. \n1) Overall summary: The essential findings of\
    \ the proposed \nstudy are summarized as follows: i) existing approaches of PA\
    \ \nhas an increasing concern over interoperability of different \ninnovative\
    \ systems and tools, ii) adoption of PA by ordinary \nfarmers will be a big task\
    \ as the technologies involved in it are \nhighly advanced and require a thorough\
    \ knowledge of it, \niii) despite various studies using IoT, narrowband, GPS,\
    \ WSN, \netc., coverage and connectivity in rural areas will be a \npotentiallytricky\
    \ task, iv) An appropriate PA implementation \nleads to generate a massive score\
    \ of big farming data which is \nimpossible to analyze from a single data point\
    \ in the crop field.  \nWith the increasing adoption of multi-crop land, there\
    \ will be \nmassive growth of data and understanding the significance and \npriority\
    \ of such data will be near to impossible for average \nfarmers in existing times,\
    \ v) IoT and WSN is the most \npromising technology in PA, but adoption of current\
    \ schemes \nonly induces scalability problems along with troublesome \nconfiguration\
    \ issues, vi) there is a lack of mathematical \nmodelling seen in the existing\
    \ system using WSN, which has \nbetter future scope. \n2) Future work: The future\
    \ direction of work will consider \nadopting IoT and WSN, which is the most demanding\
    \ \nupcoming technology for reshaping the existing system to \nFarming 4.0. In\
    \ this context, the next work is to design and \ndevelop an IoT scenario with\
    \ multi-crop land powered by \nheterogeneous WSN. The focus will be first to include\
    \ all real-\ntime constraints, e.g., energy, coverage and connectivity, \nresource\

  explanation: This paper presents a smart irrigation system for tomatoes using IoT
    and machine learning techniques. The system includes a network of sensors to collect
    data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant health. This data is then
    used to train machine learning models that can predict the optimal irrigation
    schedule for the tomatoes. The system has been tested in a field trial and has
    been shown to improve tomato yields by up to 20%.

    DOI 10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, no other invention\
    \ has generated as much\nexcitement in the computing world as the Internet. Because\
    \ of its\ntremendous strength and breadth of uses, it is virtually ubiquitous\n\
    in every sector of human endeavor (Kumar et al., 2017; Poyen et al.,\n2020; Terence\
    \ and Purushothaman, 2020). People and\norganizations have connected with amazing\
    \ agility and\nconvenience in recent years, thanks to a vast 5G network of\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs), healthcare services, cellphones,\nand various sorts\
    \ of pervasive real-time monitoring systems\n(Lakshmiprabha and Govindaraju, 2019;\
    \ Hassan et al., 2021). The\nhuman population is expanding at an alarming rate,\
    \ but at the same\ntime, pollution is slowly depleting the earth’s water and land\n\
    supplies. Smart agriculture is seen as playing a crucial role in\nresponding to\
    \ these issues. Smart agriculture has the potential to\nvastly enhance both the\
    \ agroecological setting and the yield and\nquality of agricultural products while\
    \ simultaneously decreasing the\nneed for harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ (Zhang et al.,\n2022). The use of ICTs to automate and intelligently manage\n\
    agricultural cultivation and production is central to the concept\nof “smart agriculture.”\
    \ In particular, wireless communications play\na signiﬁcant role in the growth\
    \ of agriculture, and each new\ngeneration of wireless communication technology\
    \ propels farming\ntoward a higher level of intelligence.\nPeople and objects\
    \ may connect in real-time thanks to the 5G\nnetwork-based Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), which provides important\nservices and value to millions of people across\
    \ the world (Guevara\net al., 2020; Biswal et al., 2021). 5G network-based IoT\
    \ has\ndeveloped organically into a gigantic technology platform. South\nAmerica\
    \ has initiated a yearly warm-season tomato yield that\nbelongs to the Solanaceae\
    \ family (Van Eck et al., 2019; Kumar\net al., 2022).\nDespite requiring high\
    \ amounts of fertilizer, tomato is a\npopular or demanding plant due to its health\
    \ signiﬁcance to the\nwhole world, with high levels of antioxidants such as carotenoid,\n\
    lycopene, and vitamins C and A and phenolic compounds, which\nprovide a wide range\
    \ of health advantages for the consumers\n(Campestrini et al., 2019; Samanta et\
    \ al., 2020; Chen P. et al.,\n2021). Tshiala and Olwoch reported that tomatoes\
    \ have been used\nin food preparation throughout the world as fresh vegetables\
    \ or as\nspices. It has a vital role in the Ethiopian marketing of vegetables\n\
    (Guodaar et al., 2020; Biswas et al., 2021). The production of\ntomatoes was used\
    \ as a job opportunity and as an income source\nfor producers.\nNutrient and water\
    \ supplies have a signiﬁcant impact on tomato\nquality, and their highest water\
    \ demand is quoted in an unpublished\npaper. Some poisonous elements and inorganic\
    \ substances that are\ndangerous to people can demonstrate water quality (Sanjuan-Delm´\n\
    as et al., 2020; Chen P. et al., 2021). This may be a problem for\nirrigation\
    \ using municipal wastewater. Although municipal\nwastewaters have been applied\
    \ as much as possible to irrigation,\nthey contain comparatively maximum sodium\
    \ quantities that can\nbe accumulated with this wastewater and have toxic effects\
    \ on plant\nsoils during optimized irrigation (Jayalakshmi and Gomathi, 2019;\n\
    Leuther et al., 2019; Casadei et al., 2021). The various types of crop\ngrowth\
    \ models are extremely useful in optimizing irrigation\npractices which are based\
    \ on physical or semi-empirical equations\nfor simpliﬁcation of the complex mechanism\
    \ and also having many\nparameters in the process (Sanjuan-Delm´as et al., 2020).\
    \ Because\nof its balance of simplicity, accuracy, and robustness, the AquaCrop\n\
    model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\nhas provided a\
    \ method for calculating crop yields and optimal\nirrigation scheduling for various\
    \ crops in different climates. In the\ncurrent real-time model, parameters like\
    \ soil moisture (SM), crop\ncultivation, leaf area index (LAI), or canopy cover\
    \ (CC) are\ncollected using various remote sensing devices. As a result, this\n\
    real-time cultivation process is an upgraded and fully dynamic\nversion of the\
    \ traditional models (Leuther et al., 2019; Chen P.\net al., 2021).\nA fast and\
    \ dependable Internet connection is necessary for\nagricultural IoT devices to\
    \ function. The current generation of\nmobile networks is failing due to insufﬁcient\
    \ connectivity in rural\nareas, and even in areas with high-speed access, failure\
    \ occurs due to\nmassive demand. According to a recent survey, nearly 80% of rural\n\
    areas, even in the United Kingdom, are outside of the 4G range. The\ncurrent degree\
    \ of network access in rural areas is insufﬁcient in most\nnations (Tang et al.,\
    \ 2021). In addition, in some developed\ncountries, there are multiple farms with\
    \ a large number of IoT\ndevices and machines that require a constant reliable\
    \ high-speed\nInternet connection to exchange a large amount of data, and the\n\
    technologies of the current generation of mobile networks cannot\ncope with these\
    \ demands (Singh et al., 2022). To fulﬁll these goals,\nmany promising technologies,\
    \ such as massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO), network slicing, and\
    \ smaller cells, are\nneeded to provide reliable connectivity over a larger distance.\n\
    Therefore, the smart mobile network is well suited to support\nsmart farming by\
    \ enabling wide coverage, low-energy\nconsumption, low-cost devices, and high\
    \ spectrum efﬁciency.\nUnfortunately, the IoT-based network’s usage of microwaves\n\
    (MWs) as carriers limits its ability to cover wide areas. The\nintroduction of\
    \ small base stations spaced at roughly 250 m\nintervals over coverage regions\
    \ that can be extended to any size\nallows for continuous connectivity, thanks\
    \ to the small cell\nconcept. In order to link the bigger areas, the related small\n\
    towers can be placed everywhere (on lamp posts, in trees, on\nroofs, on tops of\
    \ vehicles, etc.). Similar to 4G, this implementation\nmakes use of the massive\
    \ MIMO approach by equipping nodes\nwith many antennas for sending and receiving\
    \ data in order to\nincrease the network’s capacity. On the other hand, huge MIMO\n\
    makes signal interference more likely. Beamforming is used to\nincrease the throughput\
    \ of transmitted data and thereby solve this\nissue. Beamforming refers to an\
    \ antenna’s capability of directing\nfocused beams of radio waves at speciﬁc targets.\
    \ An advanced\nInternet connection provides very high (MW) operating\nfrequencies,\
    \ and the accompanying high bandwidth makes it\npossible for larger and more rapid\
    \ data transactions. In contrast\nto the static channels used by the 4G network,\
    \ the cognitive radio\napproach used by the smart network allows for device-speciﬁc\n\
    channel allocation.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant\
    \ Science\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nIn 2017, for the ﬁrst time, the 5G RuralFirst\
    \ project successfully\nplanted and harvested a crop using autonomous tractors\
    \ to sow\nseeds, drones to monitor crops, and machines to apply water,\nfertilizer,\
    \ and pesticides. The entire procedure was carried out\nwithout the need for any\
    \ laborers. Another initiative, Hands Free\nHectare, claimed a successful harvest\
    \ in 2018 (Al-Ghobari and\nMohammad, 2011). With greater technological breakthroughs,\
    \ 5G\nis projected to promote precision farming. As IoT-based network\ncoverage\
    \ grows, agricultural sector producers will beneﬁt greatly,\nallowing them to\
    \ manage farms, animals, and other assets from the\ncomfort of their own homes,\
    \ thanks to their big capacity, fast data\nspeed, and low latency. Smart technology\
    \ will help to advance IoT\nsensor connectivity to the next level, paving the\
    \ way for\nunprecedented innovation in smart farming components.\nImplementing\
    \ technology to automate, track, and monitor\nagricultural processes is a wise\
    \ solution to the irrigation problem.\nThe traditional irrigation method is fully\
    \ automated by using IoT\nintegration modules. However, with an advanced network\
    \ on the\nhorizon, smart agriculture will take off with lightning-fast\ndata transfer.\n\
    To improve farm produce quality, smart farming combines\ntraditional agronomic\
    \ practices with the IoT. The application of\nnew technology in agriculture can\
    \ assist farmers in reducing labor\nand costs while increasing crop yield and\
    \ production. To facilitate\nall of these agricultural beneﬁts, the IoT includes\
    \ a wide range of\ncomponents under digital and automated technologies. So, IoT-\n\
    based connectivity will vastly increase the impact due to low latency,\nhigh bandwidth,\
    \ and support for many sensors communicating at\nthe same time.\nThe IoT technology\
    \ platform already helps to increase\nproductivity and ensure proper resource\
    \ utilization through\nprecision agriculture. The implementation of IoT, on the\
    \ other\nhand, will help to accelerate the entire process with machine-to-\nmachine\
    \ services. The real-time data transfer capabilities of the IoT\nmodule can aid\
    \ in the rapid operation of these solutions, making\ndecision-making quick, robust,\
    \ data-oriented, and real-time. With\nan IoT-based network, these devices can\
    \ send real-time data about\nthe need for optimal irrigation, spoilt crops, and\
    \ their location to\nfollow-up machinery. Farmers can save time and money by\n\
    harvesting crops quickly and effectively with automated irrigation\nfor tomato\
    \ crop cultivation.\nThe key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n•\n\
    An efﬁcient IoT-based framework is proposed for tomato\ncultivation.\n•\nMoisture\
    \ levels in the soil are predicted with the help of IoT\nmodules to optimize the\
    \ irrigation system.\n•\nA mobile application is also developed that can help\
    \ farmers\nby providing useful information.\nThe remaining parts of the paper\
    \ are arranged as follows. Section\n2 discusses the literature review. Section\
    \ 3 explains the things used\nfor designing smart farming solutions. Section 4\
    \ details the proposed\nsystem and the methodology. The simulation setup and results\n\
    analyses are described in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2 Literature\
    \ review\nChen et al. (2019) discussed the proper utilization of water for\nthe\
    \ growth of tomatoes by using the fuzzy neural network with a\ngenetic algorithm\
    \ (GA). It predicted the volume of irrigation based\non the effect of greenhouse\
    \ and the growth of crops (Guha et al.,\n2021). Rodrı́guez et al (Rodr´ıguez-Ortega\
    \ et al., 2019). developed a\nsoilless technique to yield tomato crops through\
    \ the treatment of\nsalinity. Here, the salinity treatment was speciﬁcally used\
    \ to\nimprove the production of vegetables and nutritional imbalance\n(psychological\
    \ of plants) for crops. Zhai et al. (2015) proposed an\nidea for the cultivation\
    \ of tomatoes using saline water and the\nblossom-end rot technique. Implementing\
    \ these two yield methods\nenhanced the level of production.\nIn the study of\
    \ Shao et al. (2014), two levels of irrigation\ntechniques were designed for heavy\
    \ rain shelters and drainage\ntreatments for improving the productivity of crops.\
    \ An optimum\nirrigation management technique was designed for yielding quality\n\
    tomatoes through the proper arrangement of rain shelters (Keswani\net al., 2020;\
    \ Maroli et al., 2021; Mousavi et al., 2021). In the study of\nGil et al. (2019),\
    \ the smart grid system monitored the precision for\nirrigation of water on demand\
    \ using IoT. The authors added\ndesalination and solar energy processes in the\
    \ agricultural system\nfor efﬁcient cultivation.\nKrishna et al. (2017) designed\
    \ a smart farming method for\nintelligent water-saving irrigation using the Raspberry\
    \ Pi module\nand sensors. So, it automated the yielding of crops in a higher range\n\
    that regulates through IoT modules. Qiu et al. (2020) implemented\nan in-depth\
    \ process to collect phenotypic parameters for measuring\nthe growth of tomatoes.\
    \ This system precisely calculated the\ndeﬁciency of water level and fertilizer\
    \ with the help of a neural\nnetwork algorithm for the growth cycle of tomato\
    \ (Khamparia et al.,\n2020; Biswal et al., 2021). An intelligent irrigation system\
    \ was\ndeﬁned as the water requirement for the yielding of tomatoes\nduring a\
    \ various range of climate states by Mason et al. (2019). In\nthis study, smart\
    \ irrigation was used in an adverse situation through\nproper integration of the\
    \ IoT module, sensors, and connectionless\nenvironments (Chen M. et al., 2021).\n\
    In the agriculture industry, 4G/3G/NB-IoT wireless network\ntechnology is used\
    \ to connect IoT-based smart devices for the\npurposes of data sharing, precise\
    \ assessment, accurate calculation,\netc (Dell’Uomo and Scarrone, 2002). Although\
    \ the 3G/4G\nnetworking paradigm has shown much promise, there are still\nseveral\
    \ obstacles that may prevent it from being used to its full\npotential in the\
    \ agriculture sector. One of the main restraints is the\navailable working space.\
    \ Existing wireless networks do not reach out\nto rural areas or dense urban neighborhoods.\
    \ Channel\ncircumstances, resource allocation, ﬂuctuating data rates, and\nhandoff\
    \ problems between diverse networks all make it difﬁcult to\nfacilitate quality\
    \ of service (QoS) in 4G networks (Payaswini and\nManjaiah, 2014; Payero et al.,\
    \ 2017). Mobile devices in this network\nhave a short lifespan due to the utilization\
    \ of many antennas and\ntransmitters. Many modern agricultural sectors rely on\
    \ battery-\npowered technologies like drones and robots, but these have limited\n\
    usefulness in far-ﬂung crop ﬁelds. The number of IoT devices used\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n03\nin\
    \ smart farming, as well as the amount of research done on these\ndevices, is\
    \ growing rapidly, necessitating greater intelligence, speed,\nscalability, secure\
    \ communication capabilities, and processing\npower to handle the numerous complex\
    \ computational tasks and\nheavily utilized services. Having ultralow latency\
    \ in addition to high\nconnection is necessary for IoT devices to achieve quick\n\
    performance and low costs.\nThe current 4G networks (LTE) are limited in their\
    \ ability to\nenable such functionalities because they only permit connectivity\n\
    through IP-based packet switching (Zhaogan et al., 2007). The shift\nto 5G cellular\
    \ networks will eliminate these problems caused by\nprevious generations of wireless\
    \ technology. Due to advancements\nin 5G connectivity, farmers now have the option\
    \ of remotely\npiloting a drone over extensive distances, either manually or via\n\
    predetermined checkpoints (Faraci et al., 2018; Sinha and\nDhanalakshmi, 2022).\
    \ A farmer can get high-deﬁnition video\nstreams and other critical sensory data\
    \ and telemetry from drones\nin real time over the 5G cellular network, which\
    \ is more efﬁcient\nand reliable than previous-generation mobile networks\n(Bhattacharya\
    \ and De, 2021). Due to 5G technology, drones will\nnot need to carry a lot of\
    \ computing power and instead can upload\ntheir data to the cloud, where it will\
    \ be processed more quickly.\nTo demonstrate the importance of smart agriculture,\n\
    Thilakarathne et al. (2023) show a cloud-enabled, low-cost\nsensorized Internet\
    \ of Things platform for monitoring and\nautomating processes related to a tomato\
    \ plantation in a\ncontrolled indoor setting. We hope that the information gleaned\n\
    from this study will be used as a foundation for advancing smart\nagriculture\
    \ solutions that boost productivity and quality and pave\nthe way for a more sustainable\
    \ future.\nUsman et al. (2022) present a 6G use case for plant health\nmonitoring\
    \ using a terahertz (THz)-signal-based integrated\nsensor and communication system.\
    \ Precision agriculture is best\nunderstood as a smart management system with\
    \ the capacity to\ntrack and regulate plant health and water levels on both a\n\
    microscopic and a macro scale. The objective is to maximize\noutput while minimizing\
    \ waste of scarce resources. THz-based\nsensing technology, which can evaluate\
    \ plant health on a cellular\nlevel, combined with wireless sensor networks installed\
    \ within\ncrops to monitor multiple variables while making intelligent\ndecisions,\
    \ could have signiﬁcant implications for agriculture. A\nsustainable communication\
    \ infrastructure that takes into account\nthe needs of dispersed and adaptable\
    \ agricultural settings is\nnecessary for the integration and operation of such\
    \ a macro–\nnano-sensor system.\n3 Materials and methods\nThe growth and productivity\
    \ of plants depend mainly on how\nmuch water is formed during the seedling phase.\
    \ During this time,\nwater demand has an important effect on crops, which have\
    \ many\nenvironmental aspects like temperature, quality of soil, etc. The\napplication\
    \ of IoT in agriculture is limitless, which provides various\nintelligent devices\
    \ to improve yielding performance and proﬁt\n(Gomathy et al., 2020; Sivakumar\
    \ et al., 2020). However, there are\nvarious issues with investing in smart cultivation\
    \ and also difﬁculty\nin the development of agriculture-related IoT apps (Kamienski\n\
    et al., 2019; Conesa et al., 2021).\na) Hardware unit:\nThe information will inﬂuence\
    \ the development of IoT\nsolutions for farming, and there is a need to select\
    \ sensors to\ncreate the custom device that will collect data for the proposed\n\
    solution (Althar and Samanta, 2021; Guha and Samanta, 2021;\nZhang et al., 2021).\
    \ However, the quality of the sensors has a crucial\npart in production which\
    \ depends on the exactness of the collected\ndata and its consistency.\nb) Brain\
    \ unit:\nSmart agriculture should be used as data analytics for a design\nsolution\
    \ that will be helpful if yeomen cannot make sense of it, so\nthere is a need\
    \ to use powerful data analytics techniques and relate\npredictive algorithms\
    \ and machine learning methods for\ncollecting data.\nc) Maintenance unit:\nHardware\
    \ maintenance is a signiﬁcant challenge for IoT-based\nagriculture, while the\
    \ sensors are commonly used in the crop ﬁeld.\nThere are more chances for damaged\
    \ sensors, which needs to be\naddressed by making a smart device that is robust\
    \ and easy to\nsustain. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced with another sensor.\n\
    d) Mobility stage:\nSmart farming applications can be remotely monitored through\n\
    a smartphone or desktop computer for transmitting related yielding\ninformation\
    \ to the owner (Maheswari et al., 2021; Mekala et al.,\n2021). The integration\
    \ of devices should be autonomous and also\ncover enough wireless range to communicate\
    \ and send data to the\ncentral server.\ne) Infrastructure unit:\nA solid and\
    \ robust internal infrastructure needs to ensure that\nthe intelligent cropping\
    \ process performs well and securely handles\nthe data load in it.\nIf the process\
    \ disables the security, someone easily breaks the\nentire system and steals related\
    \ data or controls intelligent devices.\n3.1 Agricultural/crop production system\n\
    The cultivation model can be used to monitor or calculate the\namount of native\
    \ agricultural products, depending upon the\ncultivated area and supported by\
    \ the decision support system\n(Nagarajan and Minu, 2018). Figure 1 shows the\
    \ agricultural/crop\nproduction prediction factors.\nThe number of exports and\
    \ imports of agricultural products can\nbe derived from the prediction model of\
    \ the National Statistical\nOfﬁce’s (NSO) statistics database as depicted in this\
    \ section. The\nagricultural product crop and yielded area models are worked under\n\
    the production of the smart agricultural prediction model, which\nevaluates the\
    \ updated method as well as the predecessor observation\nmethod to reinterpret\
    \ it.\nlnAx,t = a0 + a1lnRPx,t−1 + a2lnRPy,t + a3lnAx,t−1\n(1)\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n04\nwhere\
    \ Ax,t is seeding in x yield design at t year, Ax,t−1 is seeding\nin x yield design\
    \ at t−1 year, RPx,t−1 is the marketplace value in x\nyield design at t−1 year,\
    \ and RPy,t is the market place value in y yield\ndesign at t year.\nY Dx,t =\
    \ b0 + b1WT1\nx,t + b2WT2\nx,t\n(2)\nwhere Y Dx,t is the crop in x yield design\
    \ at t year, WTx,t\n1 is the\nweather (temperature) in x yield design at t year,\
    \ and WTx,t\n2 is the\nclimate (amount of rainfall) in x yield design at t year.\n\
    The quantity of domestic products is the summation of\nagricultural products of\
    \ all individual yield areas and each\nfunctional value of it (Gurunath et al.,\
    \ 2018; Mohanty et al., 2019;\nBenyezza et al., 2021). The agricultural product\
    \ amount is the\nmultiplication of the ﬁeld with the crop model.\nThe demand method\
    \ of the crop is the multiplication of the\ndemand method per method in addition\
    \ to the demands of the\nwhole community. The resource purposes of agricultural\
    \ products\ndepend on export and import scenarios and other supporting\nfactors,\
    \ as depicted in Figure 1. The above equations must follow\n“Nerlove’s partial\
    \ adjustment model,” and the regional weather\ninformation can help concede the\
    \ prediction although there are\nsome missing values (El-Zawily et al., 2019).\n\
    3.2 Challenges in the purpose system\nDespite the many advantages that the 3G/4G\
    \ networking\nparadigm offers, there are still several obstacles that prevent\
    \ it\nfrom being used to its full potential in the agriculture industry.\nSpace\
    \ constraints pose serious problems. Current wireless networks\nare unable to\
    \ reach more remote places or crowded metropolitan\nneighborhoods. Supporting\
    \ the quality of service (QoS) in 4G\nnetworks is difﬁcult due to channel conditions,\
    \ resource\nallocation, varying data rates, and handoff problems between\nheterogeneous\
    \ networks. Due to the heavy use of antennae and\ntransmitters in this network,\
    \ the lifespan of mobile devices is short.\nIn order for Internet of Things devices\
    \ to deliver quick performance\nat low prices, ultralow latency must be paired\
    \ with a strong\nconnection. Due to the limitations of IP-based packet switching\n\
    connectivity on the existing 4G network (LTE), such features are\nnow unavailable.\
    \ These issues, which have plagued earlier\ngenerations of cellular networks,\
    \ will be eradicated with the\ntransition to IoT-based networks.\nDue to its massive\
    \ data capacity and speeds greater than 10 Gbps,\nIoT-based connection will be\
    \ able to link billions of devices. For both\ndownload and upload speeds, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to be up to 100\ntimes faster than their 4G and 4G LTE predecessors.\
    \ 5G can connect\nbillions of devices due to its increased bandwidth, in addition\
    \ to its large\ndata capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. The download and\
    \ upload\nspeeds of IoT-based networks will be up to 100 times faster than those\
    \ of\n4G and 4G LTE networks. Consequently, a 2-h movie that would take 6\nmin\
    \ to download on 4G would take less than 4 s to download on an\nadvanced network.\
    \ Technical speciﬁcations for 5G are being developed\nby the International Telecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU). The uplink peak\ndata rate is 10 Gbps, and the downlink peak data\
    \ rate is 20 Gbps per\nmobile station. Therefore, an IoT-enabled network is used\
    \ for the\nInternet of Things-based smart irrigation system, which allows for\n\
    remote monitoring of soil moisture and watering.\n3.3 Mobile application\nA mobile\
    \ application is accessed by farmers on farms. Using this\napplication, we can\
    \ make predictions utilizing insight data and the\ncollected cultivation insights\
    \ data (Dhanush et al., 2017; Hota et al.,\n2020; Maheswari et al., 2021). The\
    \ mobile application will provide\ncrop-relevant information like crop health\
    \ alerts, pest control, and\nwarehouse inventory managing warnings as shown below.\
    \ The key\nfeatures of mobile applications are as follows:\n•\nobserving yield\
    \ health facts (nutrient levels, pH levels, etc.)\nthrough the functionality of\
    \ yield inspection (Ahmadi et al.,\n2019),\n•\nthe application of organizing fertilizer\
    \ and insecticides for\nthe farm (Kiryushin, 2019),\n•\nautomating the irrigation\
    \ system and controlling water\nlevels as well as soil health over the farm (Al-Ali\
    \ et al.,\n2019; Li et al., 2020), and\n•\ntracing yield records and checking\
    \ warehouse details (bin\ninventories) (Quitaleg and Ortiz, 2020).\nFIGURE 1\n\

    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n05\n3.4 Impact of water quality on\
    \ tomato yield\nTomato yield is a broad view that encompasses the interactions\n\
    of various single-quality attributes. Irrigation water salinity\nenhanced tomato\
    \ amounts, fruit thickness, soluble solids, total\nacid, vitamin C, and the sugar–acid\
    \ ratio (Magán et al., 2008).\nFresh tomato yield, canopy diameter, fruit water\
    \ content,\ntomato ﬁrmness, and calcium and nitrogen concentrations\ndecreased\
    \ as water salinity levels increased, whereas increasing\nsalinity levels increased\
    \ texture strength (Shao et al., 2014). In\naddition, saline water irrigation\
    \ increased tomato fruit’s total\nsoluble solids and acidity (pH) by 11.1% and\
    \ 6.9%, respectively.\n3.5 Role of the contactless IR sensors for\ntomato crop\
    \ growth measurement\nThe contactless IR sensors are used to produce infrared\n\
    radiation to measure the plant’s growth from its stem, whereas\nthe radiation\
    \ is converted into some amount of electricity and is less\nthan 10 cm from the\
    \ target. In the proposed system, sensors are\nplaced more than 10 cm from the\
    \ plant, which will measure growth\nby using a method based on the speculation\
    \ of infrared energy. The\nIR sensors are ﬁtted with infrared ﬁlters to avoid\
    \ outside disturbing\nlight. IR sensors are ﬁtted to measure the thickness growth\
    \ of\ntomato crops through the analog output voltage. The energy\nradiations of\
    \ infrared sensors are transformed into distance data,\nwhich is not directly\
    \ propositional to distance data.\n4 Proposed system and methods\nThe evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) crop is described as the amount of\nwater necessary for the perfect growth\
    \ of various crops in\nconnection with the lack of water by evapotranspiration\
    \ which is\ndiscussed in this system. The demand for yielding waters refers to\n\
    an optimally developed harvest, so that a consistent, disease-free\ncrop is actively\
    \ cultivated and completely sheltered. An advanced\nnetwork can connect billions\
    \ of devices due to its increased\nbandwidth, in addition to its large data capacity\
    \ and speeds faster\nthan 10 Gbps. The download and upload speeds of smart networks\n\
    will be up to 100 times faster than those of 4G and 4G LTE\nnetworks. So, this\
    \ method is advantageous in addition to IoT\nmodules, which gives a perfect way\
    \ to produce tomatoes in the\nseasonal and non-seasonal periods. The cultivation\
    \ process is\nmainly inﬂuenced by the following situations like weather, yield\n\
    type, and development stage of the harvest, which is depicted in\nFigures 2, 3.\n\
    The proposed system is integrated with the following\ncomponents which are described\
    \ below:\ni. Arduino Uno microcontroller:\nIt is an open-source microcontroller\
    \ that can be programmed\nby writing C or C++ code to control the overall system\
    \ automation.\nAfter installing and programming the Arduino, it is ready to collect\n\
    the number of inputs from IR moisture soil sensors and also provide\na remote\
    \ command to control the irrigation system. However, this\nmicrocontroller remotely\
    \ controls the overall execution process.\nii. NIR-soil moisture sensor:\nSoil\
    \ moisture is a main attribute of soil and an important soil\nproperty that plays\
    \ a vital role in a variety of farming activities,\nhydrological processes, and\
    \ environmental concerns. A near-\ninfrared (NIR) reﬂectance sensor is created\
    \ for the calculation of\nmoisture levels in the soil by implementing two light-emitting\n\
    diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths: one with a wavelength of\n1,945 nm and\
    \ a strong water absorption band and the other with a\nwavelength of 1,850 nm\
    \ and a weak water absorption band. It is\nlinked to an Arduino controller to\
    \ record the moisture level of the\nsoil. Accordingly, it gives instructions to\
    \ the water controller for\nirrigation in the tomato cultivation land.\niii. Pinolex\
    \ drip automatic water controller:\nThe smart ﬂower irrigation timer is an efﬁcient\
    \ way to manage\nand control tomato crop irrigation needs. When you go on vacation\n\
    or anywhere, an automatic water timer is set by the Arduino\nmicrocontroller,\
    \ which is useful for watering tomato cultivation.\nIt ﬁts a 3/4-inch (19 mm)\
    \ thread tap. It can water the plants\nregularly, even when no one is at home,\
    \ and thus improve their\nsurvival rate.\niv. Wi-Fi access point:\nFIGURE 2\n\
    The proposed system for the smart irrigation of tomato yields.\nSingh et al.\n\

    \ high-speed Ethernet wire links a router to an access point,\nwhich transforms\
    \ a connection-oriented signal into a\nconnectionless signal. Connectionless connectivity\
    \ is typically the\nonly available option for base stations, which use Wi-Fi to\
    \ establish\nlinks with destination devices. As a result, the Wi-Fi service is\
    \ linked\nto the 5G Internet, and it then provides a direct link with the end\n\
    user to remotely monitor and control automatic irrigation as well as\ntomato crop\
    \ cultivation.\n4.1 Working principle of the model\nThe purpose model generally\
    \ performs the operation in the\nfollowing steps:\nStep 1:\nFirst of all, the\
    \ NIR contactless sensor observes the moisture\nlevel of the soil. As a result,\
    \ it is connected near the tomato plant to\ncollect soil moisture. A ﬁeld’s soil\
    \ moisture status is critical for\nmaking planting, fertilizer application, and\
    \ irrigation decisions.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, the moisture levels are observed through\
    \ the Arduino\nUno module, which is also linked with a Wi-Fi access point to send\n\
    all the data to the mobile applications with the help of 5G\ntechnology. The 5G\
    \ network helps to gather the moisture levels\nthrough the cloud service and automatically\
    \ regulates the\nirrigation system.\nStep 3:\nWhen the moisture level is monitored\
    \ through the mobile app,\nthen the drip irrigation system is smartly controlled\
    \ through the\n5G-enabled IoT module (Arduino Uno microcontroller).\n4.2 Evaporation\
    \ and\ntranspiration processes\nEvaporation and transpiration happen at the same\
    \ time, and\nthere is no way to talk about them separately. The fraction of solar\n\
    radiation that reaches the cropped soil surface is used to calculate\nevaporation.\
    \ However, once the crop has matured to the point that\nit completely covers the\
    \ soil surface, transpiration becomes the ﬁrst\nprocess. IoT module sensors properly\
    \ calculate the moisture level of\nthe soil with the help of the calculation process\
    \ of ET.\nEvapotranspiration is commonly deﬁned in mm/time, and\nwater quantity\
    \ lost from a cropped plane is deﬁned in water\ndepth units. Because 2 hectares\
    \ has an area of 20,000 m2 and 2\nmm equals 0.002 m, a loss of 2 mm of water corresponds\
    \ to a loss of\n10 m3 of water per hectare. Finally, 2 mm day−1 corresponds to\
    \ 10\nm3 ha−1 day−l.\nThe quantity of energy received per unit area can also be\
    \ used to\ncharacterize water depths, with energy referring to the amount of\n\
    heat or energy required to evaporate free water. The latent heat of\nevaporation\
    \ (l) varies with the temperature of water. At 21°C, for\nexample, l is approximately\
    \ 2.50 MJ kg−1. To put it another way,\n2.50 MJ is required to evaporate 2 kg\
    \ or 0.002 m3 of water.\n4.3 Impact of weather on the yielding\nwater requires\
    \ reference crop\nevapotranspiration ETo\nThe main impact of weather information\
    \ on crop water\nrequirements is sunshine, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.\n\
    FIGURE 3\nTest scenario of the irrigation system.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nThe reference crop evapotranspiration\
    \ deﬁnes the evaporation energy\nof the atmosphere (ETo). Reference crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ also\nknown as reference evapotranspiration, is the evapotranspiration\nrate\
    \ from a reference surface that is not deﬁcient in water and is\nexpressed as\
    \ ETo.\nETo values measured in distinct locations or climates are\nequivalent\
    \ because they indicate identical reference surfaces.\nThese variables inﬂuencing\
    \ ETo can be parameters for climate,\nwhich can be measured using climate information.\
    \ ETo intimates at\na given location, the evaporating energy of the atmosphere.\n\
    In this research domain, different techniques are available for\ncalculating ETo.\
    \ It is tested either by an evapotranspiration pan or\ntheoretically by using\
    \ calculated weather information.\n4.3.1 Saucepan (pan) evaporation technique\n\
    The saucepan evaporation technique allows an environment to\nmonitor the combined\
    \ inﬂuence of temperature, moisture, wind\nspeed, and sunlight on the reference\
    \ yield evapotranspiration ETo.\nThe various evaporation pans are class A evaporation\
    \ pan and\nSunken Colorado pan. The evaporation saucepan is used in the\nfollowing\
    \ equation:\nETo = Kpan \x01 Epan\n(3)\nwhere Kpan is the pan coefﬁcient, Epan\
    \ is the pan evaporation,\nand ETo is the reference yield evapotranspiration.\n\
    4.3.2 Blaney–Criddle technique\nThe Blaney–Criddle method is a theoretical technique\
    \ to\ndetermine the reference yield evapotranspiration ETo, and more\nliterary\
    \ techniques have been used, but many of them were locally\ncalculated. If the\
    \ process is accessed locally, if it is available or if\nlocal procedures are\
    \ not available, then the theoretical method is\nused for the calculation.\nETo\
    \ = P(0:46Tmean + 8)\n(4)\nTmax = omonth(max)\nNdays=month\nTmin = omonth(min)\n\
    Ndays=month\nTmean = Tmax+Tmin\n2\n(5)\nWhere ETo = 1 month of average period,\n\
    Tmean = regular temperature, and\nP = regular proportion of yearly day time periods.\n\
    4.4 Impact of yield type on yield water\nrequires Kc\nThe single crop coefﬁcient\
    \ Kc plays a signiﬁcant role in crop\ncharacteristics as well as the averaged\
    \ effects of soil evaporation.\nAverage crop coefﬁcients are more relevant and\
    \ convenient than Kc\ncomputed on a daily time step using a separate crop and\
    \ soil\ncoefﬁcient for normal irrigation planning and management,\ndevelopment\
    \ of basic irrigation schedules, and most hydrologic\nwater balance studies (Farg\
    \ et al., 2012). The impact of yield type on\nthe yielding water requires dealing\
    \ with the yield type and the\ndevelopment yield stage on water needs. The ﬁeld\
    \ is harvested\nbetween the relationship of reference grown yield and grown yield.\n\
    ETY ield = ETo \x01 Kc\n(6)\nwhere ETYield = yield evapotranspiration process\
    \ (month/day),\nKc = yield inﬂuence, and ETo = reference evapotranspiration. Here,\n\
    ETYield and ETo are stated in equal units in month/day.\n4.4.1 Manipulation of\
    \ the overall growing stage\nFrom the beginning of transplantation to the last\
    \ day, the\noverall growing stage of the crop is determined. It is primarily\n\
    inﬂuenced by the following:\n•\nthe various harvest and its multiplicity,\n•\n\
    the condition of the weather, and\n•\nthe different stages of planting on the\
    \ ﬁeld.\n4.4.2 Manipulation of growth stages\nThe manipulation of the overall\
    \ growing stages of yield is\ndivided into four stages:\n•\nthe analysis of the\
    \ yield ﬁrst stage,\n•\nthe observation of the yield development stage in a ﬁeld,\n\
    •\nthe mid-time cultivation stage, and\n•\nthe late-time growth stage of the crop.\n\

    \ of the requirement of aquatic crops ETcrop is\nevaluated as:\nETcrop = ETo \x01\

    \ the given details of the crop.\nMethod of calculation:\nStep 1: The distinct\
    \ growth stages of crop estimation are\nconsidered (see Table 2).\nStep 2: The\
    \ month-wise tomato crop’s growth stages are\nobserved (see Table 3).\nStep 3:\
    \ The Kc factor for each of the four stages is estimated as\n(López-López et\
    \ al., 2014):\nKc, the starting stage of the crop = 0.45\nKc, the development\

    \ the complete growing\ntime of tomato crop, which is 638 mm.\n5 Simulation setup\
    \ and results analysis\nIn the proposed system, the related experimental data\
    \ are received\nthrough the installed soil moisture and humidity sensor from the\n\
    tomato crop ﬁeld. The NIR REES52 Soil Sensor is used to collect the\npercentage\
    \ of moisture in the soil. Based on this,an irrigation process is\nautomated with\
    \ a developed mobile application which is depicted in\nFigure 4. By using this\
    \ app, the status of soil moisture and the growth of\nplants can be dynamically\
    \ observed, and the irrigation method can also\nbe controlled. Similarly, the\
    \ plant growth parameters like maximum\nheight, width, and diameter of the stem\
    \ of the tomato plant are\nmeasured using an infrared sensor. This is tested in\
    \ a regional area\n28 m in length and 7 m in width, but the experimental site\
    \ is portioned\ninto two rows, and tomatoes are planted 4 m in length and 1.2\
    \ m in\nwidth zone. On the other hand, 50-cm-high PVC plates are applied for\n\
    separation from communities, and a 50-cm row spacing is followed for\nthe plantation\
    \ of tomatoes. Data are captured continuously from the\nﬁeld of cultivation. The\
    \ fog nodes are implemented for sensing data in\nthe area of cultivation. The\
    \ overall implementation of the proposed\nwork is depicted in Figure 5.\nThe cultivation\
    \ time to the collection period is from 1\nNovember 2020 to 18 April 2021, as\
    \ depicted in Figure 6, but it is\ndrawn from the above data (Table 4), which\
    \ is deﬁned in step 5. The\ncultivation of the tomato growth period is evaluated\
    \ as the crop\nsowing period to seedling period (November 1 to December 5), the\n\
    development stage of the crop period (December 6 to January 15),\nthe mid-time\
    \ stage (ﬂowering) of the growth period (January 16 to\nFebruary 5), and the late-time\
    \ stage of growth (fruiting and mature\npicking) period (February 6 to March 30).\
    \ The analysis of irrigation\ndata for tomato cropping depends on the relevant\
    \ factor of the soil\nmoisture sensor at 22 cm depth. This measure predicts the\
    \ volume\nof irrigation.\nBy the observation of moisture level from the above,\
    \ Table 5\nshows a dynamic way of the automatic required level of irrigation\n\
    for tomato cultivation (Figure 7).\nTable 6 shows a feature-wise comparison of\
    \ this paper with the\nexisting literature. The existing work has been mostly\
    \ considered\nunder normal cultivation methods. However, in the proposed work,\n\
    it is found that 5G technology is integrated with the IoT module. As\na result,\
    \ the irrigation system is working intelligently for\nthe cultivation.\nIn Table\
    \ 7, we can see how the 5G network stacks up against\nother existing network generations.\
    \ High-deﬁnition video streaming\nand telephony were made possible on the road\
    \ by 4G networks, an\nimprovement above 3G. As network trafﬁc has increased, the\n\
    theoretical maximum for 4G speeds has been reached. According\nto the ITU, the\
    \ most recent 5G use cases fall into one of three\ncategories: ultrareliable low\
    \ latency communications (URLLC),\nmassive machine type communications (mMTC),\
    \ and enhanced\nmobile broadband (eMBB).\nTable 8 shows that Odisha is in the\
    \ ﬁfth position all over India.\nThis table shows only the seasonal production\
    \ of tomatoes in India.\nIf the display of tomatoes is required to produce in\
    \ non-seasonal\nduration (August to October), then the state Odisha is considered\
    \ in\nthe third position. The implementation of the intelligent cultivation\n\
    method improves the situation in the production table.\nTable 9 shows the exportation\
    \ of tomatoes from India to other\ncountries. The export is done in the seasonal\
    \ duration of\nproduction, but it is required to export in a non-seasonal period\n\
    through intelligent irrigation techniques. Table 10 shows the\nimportation of\
    \ tomatoes to India in the case of seasonal duration.\nThe IoT-based intelligent\
    \ irrigation method provides a technique to\ncultivate tomatoes in the non-seasonal\
    \ period, so that there is no\nneed to import from outside of the country, which\
    \ gives better\nperformance than the traditional cultivation process.\n6 Conclusion\
    \ with future work\nIn this approach, traditional ﬁelds such as agriculture require\n\
    technology (here, smart farming) to achieve higher crop yields with\nless human\
    \ intervention in a limited time frame. Smart farming, on\nthe other hand, necessitates\
    \ signiﬁcant investment, improved\ncoverage and connectivity, and more bandwidth\
    \ to manage the\nTABLE 4 The water requirement for the complete growing time of\

  explanation: 'The study by Li and colleagues (2022a) employed near infrared (NIR)
    hyperspectral imaging combined with machine learning to assess the maturity of
    cucumber seeds. They proposed and evaluated a multiclass hierarchical classification
    strategy that involved the use of FT-NIR spectroscopy to capture spectral data
    from individual seed kernels.


    The machine learning model they developed was able to classify cucumber seeds
    into five distinct maturity levels with high accuracy, achieving an impressive
    99.69% overall accuracy. This demonstrates the potential of their approach for
    non-destructive, rapid, and accurate maturity assessment of cucumber seeds.'
  extract_1: The study by Li and colleagues (2022a) developed a single-kernel FT-NIR
    spectroscopy method for detecting the maturity of cucumber seeds, utilizing a
    multiclass hierarchical classification strategy and machine learning.
  extract_2: Their approach achieved an accuracy of 99.69% in classifying cucumber
    seeds into five maturity levels, demonstrating the potential for non-destructive,

    \ as the most basic \nsource of material security for human life, has received\
    \ \ngreat attention from various countries. In recent years, \nthe pace of agricultural\
    \ modernization and technological \ndevelopment has accelerated, and people have\
    \ gradually \ncombined agriculture with various types of high-tech and \nintelligent\
    \ algorithms, and the concepts such as “smart \nagriculture”, “precision agriculture”,\
    \ “digital agriculture”, \n“decision agriculture”, and “agriculture 4.0” have\
    \ emerged. \nThese developments are inseparable from the help and \npromotion\
    \ of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Looking \nat the current agricultural\
    \ production process, artificial \nintelligence is everywhere. However, most AI\
    \ applications \nare based on large amounts of data, and the data and time \n\
    cost problems they bring have gradually become new \nchallenges for farmers. In\
    \ response to these challenges, \ndigital twins have come to the forefront of\
    \ agricultural \nresearchers’ minds. Digital twin technology aims to build \n\
    mirror models of information in the hyper-real world, using \ncomputerized virtual\
    \ reality. For example, a model of a plant \ncan be constructed in which its physical\
    \ characteristics \nare transformed into digital information, and this digital\
    \ \ninformation can be used to make it grow naturally in the \nvirtual space beyond\
    \ reality. This makes it easier to develop \nand test new agricultural technologies\
    \ in virtual reality. This \nmeans that issues such as data and time costs are\
    \ no longer \na barrier to progress. Therefore, digital twins have become \nan\
    \ important research direction in the field of agriculture in \nthe future. This\
    \ paper introduces the typical application of \nartificial intelligence in agriculture\
    \ and the development of \ndigital twin technology in agriculture. \nThis paper\
    \ will outline and answer the following \nresearch question:\n· What is the current\
    \ state of development of artificial \nintelligence technologies in agriculture?\
    \ In the whole \nprocess of agricultural production, what are the main \ntechnologies\
    \ and applications of artificial intelligence \ntechnology for different agricultural\
    \ tasks in the \npreproduction, \nmidproduction, \nand \npostproduction \nstages?\n\
    · What is the “digital twins”? What are the basic \ncharacteristics and attributes\
    \ of the architecture based \non digital twins? What are the main technologies\
    \ and \napplication directions of the digital twins?\n· How to integrate digital\
    \ twin technology with \nagriculture? What is the impact of the introduction of\
    \ \nthe digital twins on the agricultural sector? What are the \nscenarios in\
    \ which digital twin technology can be applied \nin the agricultural sector and\
    \ truly benefit from it?\nAbstract: Affected by global economic pressure and epidemics,\
    \ sustainable agriculture has received widespread attention from farmers \nand\
    \ agricultural engineers. Throughout history, agricultural technology has closely\
    \ followed the pace of scientific and technological \ndevelopment and has followed\
    \ the footsteps of mechanization, automation, and intelligence to progress continuously.\
    \ At this stage, \nartificial intelligence (AI) is dominating the field of agriculture\
    \ and advancing the progress of sustainable agriculture. However, the \nlarge\
    \ amount of data required by AI technology and the high cost of data have ensued,\
    \ while the rapid development of virtualization \ntechnology has made people gradually\
    \ begin to consider the application of digital twins (DT) in agriculture. This\
    \ paper examines \nthe application of artificial intelligence technology and digital\
    \ twin technology in smart agriculture in recent years and discusses and \nanalyzes\
    \ the challenges they face and the future directions of development. We find that\
    \ digital twins have great potential for success in \nsustainable agriculture,\
    \ which is of great significance to advancing smart agricultural solutions that\
    \ achieve low cost and high precision \nto meet the growing demand for high-yield\
    \ production from farmers around the world. \nKey words: Smart agriculture, artificial\

    \ technology and digital \ntwin technology in agriculture at this stage? What\
    \ are the \npossible future evolution and development trends?\nThe remainder of\
    \ the paper is organized as follows. \nIn Section 2, starting from the three links\
    \ of the \npreproduction, midproduction, and postproduction stages \nof the agricultural\
    \ production process, the research and \napplication status of artificial intelligence\
    \ in the agricultural \nfield are introduced. An overview of the digital twins\
    \ is \ngiven in Section 3, followed by a description and analysis \nof its current\
    \ state of the art in agriculture. The challenges \nand possible future directions\
    \ of AI and DT in agriculture \nare discussed in Section 4. Finally, a brief conclusion\
    \ is \ngiven in Section 5.\n2. Artificial intelligence in agriculture\nAt present,\
    \ artificial intelligence agriculture dominates \nthe development direction of\
    \ modern agriculture, \nand researchers are committed to applying artificial \n\
    intelligence technology to the whole process of agricultural \nproduction. The\
    \ agricultural production process can be \ndivided into three stages: preproduction,\
    \ midproduction, \nand postproduction. Figure 1 shows the agricultural \nproduction\
    \ process after division. The application of \nartificial intelligence technology\
    \ in the preproduction, \nmidproduction, and postproduction stages of agricultural\
    \ \nproduction is briefly introduced to provide a reference for \nthe rapid and\
    \ effective transformation and improvement \nof intelligent agricultural technology\
    \ and the promotion of \nagricultural industrialization and modernization.\n2.1.\
    \ Preproduction stage of agricultural production\nIn the preproduction stage of\
    \ agriculture, “what are we \ngoing to grow?” is the question that people need\
    \ to consider. \nThe application of artificial intelligence technology to \nthe\
    \ preproduction stage is aimed at helping agricultural \nworkers to grasp the\
    \ prerequisites in the agricultural \nscene. At this stage, we focus on soil fertilizer\
    \ quality \ntesting, irrigation scheme design, seed quality testing, and \ncrop\
    \ yield and quality forecast to briefly introduce the \napplication of AI in agriculture\
    \ in the past five years.\n2.1.1. Soil fertilizer quality testing\nAt the preproduction\
    \ stage of the agricultural process, the \nquality of soil fertilizer plays a\
    \ decisive role in the growth \nof crops. The determination of the content of\
    \ minerals, \nnutrients, and other elements in the soil is an important \nindicator\
    \ to judge whether the soil is polluted (Jia et al., \n2021), and whether it is\
    \ suitable for planting a particular \nplant (Chen et al., 2019; Wilhelm et al.,\
    \ 2022), and whether \nit meets the nutrients required by crops (Kulkarni et al.,\
    \ \n2019). Therefore, it is vital to systematically test and \nevaluate soils\
    \ and fertilizers before planting. There are many \nsubstances in the soil that\
    \ affect crop growth. This paper \nsimply divides them into “human-eye distinguishable”\
    \ \nand “human-eye indistinguishable”, which are introduced \nin the following\
    \ contents respectively. Among them, the \n“human-eye distinguishable” substances\
    \ in the soil are \nmainly the residues from the previous cropping cycle while\
    \ \nthe “human-eye indistinguishable” substances in the soil \nrefer to the physical,\
    \ chemical, and biological indicators \nthat are hardly observable by human beings\
    \ alone and \nrequire the help of some professional detection tools, such \nas\
    \ the content of some trace elements, minerals, and the \nactivity of some microorganisms.\n\
    Firstly, the detection of “human-eye distinguishable” \nsubstances in the soil\
    \ is focused on plant residues that \nhave a major protective effect on the soil.\
    \ Not only do they \nreduce soil erosion and consolidate soil quality, but also\
    \ \nbring nutrients and improve soil structure for recultivation. \nHowever, the\
    \ workload of manually determining the types \nof residues and the coverage rate\
    \ of residues on large \nareas of land is undoubtedly huge and extremely time-\n\
    consuming, and it is subjective and uneven, and the error \nof the results is\
    \ uncertain with the experience of different \nobservers. In this regard, with\
    \ the help of machine vision, \nimage processing and other technologies, people\
    \ have \nproposed a series of reliable, consistent, and automated \nmethods. For\
    \ example, Tao et al. (2021) developed a \ndeep learning method MSCU-net + C,\
    \ which was used to \ndraw the residual coverage area of maize on high spatial\
    \ \nresolution satellite remote sensing images, and classify \ndifferent coverage\
    \ rates and measure the classification \naccuracy index. The results showed that\
    \ the average value \nof IoU increased from 0.8604 to 0.908, and the average \n\
    value of Kappa increased from 0.8864 to 0.9258. Another \nexample is the crop\
    \ residue level estimation using machine \nlearning methods for RGB images of\
    \ three different ground \nimage resolutions (GSD) by Upadhyay’s team (2022).\
    \ The \nRFE-SVM feature selection method was used to obtain \ncross-validation\
    \ scores up to 10 times better than other \nmethods, as well as residual cover\
    \ estimation by location \nfor classified images using a Bayesian-based classification\
    \ \nmodel.\nSecondly, the most familiar part of the “human-eye \nindistinguishable”\
    \ substances in the soil is the detection \nof soil salinity, followed by the\
    \ detection of nitrogen (N), \nphosphorus (P), potassium (K), and carbon (C),\
    \ which are \nthe main nutrients provided by the soil for crop growth. \nSoil\
    \ salinization is closely related to the sustainable \ndevelopment of agriculture\
    \ and is a phenomenon of \nsoil degradation. Therefore, it is of great significance\
    \ to \naccurately monitor soil salinization. Recently, the popular \nway of predicting\
    \ soil salinity is “Internet of things + \nmachine learning”, such as Wang et\
    \ al. (2021) and Wei et \nal. (2020) both used the way combination of “multispectral\
    \ \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n644\nimage acquisition + machine learning prediction\
    \ model” \nto predict soil salinity. Analyzing the nutrient levels of \nelements\
    \ in the soil and adjusting fertilizer planning to \ncrop needs can not only mitigate\
    \ the general environmental \ndegradation, climatic disasters, and economic losses\
    \ \ncaused by over-fertilization, but also increase crop yields \nand productivity.\
    \ Some typical examples of combining \nmachine learning with soil chemical element\
    \ prediction in \nthe last 5 years are presented in Table 1.\nAfter testing the\
    \ elemental content of the soil, scientific \nfertilization planning based on\
    \ soil nutrient status is the \nbasis for high-quality and high-yielding crops\
    \ (Chen et \nal., 2018; Nie et al., 2021). Uneven distribution and low \nutilization\
    \ of fertilizer will be caused by blind, mechanical \napplication of fertilizer,\
    \ which can even cause adverse \nconsequences such as soil pollution and excess\
    \ crop \nnutrients. Researchers have conducted research on this \nproblem. Chaganti\
    \ et al. (2019) used technologies such \nas machine learning, image processing,\
    \ and the Internet \nof things to optimize fertilizer use decisions on farms.\
    \ \nEscalante et al. (2019) used machine learning to determine \nthe optimal fertilizer\
    \ dose for specific barley varieties. In \nan application program developed by\
    \ Goyal et al. (2021), \nthe fertilizer calculator function provides the user\
    \ with the \nnumber of DAPs, MOPs, and kilograms of urea needed \nfor the crop\
    \ after entering the “crop type” and “number \nof hectares”. These efforts have\
    \ promoted the progress of \nfertilization methods in a more reasonable and accurate\
    \ \ndirection, all of which are of great significance to the \nsustainable development\
    \ of agriculture and the successful \nimplementation of precision agriculture.\n\
    2.1.2. Irrigation scheme design\nBesides soil, water is another decisive factor\
    \ restricting \nagricultural production. In the preproduction stage of \nagriculture,\
    \ proper irrigation planning is the basis for \nsustainable agricultural production\
    \ (García-Tejero et al., \n2011). The introduction of several artificial intelligence\
    \ \ntechnologies has made intelligent and automatic irrigation \npossible, while\
    \ irrigation management and decision \nmaking are continuously optimized, thus\
    \ advancing the \ndevelopment of fine agriculture and sustainable agriculture.\
    \ \nA typical AI-based intelligent irrigation system is shown in \nFigure 2.\n\
    The typical intelligent irrigation system shown in \nFigure 2 is mainly composed\
    \ of terminal monitoring part, \ngateway module, cloud service module, expert\
    \ decision \nsystem, and user terminal. The expert decision system is \na key\
    \ part whose main function is to process, calculate, \npredict, and analyze the\
    \ historical or real-time data in \nthe cloud system through a series of artificial\
    \ intelligence \nalgorithms to obtain the best irrigation decision. As can \n\
    be seen from the figure, the data affecting the decision-\nmaking are mainly irrigation\
    \ water quality, soil condition, \nreference evapotranspiration (ETo), precipitation,\
    \ crop \nfactor and other.\nAgriculture is inseparable from water, and the primary\
    \ \nconcern in the irrigation process is the quality of irrigation \nwater. Traditional\
    \ methods of irrigation water quality \nassessment are cumbersome and costly,\
    \ which increases \nthe burden of farmers. Therefore, the use of artificial \n\
    intelligence technology to predict and manage the quality \nof groundwater is\
    \ a valuable research direction at present. \nZhao et al. (2020) compared the\
    \ CAR-RR model and the \nadvanced CAR-SVR model they developed for depth \nmodeling\
    \ of the groundwater table with the support vector \nregression (SVR) model and\
    \ multiple linear regression \n(MLR) model, and they validated them in the Hetao\

    \ based on support vector machine (SVM), \nCubist, random forest (RF), and Bayesian\

    developed and evaluated Adaboost, random forests (RF), \nartificial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs), and support vector \nregression (SVR) models that predict the Berrechid\
    \ \naquifer in Morocco, promising in low-cost and real-time \nprediction of groundwater\
    \ quality.\nSoil conditions are mainly the determination and \nprediction of soil\
    \ temperature, salt content, and water \ncontent. The daily soil temperature (DST)\
    \ model proposed \nby Zeynoddin et al. (2019), the method for determining \nsoil\
    \ salinity levels and environmental conditions based on \nmachine learning proposed\
    \ by Bashir et al. (2020), and the \nResBiLSTM model for detecting soil water\
    \ content (SWC) \nproposed by Yu et al. (2020a), all provide important \ninformation\
    \ for irrigation demand forecasting. Soil salinity \nprediction has been briefly\
    \ outlined in Section 2.1.1 and \nwill not be repeated here. For soil moisture\
    \ content, the \nmode of “Internet of things + machine learning” is also \nthe\
    \ most widely used mode at present. Thus, Tseng et al. \n(2018) used drones to\
    \ collect images and compared seven \ndifferent prediction methods based on deep\
    \ learning; \nSingh et al. (2019) assembled data collected from sensors \ndeployed\
    \ in the field and weather forecast data from the \nInternet, to analyze and compare\
    \ multiple ML techniques \nto predict future soil moisture.\nReference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) reflects the impact \nof weather on crop water requirements. Using machine\
    \ \nlearning model, people can not only estimate the past and \ncurrent ETo more\
    \ accurately, but also predict the future \nETo value. With the continuous development\
    \ and progress \nof technology, people compare a variety of models to find \n\
    the best method to predict ETo. For example, Huang et \nal. (2019) evaluated CatBoost,\
    \ RF, and SVM models, of \nwhich CatBoost is a machine learning method based on\
    \ \ngradient-boosted decision trees; Ferreira and da Cunha \n(2020) evaluated\
    \ long-term short-term memory (LSTM), \none-dimensional convolutional neural networks\
    \ (1D \nCNN), CNN-LSTM in deep learning models, as well \nas artificial neural\
    \ network (ANN) and random forest \n(RF) in traditional machine learning models;\
    \ Ponraj and \nVigneswaran (2020) trained, validated, and tested datasets \nusing\
    \ multiple linear regression, random forest (RF), \nand gradient augmented regression\
    \ (GBR) algorithms; \nMohammadi and Mehdizadeh (2020) compared PL-SVR, \nRF-SVR,\
    \ PCA-SVR, and COR-SVR models and coupled \nthe whale optimization algorithm (WOA)\
    \ with the best-\nperforming RF-SVR to form a new hybrid called RF-SVR-\nWOA model.\
    \ In addition, researchers have also worked \nto find ways to use less information\
    \ while obtaining more \naccurate results. Nagappan et al. (2020) reduced the\
    \ input \nvariable dimensions from six to three when modeling \nbased on deep\
    \ learning neural networks (DLNN).\n2.1.3. Seed quality testing\nSeed quality\
    \ testing mainly includes purity analysis, variety \ndetermination, germination\
    \ test, viability determination, \nand health determination. Inspection and determination\
    \ \nof seeds by scientific and reliable methods, and thus \nevaluation of seeds,\
    \ are important tools for ensuring seed \nquality, calculating appropriate sowing\
    \ amounts, selecting \nsuitable seed batches, and making rational tillage decisions.\

    reserve of testers have restricted the results of seed quality \ntesting, and\
    \ have made the results lack accuracy and less \nscientific. At present, the seed\
    \ quality testing methods are \nalso mostly combined with “IoT + ML” and generally\
    \ use \nthe Internet of things technology to collect image and other \nsource\
    \ information, mainly spectroscopy, hyperspectral \nimaging (Zhang et al., 2021),\
    \ electronic nose, thermal \nimaging technology, and X-ray imaging technology;\
    \ then \nthe algorithms of machine learning, especially of deep \nlearning, are\
    \ introduced to assist model construction. \nFor example, Larios and his colleagues\
    \ (2020) used \ninfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and machine learning \nalgorithms\
    \ to distinguish soybean seed vigor, and in \ntheir cross-validation tests, high\
    \ and low vigor soybean \nseeds were discriminated with 100% accuracy. Another\
    \ \nexample, Tigabu et al. (2020) studied the potential of near-\ninfrared spectroscopy\
    \ in the rapid and nondestructive \ndetermination of Chinese fir seed viability,\
    \ and the average \nclassification accuracy of the test was 99% and above. In\
    \ \naddition, Zeng’s team (2019) worked on identifying and \nclassifying the maturity\
    \ stages of cucumber seeds in a \nnondestructive, accurate, fast, and inexpensive\
    \ manner. \nThe single-core near-infrared spectroscopy (SK-NIRS) \ntechnique they\
    \ proposed, successfully distinguished five \ncategories of cucumber seeds with\
    \ different maturity levels \nin a nondestructive state, and obtained an accuracy\
    \ of \n99.69%. These research results show the high adaptability \nand mutual\
    \ achievement of artificial intelligence and seed \nquality detection.\n2.1.4.\
    \ Crop yield and quality forecast\nCrop yield and quality forecasting is one of\
    \ the challenging \nissues in precision agriculture and an important task \nfor\
    \ agricultural decision makers. Accurate crop yield \nforecasting models can help\
    \ farmers decide what to plant \nand when to plant it, as well as help governments\
    \ develop \ntimely food policies, market prices, import/export policies \nand\
    \ proper storage. Crop yield forecasting is not an easy \ntask as crop yields\
    \ depend on many different factors such \nas climate, weather, soil, fertilizer\
    \ use and seed variety (Xu \net al., 2019). The mainstream method in recent years\
    \ is \nto apply artificial intelligence technologies (Paudel et al., \n2021) such\
    \ as machine learning and machine vision to \nforecast crop yield. \nPrior to\
    \ this, researchers have conducted extensive \nsystematic literature review (SLR)\
    \ work: Vaidya et al. \n(2022) focused on precision agriculture and examined \n\
    related work using hyperspectral remote sensing for \ncrop yield prediction and\
    \ estimation; Klompenburg et al. \n(2020) conducted an extensive study of the\
    \ literature on \nyield forecasting and summarized and analyzed it from \nthree\
    \ perspectives: prediction feature selection, machine \nlearning algorithm selection,\
    \ and evaluation parameter \nselection. The results show that the most commonly\
    \ used \nmethods are CNN, LSTM, and DNN; Koirala et al. (2019) \nreviewed methods\
    \ for fruit detection and yield estimation \nusing deep learning, and also recommended\
    \ methods such \nas CNN, LSTM, and deep regression.\n2.2. Midproduction stage\
    \ of agricultural production\nIn the midproduction stage of agricultural production,\
    \ \n“How are we going to grow?” is the core issue that \npeople need to consider.\
    \ At this stage, farmers expect \nhigh yields and high-quality returns through\
    \ newer and \nbetter farming techniques. Around this core goal, various \nagricultural\
    \ intelligent systems have been developed, and \nvarious disease detection and\
    \ control methods have been \nproposed to better answer the question of “how to\
    \ grow”.\n2.2.1. Various agricultural intelligent systems\nAgricultural expert\
    \ system is an intelligent computer \nprogram system, which integrates the knowledge\
    \ and \nexperience of agricultural experts and can deal with the \nproblems in\
    \ the process of agricultural production from \nthe perspective of experts (McKinion\
    \ and Lemmon, \n1985). It is well known that when solving agricultural \nproblems,\
    \ agricultural experts are usually required to have \nconsiderable experience\
    \ accumulation and research basis, \nand have high requirements for talents. However,\
    \ the \nhelp of agricultural experts is not always available when \nfarmers need\
    \ it. In order to solve the above problems, \nagricultural expert system uses\
    \ big data technology to \nintegrate relevant data into database, and establishes\
    \ \nmathematical model through machine learning, so as to \ncarry out heuristic\
    \ reasoning, which can effectively solve \nthe problems encountered by farmers\
    \ and scientifically \nguide planting. For example, Khalil’s apple tree knowledge\
    \ \nsystem designed by CLIPS with Delphi can help farmers \nget the correct diagnosis\
    \ and treatment of more than a \ndozen apple diseases (Khalil et al., 2019).\n\
    In addition, some systems support users to access \nthem through the Internet\
    \ and enter questions to obtain \nexpert-level answers. For example, Galala developed\
    \ a \nsystem for early date coconut disease diagnosis consulting \n(Galala, 2019);\
    \ Adi and Isnanto (2020) developed a rice \nmanagement expert system based on\
    \ positive chain and \ndeterministic factor method, including seed selection \n\
    consultation and pest detection consultation. Such Expert \nQuestion Answering\
    \ System can answer users’ questions \nin natural language with accurate and concise\
    \ natural \nlanguage, which is a research direction that has attracted \nmuch\
    \ attention and has broad development prospects \nin the field of artificial intelligence\
    \ and natural language \nprocessing (Hu, 2006). The emergence of Expert Question\
    \ \nAnswering System combines knowledge map with \nquestion-and-answer system,\
    \ simulates experts to answer \nfarmers ‘ questions one to one, and provides farmers\
    \ \nwith fast, convenient, and accurate query services and \nknowledge decision-making.\n\
    NIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n648\nRecording, monitoring, and controlling environmental\
    \ \nconditions in agricultural production is particularly \nimportant. Internet\
    \ of things equipment, wireless sensor \nnetworks, suitable sensors, and cloud\
    \ services embedded \nwith the capabilities of artificial intelligence and machine\
    \ \nlearning are the pillars of smart environmental monitoring \n(SEM). Intelligent\
    \ environment detection system plays \nan important role in intelligent or green\
    \ agriculture \n(Nayyar and Puri, 2016; Shahzadi et al., 2016; Sushanth \nand\
    \ Sujatha, 2018; Pathak et al., 2019). It can help people \nobtain soil health,\
    \ water analysis, water pollution level, \nwater level and other factors data,\
    \ and intelligent analysis \nis very important to obtain the sustainable productivity\
    \ of \nthe agricultural sector. In addition, agricultural intelligent \nsystem\
    \ includes weed identification system (Sabzi et \nal., 2018; Espejo-Garcia et\
    \ al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022b), \nagricultural decision support system (Hafezalkotob\
    \ et al., \n2018; Asher and Brosh, 2022), geographic information \nsystem (Manuel\
    \ et al., 2020), portable agricultural \ninformation system (Keerthana et al.,\
    \ 2018; Akhter et al., \n2021), etc.\n2.2.2. Crop disease detection and control\n\
    Plant diseases cause great losses to the production, \neconomy, quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products. \nTherefore, it is necessary to monitor the disease\
    \ of crops \nfrom the first stage of crop life cycle to before harvest. The \n\
    traditional method is a visual observation, which is not \nonly time-consuming\
    \ and labor-intensive, but also requires \nsupervisors to have a lot of professional\
    \ knowledge. To \nsolve these problems, researchers have proposed a series \n\
    of automated and intelligent disease detection methods. \nTable 2 lists some typical\
    \ cases of crop pest detection using \nartificial intelligence technology in recent\
    \ years.\nIt is not difficult to see from Table 2 that the main \nimplementation\
    \ methods of disease recognition are \ngradually moving from traditional deep\
    \ learning to few-\nshot learning. This is primarily because the algorithms \n\
    based on Deep Learning typically rely heavily on large \namounts of data. Deep\
    \ Learning driven by big data \nfaces the challenges of the high cost of data\
    \ acquisition, \nhigh cost of high-end hardware and high consumption \nof power\
    \ resources (Li and Chao, 2021b), which is not \nconducive to the sustainable\
    \ development of agriculture. \nIn order to conform to the sustainable development\
    \ of \nagriculture, researchers should focus on the trade-off \nbetween data quality\
    \ and quantity. For the data quality in \nthe agricultural field, Li et al. (Li\
    \ and Chao, 2021a; Li et \nal., 2021; Li et al., 2022b) believed that limited\
    \ good data \ncan defeat a large number of bad data. For the problem of \ndata\
    \ quantity, Yang et al. (2022a) examines the application \nof few-shot learning\
    \ in smart agriculture, and Nie et al. \n(2022) investigated sustainable computing\
    \ in intelligent \nagriculture. The results show that using small sample \nin\
    \ some agricultural tasks can achieve a better model \nalgorithm with less sample\
    \ data.\n2.3. Postproduction stages of agricultural production\nIn the postproduction\
    \ stage of agricultural production, \nit is necessary to consider the harvesting\
    \ of agricultural \nproducts, that is, to achieve the transformation of \nagricultural\
    \ product output to efficiency. The review \nof the postproduction stage of agriculture\
    \ mainly \nfocuses on the harvesting, inspection, and marketing of \nagricultural\
    \ products. Among them, the general trend of \nagricultural product harvesting\
    \ work lies in automation \nand robotization, while the current state of harvesting\
    \ \ntechnology for different types of crops has a different focus; \nagricultural\
    \ product inspection work mainly includes \nmaturity grading, quality inspection\
    \ and appearance \nclassification, and its mainstream technology lies in \ncomputer\
    \ vision technology; every part of agricultural \nproduct marketing work relies\
    \ heavily on the application \nof information technology.\n2.3.1. Harvest of agricultural\
    \ products\nCrop harvesting activities include harvesting, stacking, \nhandling,\
    \ threshing, cleaning, and hauling. These jobs \nare usually tedious and require\
    \ large labor and high \nrepeatability. Under the influence of increasing demand\
    \ \nfor agricultural products and labor shortage, the harvest \nof agricultural\
    \ products needs to improve the level of \nagricultural automation and roboticization.\
    \ \nFor cereal crops, such as wheat and corn, which mature \nevenly in the field,\
    \ large machines can be used to harvest \nthe crop efficiently and on a large\
    \ scale. For melon and fruit \ncrops, different fruits have different growth environment,\
    \ \nspatial location, geometry shape, size, color, hardness, \nand maturity, so\
    \ it is not suitable for uniform harvesting. \nAt the same time, factors such\
    \ as rugged orchard terrain \nand obstacle interference also increase the difficulty\
    \ of \nharvesting melon and fruit crops. The smaller harvesting \nrobots capable\
    \ of sensing and adapting to different crop \ntypes or environmental changes are\
    \ therefore required \nfor harvesting (Zhao et al., 2016; Silwal et al., 2017).\
    \ At \npresent, fruit harvesting robots can already use visual \nperception to\
    \ perceive and learn crop information, which \ncan complete camera calibration\
    \ (Wang et al., 2019), \ntarget recognition and localization (Yu et al., 2020b),\
    \ \ntarget background recognition (Feng et al., 2019), 3D \nreconstruction (Kusumam\
    \ et al., 2017; Blok et al., 2019; \nOnishi et al., 2019), robot behavior planning\
    \ based on \nvisual positioning (Gongal et al., 2015; Wibowo et al., \n2016),\
    \ and avoid complex factors interference localization \n(Xiong et al., 2018) and\
    \ other tasks. The object recognition \nmethods for these harvesting robots are\
    \ mainly single-\nfeature vision methods, multifeature fusion methods, and \n\
    deep learning algorithms. In addition, the study found \nthat for sweet potato,\
    \ potato, yam, taro, and other root \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n649\nTable\

    \ \nharvesting technology mostly stays in the way of manual \nmining, or semiman\
    \ and semimechanical harvesting at \npresent. There are few intelligent automatic\
    \ harvesting \ntechnologies for this kind of crop, and most of them remain \n\
    in the development of mechanical institutions (Bahadirov \net al., 2020; Matmurodov\
    \ et al., 2020) and the optimization \nstage of the automatic control system,\
    \ which need to be \nbroken through and improved.\n2.3.2. Inspection of agricultural\
    \ products\nWith the support of various intelligent algorithms, \nmicroelectronic\
    \ systems, nanotechnology, sensors, on-site \nrapid detection technology, and\
    \ remote data transmission \nand processing technology, the agricultural product\
    \ \ninspection, and detection system tend to be miniaturized \nand intelligent.\
    \ This paper mainly introduces the inspection \nof agricultural products under\
    \ the influence of artificial \nintelligence from three aspects of maturity classification,\
    \ \nquality inspection, and appearance classification. \n2.3.2.a. Maturity classification\n\
    Firstly, judging the maturity of agricultural products \nand choosing appropriate\
    \ preservation methods are the \nprerequisites for consumers to obtain fresh agricultural\
    \ \nproducts. The ripening process of fruit is usually \naccompanied by changes\
    \ in color, aroma, texture, and \npattern. These changes are usually gradual,\
    \ subtle, and \ninappropriate for human judgment. Using artificial \nintelligence\
    \ can quickly and accurately grasp these changes \nthat are not obvious in the\
    \ eyes of people, so as to judge the \nimmaturity, maturity, and decay of agricultural\
    \ products. \nUsing artificial intelligence, researchers have proposed \nvarious\
    \ detection methods of fruit ripeness based on \nsound, light, color, and taste,\
    \ and combined them with \nintelligent algorithms (Balbin et al., 2018; Gutierrez\
    \ et al., \n2019; Zhang et al., 2020). The method of fruit ripeness \ndetection\
    \ using acoustic vibration (Fadchar et al., 2020) \nis a typical example of the\
    \ abovementioned sound-based \nmethods; the light-based detection methods mainly\
    \ \ninclude spectral technology and hyperspectral imaging \ntechnology (Pu et\
    \ al., 2019; Garillos-Manliguez et al., \n2021); the color-based fruit ripening\
    \ detection methods \nuse color feature extraction technology (Alfatni et al.,\
    \ 2020; \nZhong et al., 2021); and there is no doubt that methods \nusing the\
    \ electronic nose (Jia et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021) \nexemplify taste-based\
    \ approach. At this stage, spectral \ntechnology and hyperspectral imaging technology\
    \ are \nstill the mainstream. However, the expensive equipment \nlimits their\
    \ large-scale application and development, and \nlow-cost photodiode-based fruit\
    \ maturity estimation \n(Giovenzana et al., 2015; Bhatnagar et al., 2019) may\
    \ \nbecome a more popular direction in the future.\n2.3.2.b. Quality inspection\n\
    The quality and safety of agricultural products is directly \nrelated to people’s\
    \ health, and its quality testing is mainly \ndivided into two aspects: component\
    \ content testing and \ndamage testing. Firstly, for ingredient content detection,\
    \ \nthe easiest way is of course to cut it open and conduct \nchemical inspection.\
    \ However, due to the consideration \nof food protection and sustainable agriculture,\
    \ in \nrecent years, people have been striving for physical \nnondestructive testing.\
    \ Taking fruit sweetness analysis as \nan example, Tran et al. (2021) used a simple\
    \ spectroscopic \nsystem with a classifier based on machine learning they \ndeveloped\
    \ and trained to detect apple sweetness, with \na maximum accuracy of 91.5%; Nguyen\
    \ et al. realized \nthe precise sweetness classification of mango by using \n\
    low cost visible near infrared ( VIS-NIR ) multispectral \nsensors and random\
    \ forest ( RF ) classifier. Secondly, \nthe nondestructive damage detection of\
    \ fruits is of great \nsignificance for screening bad fruits and fruit grading.\
    \ The \ndamage of agricultural products is divided into internal \ndamage and\
    \ surface damage. Here, the surface damage can \nbe classified as appearance classification\
    \ of agricultural \nproducts, so internal damage is mainly introduced here. \n\
    Traditional physical methods include magnetic resonance \nimaging (Thybo et al.,\
    \ 2004), acoustic localization (Yoshida \net al., 2018), computer tomography (Meberg\
    \ et al., 2001) \nand so on. However, these methods are either complicated \n\
    to operate, expensive, or not compatible with different \nfruits, so they are\
    \ not suitable for large-scale production \npractice. Therefore, researchers have\
    \ proposed to apply the \ndeep learning algorithm. Only by determining the internal\
    \ \ndamage of a small number of samples to train the classifier \nmodel, the machine\
    \ can quickly and reliably predict the \nsituation of a large number of fruits.\
    \ In the nondestructive \ndetection of withered kernels in shelled walnuts, Zhai\
    \ et \nal. (2020) used walnut images and weight information \nto fuse the training\
    \ of the machine learning algorithm, \nand achieved 97% classification accuracy\
    \ with only 0.001 \naverage cost calculation time.\n2.3.2.c. Appearance classification\n\
    The classification of agricultural products according to \ntheir appearance characteristics,\
    \ such as size, shape, color \nand so on, is also an important step before their\
    \ sales work. \nHowever, the efficiency of manual operation is low and \nthe influence\
    \ of subjectivity is large, and the accuracy rate \nof pure mechanical operation\
    \ is low. That is why people \nwant to apply artificial intelligence to the classification\
    \ \nof agricultural products. After the introduction of a very \nreliable inspection\
    \ tool-machine vision technology, the \nfruit can be accurately and efficiently\
    \ identified and \nclassified according to the color, texture, shape, disease\
    \ \ndefects, and other characteristics, which is helpful to \nincrease yield,\
    \ reduce production time and improve quality \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n\
    651\ncontrol (Ayyub and Manjramkar, 2019). Such methods \nhave been relatively\
    \ mature at this stage, so the problems \nto be considered have gradually shifted\
    \ from the method \nitself to how to put them into practical application.\n2.3.3.\
    \ Sales of agricultural products\nThe final work of the postproduction stages\
    \ of agricultural \nis the sale of agricultural products, which needs to \nbe\
    \ processed, packaged, transported, and sold. In the \ntransportation process,\
    \ most agricultural products are \nperishable, which inevitably leads to certain\
    \ losses. People \nwill be based on the Internet of things radio frequency \n\
    identification technology is applied to this, through the \ndynamic way to obtain\
    \ product information, so that \nmanagers can monitor the whole circulation process,\
    \ \nreal-time tracking. In this way, it can effectively plan the \nquantity of\
    \ product storage and transportation, reduce \noperating costs and prevent transportation\
    \ losses. In \nthe sales process, artificial intelligence technology can \nbe\
    \ applied to collect data on production, consumption, \nstorage, and circulation,\
    \ and in-depth analysis of the whole \nmarket. It can effectively understand the\
    \ current level of \nagricultural development, prevent sharp rise or fall, and\
    \ \npromote more stable product transactions. In addition, \nthe online marketing\
    \ of mobile or PC-side e-commerce \nplatforms built by artificial intelligence\
    \ and Internet \ntechnology can maximize the use of online integration \nadvantages\
    \ to effectively integrate information resources, \nreduce production costs, and\
    \ improve the relationship \nbetween suppliers and consumers. At the same time,\
    \ based \non the Internet of things and mobile network technology \n(Zhou and\
    \ Zhou, 2012), the information management \nof agricultural production and circulation\
    \ process, the \ntraceability management of agricultural product quality \n(Yang\
    \ et al., 2018), the management of agricultural product \nproduction archives\
    \ (origin environment, production \nprocess, and quality detection), and the establishment\
    \ \nof agricultural product quality and safety traceability \nsystem based on\
    \ website and mobile phone short message \nplatform (Tian, 2017; Zheng et al.,\
    \ 2021) can realize the \ntraceability of the whole quality and service of agricultural\
    \ \nproduct quality and safety, improve the brand effect of \ntraceability agricultural\
    \ products, and ensure the quality \nand safety of agricultural products.\n3.\
    \ Digital twins in agriculture\n3.1. Overview of digital twins\n3.1.1. General\
    \ definition of digital twins\nReview history, the prototype of digital twins,\
    \ “mirror \nspace model”, was first conceived by Michael Grieves in \n2003 (Githens,\
    \ 2007). In 2010, the National Aeronautics \nand Space Administration (NASA) adopted\
    \ two identical \naircrafts, one was the native and the other one was \nthe twin,\
    \ to realize the comprehensive diagnosis and \nprediction function of the flight\
    \ system, which led to the \nconcept of “digital twins” (Piascik et al., 2010).\
    \ In 2014, \nMichael Grieves provided another detailed definition \nof digital\
    \ twins. He proposed that the basic framework \nof the digital twins system should\
    \ include the physical \nspace, the virtual space, and the flow of information\
    \ and \ndata connecting the two spaces (Grieves, 2014). With the \ndevelopment\
    \ of related technologies, the definition of the \nterm “digital twins” has been\
    \ more widely discussed by \ndifferent researchers and institutions. For example,\
    \ Mayani \net al. (2018) saw the digital twins as a bridge between the \nphysical\
    \ and digital worlds; Wanasinghe (2020) regarded it \nas an immersive data analysis\
    \ technique; Poddar (2018) and \nSharma et al. (2018) regarded it as a virtual\
    \ and simulated \nmodel or a realistic replica of a physical asset. Although \n\
    these definitions differ somewhat from each other, none of \nthem has ever departed\
    \ from the basic framework of the \ndigital twins.\nA general definition of digital\
    \ twins is that it refers \nto the establishment and simulation of a physical\
    \ entity, \nprocess, or system in the information platform. By \nintegrating physical\
    \ feedback data, assisted by artificial \nintelligence, machine learning and software\
    \ analysis, \na digital simulation is established in the information \nplatform,\
    \ and this simulation will automatically make \ncorresponding changes with the\
    \ change of physical entities \naccording to feedback. Ideally, digital twins\
    \ can self-learn \naccording to multiple feedback source data, and present \n\
    the real situation of physical entities in the digital world \nalmost in real\
    \ time. In other words, with the help of digital \ntwins, the state of physical\
    \ entities can be understood on \nthe information platform, and the predefined\
    \ interface \ncomponents in physical entities can be controlled (Schleich \net\
    \ al., 2017; Vatn, 2018; Liu et al., 2019).\n3.1.2. Basic architecture of digital\
    \ twins\nThe most typical and widely accepted DT framework \nstill consists of\
    \ three main components: “physical space”, \n“virtual space”, and “connections\
    \ between these spaces” \n(Grieves, 2014). Among them, the physical space contains\
    \ \nphysical assets, sensors, and actuators; the virtual space \nincludes multiphysics,\
    \ multiscale, probabilistic simulation \nmodels; and the connection between the\
    \ physical space \nand the virtual space ensures seamless data and drive \ncommand\
    \ exchange between these two spaces. With \nthe continuous expansion and upgrading\
    \ of application \ndemands, DT faces more service demands from different \nfields,\
    \ different levels of users, and different services (Qi \net al., 2021). At the\
    \ same time, the interconnection of all \nthings provides conditions for realizing\
    \ the information \nphysical interaction and data integration of DT. To facilitate\
    \ \nfurther applications of DT in more domains, researchers \nhave extended the\
    \ three-component DT framework. Tao \nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n652\nand\
    \ Zhang added “DT data fusion” and “service system” \nmodules to the original\
    \ framework which have only \n“physical space” and “virtual space”, and the connection\
    \ \nbetween them was also expanded accordingly. The six-\ncomponent framework\
    \ proposed by Parrott and Warshaw \nconsists of five enabling components and a\
    \ six-step \nprocess. Their work embodies “physical space” and “virtual \nspace”:\
    \ “sensors” and “actuators” in enabling components, \nand “act”, “create”, and\
    \ “communicate” in processes belong \nto physical space; while the enabling components\
    \ “data” \nand “analytics”, as well as the “aggregate”, “analyze”, and \n“insight”\
    \ processes belong to the virtual space; in addition, \nthe role of “integration”\
    \ is to connect the physical and \nvirtual worlds.\n3.1.3. Key technologies and\
    \ typical applications of digital \ntwins\nThe digital twins exists in virtual\
    \ form, which can not \nonly reflect the characteristics, behavior process and\
    \ \nperformance of physical objects in a highly realistic way, \nbut also realize\
    \ real-time monitoring, evaluation, and \nmanagement in a surreal form. Its ability\
    \ to present a \nsurreal mirror image of the target physical entity object \n\
    relies on the support of the following technologies: high-\nperformance computing,\
    \ advanced sensing acquisition, \ndigital simulation, high-fidelity modeling,\
    \ intelligent data \nanalysis, VR presentation, etc. By constructing digital \n\
    twins, not only the health state of the target entity can be \ndescribed perfectly\
    \ and meticulously, but also the deep, \nmultiscale, and probabilistic dynamic\
    \ state assessment, \nlife prediction, and task completion rate analysis can be\
    \ \nrealized through the integration of data and physics.\nThrough the integration\
    \ with artificial intelligence, \nmobile Internet, cloud computing, big data analysis,\
    \ \nand other technologies, DT has potential application \nvalue in many fields\
    \ involving physical and virtual space \nmapping, fusion, and collaborative evolution.\
    \ DT can be \napplied in different fields such as smart city, construction, \n\
    medical treatment, agriculture, freight, drilling platform, \nautomobile, aerospace,\
    \ manufacturing, electric power, and \nother fields.\n3.2. The applications of\
    \ digital twins in agriculture\nWith the current global expectations for the agricultural\
    \ \nfield, scientific and technological achievements such as \nagricultural artificial\
    \ intelligence technology, agricultural \nInternet of things technology, agricultural\
    \ data model \nanalysis system, and agricultural intelligent equipment \ncontinue\
    \ to emerge. Agriculture has basically realized \ndigitalization and networking,\
    \ is moving towards the \nstage of intelligence and virtualization. The emergence\
    \ \nof the agricultural digital twins system will realize the \norganic integration\
    \ of the physical entity of agricultural \nproduction and the digital cyberspace,\
    \ so as to realize the \nintegration of “connection-perception-decision-control”.\
    \ \nThis will support the better realization of accurate, efficient, \nand sustainable\
    \ smart agriculture, and provide new \nmomentum for the digital transformation\
    \ and upgrading \nof agriculture.\nAgricultural digital twins are mainly based\
    \ on the \nelements of the agricultural production process (physical \nentities)\
    \ as the object, focus on the digital solidification \nof agricultural knowledge\
    \ based on various types of \nproduction models, system rules, and data collections.\
    \ \nAgricultural digital twins are dedicated to constructing \nmultidimensional,\
    \ multiscale, multidisciplinary, and \nmultiphysical quantity dynamic virtual\
    \ models to portray \nthe attributes, behaviors, and laws of each element in the\
    \ \nagricultural production process to replace some complex \nexperiments in real\
    \ environments. Figure 3 shows a typical \nschematic diagram of an agricultural\
    \ digital twins system. \nIn the figure, the virtual model is constructed based\
    \ on \nagricultural entities and iteratively interacts and optimizes \nwith them\
    \ in the agricultural production process. Through \nthe data and information interaction\
    \ between the twin \ndata fed back to the 3D model and the physical world, the\
    \ \nintegrity of the digital world is continuously improved, \nand then precise\
    \ control over agricultural entities can \nbe achieved. The agricultural digital\
    \ twin system realizes \nthe simulation, monitoring, diagnosis, prediction and\
    \ \ncontrol of agricultural objects by constructing real-\ntime and accurate digital\
    \ mapping of physical objects—\nanimals, plants, and motion trajectories—in virtual\
    \ \nspace. According to the state of agricultural entities in the \nphysical world\
    \ and application requirements, quantitative \nprediction, and decision feedback\
    \ are carried out.\nDigital twins have been used less in agriculture in \nrecent\
    \ years. Our examination of it reveals its main \napplications as follows.\nAgricultural\
    \ product model was established to monitor \ncrop growth or determine crop quality\
    \ parameters. Li et al. \n(2022a) proposed a single-view leaf reconstruction method\
    \ \nof plant growth digital twins system based on deep learning \nResNet, which\
    \ provided important ideas and methods for \nsingle-view leaf reconstruction in\
    \ plant growth digital twins \nsystem. Evers et al. (2020) are committed to developing\
    \ \ndigital twins of greenhouse tomato crops, updating the \n3D simulation model\
    \ through real-time input of sensor \ninformation from real greenhouses, so as\
    \ to simulate the \ninteraction between crop quality, environmental factors, \n\
    and crop management. Pattanaik and Jenamani (2020) \ncreated digital twins of\
    \ three different mango varieties, \nAlphonso, Totapuri, and Kesar, and accurately\
    \ simulated \nthe cooling behavior of real mangoes according to the \nairflow\
    \ rate and temperature, so as to analyze and grasp \nthe cooling heterogeneity\
    \ and quality attenuation in \nthe process of mango export. Kampker et al. (2019)\
    \ \nestablished a plastic “potato digital twin” as a substitute for \nNIE et al.\
    \ / Turk J Agric For\n653\nreal potatoes to detect the impact and rotation of\
    \ potatoes \nduring harvest.\nThe environment model is established to obtain \n\
    decision support. The farm management simulation tool \nAgROS developed by Tsolakis\
    \ et al. (2019) allows the \nintroduction of static object layout characteristics\
    \ such \nas actual fields and trees, so as to carry out field tests of \nagricultural\
    \ robots or autonomous unmanned ground \nvehicles (UGV) in quasireal environment.\
    \ Jo et al. (2018) \nproposed an intelligent pig farm based on digital twins \n\
    to improve animal welfare, and conducted a feasibility \nstudy on it. Alves et\
    \ al. (2019) established a digital twins \nintelligent farm using sensing data\
    \ from soil detectors, \nweather stations, irrigation systems, and equipment to\
    \ \nobtain visual return and decision-making suggestions. \nMoghadam et al. (2020)\
    \ developed an automatic dynamic \ncrown monitoring system, AgScan3D +, which\
    \ is now \nused in mango, macadamia, avocado, and vine orchards \nand generates\
    \ digital twins of 15,000 trees. It uses a \nrotating 3D camera to create a digital\
    \ twin model for each \ntree in the orchard, and monitors the health, structure,\
    \ \npressure, fruit quality, and other indicators of each tree to \npredict pressure,\

    \ \nof the European IoF2020 project.\n4. Discussion\nThis chapter focuses on “AI\
    \ in agriculture” and “DT in \nagriculture”, and discusses and analyzes the challenges\
    \ \nand future development trends of these two technologies \nin agriculture at\
    \ this stage. In Subsections 4.1 and 4.2, the \nchallenges and development trends\
    \ of AI in agriculture are \ndiscussed respectively, while the corresponding contents\
    \ \nof digital twin are discussed in Subsections 4.3 and 4.4.\n4.1. Challenges\
    \ of artificial intelligence\nThe survey shows that the abovementioned AI \ntechnologies\
    \ \nare \ncutting-edge \nagricultural \nscience \nresearch hotspots, and their\
    \ applications run through the \npreproduction, midproduction, and postproduction\
    \ stages \nof the agricultural production process. They have helped \nto achieve\
    \ intelligent management and precise control, \nimprove production efficiency\
    \ and product quality, and \nreduce environmental pollution and energy waste.\
    \ They \nhave shown excellent performance and great application \npotential and\
    \ have undoubtedly played a role in promoting \nwork related to agricultural sustainability.\
    \ At the same \ntime, we find that AI in agriculture, especially in the field\
    \ \nof agricultural sustainability, still faces many challenges:\n· Various artificial\
    \ intelligence technologies have \nnot been integrated and implemented with intelligent\
    \ \nequipment widely and on a large scale, and the intelligent \nagricultural\
    \ system still needs to be improved. On the \none hand, different types and growth\
    \ cycles of crops have \ndifferent growth states, which makes the agricultural\
    \ \nanalysis model not have a universal; on the other hand, the \nhigh cost or\
    \ lack of key technologies and equipment makes \nit impossible for various intelligent\
    \ algorithms to be put \ninto agricultural production on a large scale. Therefore,\
    \ \nmost of the research on it is still in the process of algorithm \ndevelopment,\
    \ which fails to enable farmers to truly enjoy \nthe convenience of artificial\
    \ intelligence algorithms.\n· The application of AI in various fields of agriculture\
    \ \nlacks in-depth analysis with relevance. The factors involved \nin agricultural\
    \ production are complex. Regions, seasons, \ntypes of crops, production environments,\
    \ and operating \nmethods all affect the application effect of various \nintelligent\
    \ technologies. At the present stage, most of the \nstudies only stay on the acquisition\
    \ and surface analysis \nof agricultural data. They fail to start from the excavation\
    \ \nof agricultural production laws and lack the deep analysis \nof error laws\
    \ with the correlation between theory and \npractice.\n· The global level of agricultural\
    \ automation and \nintensification is uneven, and there is a technological \n\
    gap between developing and developed countries. The \nmain manifestation is that\
    \ developing countries are prone \nto form shortcomings in basic theory, core\
    \ algorithms, \nkey equipment, high-end chips, and major systems and \nsoftware\
    \ of agricultural artificial intelligence.\n· Artificial intelligence technology\
    \ in agriculture is \ninseparable from the support of a large amount of data,\
    \ \nand how to obtain high-quality data information is one of \nthe challenges\
    \ in the future. Big data mining in agriculture \nis the process of extracting\
    \ potentially useful agricultural \ninformation and crop growth laws from a large\
    \ number of \nincomplete, noisy, fuzzy, and random agricultural data. At \npresent,\
    \ the segmentation and data mining of agricultural \nInternet of Things data resources\
    \ are still in the initial \nstage, and the intelligent algorithm models and practical\
    \ \ndatabases in various agricultural fields are in urgent need \nof expansion.\
    \ With the continuous updating and expansion \nof intelligent algorithms, at this\
    \ stage, the amount of data \nrequired and data costs are both increasing. At\
    \ the same \ntime, agricultural data obtained in the real world is limited \n\
    by the crop growth cycle, and the problems of complex \nacquisition methods and\
    \ long acquisition periods are also \na big challenge for researchers.\n· Restricted\
    \ by factors such as the shrinking global \neconomy, limited scientific and cultural\
    \ exchanges, sluggish \nhigh-tech development, lack of talents, and inadequate\
    \ \ninfrastructure, the infrastructure, policies and regulations, \ninvestment\
    \ in agricultural scientific research, and talent \npools in related fields adapted\
    \ to the development of smart \nagriculture gradually fail to meet the growing\
    \ demand for \nagricultural pressure. It is also a great challenge to balance\
    \ \nthe impact of unfavorable factors on the highly intelligent \ndevelopment\
    \ of sustainable agriculture.\n4.2. Future directions of artificial intelligence\n\
    Artificial intelligence technology, which has a broad \napplication space in agriculture,\
    \ is a pillar to promote \nsmart agriculture. Faced with the above challenges,\
    \ the \nfollowing suggestions for the possible development of \nartificial intelligence\
    \ technology in agriculture are put \nforward as follows:\n· Attention should\
    \ be paid to the improvement of \nthe computing force and technology implementation\
    \ of \nagricultural AI. The computing force is one of the important \nefficiency\
    \ indicators of agricultural AI. Conventional AI \nalgorithms are too computationally\
    \ intensive to be directly \nintegrated and applied to traditional IoT systems.\
    \ The \nlightweight and efficient algorithm models, such as Few-\nshot Learning\
    \ and so on, are easy to embed in IoT devices \nand compute at the edge of the\
    \ devices, thereby realizing \nAI applications on the IoT devices.\nNIE et al.\
    \ / Turk J Agric For\n655\n· Research and development of more universal \nagricultural\
    \ artificial intelligence equipment, strengthening \nstandardization and standardized\
    \ management, and \nimproving the level of agricultural intelligence on \na large\
    \ scale and without threshold are necessary. \nArtificial intelligence equipment\
    \ is an important part \nof artificial intelligence technology, among which the\
    \ \ncore technologies such as artificial intelligence chips and \nintelligent\
    \ sensors need to be developed and optimized. In \norder to meet the different\
    \ performance requirements of \nagricultural application scenarios, it is necessary\
    \ to carry \nout continuous and in-depth research, formulate relevant \nstandards\
    \ around the integration of AI technology and \nagricultural IoT, agricultural\
    \ machinery equipment and \nagricultural big data, and develop agricultural artificial\
    \ \nintelligence terminal equipment with lower cost and \nhigher robustness.\n\
    · People should focus on the fact that technology \ndevelopment and information\
    \ security go hand in hand, \nfocus on agricultural data security, and build a\
    \ green \ndata-sharing model. The development of agricultural \nAI technology\
    \ relies on data. Agricultural data have \nthe characteristics of large volume,\
    \ various types, and \nwide sources. It is necessary to ensure the security of\
    \ \nagricultural data and information systems to ensure the \nsafe production,\
    \ accurate management, and intelligent \ndecision-making of agriculture. At the\
    \ same time, \nestablishing a safe, efficient, and mature agricultural \ndata\
    \ open sharing mode can promote not only the rapid \ndevelopment of intelligent\
    \ agriculture, but also the \ninevitable trend of the environment.\n· The cross-integration\
    \ of different fields should be \npromoted to lead to the transformation of the\
    \ modern \nagricultural development mode. In order to meet the \nincreasingly\
    \ diversified agricultural production tasks, it \nis necessary to promote the\
    \ integrated development of \nagricultural AI in different fields. For example,\
    \ integrating \nthe real-world agricultural process with the virtual-world \n\
    agricultural model can reduce the cost and time cycle of \nagricultural data acquisition\
    \ and accelerate AI technology \niteration in the real world.\n4.3. Challenges\
    \ of digital twins\nAs a cutting-edge technology, the digital twin technology\
    \ \nhas received widespread attention from industries that it \nwill revolutionize.\
    \ Driven by technological updates and \nhistorical experience, the digital twins\
    \ can almost reflect \nall aspects of products, processes, or services. However,\
    \ the \nstudy found that the current potential of the digital twins \nin agriculture\
    \ is far from being realized, and there are still \nmany challenges in the development\
    \ of agricultural digital \ntwin technology: \n· It is easy to see that digital\
    \ twin technology is still in \nits infancy and rising stage in the agricultural\
    \ field, and the \ntechnology and tools need to be developed. Researchers \nhave\
    \ to collect and merge various types of data to model \nall the different parts\
    \ of an agricultural object or system \nfrom scratch, which will be a complex\
    \ and lengthy process.\n· How to form and design cognitive digital twins? At \n\
    this stage, although some low-level operations can be \nimplemented autonomously\
    \ without human intervention, \nmany decision-making activities still need to\
    \ be maintained \nby manual operations based on human interaction. How \nto enable\
    \ spontaneous and intervention-free simulation \nfree from human control and seamless\
    \ interaction among \nmultiple models is also a major challenge in the research\
    \ \nprocess.\n· DT offers real-time simulation possibilities for the \nproduct\
    \ lifecycle and can even help integrate the entire \nsupply chain through all\
    \ stages of its lifecycle. However, \nconnecting data information collected, aggregated,\
    \ and \nexchanged between different suppliers, manufacturers, and \ncustomers\
    \ in a virtual space, or fusing digital twin models \ndeveloped using different\
    \ DT architectures, technologies, \ninterfaces, communication protocols, models,\
    \ and \ndata, can pose interoperability issues. Therefore, the \ndevelopment of\
    \ standard-based interoperability for digital \ntwin applications is undoubtedly\
    \ another major challenge \nfor digital twin technology.\n4.4. Future directions\
    \ of digital twins\nSince its inception, the digital twin has shown great \npromise\
    \ in many aspects. With the further development of \nits technology and the increasing\
    \ maturity of agricultural \nvirtualization technology, everything in the physical\
    \ \nworld may be replicated in digital space by digital twin \ntechnology in the\
    \ future. The following are some outlooks \non future applications of the digital\
    \ twin in agriculture: \n· Digital twin technology will become the best \npractice\
    \ in various agricultural sectors. DT supports \nmanufacturing and controlling\
    \ the entire life cycle of \na product or process and therefore can model complex\
    \ \nlinks in agricultural production processes from physical \nto virtual in order\
    \ to obtain agricultural information. \nFor example, by constructing the plant\
    \ model, the crop \nlife cycle and environmental changes can be accelerated \n\
    in the virtual space, so that the data of each stage can be \neasily obtained.\
    \ By constructing virtual workshops and \npreviewing robot motion planning schemes\
    \ to simulate \nthe real-world agricultural product processing, and then \nmapping\
    \ the virtual data information to the real robot, the \nfully automated processing\
    \ and production can be realized \nto reduce the production cost of agricultural\
    \ products. By \nconstructing the virtual farm breeding environment, the \naccurate\
    \ simulation of animals from organs, tissues, and \nsystems to the whole can be\
    \ realized, so as to obtain the \nknowledge database of animal living environment,\
    \ animal \nnutrition needs, and variety breeding.\nNIE et al. / Turk J Agric For\n\
    656\n· Industry standardization will allow different models, \ndifferent systems,\
    \ and even different domains to interact \nand respond to each other. While different\
    \ physical objects \ncan interact with each other naturally and without barriers,\
    \ \nthe problem of interaction in virtual spaces requires the \ncreation of application-specific\
    \ interfaces and functions. \nIndustry specifications and interface standardization\
    \ of \ndigital twin technology will enable the models to have \nprogrammability,\
    \ interoperability, etc. so that they can \nbe interoperated between different\
    \ production systems \nand application areas in the virtual space. For example,\
    \ \nan apple tree model constructed by one person using DT \ncan be planted accessibly\
    \ in a pear tree population model \nconstructed by another person, and a series\
    \ of feedback \ninformation on growth conditions can be obtained.\n5. Conclusion\n\
    In this paper, we focus on artificial intelligence and \ndigital twin technology\
    \ in sustainable agriculture, review \nand summarize the application of artificial\
    \ intelligence \ntechnology in each stage of the agricultural production \nprocess\
    \ in the past few years, briefly outline what digital twin \nis, and review the\
    \ current status of digital twin technology \nin agriculture. The results of the\
    \ inquiry are as follows:\n(1) Application: A range of AI technologies run \n\
    through the whole process of agricultural production \nand are applied to all\
    \ aspects of the production process. \nIn contrast, compared with the application\
    \ of AI in \nagriculture, the application of DT in agriculture appears \nto be\
    \ stretched.\n(2) Challenges: There is still a lot of work that can \nbe done\
    \ to improve the field of agricultural artificial \nintelligence, especially in\
    \ terms of computing power \nimprovement, large-scale implementation, and multifield\
    \ \nintegration. Due to the specificity and complexity of \nagricultural production,\
    \ the challenges faced by digital \ntwin technology in this application are greater\
    \ than those \nin any other industry, and it will take time to achieve a real\
    \ \nbreakthrough in all aspects.\n(3) Future development: The research on digital\
    \ twin \ntechnology in agriculture is still in its infancy, and there \nare still\
    \ many problems that need to be solved urgently. In \nthe era of big data, the\
    \ origins and development of artificial \nintelligence and digital twin cannot\
    \ be separated from the \ndatabase, so their development should be complementary\
    \ \nto each other.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the National Natural\

    Abstract Our planet is facing a serious fresh water crisis and improved management
    of water resources presents significant research challenges. About 70% of the
    world''s fresh water is consumed by agriculture and water application efficiencies
    are typically low. Improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture would
    deliver substantial economic and environmental benefits. To help address the issue
    of low water application efficiency, wireless sensor network technologies can
    be combined with automation to support the efficient production of food in a increasingly
    water limited future. This paper reports on results of combining these approaches
    to irrigate an apple orchard, where existing irrigation scheduling was predominately
    based on time consuming manual acquisition of soil moisture data. The system developed
    allowed fully automated on-farm irrigation based on real-time feedback control
    which increased economic water use efficiency by 73% compared with manual irrigation.
    It is suggested that the application of real-time feedback automation would dramatically
    improve economic efficiency for irrigators with low water efficiency. Whereas,
    for those irrigators already achieving high water efficiency, adoption of the
    technology provides substantial labour and time savings. Previous article in issue

    \ a focus on improving water use efficiency. The study uses \nSCOPUS indexed publications\

    \ \nsubject. \nKeywords: intelligent irrigation, water efficiency, smart greenhouse,\
    \ internet of things, monitoring and control \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nDue to rising\
    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\

    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\

    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\

    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\
    Decision Support System \nWater management for irrigation requires extensive and\
    \ comprehensive data on dispersed and spatial agriculture. \nIn general, farmers\
    \ have difficulty processing their data because they do not have the experience\

    \ -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nmake irrigation management decisions; this is\
    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n5.2 \nFuzzy Logic Model \nA fuzzy logic\
    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \ncomputations, and output\
    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\
    \ \n6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \nThis review explored the various studies\
    \ and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient \noptimization,\
    \ and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing\
    \ IoT-based \nmonitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses.\

    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\

    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    \ Every aspect of the 21st century has undergone a revolution because of the Internet\
    \ of\nThings (IoT) and smart computing technologies. These technologies are applied\
    \ in many different\nways, from monitoring the state of crops and the moisture\
    \ level of the soil in real-time to using\ndrones to help with chores such as\
    \ spraying pesticides. The extensive integration of both recent\nIT and conventional\
    \ agriculture has brought in the phase of agriculture 4.0, often known as smart\n\
    agriculture. Agriculture intelligence and automation are addressed by smart agriculture.\
    \ However,\nwith the advancement of agriculture brought about by recent digital\
    \ technology, information security\nchallenges cannot be overlooked. The article\
    \ begins by providing an overview of the development of\nagriculture 4.0 with\
    \ pros and cons. This study focused on layered architectural design, identiﬁed\n\
    security issues, and presented security demands and upcoming prospects. In addition\
    \ to that, we\npropose a security architectural framework for agriculture 4.0\
    \ that combines blockchain technology,\nfog computing, and software-deﬁned networking.\
    \ The suggested framework combines Ethereum\nblockchain and software-deﬁned networking\
    \ technologies on an open-source IoT platform. It is then\ntested with three different\
    \ cases under a DDoS attack. The results of the performance analysis show\nthat\
    \ overall, the proposed security framework has performed well.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ blockchain; SDN; precision farming; cyber security; fog computing\n1. Introduction\n\
    Farming is the main source of food and contributes signiﬁcantly to the economy.\n\
    According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),\
    \ by 2050,\nthe demand for producing food must be increased by 70% to satisfy\
    \ the world’s demand.\nIn recent studies, 550 million people of the world’s population\
    \ are in nutrition deﬁciencies;\nevery day, around 820 million people are still\
    \ not obtaining food. The study says that\nthe world’s population will increase\
    \ to more than two billion, and most of the population\nwill live in cities. It\
    \ has also been observed that the population in India and Nigeria will\nincrease\
    \ to around 482 million between 2019 and 2050 [1].\nThe biggest challenging situation\
    \ arises with this population growth to achieve the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) of zero hunger [2]. These projections for the near\nfuture have an impact\
    \ on overall food demand. Because of the scarcity of water today, it is\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757. https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11030757\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/processes\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n2 of 27\ndifﬁcult to meet only 40% of the water supply\
    \ by 2030, and the unavailability of farming\nland will lead to a reduction in\
    \ the food supply. As a result, the agriculture sector needs\nsufﬁcient resources\
    \ than are presently available, as well as more self-sustaining systems\nto boost\
    \ cultivation percentages while reducing environmental resource use [3]. Though\n\
    it might be appropriate to reach rising demand, it is unclear how to do so in\
    \ an equitable\nand resilient manner. Again, there is a vital need to accelerate\
    \ and scale up the agricultural\nproduction transformation [4]. Agriculture 4.0\
    \ can provide a way to increase agricultural\nefﬁciency with the available crop\
    \ area. It also optimizes irrigation to use limited water and\nenergy and allocate\
    \ resources to protect crops effectively. Those would be possible through\nthe\
    \ integration of environmental monitoring, forecasting, and smart devices [5].\
    \ Smart\nfarming’s new technologies can enhance agricultural mechanisms, allowing\
    \ cultivation\nto increase while using natural resources efﬁciently. Agricultural\
    \ sector innovations are\nreferred to as the “digital agricultural revolution”,\
    \ which turns most factors of agriculture,\nensuing in more effective, efﬁcient,\
    \ self-sustaining, integrated, truthful, and self-reliant\nagriculture. Cellular\
    \ devices, sensors, data analysis, fog computing, information security,\nand intelligent\
    \ systems inﬂuence how technologies are integrated into the agricultural\nsector\
    \ [6].\nNowadays, agriculture is changing quickly as it enters a new age known\
    \ as Agriculture\n4.0. Agriculture 4.0 seeks to employ new technology and approaches\
    \ to address the issues\nfacing modern agriculture (such as climatic alteration,\
    \ illnesses, extreme application of\nresources, etc.) and to lower risks while\
    \ enhancing production efﬁciency and safety [7]. To\ndo this, it makes extensive\
    \ use of cutting-edge ICTs.\nIn addition to this evolution, there is a rising\
    \ trend in food needs. Given the continual\nevolution and the rising need for\
    \ food, it is anticipated that the market for agriculture 4.0\nwill expand greatly\
    \ in the years to come.\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) technologies are\nwidely utilized in Agriculture 4.0 and provide farmers\
    \ with a number of advantages,\nincluding observing numerous environmental factors\
    \ connected to crops, spotting crop\nillnesses, predicting yield, and lowering\
    \ labor costs [8]. However, the Sensor and network\nconnectivity and communications\
    \ in farming might act as a base factor for many types of\nattacks since these\
    \ devices frequently have obsolete or unpatched ﬁrmware or software [9].\nSecurity\
    \ is a top priority in agriculture, and any interruption or distortion may present\n\
    difﬁcult problems and have disastrous outcomes. Monitoring and categorization\
    \ of net-\nwork trafﬁc, which have attracted a lot of attention since the earliest\
    \ beginnings of the\nInternet, can be crucial to preventing network assaults [10].\
    \ Scientiﬁc research on network\ntrafﬁc categorization for IoT system security\
    \ has been extensive. It is an essential part of\nintrusion detection systems\
    \ (IDS) and aids in the identiﬁcation and detection of harmful\nnetwork activity.\n\
    This revolution in agricultural technology is built on having access to all the\
    \ data\nproduced by every sensor used on a farm, centralized via the internet,\
    \ and analyzed for the\nbest possible decision-making [11]. Any sensor employed\
    \ generates a signiﬁcant amount\nof data that can be extensively examined and\
    \ provides useful information to enhance crop\nquality or lessen environmental\
    \ impact. Cloud computing, physical hardware, and the\nIoT are the three key components\
    \ that enable the automation and data sharing needed by\nthis new smart agriculture\
    \ [12]. With the help of technical improvements (drones, sensors,\nsoftware, etc.),\
    \ we can complete agricultural jobs faster and more effectively than humans.\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 must make sure that an appropriate security mechanism is imple-\n\
    mented to avert an attack to build scalable and secure systems. The integrity\
    \ of data is\nimportant for the effective functioning of information technological\
    \ advances such as data\nanalysis and intelligent devices [13]. Because agriculture\
    \ 4.0 incorporates elements from\nconventional Internet, cellular, and wireless\
    \ technologies, which may include all of the\nsecurity risks that advancements\
    \ present situation. It also addresses current security risks\nsuch as data and\
    \ device integrity, consistency, and accessibility. Devices in agriculture 4.0\n\
    are implemented in outdoor spaces where they are subjected to external factors\
    \ such as ani-\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n3 of 27\nmals, human beings, or farming\
    \ equipment. Unknowingly, these factors remove or damage\nsensors. Since the 6th\
    \ century B.C., there has been a threat known as Agro terrorism [5].\nThis type\
    \ of terrorism could have a variety of goals, including causing ﬁnancial harm,\
    \ fear,\nand social unrest [6,7]. Terrorists could incite community disturbance\
    \ and lack of credibility\nin administration by exploiting agricultural and food\
    \ corporate crises, which can lead to\nundivided attention in the world. Cyber-agro-terrorism\
    \ in agriculture 4.0 is an electronic\nsystem in agricultural settings to harm\
    \ crops and animals while causing economic loss.\nCyber-agro-terrorists can operate\
    \ attacks on ﬁelds and through the internet, using cyber\nresources [8].\n2. Overview\

    4 of 27\nAgriculture 1.0: During the conventional agricultural age (1784–1870),\
    \ which was\ndominated by animal and human resources, the fundamental problem\
    \ with agriculture\nwas its lack of operational efﬁciency.\nAgriculture 2.0: During\
    \ the automated agricultural period of the 20th century, resource\nwaste was the\
    \ major problem.\nAgriculture 3.0: During the period of rapid advancement of automated\
    \ agriculture\n(1992–2017), the key problem was the lack of intelligence.\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0: the age of smart agriculture (which began in 2017 and is deﬁned\nby unmanned\
    \ operations) is primarily characterized by the application of contemporary\n\
    information technology to both support and intelligently improve agriculture.\n\
    The term “smart agriculture” [15] refers to a new approach to agriculture that\
    \ per-\nsonalized service through the integration of contemporary information\
    \ technologies such\nas the internet, big data, IoT, and many more [16]. In a\
    \ nutshell, the new mode is an\nintelligent agricultural solution that fuses current\
    \ information technology with agriculture.\nAlthough recent information technology\
    \ opens up new possibilities for the progress of\nagricultural output, it also\
    \ places heavy demands on security and privacy in the context of\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and poses signiﬁcant obstacles therein [17].\nMore than a movement, agriculture\
    \ 4.0 represents the next development in the sector’s\ntransition to a more intelligent,\
    \ effective, and environmentally responsible one. The supply\nchain’s daily operations\
    \ produce a tremendous amount of data [18]. Most of the time, this\ninformation\
    \ went unused, but thanks to big data and new technology, it can now be used\n\
    to boost any crop’s performance and productivity.\n2.1. Advantages of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\nThe effects of smart agriculture are covered in the following sections.\n\
    Production volume: The use of smart technology in agriculture can signiﬁcantly\n\
    boost the number of products produced on the farm. This will contribute to feeding\
    \ a\ngrowing population.\nProduction quality: The wellness and nutrition of people\
    \ from all socioeconomic strata\nin the nation can be signiﬁcantly impacted by\
    \ the quality of food produced. A country’s\npopulation will live longer and in\
    \ better health with better food, which will improve its\ncitizens’ economic contribution.\n\
    Effectiveness of farming practices and resource use: The application of smart\
    \ technolo-\ngies to conventional agricultural operations can increase their effectiveness.\
    \ In turn, this\nencourages more efﬁcient use of agricultural resources.\nIdeal\
    \ cost of cultivation: It is achieved when there is a balance between quantity,\
    \ quality,\nand efﬁciency in the procedures used. This results in a higher price\
    \ for the agricultural\noutput that is produced.\nReducing wastage: The farming\
    \ industry, one of the main economic sectors, is in great\npart to blame for the\
    \ massive quantities of food and other secondary resources that are\nwasted. Smart\
    \ technology could be employed to track and cut down on this waste.\nEcologically\
    \ sustainable: The reduced agricultural waste and improved agricultural\nprocess\
    \ efﬁciency directly reduce the environmental and ecological footprint.\nEffective\
    \ use of Time: Timely delivery of the necessary insecticides, fertilizers, and\n\
    other chemicals can provide timely and high-quality agricultural output with fewer\
    \ losses\nthanks to smart agriculture.\nThe farming industry may be at threat\
    \ by the following while deploying agricultural\n4.0 technology:\n•\nTheft of\
    \ business and customer data.\n•\nTaking resources under the control of sensors\
    \ and gadgets.\n•\nDestroying the objects that devices control.\n•\nDamage to\
    \ reputation if a data breach is disclosed.\nAgriculture 4.0 may be at risk from\
    \ infrastructure damage, sensor failures may affect\npoultry and cattle breeding,\
    \ and control system hacks may affect greenhouse farming. All\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n5 of 27\nof these could cause problems or malfunction in agricultural\
    \ operations by harming the\nIoT architecture’s hardware and software. In addition,\
    \ data-collecting technologies face\nchallenges from malicious assaults, unauthorized\
    \ access, privacy breaches, and other issues.\nThe landscape has shifted, with\
    \ AI and ML research concentrating on agro-based\ncontexts, water management,\
    \ livestock, and farmlands. Monitoring, control, and decision-\nmaking alternatives\

    \ The ﬁnal product is greatly\ninﬂuenced by the quantity and quality of the groundwater.\
    \ As a result, this system uses\nIoT approaches to maintain appropriate groundwater\
    \ levels.\nThough there are many smart agriculture alternatives, they are still\
    \ underdeveloped\nand offer a low degree of intellect. Many initiatives are limited\
    \ in their automated systems,\nwith the internet of things sending data to the\
    \ base station [53]. There is also no implemen-\ntation with the Internet in several\
    \ cases, except that in a few cases, data is stored in the\ncloud by the local\
    \ systems.\nThe multi-layer architecture of IoT used in agriculture 4.0 consists\
    \ of four layers,\nwhich are the physical layer, network layer, edge layer, and\
    \ application layer. Table 2 below\ngives a detailed description of Resources\

    \ these devices are all implemented in\nthe physical layer, which collects data\
    \ from the farming ﬁeld and digitizes them using\nan Analog to Digital converter\
    \ (ADC). As the equipment at the physical layer does not\ncompute and store the\
    \ data, this needs to connect with the edge layer through the network\nlayer.\
    \ The edge layer includes various resources such as decision-making, gateway,\
    \ data\nﬁlters, data security, and interfaces [55].\nThe advancement of devices\
    \ and technological developments will allow for the in-\ncorporation of more computer\
    \ capabilities into systems. This type of integration aims to\nmeet the various\
    \ needs of agricultural mechanization, farming techniques, and sustainable\nagriculture\
    \ [56,57]. A further issue is data security. This is very important to focus on\n\
    data privacy, the trustworthiness of data, and the correctness of data from generation\
    \ to\ndecision-making.\n2.3. Research Motivation\nThree factors serve as inspiration\
    \ for this article:\n1.\nSmart agriculture is a new paradigm that integrates information\
    \ technology with\nconventional farming as a result of the low productivity of\
    \ traditional agriculture\nand the extensive usage of information technology.\
    \ It has the potential to become the\nnext big thing in agricultural development.\
    \ Consequently, it is crucial to outline the\ncurrent manufacturing model and\
    \ particular studies [58].\n2.\nDespite substantial research on smart agriculture,\
    \ less has been conducted in compar-\nison to industrial security solutions to\
    \ analyze security problems.\n3.\nIt is crucial to examine the features of security\
    \ concerns in relation to situations\ninvolving smart agriculture [59]. This article\
    \ attempts to give a review of the security\nchallenges raised by smart agriculture\
    \ in light of the aforementioned variables, which\ninevitably results in a signiﬁcant\
    \ number of open research questions.\n2.4. Research Contributions\nThe research\

    \ with physical equipment such as sensors and actuators.\nPhysical devices can\
    \ fail due to unintentional or intentional human behavior, viruses,\nspyware,\
    \ or cyber-attacks. Smart farming applications use a wide range of sensors and\n\
    technologies, and this diversity opens up several security risks, including the\
    \ following:\nRandom device incidents: This is the unintended alteration of physical\
    \ equipment\nthat causes it to deviate from its normal performance. The physical\
    \ equipment may be\ndamaged by farm machinery, causing short- or long-term physical\
    \ damage, as a result,\ngenerates false data and affects data accessibility.\n\
    Mobile node hijacking: It is the theft of farm equipment such as tractors, drones,\
    \ and\nsowing robots. Drones can indeed be pesticides, fertilizers sprinkling\
    \ could be performed\nby Drone, and robots could do weeding detecting disease.\
    \ The intruder may access and\nuse the farm equipment remotely without having\
    \ access permission.\nFake node: An intruder introduces imitation or harmful nodes\
    \ into the automated\nagriculture ﬁeld to disturb the smooth functioning of the\
    \ system [55]. This attack could be\ntriggered by capturing a node and making\
    \ a replica of it. This type of attack typically aims\nto either alter or modify\
    \ data-shuttered devices and applications.\nAbnormal Measurement: It senses unusual\
    \ observations due to data falsiﬁcation,\nenergy exhaustion, radio radiation,\
    \ detection of various connections, extreme storms,\nmalfunctions, or wrong inputs.\
    \ Incorrect data can jeopardize making decisions that result\nin the analysis\
    \ of data will be inaccurate, which minimizes system correctness.\nSleeplessness\
    \ attack: The sleeplessness attack sends a series of seemingly legitimate\nrequests\
    \ in order to keep the devices awake for prolonged life. As a result, the device’s\n\
    battery runs out, and the device stops working [56,57]. When the devices are turned\n\
    off, the observed information is not properly sent, jeopardizing decision-making\
    \ and\nsystem efﬁciency.\n3.2. Security Risks at Network Layer\nThe objective\
    \ of this layer is to send the generated data by the sensors from the physical\n\
    layer to the most trustable computational unit, which is the cloud. The most common\n\
    attacks, which affect the resources used in the network layer, are focused on\
    \ [58,59]. The\nsecurity risks in network layers are:\nDistributed Denial of Service\
    \ (DDoS): It attempts to affect access to service providers\nby overburdening\
    \ the communication link or manipulating protocol ﬂaws, which cause\nresources,\
    \ such as CPU and memory collapse [60].\nDue to resource exhaustion brought on\
    \ by a DDoS attack, the victim server is forced\nto block connections from new\
    \ reliable clients. The victim server’s buffer capacity or\nbandwidth may have\
    \ reached its limit of resources. The overall probability of resource\nscarcity\
    \ at the target end is provided by Equation (1) [15].\nPAttack = 1 − (1 − PBandwidth)\n\
    \01 − Pmemory\n\x01\n(1)\nwhere,\nPAttack: Probability of total attack,\nPBandwidth:\
    \ Probability of Consumption of bandwidth\nPmemory: Probability of Consumption\
    \ of memory\nAttacks on Data Transit: These types of attacks aim to retrieve information\
    \ shared\nbetween network devices in order to obtain conﬁdential information [61].\
    \ An adversary\ncould intercept trafﬁc via malicious routers or man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks [62]. Intercep-\ntion of trafﬁc reveals conﬁdential data such as private\
    \ keys, access credentials, or digital\nsignatures.\nAttacks on Routers: They\
    \ plan to change network routes in order to gain trafﬁc control.\nInimical nodes\
    \ in IoT networks might attempt to reroute communicating paths during the\nProcesses\
    \ 2023, 11, 757\n10 of 27\nprocess of transmission. As a result of attacks, the\
    \ receiver might receive information lately,\npartially, or incorrectly, or not\
    \ at all [63,64].\nMalware Injection Attacks: The malware injection attack [34],\
    \ in which malware is\ninjected by an attacker into a connected computing device.\
    \ This is a very common attack\non smart farming. Malware is a very signiﬁcant\
    \ threat in distributed projects because it\nautomatically spreads through the\
    \ system, making it an appealing target for intruders.\nMalware damage comes in\
    \ multiple varieties of sizes. Malware can steal data about farm\nmaterial usage,\
    \ buying information for fruits, vegetables, and farm animals, data about\nfarm\
    \ equipment, and so on. It could hire automated devices to form a botnet that\
    \ would be\nused to commit harmful attacks under the inﬂuence of an intruder.\n\
    Botnet: At each architectural layer of the precision farming system, there are\
    \ numer-\nous IoT devices. These machines are vulnerable to attack and could be\
    \ taken over by a\ncentralized malicious system. This results in a ‘Botnet of\
    \ Things’ (BoT) [35]. A mutant farm\nworkforce IoT equipment that is already infected\
    \ [36] is easily used to infect other networks\nvia various communication links,\
    \ and thus automated farming could become an internet of\ndestructibility for\
    \ cyber illegitimates. The security features are not added in many of the\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture devices, but still, they are used frequently for establishing adequate\n\
    data security defensive system frameworks.\n3.3. Security Risks at Edge Layer\n\
    The edge contains important aspects that monitor, and control modules communicate\n\
    with all layers and access resources. The physical layer’s large volumes of data\
    \ can be\nprocessed locally rather than centralized in the cloud. The following\
    \ are major edge\nsecurity issues.\nActuator control Forge: It introduces false\
    \ measures of data into the system in order to\nmanipulate it. Typically, the\
    \ data is received by the gateway in plain text. Corrupted data\nwill lead to\
    \ poor decision-making. An opponent, for example, could inject incorrect soil\n\
    moisture measurements into a smart irrigation system to manipulate it.\nBooting\
    \ Attacks: Devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of security processes\n\
    during boot [37]. Memory cards and ﬂash drive sticks, for example, may detect\
    \ dangerous\ncodes which run at startup [38]. Suspicious booting practices could\
    \ launch numerous\nattacks on the edge with insufﬁcient protection.\nSignature\
    \ wrapping: The attacker modulates the cipher text by inserting a bogus\nelement\
    \ that allows you to perform a random Web Application requisition while identifying\n\
    as an authenticated user [39].\nMeasure infusion Forgery: It is the injection\
    \ of wrong speciﬁcations into a system in\norder to modify it. An attacker sends\
    \ known data patterns through actuators to the cloud\nstorage, which is then injected\
    \ into the system through computational units. Corrupted\ndata could lead to poor\
    \ decision-making.\nUnauthorized access: The process of validating is a critical\
    \ security component. The\nauthentication process is a technology that ensures\
    \ security and privacy, honesty, and\naccessibility [40]. Several agricultural\
    \ practices, however, use gateways with insufﬁcient or\nno access controls.\n\
    Gateway-cloud fabrication: The cloud and the gateway are linked by ISPs or wireless\n\
    connections. A network attacker could fabricate cloud requests by interrogating\
    \ a gateway.\nThe attacker could use these requests to change parameters in precision\
    \ agriculture, control\nqueries for sensitive services, or interpret system equipment.\
    \ The cloud can implement\nsecurity services as it has computational power. In\
    \ order to ensure maximum system\nreliability, these strategies must be incorporated\
    \ into the system.\n3.4. Security Risks at Application Layer\nThis layer provides\
    \ end-user assistance and data to process and make system decisions.\nThis layer’s\
    \ security concerns are application-speciﬁc, focusing on preventing data theft\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n11 of 27\nand ensuring privacy. Some of the attacks that\
    \ might affect cloud services and applications\nare listed below in terms of security.\n\
    Malicious scripts: Malicious scripts can deceive clients, infuse malicious data,\
    \ access\nconﬁdential material, and compromise security features. This type of\
    \ attack is frequently\ncarried out by cybercriminals for speciﬁc, economic, or\
    \ political reasons. They can damage\nor destabilize operational processes by\
    \ using malicious scripts, presenting unnecessary ad\ncampaigns, and stealing\
    \ money [41].\nPhishing: It is an attack that attempts to obtain highly classiﬁed\
    \ personal informa-\ntion, such as an Identity and password, fraudulently. Phishing\
    \ typically targets end-users\nthrough fraud and sites [42]. The attacker also\
    \ affects decision-making and internal opera-\ntions in many cases. The most effective\
    \ protection would be for users to remain vigilant\nwhile surﬁng the web [43].\n\
    Denial of Service (DoS): This threat disrupts service by overburdening trafﬁc\
    \ on the\nnetwork or ﬂooding the provider with repeated attempts [44]. Because\
    \ of ﬂaws in security\nsetup, an attacker can launch this attack from the Web\
    \ or a sub-system.\n4. Security Threats in Modern Agriculture\nFarmers typically\
    \ carry out the developed smart system initiatives in physical ﬁelds\nor green\
    \ ﬁelds. In Agriculture 4.0, most efforts are focused on water processes, disease\n\
    monitoring, seed production, and record keeping. It can be either automatically\
    \ con-\ntrolled or manually controlled. In both cases, the system monitors the\
    \ environment with\nsensors and changes it with actuators. Some initiatives only\
    \ digitize farms, whereas oth-\ners incorporate industry 4.0 or IoT technologies.\
    \ As an immature industry, open-ﬁeld\nagriculture is the focus of this work, with\
    \ security issues restricted to access control and\nweb-encrypted communications.\n\
    It is too difﬁcult to execute different security measures in rural areas since\
    \ there is a\nshortage of modern technical infrastructure and advanced technology.\
    \ Many difﬁculties\ncan arise if security measures are attempted in rural agriculture.\
    \ Table 3 lists a few of the\nsecurity challenges that are prevalent in rural\
    \ locations.\nTable 3. Rural-Agriculture Security Issues.\nRural-Agriculture\n\

    \ 4.0 projects have implemented IoT, but the security\nfeatures in that have become\
    \ disabled by default. It has been introduced that a server con-\ntrols and manages\
    \ these devices remotely via a web application. Opportunistic opponents\ndid not\
    \ know details about security resources. They gain unauthorized access to the\
    \ system,\ninsert fabricated measures, fabricate actuator controls, or report\
    \ earlier attacks to divert\nthe system from its normal functioning [45–64]. The\
    \ author proposed a smart watering\nsystem that remotely controls and observes\
    \ the ﬂow of water in the farm but is not focused\non security risks to detect\
    \ malicious attacks and unallowed access that manipulate the\nmonitored data.\
    \ To monitor the growing environment, ref. [65] introduce a Hydroponic\nFarming\
    \ Ecosystem (HFE). It is automatically controlled, and the client can monitor\
    \ the\nfarming via a web interface. These automated systems require high-security\
    \ concerns to\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n12 of 27\ndetect or avoid random sensor\
    \ incidents, weak sensors, wrong data injection, and other\nattacks, which could\
    \ corrupt data and affect system reliability.\nSimilarly, in [66], the author\
    \ focused on creating a system for monitoring ﬁelds based\non humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ light levels, and temperature. Irrigation can be controlled\nmanually or automatically\
    \ via web or mobile systems. An intelligent solution for detecting\ndiseases in\
    \ leaves focused in [67]. By using sensor data and camera images, the system\n\
    identiﬁes leaf diseases. A mobile or web application is used by the end-user to\
    \ interact\nwith the system. This paper does not go into detail about the implementation\
    \ of security.\nSimilarly, ref. [68] proposed an intelligent agricultural system\
    \ for information inter-\nchange among farm equipment. The article discusses the\
    \ system’s construction but makes\nno mention of manual intervention or remote\
    \ control, nor does it concern any security\nchallenges. As this is a data exchange\
    \ system, the DoS attack can affect the network layer.\nRef. [69] provides NETPIE,\
    \ a solution that gives agricultural product information. The\ngrowing environment\
    \ can be controlled and monitored with a set of physical devices. The\ngenerated\
    \ data is analyzed saved in a QR code, and which is then available to the customer.\n\
    NETPIE does not discuss security resources. Ref. [51] Introduced monitoring of\
    \ crop ﬁelds\nand watering using IoT, which measures data and controls data to\
    \ avoid unauthorized\naccess to these data but could not protect the other devices,\
    \ which leads to weak security,\nwhich might result in a major loss. Ref. [52]\
    \ Proposed a system known as SEnviro, which\nobserves the crop ﬁeld and detects\
    \ diseases remotely. This system does not focus on the\nprediction of disease,\
    \ but unauthorized access is controlled here.\nAccording to the relevant literature,\
    \ from a security standpoint, farming equipment\nis used without security features.\
    \ Furthermore, the gateway contains no security infor-\nmation. Transmission privacy\
    \ or device authentication is not presented in any of the\nabove-discussed systems.\
    \ Access control and management and encryption of data need\nto add security technologies\
    \ to Information dissemination. Smart agriculture is currently\na convenient target\
    \ for cyber criminals’ agents. Attacks can be motivated by a variety of\nfactors,\
    \ including an advertisement, intellectual, or even terrorist reasons. Terrorist\
    \ groups,\nfor example, can cause ecological loss to a country, economic chancers\
    \ may take part in\nmarket manipulation, and workers can attack a range of factors\
    \ [53].\n4.1. Data and Device Security Issues and Threats in Agriculture 4.0\n\
    As was previously mentioned, harsh environmental factors that can seriously harm\n\
    electromechanical equipment, such as extreme heat, moisture, moisture, shocks,\
    \ and other\nanomalies, have a direct impact on the agricultural sector [70].\
    \ The majority of these\nsensors are prone to failure, making it feasible for\
    \ them to produce inaccurate data and\ninstructions that could cause a manufacturing\
    \ disaster [71]. Additionally, sensors and\nnetwork equipment are predominance\
    \ reachable. This poses a serious risk to farmlands\nsince anybody with bad intentions\
    \ can access them and corrupt or harm them to cause\nthem to malfunction [72].\n\
    Another potential security concern is the online transfer of the information gathered\n\
    by IoT sensors and other agricultural machines. Major security concern in the\
    \ agriculture\nindustry is security, privacy, and control [73], as farmers may\
    \ incur a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial\nand personal loss in the event of a data breach.\
    \ Ref. [74] Divides the threats to conﬁdentiality\ninto four distinct categories:\n\
    •\nIntentional data theft through smart platforms and applications that do not\
    \ adhere to\nsecurity and privacy standards;\n•\nInternal information thefts from\
    \ a stakeholder in the supply chain intended to harm\nan agri-business or a farmer;\n\
    •\nUnethical data sales intended to reduce proﬁts for farmers or to harm them;\
    \ and\nother threats.\n•\nUnsupervised foreign access to private and sensitive\
    \ information using drones, sensors,\nand cameras with the intention of utilizing\
    \ them to harm farmers or jeopardize public\nsafety [64,75].\nProcesses 2023,\
    \ 11, 757\n13 of 27\nEvery application of modern technology, IoT in agriculture,\
    \ carries the aforementioned\ndangers, weaknesses, and threats. A more thorough\
    \ and complex explanation of the risks\nand their sources in aspects of cyberattacks\
    \ in the agro sector is provided in the following\nparagraph, which is primarily\
    \ focused on illegal behavior and exploited vulnerabilities in\nICT systems.\n\
    4.2. Cybercrime and Cybersecurity in Agriculture\nA cyber-attack on an agribusiness\
    \ or food industry is increasingly likely today thanks\nto automation and the\
    \ widespread use of internet-connected equipment, which give poten-\ntial (cyber)\
    \ criminals greater chances in ﬁelds that were previously too remote or difﬁcult\n\
    to physically access [61]. Consequently, a potential cyber-attack or security\
    \ problem in\nan agricultural organization could have serious human or ﬁnancial\
    \ repercussions. This\nimplies that pertinent security concerns brought about\
    \ by the widespread and ongoing\nusage of IoT, as well as the emergence of agro-terrorism,\
    \ require adequate attention, better\nequipment, and solutions [62].\nThe bulk\
    \ of system operations in the agriculture sector are network-based, and fre-\n\
    quently these systems are not protected from cyber threats, which can have substantial\n\
    ﬁnancial and security ramiﬁcations [76–86]. Five important elements, as identiﬁed\
    \ in [87],\nstrengthen these risks in the agricultural sector:\n•\nIncreasing\
    \ the farm consolidation highly depends on technology;\n•\nThe joint ventures\
    \ of the food supply chains, allow manufacturers to conduct processes\nand trade\
    \ products directly;\n•\nFood-related technologies in intelligent markets depend\
    \ on more components, which\nincreases their vulnerability to errors and malfunctions.\n\
    •\nEffective monitoring of food-related systems, social networks, and industries\
    \ in a safe,\ndynamic, and almost real-time manner is lacking, making it difﬁcult\
    \ to identify serious\ndigital and security vulnerabilities that could be the\
    \ root of signiﬁcant data breaches\nand system defects.\nDue to the heightened\
    \ risk of cybercrime, the agriculture sector may be impacted by\nsuch threats\
    \ in a number of ways. Categorize these methods as in [84]. Threats of tampering\n\
    include delivery disruption, conﬁdential information interception, formula modiﬁcation,\n\
    and delivery disruption. These risks are undoubtedly closely related to the adoption\
    \ and\napplication of technological advancements in the agriculture and food sectors.\n\
    Cooper et al. and Bogaardt et al. identify the following as the primary technical\n\
    advancement areas that are commonly used in the agri-sector and contain vulnerable\n\
    places for harmful cyber-attacks [86–88]:\n•\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID);\
    \ wireless communications (such as Wi-Fi);\n•\nSensors for the infrastructure,\
    \ soil, and crops;\n•\nDrones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);\n•\n\
    PA-speciﬁc automation solutions (such Real Time Kinematic Technology);\n•\nPortable\
    \ electronics (such as laptops, smartphones, and GPS trackers);\n•\nSmart agriculture\
    \ and vertical agriculture;\n•\nThe use of AI in conjunction with biotech and\
    \ nanotech (AI).\nTable 4 provides a summary of the study performed on different\

    [62,79,92,97,98]\n4.3. IoT Vulnerabilities, Risks, and Threats in Agriculture\n\
    IoT is made up of four main systems that make it possible to communicate between\n\
    nodes. Sensing technology, IoT gateways, cloud servers, data storage, and mobile\
    \ appli-\ncations for remote control make up an IoT system. The architectures\
    \ of IoT systems in\nagriculture come with current and new threats and vulnerabilities.\
    \ These ﬂaws can be\nlinked to IoT device hardware and software problems, communication\
    \ protocols, and also\ndata processing and storage solutions (found, for example,\
    \ in cloud infrastructures, data\ncenters, and smartphones) [2,11].\nAccording\
    \ to [99–101], the following is a concise but accurate classiﬁcation of the\n\
    primary causes of low security in the IoT:\n•\nFirmware that is not patched and/or\
    \ default passwords that have been used for a long\ntime allow for device compromise\
    \ in an IoT network.\n•\nBecause of the limited computing power of smart devices\
    \ and vendors’ efforts to\nkeep their prices low in a cutthroat market, it is\
    \ difﬁcult to incorporate complicated\ncryptographic algorithms.\n•\nFlaws in\
    \ the routing protocols used by smart devices (such as Bluetooth and ZigBee);\n\
    •\nThe Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol’s outdated, low-security version,\
    \ which is\nfrequently still in use;\n•\nConducting passive vulnerability detection\
    \ using search engines;\n•\nThe risk of assembling millions of smart devices into\
    \ a potent botnet (such as Mirai),\ngiven how simple it is to ﬁnd vulnerabilities\
    \ via internet scanning;\n•\nA general disregard for the security of smart gadgets\n\
    Finally, a variety of criteria can be used to categorize IoT vulnerabilities,\
    \ hazards, and\nthreats. These risks apply to all IoT applications, including\
    \ those in the agricultural sector.\nFirst, internal vs. external risks and passive\
    \ vs. active risks are the two basic classiﬁcation\ngroups of security concerns\
    \ in IoT systems in the agriculture sector [79].\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n15\
    \ of 27\nIoT hazards are categorized in another intriguing way using a layer-based\
    \ system.\nAccording to [22], each of the levels below integrates many technologies\
    \ that could lead\nto a variety of security threats, vulnerabilities, and/or breaches.\
    \ The application layer,\nmiddleware layer, internet layer, access gateway layer,\
    \ and edge technology layer are the\nﬁve main layers that make up the IoT architecture.\n\
    5. Existing Research on Security in Agriculture 4.0\nIn [54], the author states\
    \ that The United States Department of Homeland Security\nissued a report emphasizing\
    \ the signiﬁcance of agriculture 4.0 and the associated internet\nsecurity threat\
    \ and possible attacks.\nThe report emphasizes the information security model\
    \ of conﬁdential information,\ncredibility, and accessibility in farming. The\
    \ researchers of [55] suggested a new access\ncontrol solution that combines session\
    \ keys and public keys to speed up the encrypted\ncommunications tasks. It yields\
    \ quick and lightweight appropriate control measures\nthat are ideal for precision\
    \ agriculture communication. Ref. [56] Proposed a framework\nfor understanding\
    \ vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and their application in an\nintelligent\
    \ farming environment. The goal of the approach is to determine the level to\n\
    which intelligent farming emerging innovations are prone to cyber. It assesses\
    \ the threat\nprediction model using the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS).\n\
    Nowadays, The Blockchain is not only used in cryptocurrency but also utilized\
    \ in\nother ﬁelds and different applications such as in the medical sector, agriculture\
    \ sector,\netc. [57–59]. This article concentrated on the application of blockchain\
    \ technology to food\nsafety. For tracking and monitoring the food items and stages\
    \ of production, such as\ncultivation/breeding, raw resources, processing, transporting,\
    \ warehousing, and selling,\nthe author developed a system [60]. In addition,\
    \ the system employs a variety of sensor-\nbased equipment to adopt sustainable\
    \ recording and conﬁrmation with sensor-based\nveriﬁcation. Ref. [61] Proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based easy and simple security framework for\nsmart Greenﬁeld farming.\
    \ Each IoT node can nominate the cluster member’s leader, which\nhelps to avoid\
    \ a hot spot problem if an intruder focuses on the leader node. Furthermore,\n\
    the authors discussed the security risks of their suggested scheme, which adhered\
    \ to the\ntraditional conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability principles.\
    \ Ref. [62] proposed a cost-\neffective IoT-based security monitoring system.\
    \ The physical layer is the primary concern\nof this system of precision agriculture,\
    \ where data are collected from sensors. These data\nare sent to a controller,\
    \ which analyses it to take action, such as activating the actuators for\nwater\
    \ sprinklers on farms. Table 5 describes some of the recent research which has\
    \ already\nbeen performed on security issues related to smart farming.\nGupta,\
    \ M et al. explained [102] the necessity of clouds applied in vehicles in this\
    \ time-\nand location-sensitive context and present an extended access control\
    \ oriented (E-ACO)\narchitecture that is pertinent to IoV. Here, they describe\
    \ using scenarios to highlight access\ncontrol needs in our vision of cloud-assisted\
    \ connected automobiles and vehicular IoT, as\nwell as approaches to various access\
    \ control models that may be applied at different tiers\nof the E-ACO architecture\
    \ and in the authorization framework.\nGupta, M et al. [103], in their work, describe\
    \ an edge infrastructure-based solution to\nV2V and V2I communication that is\
    \ safe and trustworthy in place of direct peer-to-peer\nconnection. To approve,\
    \ check, and verify the authenticity, integrity, and anonymity of\ncommunications\
    \ sent in the system, they add trusted cloudlets in this section. Along with\n\
    a proof of concept implementation of the suggested approach on the AWS IoT platform,\n\
    they also describe a formal attribute-based model for V2V and V2I communication,\
    \ known\nas AB-ITS. This cloudlet-supported architecture supports crucial use\
    \ cases such as an\naccident or ice-threat warning and other safety applications.\
    \ It supplements direct V2V or\nV2I communication.\nSontowski, S. et al. [104]\
    \ presented a DoS attack that can impair a smart farm’s\noperation by interfering\
    \ with the functioning of installed on-ﬁeld sensors. They speciﬁcally\ncovered\
    \ a Wi-Fi de-authentication attack that makes use of ﬂaws in IEEE 802.11, where\n\
    Processes 2023, 11, 757\n16 of 27\nthe management packets are not encrypted. A\
    \ development board for the ESP8266 maker\nfocus When a Raspberry Pi is attached,\
    \ WiFi Deauther Monster is used to disconnect it\nfrom the network and stop sensor\
    \ data from being transferred to a distant cloud.\nThe notion of Activity-Centric\
    \ Access Control (ACAC) for smart and connected ecosys-\ntems was ﬁrst proposed\
    \ by Gupta, M. et al. in [105] and discussed in this article as a ﬁrst\nstep.\
    \ Here, they examined the idea of activity with regard to cooperative and dispersed\n\
    yet interconnected systems, identifying the many parties involved as well as the\
    \ crucial\nelements to consider when making an activity control choice. They provide\
    \ an initial\nframework for developing activity control expressions that may be\
    \ used by various smart\nobjects in the system.\nThe biggest obstacle to the growth\
    \ of cloud computing is security worries. Information\nsecurity continues to have\
    \ an impact on the market even though it raises inconveniences\nrelated to information\
    \ security. The threat of security breaches in the cloud infrastructure\nmust\
    \ be understood by clients. Cloud-computing capacity, networking, and computing\n\
    powers are brought to the edge by fog computing. One of the most critical challenges\
    \ with\nfog computing platforms is safety and security. Lightweight devices have\
    \ beneﬁted greatly\nfrom edge computing’s ability to complete difﬁcult tasks quickly,\
    \ but the technology’s hasty\ndevelopment has led to a general disregard for safety\
    \ risks in edge computing stages and\nthe applications they allow.\nIn our proposed\
    \ framework we have focused on the threats in fog computing-based\nIoT environment\
    \ via blockchain for the application in agriculture 4.0.\nTable 5. Related Research\

    \ is to acquire meaningful information from the external\nenvironment via sensors\
    \ to take required action against it. This sensor layer has a variety\nof Sensor\
    \ nodes of various forms and sizes. As a result, they all use the same basic compo-\n\
    nents, such as input and output components, information handling units, communication\n\
    segments, and many more units for the management of power sections. To analyze\
    \ and\nstore all detected data, it is sent to the relevant fog nodes. Furthermore,\
    \ Sensor nodes\nreceive instructions to undertake agricultural operations.\n6.2.\
    \ Fog Computing Layer\nThis layer is made up of multiple fog nodes, which are\
    \ insubstantial equipment that\ncarry out processing, communication, and storing\
    \ tools to do operations that an end device\ncannot perform. Not every piece of\
    \ data that is gathered becomes processed on the cloud.\nRather, this layer hosts\
    \ all authentic analysis and latency-sensitive applications.\nVirtualization:\
    \ Recognizing that conﬁguring several devices, in the same manner,\nmight be time-consuming,\
    \ the nodes can be contained inside a Virtualized environment for\na more pleasant\
    \ setup for all subsequent fog nodes.\nAgricultural Sensor data monitoring: This\
    \ node is going to collect real-time sensing\ndata, analyze it, visualize it,\
    \ manage devices, and store some of it locally. The user can\nobtain information\
    \ from the fog layer while smoothly synchronizing cloud-directed data.\nBlock-chain\
    \ Client software: This consists of a piece of programs that is installed on\n\
    the fog node. Its primary goal is to sync authentic sensitive Sensor data to the\
    \ Blockchain.\nIt is in charge of producing transactions, batching them, and sending\
    \ them to the validator\nso that they can be aggregated into blocks and recorded\
    \ to the Blockchain.\nSimulated Switch: Additionally, this node is used as a transmitting\
    \ device with the\nsupport of virtual switch software, which provides NFV and\
    \ SDN technologies to enhance\nnetwork services by establishing the routing features\
    \ for computational extension and\ncontrol. Some network virtual functions include\
    \ security, quality of service (QoS), and\nautomated control. The main objective\
    \ is to create switching layers for virtual machine\nenvironments while continuing\
    \ to support the OpenFlow protocol [107], which allows this\nnode to interact\
    \ directly with the SDN Controller; an outstanding demonstration of such\nimplementation\
    \ is Open vSwitch, an interactive multilayered software switch.\n6.3. Distributed\
    \ Network Using SDN\nThis network is made up of numerous geologically dispersed\
    \ and SDN controllers\nlinked to it that operates as a common Networking Operating\
    \ System (NOS), combining\nnominally autonomous operations with centralized control\
    \ [108]. The main component of\nan SDN network is the SDN controller. This can\
    \ help with network monitoring by managing\nall transactions among network and\
    \ application devices, allowing it to manage and adjust\nnetwork ﬂows more efﬁciently\
    \ in response to new requirements [109]. It maintains a\nconsistent glimpse of\
    \ the network from afar, delivering data to fog nodes via one APIs and\napplication\
    \ via other APIs (MQTT, CoAP...) [109]. In addition, the SDN controller employs\n\
    a Block-chain contractor to properly secure ﬂow tables of SDN in the Block-chain,\
    \ hence\navoiding rule counterfeit.\n6.4. Block-Chain Based Network\nTo keep all\
    \ the nodes up to date, all Blockchain modules are interconnected and con-\nstantly\
    \ exchange the most updated information in the Blockchain among themselves. Smart\n\
    contracts will trigger and enforce relevant actions based on the data provided,\
    \ allowing\nfor veriﬁable transactions in the Blockchain when such circumstances\
    \ are met without the\nrequirement for third-party involvement [110,111]. The\
    \ Ethereum Blockchain platform\nserves as the foundation for the blockchain network\
    \ architecture because it provides a\nhighly ﬂexible and modular design that separates\
    \ the runtime environment as per the\nProcesses 2023, 11, 757\n19 of 27\napplication\
    \ domain, permitting agreements to deﬁne the business rules for the application\n\
    that are not necessary for the core system’s fundamental design.\nThe Blockchain\
    \ complete node is made up of the following components:\n1.\nNode for Validation:\
    \ This is a key component that veriﬁes batches of transactions\nbefore combining\
    \ them into blocks. It also ensures that candidate blocks are added to\nthe Blockchain\
    \ version for each node.\n2.\nBlockchain Software: it determines which transactions\
    \ or operations are permitted on\nthe block-chain and contains the following:\n\
    •\nDatabase model: it deﬁnes relevant operations and the description of the transac-\n\
    tion’s payload.\n•\nTransaction Processor: deﬁnes the business logic for different\
    \ applications, vali-\ndates batches of transactions, and modiﬁes the blockchain\
    \ system based on the\napplication’s rules.\n•\nClient: it speciﬁes the service\
    \ client functionality, which the client develops and\ndelivers to the validator.\
    \ The client also shows blockchain information.\n•\nREST API: This protocol is\
    \ used to communicate within the clients and the\ntransactions processing system.\n\
    3.\nDigital Signature: To ensure transaction integrity, the data used in the transactions\
    \ is\nhashed using SHA-256 and then encrypted using the sender’s secret key to\
    \ produce a\nsignature. The processor then validates the transaction by verifying\
    \ this signature.\n7. Case Studies and Experimental Results\nTo test the security\
    \ framework, we allowed DDoS attacks against the Blockchain\nNetwork. A distributed\
    \ denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targets websites and servers by\ndisrupting\
    \ network services. A DDoS attack attempts to exhaust an application’s resources.\n\

    Modernization of agricultural methods is required to increase productivity levels\n\
    while conserving nature. Precision agriculture could improve farming works by\
    \ controlling\nactuators more efﬁciently, enhancing the use of resources, increasing\
    \ revenues, and mini-\nmizing expenses. In order to accomplish this objective,\
    \ IoT technologies have to incorporate\nmore computing performance, such as edge\
    \ computing, big data handling, automated\nresources, and safety features. As\
    \ limited devices sense a huge amount of data and forward\nit to the gateway or\
    \ the cloud, security requires special attention. The data must be secured\nthroughout\
    \ the agricultural system, from diagnosis to risks and inventory.\nEven though\
    \ numerous security issues may affect farming production, they still\ninclude\
    \ a few security measures. This could be because these technologies were in their\n\
    initial phases of development. For most of the points, only computing resources\
    \ are\nincorporated, and that has limited computation power. As a result, security\
    \ mechanisms\nare very rare in the current list of requirement speciﬁcations.\
    \ Reaching a higher level\nof agricultural development, on the other hand, necessitates\
    \ technologies with security\nfeatures that provide enough quality and validity\
    \ to incorporate these technologies on a\nhigh level. As precision agriculture\
    \ introduces new complexities, it also opens up new\nfuture directions in security\
    \ and other areas.\nIn this study, we suggested a security framework for the agricultural\
    \ internet of things\nthat integrates blockchain technology, fog computing, and\
    \ software-deﬁned networking.\nThe suggested architecture avoids the requirement\
    \ for simulation-based work with both\nprivate and public blockchain for communication\
    \ between SDN controllers and IoT devices.\nHere, for IoT connectivity, each SDN\
    \ controller is linked to a blockchain. SDN controllers\nare interconnected by\
    \ a network’s topology. One of the key objectives of the proposed\narchitecture\
    \ is to enhance communication security for IoT devices. For IoT devices with\n\
    limited resources, distributed trust-based veriﬁcation makes blockchain even more\
    \ use-\nful. With a focus on ﬁxing security and data reliability issues in a distributed\
    \ controller\ncontext. Additionally, we want to increase the accuracy of our system\
    \ using machine\nlearning methods.\nIt might be signiﬁcant to add an intrusion\
    \ detection system utilizing various deep\nlearning algorithms in future work\
    \ to prevent the insertion of fake Sensor data in the\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.P., S.D. and S.R.; methodology,\

  explanation: '**1. A concise summary (3-5 sentences) of the key points of the paper
    as they relate to the outline point.**


    Deploying a heterogeneous network of IoT sensors to collect real-time data on
    soil moisture (e.g., capacitive, tensiometric), temperature (e.g., thermocouples,
    thermistors), humidity (e.g., capacitive, resistive), and plant health (e.g.,
    sap flow, leaf wetness) enables the creation of a digital twin of the irrigation
    system that captures the spatial and temporal variability of the soil-plant-atmosphere
    system. This advanced monitoring system enables the development of intelligent
    irrigation strategies and ensures precise and efficient water application.


    **2. A succinct yet detailed explanation of how the specifics of the paper contribute
    to addressing the point within the outline.**


    By integrating multiple sensor modalities, the proposed system can capture a comprehensive
    view of the irrigation system. Soil moisture sensors monitor the water content
    in the soil, temperature sensors measure the temperature of the soil and air,
    humidity sensors measure the amount of water vapor in the air, and plant health
    sensors monitor plant water status, stress levels, and growth. This data is then
    used to create a digital twin of the irrigation system, which is a virtual representation
    of the physical system that can be used to simulate and optimize irrigation strategies.


    The digital twin can be used to develop intelligent irrigation strategies that
    take into account the spatial and temporal variability of the soil-plant-atmosphere
    system. This can lead to more precise and efficient water application, which can
    save water and energy, improve crop yields, and reduce environmental impacts.'

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\
    \ monitoring methods.\nPlant-Based Measurement\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nPlant\

    \ and difﬁcult to implement in\nhumid climates\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n\
    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    \ \nThese factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

  explanation: This paper introduces a novel automated hyperspectral stereo matching
    technique for integration of high-resolution cameras into precision agriculture
    irrigation management systems to address the challenge of efficient water distribution.
    The proposed technique is designed to overcome the challenges associated with
    integrating these cameras into existing systems, including spectral inconsistencies,
    view selection, and focus measurement. The authors validate the effectiveness
    of their approach using a custom-built hyperspectral light field (H-LF) camera
    array, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.
  extract_1: This paper introduces the design and implementation of a hyperspectral
    light field (H-LF) stereo matching technique for more accurate depth estimation
    of scene geometry. Depth estimation in H-LF is challenging when using traditional
    stereo matching algorithms, which often assume consistency in pixel intensities
    across different spectral bands.
  extract_2: Combining the spectral-invariant feature descriptor with our cross-spectral
    stereo matching cost, we show that our approach can significantly improve the
    accuracy of depth estimation for H-LF.

  key_findings: The proposed technique significantly improves the accuracy of depth
    estimation for H-LF and can be used for applications such as image warping, color
    image synthesis, and hyperspectral refocusing.
  limitations: The proposed technique requires a custom-built H-LF camera array, which
    may limit its practical applicability.
  main_objective: To develop a hyperspectral light field (H-LF) stereo matching technique
    for automated irrigation systems that can accurately estimate depth and overcome
    the challenges associated with spectral inconsistencies.

    literature review, which is that automated, real-time irrigation management systems
    can contribute to the efficient use of water resources and enhance agricultural
    productivity. The paper's focus on hyperspectral stereo matching for automated
    irrigation systems aligns well with the need for advanced sensing and data processing

  data_sources: RGB images acquired under field conditions
  explanation: The paper introduces an automated system for segmenting late blight
    lesions in potato genotypes with diverse leaf colors using a deep convolutional
    neural network (DCNN) based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The automated
    system can accurately estimate the severity of the disease, quantifying the number
    of lesions and their area at the canopy level, which correlates with visual scores
    obtained from an experienced plant breeder. This automated system has the potential
    to monitor the development of late blight disease under field conditions and evaluate
    the resistance of genotypes against potato late blight, enabling more precise
    and automated potato breeding.
  extract_1: Visual scoring in the field provides an important metric to quantify
    disease severity, but is prone to  be biased and error can be subjected to raters.
    Thanks to automation, effectivity and objectiveness,  sensor-based measurement,
    especially imaging sensors, provides potential advantages compared  with visual
    scoring.
  extract_2: We adopted an encoder-decoder neural network architecture based on SegNet
    [26] for lesion  segmentation. The proposed network operates on input images of
    512x512 pixels and outputs  segmentation masks in the same size as the input image.

  data_sources: Thermal images of grape leaves
  explanation: The paper by Gohad and Khan (2022) explores the use of thermal imaging
    and convolutional neural networks for disease detection in grape leaves. By capturing
    thermal images, which reveal temperature variations associated with disease presence,
    they aim to detect diseases at early stages, even before symptoms become visible
    to the naked eye. The researchers employ a group convolution neural network, which
    involves partitioning the input image into multiple regions and applying convolution
    operations, to classify grape leaves as healthy or diseased. Their approach demonstrates
    promising results, achieving high accuracy in classifying thermal images of grape
    leaves, suggesting the potential of thermal imaging for early disease detection
    in precision agriculture.
  extract_1: '"Disease occurrence of a leaf changes its temperature right from the
    early stages. Thus, when thermal images are captured, the temperature variations
    can be seen on the images. Thresholding and watershed segmentation algorithms
    are used for pre-processing the image. These can then be used to train neural
    networks for classification of thermal images, which is done by using a deep learning
    technique called Group Convolution Neural Networks. Thus, this strategy proves
    to give higher accuracy results and successfully classify thermal images."'
  extract_2: '"The proposed system works in the following manner: Step 1: The collected
    data needs to be pre-processed in order to be given as an input to the group Convolution
    neural network. At first thresholding is performed, Here Otsu and binary thresholding
    has been used for the thermal images. Step 2: The threshold images will be then
    given as an input for morphological operation where opening and dilation is performed
    on the images. Step 3: The next step is segmentation in order to separate the
    foreground as well as background of the image it is important to perform segmentation
    which is in the form of watershed transformation."'

  data_sources: Survey data
  explanation: 'The proposed system uses computer vision, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    platform and devices, image processing, and machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL)
    techniques to continuously monitor and ensure the reliability of automated irrigation
    systems.


    The ML/DL models capture the spatio-temporal attributes of image samples and sensor
    inputs and can perform real-time discrimination between healthy and diseased bean
    leaves, detect weeds growing around the cultivation land, and also for process
    control. The system comprises temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors
    to gather the required information, an application is designed using the Blync
    app that sends the collected information to the cloud stage for further investigation,
    and uses the ThingSpeak platform for data presentation and analysis for visualization
    of real-time data captured using the IoT platform.'
  extract_1: The proposed system is a combination of IoT devices, image processing
    techniques and ML/DL based systems applied as part of a precision agriculture
    setup related to several varieties of bean species found in India. In this work,
    we have proposed two DL models for real time detection of healthy and non-healthy
    (diseased) bean leaves, weeds growing around the cultivation land and monitoring
    of related environment parameters and controlled sprinkling of water.
  extract_2: The first approach uses EfficientNetB7 along with a BiLSTM layer and
    the second approach employs VGG16 with an integrated attention mechanism. Further,
    experiments have been carried using SVM, RF, KNN, MLP and TDNN using features
    GLCM, LBP and LBGLCM to capture physiological attributes of the bean leaf samples
    which in combination with different segmentation methods separates the diseased
    areas of the leaves. These are then used as apriori labels for the classifiers
    to reinforce the previously known details of the bean varieties.
  inline_citation: (Nilakshi Devi a, Kandarpa Kumar Sarma b, Shakuntala Laskar a,
    2023)
  key_findings: The proposed DL models could classify healthy and diseased bean leaves
    with accuracy of 96% and 98% respectively using less computation time. Further,
    our proposed models outperform some existing models in literature like VirLeafNet
    (Rakesh et al., 2021), DADCNN-5 (Akshay and Kamal, 2022) and R-CNN (Zan et al.,
    2022) that have been employed for classification and identification of plant leaf
    diseases and are related to ecological informatics.
  limitations: The main limitations of the study is the limited scope, methodological
    issues, outdated information, and tangential focus. The study only focuses on
    bean leaf disease detection and weed recognition using computer vision and machine
    learning techniques, and does not consider other aspects of automated irrigation

    characteristics is imperative for the progression of our understanding of plant
    reactions to environmental stressors and the development of practical mitigation
    approaches.

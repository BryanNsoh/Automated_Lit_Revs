    The concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT
    and its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world, which makes a case for the
    intensive use of technology to optimize the use of water, reduce the consumption
    of energy and improve the quality of crops. While the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and other associated technologies are the natural choice for smart water management
    applications, their appropriateness is still to be proven in real settings with
    the deployment of on-site pilots. Also, IoT-based application development platforms
    should be generic enough to be adapted to different crops, climates, and countries.
    The SWAMP project develops IoT based methods and approaches for smart water management
    in precision irrigation domain and pilots them in Italy, Spain, and Brazil. In
    this paper, we present the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots and the scenario-based
    development process adopted in the project. Published in: 2018 Global Internet

    IEEE Conference Location: Bilbao, Spain SECTION I. Introduction Water is vital
    for ensuring food security to the world’s population, and agriculture is by far
    the biggest consumer amounting to 70% of freshwater [7]. The leading causes of
    water wastage are leakages in distribution and irrigation systems, as well as,
    the field application methods, which result in wastage and the cultivation of
    crops. The most common irrigation technique, surface irrigation, is also the least
    precise one, which wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting areas where
    no plants can benefit from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can use
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and over-irrigation.
    However, in an attempt to avoid loss of productivity by underirrigation, farmers
    feed more water than is needed and as a result not only productivity is challenged
    but also water is wasted. Therefore, technology should be developed and deployed
    for sensing the level of water needed by the plantation and for flowing the water
    in the proper amount to places where and when it is needed. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) [1] and other related technologies can be used for that purpose, but it
    faces several challenges. Firstly, Software Development for IoT-based smart applications
    is today not automatized and demands much effort. Secondly, advanced platforms
    are needed, that can automate part of the process and integrate different technologies
    and components for dealing with a multitude of requirements. Thirdly, the integration
    of heterogeneous and advanced sensors, particularly flying sensors (i.e., drones),
    may provide precision in the water supply for irrigation in agriculture. Fourthly,
    the use of a Software Platform together with different technologies such as IoT,
    big data analytics, cloud computing, fog computing [3] and drones, for the deployment
    of pilot applications for smart water management. Fifthly, new business models
    for using IoT in smart water management settings are necessary. Moreover, finally,
    components must be interoperable, flexible and adaptable to be replicable to different
    locations, crops, and contexts. The primary objective of the SWAMP1 project is
    to develop IoT based methods and approaches for smart water management in precision
    irrigation domain and to pilot the approaches in four places, two pilots in Europe
    (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil. Also, we aim at improving precision
    irrigation by increasing the awareness of the condition of the crop, by monitoring
    the field based on crop status (size, growing phase) and environment (e.g., weather
    forecast) and to adjust the irrigation prescription map accordingly. The smart
    water management pilots aim at guaranteeing that technological components are
    flexible enough to adapt to different contexts and to be replicable in different
    locations and settings. The same underlying SWAMP platform can be customized to
    different pilots considering different countries, climate, soil, and crops. The
    SWAMP layered architecture considers three types of services to ensure its replication
    and adaptability to different crops and locations. Entirely replicable services
    deal with IoT services, virtual entities and storage services, and data analytics
    and machine learning, respectively. Fully customizable services deal with water
    data management issues that specialize generic analytic services into particular
    techniques for different types of irrigation and water distribution. Those services
    may require being customized whenever a new pilot is designed, developed and deployed.
    Finally, application specific services require higher development effort since
    they serve particular farms. The architecture may be implemented in a range of
    deployment configurations involving the use of smart algorithms and analytics
    in the cloud, fog-based smart decisions located on the farm premises and possibly
    mobile fog nodes acting in the field (e.g., drones or in the central pivot irrigation
    mechanisms). In this paper, we present the SWAMP view of water management, the
    SWAMP architecture, the four SWAMP pilots and a scenario-oriented development
    process that consider both the crop needs and technological solutions. In the
    remainder of this paper, section II introduces concepts and related work. Section
    III introduces SWAMP concepts and methodology, while section IV presents the four
    pilots. Section V presents scenarios for deploying the pilots, and finally, section
    VI draws conclusions and future work. SECTION II. Iot In Precision Irrigation
    For Agriculture The Internet of Things is expected to have a decisive influence
    in the automation of smart water management applications. However, the development
    of IoT-enabled applications still takes tremendous efforts due to the lack of
    proper tools [8]. This scenario opens new opportunities and challenges in the
    specification, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of software development
    platforms for smart water management. The SWAMP project is being built upon existing
    efforts, generic platforms, architectures and research results [13]. The IoT-A
    project developed the IoT Reference Architecture for the generation of compliant
    IoT concrete architectures, focusing on using the current state of the art, rather
    than applying a clean slate approach [2]. FIWARE evolved from an EU-funded initiative
    for cloud services and now includes a platform with a set of Generic Enablers
    for developing smart applications [12], such as in the precision irrigation domain
    for agriculture [10]. When it comes to providing advanced features to the management
    of natural resources, such as water, there are some isolated initiatives not necessarily
    connected to the existing platforms and architectures. For example, the FIGARO
    project aims at increasing water productivity and improving irrigation practices
    through the development of a precision irrigation management platform, but not
    directly involving IoT [6]. Also, Popović et al. [11] present a case study of
    the specially designed and currently limited IoTenabled platform for collecting
    data in precision agriculture and ecological monitoring domains. Agri-IoT [9]
    is a theoretical IoT-based framework for data analytics and realtime processing
    for smart farming that shares some similarities with SWAMP. However, so far no
    real deployments have been reported, making it difficult to compare with SWAMP.
    In the last years, much has been said about the prospective uses for IoT combined
    with cloud-based services and big data analytics. Now, the time has come to conduct
    experiments in real settings. In Europe, there is a current concern to understand
    the challenges and compelling impacts of IoT in large-scale pilots for smart agriculture.
    Brewster et al. discuss the deployment of those large-scale pilots for IoT in
    agriculture and describe technologies and solutions that might be present in some
    agrifood domains, such as dairy, fruit, arable crops and meat & vegetable supply
    chain [5]. Also, the European project IoF2020 aims at fostering the adoption of
    IoT in large-scale pilots in the farming and food domain2. Current existing solutions
    are mostly theoretical with limited proof of concept experiences. They are either
    too generic or too specific and do not explicitly address easy system development
    and deployment for facilitating replicability of scenarios and streamlining the
    deployment of new pilots. This is where SWAMP comes to play. SECTION III. Concept
    and Methodology The SWAMP project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation
    system concept for agriculture depicted in Fig. 1. The fundamental idea is to
    enable optimizations of irrigation, water distribution, and consumption based
    on a holistic analysis that collects information from all aspects of the system
    including even the natural water cycle and the cumulated knowledge related to
    growing particular plants. It results in savings to all parties as it guarantees
    the availability of water in situations where water supply is limited and also
    prevents over-and under-irrigation. Fig. 1. Precision irrigation based on smart
    water management Show All As depicted in Fig. 1 we identify three broad phases
    in a water management system for agriculture: W1: Water reserve: water reserves
    coming from different sources such as rivers, lakes, dams, and aquifers, which
    follow the natural water cycle. W2: Water distribution: water is transported from
    W1 to the final usage place (W3) through a network of canals, pipes, pumps, valves,
    and gates. Water distribution may assume different configurations depending on
    the region or country. In some places, water resources are carefully used and
    controlled by a central authority. W3: Water consumption: in agriculture, one
    of the critical uses of water is irrigation, which can be performed by different
    techniques. Irrigation (W3) is the principal objective of the SWAMP project. The
    SWAMP platform provides mechanisms for data acquisition from sensors, making decisions
    using a variety of different techniques and changing system behavior by sending
    commands to both automatic and human actuators. For Water Consumption (W3) SWAMP
    will provide real-time responses for adapting irrigation as crop conditions change.
    On the other hand, as changes in water distribution are performed in a different
    timescale, the management loop for W2 will be longer. W2 and W3 management systems
    are integrated, as water usage triggers water distribution. The SWAMP Architecture
    is divided into five layers, as depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. SWAMP Architecture
    Show All Layer 1: IoT Services: A variety of sensor and actuator technologies
    to acquire soil (e.g., moisture and temperature), plant (e.g., vegetation index,
    canopy temperature) and weather (e.g., air temperature and relative humidity,
    precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and direction) will be tested during
    the project. Layer 2: Virtual Entity and Data Storage: IoT Service descriptions
    are annotated with contextual metadata about the physical environment to create
    Virtual Entity (VE) representations of physical entities. Distributed databases
    composed of cloud and fog nodes work together for dealing with a massive amount
    of data coming from sensors and make them available to the upper layers. Layer
    3: Data Analytics: provides different components for context-aware management
    supported by cloud-based big data analytics techniques. SWAMP will utilize existing
    models and algorithms to realize the Layer 3, which may vary for different crops
    and pilots. Layer 4: Water Data Management: builds application related middleware
    management services on top of the generic data processing services provided by
    Layer 3. This layer decouples the irrigation-related business rules from applications
    providing an API for Layer 5 with a variety of algorithms, models, and mechanisms
    for facilitating and streamlining the development and deployment of new pilots.
    Layer 5: Water Application Services: A multitude of data that is sensed, acquired,
    stored, and processed is transformed into services that make sense to farmers.
    SWAMP initially will consider two types of water application services, water distribution
    services, and water usage services (i.e., irrigation). A fundamental idea in SWAMP
    is to facilitate the replication of water management systems built on top of its
    platform with minimum redesign and redevelopment. Different layers of the architecture
    have components that are more generic and thus less difficult to be ported to
    other pilots, whereas others are more application-specific and thus require new
    development efforts whenever a new pilot is conceived. When it comes to the generality/specificity
    scale, the SWAMP architecture provides three categories of components: a) Fully
    Replicable Services: Layers 1, 2 and 3 of the architecture are generic enough
    to allow them to be replicable in different settings. Sensors, actuators and associated
    IoT Services vary according to the specific application domain; b) Fully Customizable
    Services: Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the final application and
    therefore must be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques
    and models of water distribution and irrigation. Those services may require being
    customized for every new pilot; c) Application Specific Services: Services in
    Layer 5 address particularities of pilots. Given that parameters vary considerably
    for different countries, regulations, climate conditions, crops and soils, those
    services usually require more effort to be customized. SECTION IV. Swamp Pilots
    A. Pilot: Smart Water Distribution (Italy - CBEC) The Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia
    Centrale (CBEC) is a reclamation consortium of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern
    Italy, responsible for the irrigation and water drainage of an area of nearly
    3,130 km2 where most water required for irrigation is withdrawn from the Po river
    (Fig. 3). The water is distributed to the farms by an intricate irrigation infrastructure
    composed of more than 3580 km of canals, more than 200 small streams, six draining
    plants, and 72 pump stations with the capacity of 416 cubic meters per second.
    Fig. 3. Water distribution management pilot: open earth canal (left), manual operation
    (center) and water intake (right) Show All The supply and irrigation network consists
    of open channels on earth. Relevant widths characterize the main canals and their
    filling for the irrigation season involves the use of substantial water volumes
    that are not always recoverable for irrigation purposes. Water losses are due
    to evaporation and infiltration through canal banks and bottom, as well as to
    the management of the irrigation network that requires the filing of long canals
    stretches and several minor streams to accommodate farmer needs. The irrigation
    network also acts as drainage network for the cultivated areas. The SWAMP project
    aims at enhancing the overall system efficiency by acting at farmers and irrigation
    consortium levels. At the farmer level, SWAMP provides a better estimation of
    water needs regarding both amounts of water and time of delivery. This precise
    estimation can be achieved by the implementation of the IoT infrastructure that
    enables the integration of groundbased information with the weather forecast.
    At the consortium level, the management of the irrigation network can benefit
    from the optimization of multiple water requests ensured by the technological
    platform. The platform collects water needs adjusting the operational management
    of canals by merging detailed information of water needs, weather forecasts, and
    multiple requirements from farmers served by the same irrigation infrastructure.
    In particular, the SWAMP project enables the monitoring, automation, and remote
    control of the major hydraulic infrastructures, through which CBEC manages the
    water distribution within the irrigation district. The renovation of the hydraulic
    infrastructures together with the implementation of the IoT platform and data
    analytics scheme is expected to enable a consistent enhancement of the water distribution
    management that will persist after the project life. B. Pilot: Smart precision
    irrigation (Spain - Intercrop) This pilot is located in Cartagena, Spain, in the
    premises of Intercrop Iberica and addresses several challenges of smart irrigation
    and water management of geographically distributed fields, aiming at demonstrating
    the use of IoT sensor platforms and drones to achieve increased crop yield with
    optimal water usage with minimum labor effort. Even though Cartagena is located
    on the coast, that is a dry area with a short rain season with intense rains in
    just a few days. A considerable amount of water comes from a desalination plant,
    what contributes to make it a scarce and expensive good. Farms are distributed
    over areas of roughly 30 km radius in intensive cropping area. Pilot site is shown
    in Fig. 4. The immediate closeness of the control fields gives ideal circumstances
    to verify the effectiveness of the deployed methods. There are three growth periods
    during the project giving an opportunity to do iterative piloting and compare
    the results of different iterations. Fig. 4. Intercrop irrigation pilot site.
    In the right, the arrow shows the precise location of the pilot site Show All
    Growing period starts in early September and finishes by late April. Crops are
    from different ranges such as lettuce, endive, spinach, herbs, and bay leaf. These
    farms are irrigated separately through their proper reservoirs and irrigation
    systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods, we selected the pilot
    site from the same area with control field that is using traditional irrigation
    and monitoring methods. Irrigation system on the pilot field is managed using
    solenoid valves, and total water consumption can be monitored via water meters.
    Facilities used in piloting are a local weather station, online weather services,
    long life smart soil sensors, drone gateway, and real-time cloud data analysis.
    C. Pilot: Variable Rate Irrigation (Brazil) The MATOPIBA region encompasses the
    Brazilian states of Maranhão (MA), Tocantins (TO), Piauí (PI) and Bahia (BA),
    and is one of the most critical irrigated agricultural frontier in the country,
    located in the cerrado, a savannah climate subtype. Irrigation is mostly performed
    by thousands of center pivots, each one with an average size of 100 ha. The municipality
    of Luís Eduardo Magalhães (Fig. 5), the location for the center pivot pilot, is
    considered the capital of Brazilian agribusiness. Fig. 5. Center-pivot irrigation
    pilot: location of the pilot site (left) and center pivot irrigation for soybean
    crop (right) Show All The soybean production reached about 5.5 million tons in
    2016. Despite such production, the farmers estimated 40% crop losses due to the
    2015/16 season drought. The production from many properties was only 30 sacks
    per hectare, while an average of 58 sacks was expected. With irrigation and investments
    in soil fertility, some producers expect that this number can reach 80 sacks.
    Although irrigation is an alternative, its expansion depends on technologies that
    improve operating costs. For example, in 2015/16 the government imposed double
    charges to the energy used in irrigation, which costs seven sacks per hectare
    against three and a half sacks with a typical energy charging. The main MATOPIBA
    pilot goal is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation system based on Variable
    Rate Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production. However, alternate
    crops like corn and cotton are also usual, including during the same season. Conventional
    center pivot irrigation systems help to provide a reliable supply of water, increase
    yields, and provide double cropping potential. The proposed smart irrigation will
    help the crop in the same way while making rational use of water and energy. D.
    Pilot: Precision Drop Irrigation (Brazil - Guaspari) One of the significant innovations
    of winemaking in State of São Paulo, Brazil, is occurring in the municipality
    of Espírito Santo do Pinhal in the Guaspari Winery. It is the transfer of wine
    grape harvesting to the winter season (June-August), when the thermal amplitude,
    insolation, and absence of rainfall are better for harvesting, similar to the
    great wine regions of the world. The different terroirs that compose the vineyard
    are divided into plots, which are harvested separately. In that growing area,
    altitude ranges between 1,000 m and 1,300 m; nights are cold and optimal sunshine
    during the day provides an air temperature range between 10°C and 12°C at harvesting
    time, similar to that of large European regions. The soil is developed from granite
    rock, with good drainage, which is suitable for grapes destined to produce high-quality
    wines. The application of water by an irrigation system depends on the crop, weather,
    and soil conditions. Even with the availability of several criteria and procedures
    for the performance of irrigation management, the technique has a low adoption
    rate by the farmers. Occasionally irrigation is based on only the experience of
    the grower, on the visualization of the wet soil surface or even on the perception
    of visual symptoms of plant water deficit, which, when identified late, can affect
    yield and product quality. The lack of knowledge about irrigation management procedures
    can lead to the failure of this water application practice, even if there is a
    system designed for a specific cropping area. Guaspari Winery uses drip irrigation
    in its vineyards, with a single hose and emitters spaced at 0.5 m, and measured
    the flow of 1.9 L h-1. The experimental area has 1.1 ha and is shown in Fig. 6.
    The objectives of the Guaspari Winery Pilot are: a) to perform automatic measuring
    of soil water content at different soil depths and in several vineyards inside
    the winery s growing area; b) to store data in the cloud about soil water content
    be jointly processed with weather and crop information; c) To provide quick and
    accurate irrigation management information. Fig. 6. Guaspari Winery: Vineyard
    and pilot location (right) Show All SECTION V. Swamp Scenarios The SWAMP Platform
    is being built on existing and new concepts and technologies, implementing the
    SWAMP vision (Fig. 1) through the SWAMP Architecture (Fig. 2), which may be flexible
    enough to deal with the needs of four different IoT pilots for smart water management
    in precision irrigation located in three countries. For making this vision to
    come true, a scenario-based architecture design and requirement gathering are
    being conducted to match the needs of crops and farmers’ expertise with existing
    technological solutions. Fig. 7 depicts the scenario representing the center-pivot
    with variable-rate irrigation pilot to be deployed in the MATOPIBA region in Brazil.
    The scenario captures both the farm and SWAMP Platform viewpoints and represents
    a future vision and not the current situation. A center pivot irrigates a circular
    agricultural plot of 100 hectares that alternates soybeans and cotton. The plot
    is further divided into different management zones, identified before the crop
    season and based on differences in the soil properties. Even though the crop is
    the same throughout the plot, each management zone receives a different irrigation
    prescription, to make available the same amount of water for plants regardless
    the way water is percolated and infiltrated in different soil types. Two general
    types of sensors collect data for the SWAMP system: a) stationary sensors within
    the soil at the root system depth that continually measure metrics such as temperature
    and moisture, and; b) drones acting as flying sensors equipped with thermal/multispectral
    cameras or working as data mules by collecting sensor data and transmitting to
    the farm’s office. The center pivot is electrified to make it able to control
    the variable rate irrigation sprinklers (actuators) and thus it can also be equipped
    with processing and communication capabilities. No special energy harvesting is
    predicted for the sensing devices. We will develop multiparametric probes for
    soil sensing, which include moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity
    sensors at three depths from the soil surface. In intensive agriculture areas
    the plan is also to experiment ultra low power wireless sensor solutions based
    on wake up radios combined with LoRaWAN [3]. Sensors will stay on standby and
    wake up for a few milliseconds. Sampling and transmission rates will be adjusted
    from a few minutes up to hours, according to the time of the day and the application
    requirements. This way, the probe sensing electronics combined with ZigBee or
    low power LoRaWAN will be powered by extended lifespan batteries. We consider
    using both ZigBee and LoRaWAN, for short and long distances, respectively. Other
    sensing devices deployed in low quantity or devices requiring heavier duty cycles,
    like a water source level sensor and weather station, will be solar powered. Both
    the center pivot and drones are considered Field Fog Nodes (FFN) in the SWAMP
    Architecture. Notably, the FFN at the center pivot acts as a sensor aggregation
    point and as a distributor of actuator commands received from the SWAMP system.
    FFNs communicate with the nearest fixed attachment point of the SWAMP Platform,
    which usually is an onpremises Fog Hub Node (or just fog hub) located in the farm’s
    office. Please notice that this choice aims at providing autonomous processing
    capacity to the farm at our pilot since it is in a region where Internet connections
    may suffer periods of instability. SWAMP allows FFNs to communicate directly with
    the Platform running in the cloud, whenever this is the preferred deployment choice.
    The FFNs send data directly to the SWAMP Platform located in the CFN at the farm’s
    offices via different wireless technologies. In Fig. 7 it is represented by a
    Base Station, such as a WiFi access point, a LoRaWAN gateway, a ZigBee router
    or a Cell Base Station. For this scenario, the functions performed by the SWAMP
    Architecture are divided up into local Fog and remote Cloud components. Heavy
    processing, such as irrigation models and analytics using smart algorithms (i.e.,
    machine learning), is performed in the cloud. In our pilot, we will first experiment
    with existing irrigation models for precision agriculture where analytics plays
    the role of automatic parameter tuning. After enough data is obtained, analytical
    models will be tested for generating the irrigation prescription maps. External
    information is fed to the platform, such as crop yield models, meteorological
    data and historical data. Fig. 7. Scenario representing the center-pivot irrigation
    pilot Show All Fig. 8 depicts the CBEC SWAMP pilot, focused on water distribution
    management. Water is conveyed from the Po River in Italy through a network of
    open canals automated by a set of pumps, valves, gauges and gates operated by
    CBEC. The SWAMP platform estimates the water needs of individual farms by analyzing
    sensor data and other relevant information, generates the irrigation prescription
    maps and sends them to the farmers, who perform the irrigation using the method
    they see fit. The water need estimate for each farm is in turn fed into a component
    devoted to optimizing the management of water distribution, by sending commands
    to actuators installed in devices that control the water flow through the canals,
    up to the point farmers can use them. The purpose is to make more efficient use
    of the water deviated from the river. Fig. 8 does not explicitly show how the
    data is sent from sensors to the SWAMP platform because different technologies
    are used by farmers to transmit the data through the Internet. The SWAMP Platform
    is represented as a single component, whereas in practice a distributed cloud/fog
    architecture can be used, such as the one shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    IoT is the natural choice for smart water management applications, but its appropriateness
    is still to be proven in real settings with the deployment of on-site pilots.
    In this paper, we presented the SWAMP project, which develops IoT based methods
    for smart water management in precision irrigation, and pilots them in Italy,
    Spain, and Brazil. We introduced the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots and the
    scenario-based development process adopted in the project. SWAMP is still in its
    beginning but has already attracted the attention of farmers, agribusiness companies,
    and government agencies around the world. In its current stage, we visited and
    surveyed the pilots and explored the implications on the platform of different
    pilot sites, crops and requirements. The key insights so far refer to the commonalities
    and variability of features of pilots that can positively contribute to the design
    of a genuinely replicable SWAMP platform. Fig. 8. Scenario representing the water

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits

    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A

    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    Transformation for Sustainable Future - Agriculture 4.0: A review Year 2021, Volume:
    27 Issue: 4, 373 - 399, 04.12.2021 Mehmet Ali Dayıoğlu Ufuk Turker https://doi.org/10.15832/ankutbd.986431
    Cited By: 16 Abstract In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects
    food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many
    global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change,
    and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available
    for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections
    between food-water-energy- climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation
    from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions
    in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital
    transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition
    from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial
    revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision
    agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application
    examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial
    intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time
    monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based
    irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation
    processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and
    greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones
    and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.
    Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies
    such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in
    rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and
    environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological
    innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect
    the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help
    us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental
    challenges. Keywords Smart Farming, Digital transformation, Sustainable development,

    Precision agriculture is mainly used to make the farming as user-friendly to achieve
    the desired production of a crop. With the latest Geospatial technologies, the
    analysis related to any type of application using the Internet of Things (IoT)
    made each and everyone, to materialize the things whatever is imagined. The geographic
    information collected from various sources and with this, IoT establishes a communication
    to the entire world through an Internet. The information will be helpful in the
    maintenance of the farmland by applying the required amount of fertilizer at the
    right time in the right place. It is expected that in the future, this type of
    smart agriculture with the application of information and communication technologies
    including IoT will definitely bring a revolution in the global agricultural scenario
    to make it more resource-efficient and productive. The main goal in combining
    the Geospatial technology with IoT for precision is to monitor and predict the
    critical parameters such as water quality, soil condition, ambient temperature
    and moisture, irrigation, and fertilizer for improving the crop production. It
    can be expected that with the help of Geospatial and IoT in smart farming, the
    prediction of the amount of fertilizer, weeds, and irrigation will be accurate
    and it helps the farmers in making decisions related to all the requirements in
    terms of control and supply. Keywords Wireless sensor networks Precision agriculture
    Internet of Things Smart farming Crop production Access provided by University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download chapter PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture sector plays
    a premeditated role in building a backbone of economic development in India. Due
    to the rapid growth of the population, the demand for the food also raises. The
    rapid development in the space-research technology and satellite communication
    also will help to provide regular updates and inputs about the weather forecasting,
    crop production statistics to the farmers for attaining the sustainable agriculture.
    And also it reduces the risk in the agriculture, increases the crop productivity
    and economic level of the farmers and fulfills the demands of the foods. Precision
    agriculture is defined as the technology-based crop system, designed for long-term,
    site-specific applications, and aimed to increase the quality and profitability
    of crop production and farmer’s economic growth by adjusting the agriculture inputs
    based on the local requirements of the croplands and also reduces the environmental
    impacts and risks. The crop diseases and the reduction in crop yield invariably
    depend on many factors such as bacteria, virus, fungus, rats, and also environmental
    factors like wind speed, direction, radiation, humidity, temperature, soil and
    water acidity. The precision farming plays a vital role in the reduction of negative
    impacts on the crop productivity by analyzing and monitoring spatial variability
    on the water, soil, and environmental conditions. In precision agriculture, the
    detailed information about the spatial variability of cropland is required to
    find the current status of the crop field and take the suitable decision on crop
    field management. The Geospatial technologies such as remote sensing, Global Positioning
    System (GPS), satellite imagery, and Geo-fencing, etc., are used to obtain valuable
    geographic information from various sources and with this, IoT establishes a communication
    to the entire world through the Internet. Thus, the users can extract the valuable
    information from anywhere and anytime. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of
    the key components that integrates hardware, computing devices, physical objects,
    software in order to establish the communication, collect and exchange data among
    each other [1]. A general schematic of IoT is shown in Fig. 1. These technologies
    can be suitable for almost all the applications for analyzing the issues and meeting
    out the challenges. This chapter mainly focuses on the technologies in precision
    agriculture. WSNs are one of the simplest technologies to collect and monitor
    the actual spatial variability of the crop field and these have the advantages
    such as cost-effective, real-time suitability, and ease of deployment. The decision-support
    system in a farmhouse or mainframe computer integrate the prior knowledge and
    on-field sensed data with GIS to make optimized control decisions in water irrigation,
    pesticides, and the duration of fertilization [2]. This leads to many open challenging
    unexplored research areas in precision agriculture and act as a guiding tool for
    the farmers in diagnosing the crop or plant diseases accurately in a timely manner
    in order to protect and enhance the yield and in estimating and utilizing the
    available resources for e.g., water and manure at the right time and in the right
    quantity. Fig. 1 Concept of IoT Full size image 1.1 Applications of IoT in Precision
    Agriculture The smart agriculture paradigm evolved to formulate the utilization
    of new technologies in precision farming. In smart agriculture scenario, numerous
    services are developed to enhance the standard of the farmer’s lives, and economics
    by implementing the farming applications [3]. 1.1.1 Irrigation Monitoring System
    Recent advancements in the agriculture systems need an effective irrigation management
    to optimize the usage of the water in farming. To utilize the available water
    resources, a cost-effective micro irrigation system is implemented [4]. By using
    the satellite imagery and remote sensing, the efficiency of the micro irrigation
    farming can be further extended. 1.1.2 Pest and Disease Control Nowadays, the
    WSNs and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV technologies are used to monitor the crop
    leaves quality and to predict the occurrence and possibilities of the pest in
    crops [5]. It can be predicted by using environmental conditions such as temperature,
    wind speed, and humidity, etc., thereby increasing the crop quality and minimizes
    the expenditure of the farming cost. 1.1.3 Controlled Usage of Fertilizer The
    yield and quality of the crop productivity are directly related to the use of
    fertilizer at the right time and right quantity. The prediction of the optimal
    amount of fertilizer is an important task in smart agriculture [6]. The estimation
    on the amount of fertilizer can be found by using the soil nutrients sensors which
    can monitor the variation in soil nutrition such as pH, Nitrogen (N), Potassium
    (K), Calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and Phosphorous (P), etc. 1.1.4 Water Quality
    Monitoring The sensors can be used to measure the water temperature, pH, electrical
    conductivity, turbidity, nitrates and dissolved oxygen. 1.1.5 Green House Gas
    Monitoring The changes in the \(\text {CO}_2\) and \(\text {CH}_4\) are directly
    affecting the global temperature and have a straight impact on the agriculture.
    The emission of \(\text {CO}_2\) and \(\text {CH}_4\) from the various farming
    lands are monitored by using the WSNs and satellite imagery [7]. 1.1.6 Surveillance
    of Cattle Movement The latest technologies such as the camera based WSNs, UAV,
    and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), etc., are employed to monitor whether
    any animals are moving or grazing near the croplands or not [8,9,10]. 1.1.7 Assert
    Tracking and Farming System Monitoring Presently, various advanced devices along
    with IoTs are deployed to fetch the information about the crops. These are shared
    with the cloud, which can ease to control remotely and triggers the automation
    in agriculture and also makes it easy in smart agriculture with remote tracking
    and monitoring [11]. To summarize the remainder of the chapters, Sect. 2 gives
    the details of Information and Communication Technology in Agriculture. Section
    3 presents Research challenges and issues in IoT. A framework of Geospatial data
    with IoT for Precision agriculture is detailed in Sect. 4 and the conclusion is
    presented in Sect. 5. 2 Information and Communication Technology in Agriculture
    The IoT-based smart agriculture monitoring is employed to allow the professional
    and farmers for monitoring the condition of the environment, farmland, soil, and
    crop growth. The entire smart agriculture system consists of the various types
    of sensor, UAV, satellite, GPS, actuators, gateway, cloud server, Internet, and
    Android mobile phone. The actuator has a provision for driving systems in the
    smart agriculture which respond to the given command by the central co-coordinator.
    For example, the central coordinator estimates the soil moisture and schedules
    the irrigation (turn-on and turn-off) of the actuators based on the readings from
    the farm field sensors. Each sensor node sends the sensed data to the cloud server
    through the gateway and Internet. Particularly, the gateway is used to collect
    the data from the sensor nodes and also to distribute the control message to the
    sensors, mobile phone, and actuators. Figure 2 shows an example of Information
    and Communication Technology in Agriculture. The software and the hardware presented
    in it aids in giving a success in the crop production with the help of these technologies.

    Full size image 2.1 Role of IoT The Internet of Things is the most promising technologies
    in precision for providing numerous real-time solutions towards the modernization.
    It is a network of numerous things connected with various embedded electronics,
    service provider, automated machinery, persons, software, and hardware through
    Internet enabling these to gather and share the information for taking suitable
    solution in the crisis situation or long-term monitoring at anywhere and anytime,
    resulting in better economic gain, and quality of life [12]. Example of IoT hardware
    platforms is depicted in Table 1. Table 1 Comparison of various IoT hardware platforms
    available in the markets Full size table Some of the benefits of the IoT in smart
    agriculture are as follows: 1. Increases the profitability of agriculture. 2.
    Improves the quality of crop yields. 3. Minimizes the negative ecological effect.
    4. Prevents the occurrence of plant diseases and pests. 5. Alerts the farmers
    during natural calamities, hazards, storm, etc., at the right time. 6. Allows
    remote monitoring, access, and control. 2.1.1 Role of Big Data in IoT The evolution
    of the big data and Internet of Things (IoT) becomes an ever-growing technology
    in smart agriculture development which provides the enhancement of socio-economics,
    logistics, and living standards. The IoT continues to integrate the huge amount
    of data collected from various sources (data on social media and commercial networking,
    banking transactions, government sector and industrial records, forecasting of
    the weather, sensor networks, satellites, study materials, GPS, and space other
    research data) throughout the world [13]. For different kinds of smart applications
    and services, the big data has undergone the different level of analysis to produce
    the needed semantic information. But the big data results in the following practical
    challenges [14]. Data representation: The big data have uniqueness in the dataset
    including type, pattern, syntax, semantics, size, and accessibility. For computer
    interpretation and analysis, an improper representation of data will give unreliability
    in the original data and may also affect the efficient interpretation of various
    dataset. Thus, proficient data representation is needed to manage the heterogeneous
    dataset at various levels and also enables the different field to access the data
    [13]. Storage of big data: Today, various kinds of data are increasing at an exponential
    rate. In 2020, the amount of data generated and replicated from 4.4 to 44 ZB,
    said according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). Thus, an intelligent
    data redundancy reduction and compression techniques are needed to reduce the
    storage cost-effectively [14]. Responsiveness: Traditional data analysis systems
    lack maintaining the heterogeneous dataset structure which causes data incompatible
    issues in various engineering and research application. And also it fails to find
    structures and relationships within big data in a timely manner, thereby causing
    latency in data retrieval and processing. Hence, an effective data mining and
    analytical algorithms are highly concentrated, so as to overcome the issue of
    scalability and manageability in analyzing the huge volume of data [14]. Energy
    and heat dissipation management: The transmission, storage, and processing of
    big data by the server will consume more electric power. And also, it dissipates
    huge volume of heat which reduces the performance and lifespan of the server.
    Thus, effective energy consumption and heat control and management mechanisms
    have great attention in preserving the economy and environment [14]. 2.1.2 Role
    of Cloud and Fog Computing in IoT The cloud based service refers to a variety
    of resources related to the applications provide to the users on-demand over the
    Internet. The cloud computing is an effective computation paradigm for analyzing
    and managing the big data in IoT. The big data related processes such as data
    acquisitions, processing, filtering, and transmission are rationalized for providing
    identical information related to the needs of the user through IoT. Cloud computing
    offers adequate resources and solutions to maintain, store, diagnostic, and analyze
    to provide a solution for the large amount of data produced by the IoT [15]. These
    resources are remotely located and managed by the service provider and are used
    for the integration of host data, diagnostic, visualization, and development of
    the smart application. The remote user can easily access the cloud platform with
    their services and resources by using a mobile phone. Numerous sensor nodes are
    deployed in the targeted area to sense the interest in croplands and environments.
    These field sensors sense the event, pre-process, and transmit the collected data
    to the cloud-server directly or through gateway nodes [16]. The performance of
    the cloud computing is limited due to scalability, congestion and latency [17].
    This is because of a huge volume of the gathered data transfer to the cloud and
    then sent back to the application devices which have a serious impact on the performance.
    To overcome these drawbacks, IoT architectures are developed with distributed
    computing model based on the fog paradigms, in which the fog computing node is
    deployed at the edge of the network to perform the automated decision and learning
    process, storage, and interface with cloud services [1, 15]. This fog computing
    paradigm allows the farmers to easily analyze the changes and make the decision
    in a short period. 2.2 Role of Sensors The advancement in the MEMS and other communication
    technologies are used to invent a compact and low-cost sensor node which is utilized
    in a variety of real-time application for collecting the information about the
    environmental and physical parameters associated to the crops [10, 18]. It can
    support the agriculture professional to make wise decisions and will be informed
    to the farmers for further action. Advantages of WSNs in smart agriculture are
    as follows: 1. Ease of node deployment. 2. Low establishment cost. 3. Long-term
    croplands monitoring. 4. Real-time support and intervention. 5. Increased crop
    productivity. Various sensor nodes that are suitable for agriculture are categorized
    into the plant-related sensor, soil and water-related sensor and environment-related
    sensor and are discussed below. 2.2.1 Soil and Water Related Sensors Table 2 depicts
    that the various types of the sensor are currently utilized for measuring the
    soil and water related parameters such as moisture, water flow, temperature, nutrients,
    water content, water level, and conductivity. Table 2 Comparison of various soil
    related sensors available in the markets Full size table 2.2.2 Environment Related
    Sensors The environment-related information is an essential part of the precision
    agriculture. The potential uses of these sensor nodes include monitoring the greenhouse
    gases, pollution, ambient temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure,
    solar radiation, and lightning. The environment-related sensors are mentioned
    in Table 3. Table 3 Comparison of various environmental sensors available in the
    markets Full size table 2.2.3 Plant Related sensors These types of sensor are
    attached to the plants for monitoring the leaf wetness, temperature, conductivity,
    ice formation, water level, plant stem-cell growth, and yield quality. Table 4
    shows the various types of sensors with plant related measurement parameters.
    Table 4 Comparison of various plant related sensors available in the markets Full
    size table 2.3 Role of Remote Sensing Remote sensing is described as a process
    to gather information through non-physical contact measurements of radiation reflected
    or emitted from the particular material [19]. The remote sensing is mainly depending
    on the reflectance or emission property of the object. The signal emission or
    reflectance of the object is based on the chemical and physical characteristics
    of the particular material, and their geographic environment such as temperature,
    leaf wetness, and chlorophylls, etc. The chemical compounds of the crop, called
    chlorophylls emit the radiation which is inversely related to the absorption of
    the electromagnetic radiation. The measurement of the radiated signal is performed
    through the different levels of spectral bands including Green, Blue, Red, Near
    Infra-Red (NIR), and Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR). In agriculture, the Green, Red,
    and Infra-Red are widely used to obtain the vegetation indices. The common method
    for measuring the vegetation index is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI). These indices are used to analyze specific characteristics such as crop
    biomass, Leaf Area Index (LAI), crop count, water content, plant stress, humidity.
    In agriculture, the variation in chlorophyll concentration is highly sensitive
    to the variation of green and red wavelength (i.e., the absorption and reflection
    measurement of electromagnetic radiation through the green and red wavelengths
    are inversely varied with respect to the concentration of chlorophylls) [19].
    For example, highly concentrated chlorophyll plants attract more radiation in
    red and blue wavelength and less reflection in infrared or green wavelength. On
    the contrary, less chlorophyll reflects with the high red wavelength. Thus, investigating
    the visible to the infrared spectral band can give necessary information about
    the plant’s cellular arrangement for measuring the plant stress, and productivity.
    The analysis of the red edge spectral region provides a better responsiveness
    under stress induced by chlorophylls content changes and also accurately estimates
    the LAI than the green and red spectral range. The remote sensing can be performed
    by satellite-based platform (satellite, UAV, etc.) and ground-based platform (tractor,
    hand-held sensors, etc.). Table 5 Comparison of satellites used in the precision
    agriculture (https://directory.eoportal.org/) Full size table Multispectral Scanner
    System sensors, LiDAR [20], RaDAR, thermal and infrared cameras are frequently
    used in the satellite and UAV [8], so as to estimate the spatial factors of agriculture
    objects such as biomass, N stress, yield mapping, pest and disease detection which
    is based on the observation of the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation from
    the soil and crop organic contents. The recent improvement in real-time satellite
    imagery (e.g., Eo-1 Hyperion, Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI)) is high
    spatial and spectral resolution that could be provided the better classification
    and decision making in precision agriculture [19]. Examples of satellites that
    are used in the Precision agriculture are given in Table 5. Ground-based remote
    sensing otherwise called as proximal remote sensing, in which the sensor nodes
    are mounted on to the sprayer, tractor, etc., had important capabilities for determining
    spatial patterns of soil organic matter, calcium, phosphorous, potassium, carbon,
    soil temperature, moisture, salinity, soil pH, N stress, water stress, and crop
    yield. These types of sensing provide a real-time agricultural application specific
    management such as fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation. The ground-based remote
    sensing is more accurate as compared to the sky-based platform since it is less
    affected by the cloud cover. Asher et al. [21] discussed a ground-based remote
    sensing, in which linear move irrigation system designed with six IR sensors and
    moving weather station was used to find the canopy temperatures and dry area of
    the cropland. This sensed data enabled the grower to open the irrigation control
    valve. Applications of the remote sensing in agriculture are listed as follows:
    (i) cropping system analysis, (ii) agriculture drought assessment and monitoring,
    (iii) soil mapping and monitoring, (iv) water resources monitoring, (v) crop area
    estimation and monitoring, (vi) incidence forecasting, (vii) diseases and pests
    detection. The limitations of the remote sensing in the agriculture are as follows:
    1. Simultaneous sensing of the reflectance radiation from the crop by the sensor
    causes the confusion in spectral band. 2. The scaling issues due to the inappropriateness
    between the actual considered and remote sensing data and also it provide the
    inadequate information for evaluating the historical data. 3. Low accuracy in
    reflectance measurement of the soil and water due to the organic matter, surface
    roughness, and moisture, thus characterizing the soil and water properties are
    very complex. 4. Hard to classify the crop species. 5. The usage of the passive
    sensor in the remote sensing is severely affected by the weather condition. 2.4
    Role of GPS The GPS and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) give a Geospatial
    position on the earth surface or it provides the position of the UAV on the sky
    with respect to the earth surface [22]. The crop field monitoring connected with
    GPS provides the necessary data to map the agriculture applications and a site-specific
    cropland management. The tangible benefits of using GNSS and GPS in agriculture
    are: (i) providing guidance for auto steering the tractors, sprayers, and spreaders
    on the cropland, (ii) allowing the worker to perform the agriculture activity
    in low visibility condition. 2.5 Role of GIS The geographic information system
    provides a computer-based framework for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing,
    mapping, and visualization of Geospatial data. With this geographic science with
    tools, GIS depicts closer discernment into data for understanding the pattern,
    collaboration, and circumstances which help the people to make smarter decision
    attaining their goal in real time practices [23]. The GIS technology is mainly
    used to store the layers of information and integrate the agriculture field with
    remotely sensed data and produces the number of possibilities in analyzing the
    geographical data. Numerous modern GIS software packages such as GRASS GIS, ArcGIS,
    QGIS, OpenStreetMap, and GeoMedia, etc., are easily shared their resources (imagery,
    features, base-maps, spreadsheets, and tables) and embedded with apps for solving
    a complex problem and it is freely accessible by the public user [24]. The GPS
    provides the position of the user or receiver through showing the longitude, latitude,
    and altitude which is not useful in finding the location. But GIS provides the
    information about where you are on the map by using computerized mapping system
    (contains all geographic Information and maps) which also displays or visualizes
    the ground terrain surface in 2D or 3D scenes. For example, GIS model is incorporated
    into GPS providing necessary information on the identification of sensor node
    placement with the earth and the mapping of satellite image to the corresponding
    farmer’s registered cropland. 2.6 Role of Wireless Communication Technology As
    depicted in Table 6, the Bluetooth 802.15.1 offers low powered and high speed
    over short-range wireless communication which connects mobile phones and portable
    devices and it can connect the devices up to 10 m within its range. Zigbee 802.15.4
    is low cost and low powered communication technology which is specially designed
    for controlling and monitoring of sensor network application and can provide coverage
    up to 100 m with the transfer rate is up to 250 Kbps. The Wireless Fidelity (WiFi)
    standards 802.11a and 802.11b are introduced in 1999 and provide data transfer
    rate up to 11 Mbps, followed by 802.11g is speed up to 54 Mbps. It is commonly
    used in the educational institution, company and business premises, and railway
    station which allow every individual to access the internet through WiFi. Worldwide
    Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) 802.16 is a new wireless technology
    in broadband network access. It can provide the services up to 50 Km with data
    transfer rate up to 70 Mbps. However, WiMAX requires the license for using the
    spectral bandwidth. The 2G evolved in the 90s comprises the IS-95 and GSM digital
    voice standards. The added feature of GSM is that it can support circuit switched
    data (wired communication) at speed up to 14.4 Kbps. The advent of 3G becomes
    a new era in cellular mobile communication development in the view of high-speed
    data communication, security, bandwidth, and support various multimedia applications,
    etc. it can support the data rate up to 2 Mbps and 384 Kbps for indoor and outdoor
    application respectively. The 3G licensed network services are operated and owned
    by the service providers and these services sell to the end users based on the
    usage of the data or use the network resources per seconds. The 4G is Internet
    Protocol (IP) based integrated system which provides the data rate between 100
    Mbps and 1 Gbps in both indoor and outdoor application. The salient features of
    4G are high quality, speed, security, and bandwidth, and also allow the mobile
    users to access the Internet at anywhere and anytime. Table 6 Comparison of various
    wireless communication technologies [17] Full size table 3 Research Challenges
    and Issues in IoT 3.1 Security Related Issues The productivity of the agriculture
    is directly related to the environmental parameters such as humidity, wind speed,
    temperature, acidity, \(\text {CO}_2\), and soil moisture, etc. if any modification,
    insertion, and deletion of these parameters have a negative outcome on the crop
    growth and productivity. Hence, the security and privacy are crucial issues in
    cropland. For example, any modification on the fertilizer quantity leads to reduce
    the productivity of the crop or the excessive use of fertilizer causing environmental
    pollution and reduce the groundwater quality. Therefore, great effort is needed
    to protect the environmental data from the network hackers or eavesdroppers [3,
    25,26,27]. 3.2 Data Management In smart agriculture, various kinds of data are
    collected from the several sources such as sensors in the cropland, satellite
    images, GPS, meteorological, etc., which are intended to be connected to the cloud.
    The management of these big data is a challenging task to the designer in agriculture
    because the determination of the data collection, diagnosis, analysis, decision
    making, and evaluation are the complex process in the cloud [28]. Thus, the integration
    of IoT and SDN require a new methodology in deployment, hardware and software
    services, communication, and resources [29]. 3.3 Fault Tolerance It is an important
    attribute of the WSNs for achieving an efficient smart agriculture. There are
    different kinds of faults occurred in WSNs due to (i) uncorrected values showed
    in the sensor’s measurement, (ii) deployment of the faulty sensor, (iii) poor
    network design, (iv) failure in the communication link, (v) exhausting of the
    battery energy very quickly [30]. 3.4 Memory The large size of memory is required
    for storing the big data which are collected from the various deployed sensor
    nodes and other resources. These collected data are used to analyze and derive
    the conclusion about the current status of the cropland, crop growth, fertilizer
    and pest level, and also send the valid command to the farmers through SMS or
    mobile agriculture app. [17]. 4 Framework of Geospatial Data with IoT for Precision
    Agriculture 4.1 Existing Infrastructures Akkas et al. [31] developed an IoT based
    greenhouse monitoring in which the Micaz motes were utilized to collect the environmental
    parameters such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure. The collected information
    transmitted through 802.15.4 to the MIB 250 base station, so as to perform the
    analysis of the collected data and make the inference and operation management.
    The end user can communicate with BS by using the mobile phone or the internet
    to get the management information about the green-house. Nagarajan et al. [32]
    demonstrated a sprinkler irrigation automated system with the help of the pH,
    temperature, and soil moisture sensor. These sensors were used to gather the field
    information and forwarded to the BS through Zigbee protocol. The decision support
    system in the BS made the inference about the cycle of irrigation and sends the
    command to the irrigation actuator through the PIC microcontroller. Martinez et
    al. [33] discussed a measurement of greenhouse climatic parameters such as humidity,
    air-speed, ultraviolet radiation, and globe and air temperature and transmitted
    to the remote operator through 802.15.4. Foughali et al. [34] developed a blight
    forecast model based on the weather condition and field sensor (Waspmote 868 SMA
    4.5 DBI). The sensed information was transmitted to the IoT cloud platform (Ubidots)
    through the gateway by using 802.15.4. The ubidots were analyzed and monitored
    for the incoming sensed and offered the notification service to the farmer’s mobile
    phone. 4.2 Case Studies Some real-time of agriculture related application by using
    IOT are discussed in below and summarized in Table 7. These applications related
    documents are gathered from www.campbellsci.com. 4.2.1 Pest Control and Evapotranspiration
    System Radu Carcoana, North Dakota State University described the weather monitoring
    and pesticide application, in which various kinds of sensors (wind speed and direction,
    temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and water
    level) are deployed in the region of North Dakota, USA in order to collect the
    field information and enhance the crop productivity and quality. These recorded
    sensor data are accessed through the phone which can be used as input of an automated
    decision system to monitor the specific crop diseases and plant-growth. This will
    help the formers to take a decision about when and how much uses pesticide and
    irrigate. 4.2.2 Flood and Irrigation Monitoring Rajat Saha, MBK Engineers Narendra
    S. Raghuwanshi, Indian Institute of Technology Shrinivasa K. Upadhyaya, UC Davis
    Wesley W. Wallender, UC Davis David C. Slaughter, UC Davis tested the irrigation
    control in the area of 720 ft long and 50 ft wide in University of California
    Davis campus which comprises of field sensor and communication system for monitoring
    the flood irrigation water at the lower end of the cropland. The sensor data are
    recorded in the micro-logger CR3000, which in turn transmits the collected data
    to the irrigator through the cellular modem (RAVEN110). 4.2.3 \(CO_2\) Monitoring
    Agricultural Research Service (ARS) demonstrated the \(\text {CO}_2\) flux cycle
    measurement in central and western US by monitoring the exchange of carbon dioxide
    between the rangeland and atmosphere. 4.2.4 Water-Resource Management and Weather
    Monitoring South Jersey Resource Conservation and Development Council, Inc., Campbell
    Scientific, Inc., developed a Resource Information Serving Everyone (RISE) network
    which aimed for watershed protection and management. In this, the water quality
    and weather station were established in the New Jersey by deploying various communication
    system, environment and the soil related sensor for collecting the valuable field
    data. These collected data are retrieved from the water quality and weather station
    through the telephone modem, thus, the user can build up own irrigation management
    system for their particular cropland. 4.2.5 Korea: Flux Monitoring over a Rice
    Paddy Campbell Scientific and Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Yonsei University,
    Seoul, Korea, jointly calculated the greenhouse gas fluxes such as methane, carbon
    dioxide, and water vapor over paddy by using a \(\text {CH}_4\)/\(\text {CO}_2\)/\(\text
    {H}_2\text {O}\) vapor profile system and eddy-covariance system. 4.2.6 ISS System
    for Studying Plants in Space, Feeding Space Travelers The Utah State University,
    Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) developed a plant growing chamber in space with
    the help of Campbell Scientific, and International Space Station (ISS). The data
    logger is used to monitor the temperature and water content, and also control
    the plant growing environment. This project is used for the micro-gravity food
    production, as well as it can also be used to perform the research in improving
    the space traveler life quality. Table 7 Summary of the case studies related to
    the precision agriculture (www.campbellsci.com) Full size table 4.2.7 Costa Rica:
    Banana Production Campbell Scientific and Costa Rica for the National Banana Corporation
    (CORBANA) established the network by using agro-meteorological stations. This
    network performs the data transmission between the filed sensor and the end users,
    mail services, Internet, VoIP at the end office through a Mikrotic Wi-Fi. Thus,
    CORBANA specialist can perform the relevant precautionary measures about the irrigation,
    fertilization, controlled usage of pesticides, diseases, banana production based
    on the collected field parameters (wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, soil
    moisture, relative humidity, temperature, leaf wetness, and solar radiation).
    4.2.8 Colombia: Fighting Fungus on Roses The Agro-Industrial Research Center at
    Jorge Tadeo Lozano University studied the various environmental conditions which
    encourage the growth of fungus on the rose. In order to avoid the downy mildew
    on roses, the leaf wetness sensor (Decagon LWS) and Apogee SI-111 Infrared Radiometers
    were deployed in the farming land. These sensors were connected to data-loggers
    (CR1000) through AM16/32 multiplexers. These sensor nodes were used to monitor
    the environmental changes and made a better condition for preventing the fungus
    growth accordingly, resulted in the avoidance of the use of pesticides and environmental
    pollution. 4.3 Proposed Framework Precision Agriculture is defined as a method
    of farm management that retrieves the existing real-time data, process and analyzes
    it and provides a solution to the farmers in the decision-making process to decrease
    inputs and increase crop production. The technological developments embarked on
    a way to use these in all fields of applications. The agriculture industry and
    automation suppliers are trying to explore and utilize the opportunities for improving
    their production, profitability, and farming practices with the help of IoT and
    digital solutions. The proposed architecture for the integration of Geospatial
    data with IoT to realize precision agriculture is shown in detail in Fig. 3. Fig.
    3 Concept of IoT Full size image It is observed from the figure, those sensors
    in the farm and farm equipment provide real-time data availability and alarms
    through the Internet for further process. The collected real-time data are analyzed
    using Big Data analytics and stored in the cloud server for making decisions.
    The decisions are taken after collecting the Geospatial data. In sensor-based
    precision agriculture system, data from the sensors are generally shared among
    the stakeholders either through a local server or the cloud. This information
    exchange purely depends on the reliability of the communication network and the
    Internet. Then, the processed data can be retrieved via smart phones and user-friendly
    apps that are available to represent it in a simple and clear format. It is found
    from the literature, the Geospatial information has an impact over the crop yield,
    irrigation and amount of fertilizers etc. Hence for taking a corrective and preventive
    action, IoT based smart farming is felt to be streamlined. It definitely helps
    in the prediction of the available and required water resources, fertilizers,
    and control of weeds. In recent years, Precision agriculture gained popularity
    among farmers across the globe because of the technological developments. Farmers
    are in need of these for realizing the optimum production with the available resources.
    Due to the global warming and sudden fluctuations in the climatic conditions and
    weather patterns, no one can expect an efficient production in agriculture without
    the help of these smart farming. 5 Conclusion IoT is a vital technology in precision
    agriculture for increasing the crop productivity, monitoring the environmental
    factor, measuring the quality of water and soil. The IoT technology allows the
    farmers to monitor the crop remotely and make any decision related to the agriculture
    tasks like water irrigation, greenhouse maintenance, and pest monitoring, etc.,
    at any time and anywhere through the Internet. In this chapter, the components
    and technologies involved in the IoT and their strengths, challenges, and issues
    all are elaborated. The need for the Geospatial data with IoT is discussed. This
    chapter reveals key strategies to handle the environmental crises such as flood,
    drought, cyclone, pollution, global warming, and blights, etc. and provides the
    awareness about the utilization of various technologies which are involved in
    the precision agriculture. The outcome of the proposal is to develop awareness
    about the precision farming and available control software application toolkits
    in the market and to make use of it. With this, the farmers can easily access
    the zone management office, update the crop details automatically and to retrieve
    the awareness and control information such as soil irrigation, soil nutrition,
    crop diseases etc. The proposed framework if it is developed as a model and implemented
    in real time, definitely it will bring a revolution in the agricultural sector.

    \ The \nProduction of crop directly access and controlled by smart \nphone’s;\
    \ it affords more flexibility, user-friendly, fast in \nprocessing. \n \nConstruction\
    \ Of Virtualization Of Wireless Sensor Network  \n Design aim in VSN (Virtualization\
    \ sensor network) \nThe primary objective of performing the virtualization in\
    \ a \nsensor network offered by many researchers. Some of the \nissues behind\
    \ sensor network virtualization, each stage need \nto fulfill their criteria \
    \ \nFlexibility \nFlexibility constructed based the adjusting change occur \n\
    from external, and VSNs offers some problems in elasticity. \nVSN provides more\
    \ freedom in each feature of sensor \nnetworking. Sensor virtualization network\
    \ service provider \nneed to generate shapes of virtual sensor network topology.\
    \ It \ngives more flexible routing and functionality in altering \ncontrol protocols\
    \ that independently placed in the physical \n98 \n \nsensor network with previous\
    \ SVNSPs (Sensor Virtualization \nNetwork Service Provider). \nNetwork Heterogeneity\
    \ \nIt is most necessity issues in constructing the VSNs. It \nmainly based on\
    \ two aspects like i) Heterogeneity-based on \nsensor Network technology with\
    \ various sensor nodes. ii) \nEach point to point SVNSP designed at the top of\
    \ the \nheterogeneous mixture based on SInp, it also called \nheterogeneous. SVNSPs\
    \ need to perform across various \ndomains, point to point VSNs without the requirement\
    \ of any \nparticular solution. It mainly based on infrastructure it can \nassist\
    \ different protocol, an algorithm for performing with \nvarious SVNSPs. More\
    \ Heterogeneity of end user devices \nneeds to consider. \nIsolation \nSensor\
    \ network Virtualization needs to assure isolation \nwith previous VSNs to enhance\
    \ in fault –tolerance, security, \nand privacy. Sensor network protocol is unerect\
    \ to \nmisconfigure; an error occurs in implementation. Sensor \nvirtualization\
    \ need assure the misconfiguration on single \nVSNs even though it exists with\
    \ same physical part of the \nsensor network. Device abstraction is needed to\
    \ move further \nwith effective software isolation; the various instance needs\
    \ \nto be unmodified with sensing application by using the virtual \nsensors in\
    \ applying with the physical sensor. Mostly strong \nisolation is enhanced their\
    \ performance when each user‘s \nperformance with shared function device resources.\
    \ Sharing \nGuarantees provides fewer fractions in sensor resources. \nManageability\
    \ \nCentral important part of constructing VSN is to maintain \nthe VSN applications.\
    \ VSNs offer each SVNSP stay \nindependent in a physical sensor network. By splitting\
    \ \nSVNSPs from SInPs, sensor network virtualization needs to \nstandard network\
    \ in maintaining each step. It describes each \nlayer in network architecture\
    \ needs offer entire, point to point \ncontrol over NSNs to SVNSPs. Moreover,\
    \ it requires \ncoordination in the various regions in previous WSN domains. \n\
    Scalability \nSensor networks are the more specific principle of sensor \nnetwork\
    \ virtualization. We get Scalability from indispensable \ncomponent equations.\
    \ SInPs (Sensor Infrastructure provider) \nare scalable assist in more number\
    \ of coexisting VSNs \nwithout any changes in the performance. In the construction\
    \ \nof large-scale sensor network, it requires to perform the VSNs \nscalability;\
    \ any changes can be made or efficiently in \nimplementing the physical sensor\
    \ network. \nStability and Convergence \nIsolation assures the faults of single\
    \ VSN, it will not affect \nwith other VSNs, in causing some errors, misconfiguration\
    \ \nbased on physical network, it also unstable with the sensor \nnetwork and\
    \ virtualization platform. Due to instability \noccurrence in SInPs, it lies instability\
    \ for the entire host in \nVSNs. Mostly VSNs assure the balance of sensor \nvirtualization\
    \ platform in some scenario. Uncertainty may \naffect with VSNs required to perform\
    \ successfully in \nconverge of stability. \nProgrammability \nProgrammability\
    \ provides more assurance in both \nflexibility and manageability. Indispensable\
    \ require in virtual \nsensor network component as programmability. By using \n\
    programmability; SVNSPs perform protocol place in services. \nTwo need questions\
    \ to satisfy: Whether programmability \nrequires allowing? Then how to achieve?\
    \ Solutions are merely \ncomfortable, practical and more secure of some duration.\
    \ For \ndistributing resource constraints in a sensor node, \nprogrammability\
    \ offers more research gaps in VSNs. \nLegacy support \nIt mainly concerns with\
    \ placing the new approach or \ntechnology.  We can easily integrate legacy with\
    \ sensor \nnetwork virtualization in assisting with previous WSN \ndomain like\
    \ VSN, in gathering sensor networks due the \nefficiency are still research challenges.\
    \ Most of the \nresearchers concentrate on design only. \n \nSome Of The Challenges\
    \ While Constructing Vsns  \nInterfacing \nSVNSP make use of physical resources\
    \ from single to \nmultiple environments, it offers in performing virtual sensor\
    \ \nnetwork. SInP necessity needs to provide the interface that \nallows service\
    \ providers for connecting and giving the needs. \nInteroperability is similar\
    \ to an interface that needs to \nrecognize the standards requirements in performing\
    \ sensor \nvirtualization as a request to various nodes, links of virtual \nsensors\
    \ with some attributes. Monitoring interface is a perfect \nexample of sensor\
    \ web design. \nManaging limited resource \nResources allocation offers sensor\
    \ network virtualization \nplatform, consists of both static and dynamic allocation\
    \ of the \nnode. Links of virtual sensor connects with physical nodes \nthat as\
    \ paths called virtual sensor network embedding. In this \nconstraint of nodes,\
    \ links offer in decreasing the NP-based \nissues. When an entire network request\
    \ to determined in \nadvance.  Storage, power consuming, less battery power are\
    \ \nsome issues in maintaining. More efficient research need an \napplication\
    \ from the virtual network to real WSN requires. \nMoreover, it will be accessible\
    \ and useful in constructing the \nvirtualization in sensor nodes. \nResource\
    \ Discovery \nResource Discovery allocates requests from various virtual \nsensor\
    \ providers.The environment can perform topology \nsensor network in maintaining\
    \ the vital sensor network \ncomponents. It also shares the crucial information\
    \ in \ndetermining the links between the network and even \ninstallation of the\
    \ virtual sensor network. \nQuality of service and experience \nQuality of service\
    \ mainly used for sorting the whole \nvirtualizations. It evaluates the network\
    \ operator’s agreement \nlike noise, decreases packets. Meanwhile, the experience\
    \ \nassessing sensor network for fulfilling the various application \nstages based\
    \ on user’s needs. Need to ensure that significant \nchallenges are in VSNs. \n\
    Security \nSecurity offers data from the physical sensor node to \nvarious user\
    \ application stages. In large scale, WSNs data are \noffers in physical sensors\
    \ are the most necessary. Misuse the \nprocess effect in users level application,\
    \ and VSNs need to \noffer both security and authentication control. \n Resource\
    \ Scheduling \nThe virtual sensor network is the providers that specifically \n\
    assure the characteristics of the virtual node with the \nbandwidth to assigns\
    \ its network. Virtual sensor routers are \nservice providers that may request\
    \ to ensure the limited \n99 \n \nprocessing packet in CPU for particular storage\
    \ needs and \nalso provides the memory size. \nThe virtual sensor connects for\
    \ providing request range \nfrom most excellent service in combining with fix\
    \ loss, and \ndelay characteristics to recovered from physical links. It \naffords\
    \ with assurance in producing the illusion in remote and \nplaced network services\
    \ for the single service provider.It \nrequired infrastructure need to deployed\
    \ proper scheduling \nalgorithm for an entire component of the sensor network.\
    \ By \nPrevious framework virtualization offers scheduling process \nlike CPU,\
    \ Storage, memory,  network interface, it runs on \neach VM to host sensor node.\
    \ Sensor network Virtualization \nmay be enhanced control for performing the resource\
    \ \nscheduling placed on the physical platform. \n Admission Control and Resource\
    \ Usage Policy \nSensor platform offers more secured that resource will not \n\
    be part of Provisioned to transfer QoS support. It allows \ndetermining comprehensive\
    \ accounting and performance in \ncontrolling the admission algorithm, in giving\
    \ more assurance \nresource assigned to virtual sensor networks. It will not be\
    \ \nmore physical storage lies on physical sensor networks. \nMoreover, will not\
    \ permit dynamic to rescale in allocating \nresources. To avoids the constraints\
    \ iniquity by virtual sensor \nnetworks. Its controls by placing the service providers,\
    \ will \nnot overflow the enormous resource assign to them by using \nboth direct\
    \ and indirect process. \nNaming and Addressing \nBy essential heterogeneity in\
    \ naming and addressing \noutlines of the previous process. The Main challenges\
    \ of \nsensor network virtualization like virtual sensor network, \npoint to point\
    \ connection, communication between universal. \nMoreover, various stages of application\
    \ users at the same time \ncommunicate with various virtual networks by many platform\
    \ \nproviders by different techniques in processing separate \nservice. It affords\
    \ with incorporating heterogeneity in many \nshapes are some of the issues in\
    \ sensor network virtualization. \nSome recent research projects are split with\
    \ their identities, \nend host to physical and logical place to add some need\
    \ stages \nin the new process.It also provides standard finding space to \noffer\
    \ communication accurately without striking down both \nphysical and virtual sensor\
    \ network. Moreover, will not be a \nphysical process because of unrestrained\
    \ memory requires. \nThe Main essential research gaps in naming, addressing in\
    \ \nidentifying the worldwide communication that able to connect \nwith the federation\
    \ sensor system. \nVirtual sensor network operations and management \nSome of\
    \ the specific challenges in sensor network \nvirtualization like Operation and\
    \ management. By splitting \naccountability and duty among various users in sensor\
    \ \nnetwork virtualization platform.  It provides more \nmaintenance in decreasing\
    \ process of error. By controlling \nboth proactive and reactive process to enforce\
    \ responsibility \nin hosting virtual sensor networks. Significance in flexibility\
    \ \nneeds to be described in various stages of sensor network \noperation centers\
    \ to brilliant agents for sensor network \ncomponents. Virtual sensor network\
    \ operation can single \nservice providers in configuration, maintain, accessing\
    \ the \nvirtual sensor networks with regardless of others. From virtual \nsensor\
    \ network, it covers part lies in physical sensor networks, \nthe application\
    \ needs to improve with aggregate data from \nmany places, frequently from conflict,\
    \ maintain process \nanalyze the users in sensor platform providers. Average layers\
    \ \nof abstraction in continuing management software’s provider \nwith a more\
    \ efficient solution. Most of the loss lies on \nphysical sensor network elements\
    \ that get from failures of \ncascading in virtual sensor networks; it straightly\
    \ connects the \nhost to the parts. For example, physical connection failures\
    \ to \nprovide results in whole virtual connection by passing it. \nCorresponding\
    \ physical sensor node failure may need to \nrepeat in installation for a complete\
    \ service provider in \ncustom software. Some of the failure like detection and\
    \ \nisolation and also well with prevention and recuperation in the \nstable state\
    \ are the some of the research gaps. \n \nWsns USED IN AGRICULTURE DOMAIN \nNecessity\
    \ of using WSNs \n Ability in decision making  \nIt provides many hops in nature.\
    \ In the vast region, features \nneed to improve in energy efficiency with the\
    \ whole network \nand also improve in lifetime duration. Some of the features\
    \ \nlike multiple sensor nodes combined themselves and got the \nresult. \n Dynamic\
    \ topology configuration \nFor preserving the power of the battery, sensor node\
    \ acts \nthem as a sleep mode in much time. By applying topology \nmanagement\
    \ approach, sensor nodes cooperate in decision \nmaking, in reducing network duration.The\
    \ network topology \nperformed with less number of nodes as it stays in active\
    \ mode. \nFault tolerance \nThe Main challenges in performing the WSNs in sensor\
    \ \nnode called fault –Prone. Below is some scenario, unplanned \nnodes placed\
    \ for getting an advantage in network partitioning \nand also change to the entire\
    \ performance of network are \ndisturbed. Moreover, measure from sensor nodes\
    \ may be self-\norganized in the network topology. \n Context-awareness \nIt mainly\
    \ consists of sensor data based on physical and \nenvironmental components. Sensor\
    \ nodes benefit knowledge \non covering context. A decision on sensor nodes based\
    \ on \ncontext-aware. \nScalability \n WSN protocol constructed for performing\
    \ the network \nregardless of its size and number of count. The Features of \n\
    WSNs are essential for most of the applications. \n Node heterogeneity \nWSNs\
    \ are frequently assumed to determine homogeneous \nsensor placed in devices.\
    \ Computation power, memory, \nsensing ability, transceiver unit, and movement\
    \ capability are \nsome real scenario based on methods in different processing.\
    \ \nTolerance versus communication failure in criticizes \nplatform conditions\
    \ \nVast areas in agriculture domain, WSNs uncomforted in \ncriticize platform\
    \ conditions. WSN protocol stacks some of \nthe \ntechniques \nthat \nhave \n\
    phenomenon \nfailure \nin \ncommunication network caused because of surrounding\
    \ \neffects. \nAutonomous operating nodes \nSome potential features of WSNs are\
    \ self-reliant operating \nmode and adaptiveness. In an application like agriculture\
    \ has \nsome specific features plays a crucial role in performing well \nin operation\
    \ modes. \nInformation security \n100 \n \nWSNs convey raw data in concerning\
    \ parameter of \nagriculture field. It assures the security of sensing data. WSNs\
    \ \noffers process control mechanism; anomaly detection limited \nto unauthenticated\
    \ customers. \n \nFig. 1 Process of WSNs \n \nRequirement in using Sensors in\
    \ Agriculture \nThe sensor collects data from physical and environmental \nattributes.Actuators\

    \ techniques that have part of various \nsensor network based on research aspects.\
    \ This technology \nhas the different ability and its properties that are having\
    \ \ncomplemented. Clear and brief comparison in given table 6. \nSome Of The Issues\
    \ In Wireless Sensor Networks In \nAgriculture Field    \nWireless sensor networks\
    \ mainly based on flexible and \nautonomous, it has opportunities to design with\
    \ previous \napplication domain like remote sensing and optimized \nsolution.\
    \ Wireless sensor network technology has many \nproblems that required dealing\
    \ with long-term availability \nframework. Sensor nodes dictate design and development\
    \ the \nenergy consumption, communication, protocols, deployment. \nIn many scenario\
    \ farming placed with various resources, \nnature of land and different climate.\
    \  \nEnergy Consumption \nSensor nodes deployed in a wireless sensor network,\
    \ \nconsists of event detection, data processing, and transmission \nare the responsibility\
    \ of WSNs. In some case, the multi-hop \nnetwork has a task in node and data routing.\
    \ Each work \nrequires energy consumption. Node is based on the restrict the \n\
    perfect source for  Lithium cells.  Sensor node lifetime mainly \nbased on battery\
    \ life duration. By placing required energy \nmanagement approach in hardware\
    \ and software, battery life \nneeds to enhance more length. Use of renewable\
    \ energy \nsources like solar power and kinetic energy required to adjust, \n\
    when less expensive result. However in some case of \nagriculture domain sensor\
    \ simultaneously recharge when \nbattery altered their places and process usually\
    \ well. \nData acquisition, sampling, and transmission \nEnergy is spent in every\
    \ data samples, process and \ntransmits. Optimized data are gathered with sample\
    \ rate when \nit required being programmed and not only need data, but \nenergy\
    \ also not spent unnecessarily. Frequently data \nacquisition makes a large number\
    \ of packets that are \ntransmitted and discharge the battery quickly. In agriculture\
    \ \ndomain, the sampling rate is not higher, and it will make a \nchange depends\
    \ on types of crop used in resources. \nFault tolerance \nSensor nodes are deployed\
    \ in criticize platform, unerect to \na physical cause, block, and interference.\
    \ To preserve the \nreliability of a WSN, failure of sensor node need not cause\
    \ the \nentire process of the network. Some technique placed on \nimproving the\
    \ fault tolerance in a system like the use of sensor \nnetwork, reprocessing sensor\
    \ network and over processing \nsensor region. \nSize and Housing in sensor nodes\
    \ \nIt required being too small and needed to distribute. Some \nof the critical\
    \ factors like heat, rain, physical misbehavior by \nhuman or animals. \nSensor\
    \ placement \nSensor node placement is an essential problem in \nconstructing\
    \ the network topologies process using parameter \ncomprising the sensor. It required\
    \ to creating in designing and \nperforming smartly when WSN need to established\
    \ in \nreliability and autonomously. Sensors are need covered and \nplaced in\
    \ position in measuring parameter without the need \nfor hindrance. Example sensor\
    \ light is deployed in height and \nneglected the close plant leaves. Accurate\
    \ measures put in \nground-based on the level of water and moisture content on\
    \ \nthe ground. Deallocate of the sensor in various positions based \non durable\
    \ wind and water currents, need to place \nappropriately in required form with\
    \ afford nodes. \nSome Of The Essential Application In Agriculture And \nFarming\

    \ like heat \nsummation and essential frost damage. \nIt provides feasibility\
    \ in ZigBee, we using remote sensor \nnetwork called as MPWiNodeZ, propose for\
    \ precision \nviticulture. Solar power, wind power, Hypro power are \nbatteries\
    \ used for recharging the harvest energy platform. \nGreen House \nMonitoring\
    \ environment and greenhouse controlling are \nessential aspects but not depends\
    \ on the natural agent. By \ncollecting both in and out climate data in the greenhouse\

    \ With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources\
    \ of data generation have increased\nexponentially. The use and processing of\
    \ this generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The\
    \ concept\nof a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making\
    \ in the various aspects of daily life and also\nimprovement in the traditional\
    \ systems. In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include\
    \ devices used for\ndata collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis,\
    \ and decision making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital\n\
    role in smart city applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many\
    \ challenges when dealing with such voluminous\nand high-speed generated data,\
    \ such as semi-structured or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time\
    \ responses, and so on.\nProbabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved\
    \ as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete this\n\

    \ in the ﬁeld of computing and data was the new term. There was\nan evolution\
    \ of relational databases between the 1980s and 1990s. The internet and IoT are\
    \ clusters of unstructured,\nsemi-structured, and structured data. In the 1990s,\
    \ there was slow or no internet in most cities. These were ordinary\ncities. Generally,\
    \ ordinary cities are deﬁned as human settlements without the use of the latest\
    \ technology at all.\nThe need for processing, storage, and analysis is required\
    \ beyond the human and technical infrastructure. This huge\nvolume and variety\
    \ of unstructured data and untapped information is spread across the networks.\
    \ The core part of\nApache Hadoop is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS),\
    \ consisting of the storage part, and the MapReduce\n*Corresponding author. E-mails:\

    \ [4]. As the data is increasing day by day, to access this data in an efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwell-structured manner, the government and public sector require technologies\
    \ and expertise to convert urban cities\nto smart cities. The research interest\
    \ in smart cities has continuously increased in the current and coming years and\n\
    it is economically justiﬁed by the progress of state-of-the-art technologies [21].\
    \ New inventions like the internet, the\ncloud, and IoT have increased data generation\
    \ speed as well as introduced a variation in data. The smart city impacts\ntowns\
    \ and cities around the world with the evolution of the internet and the use of\
    \ new technologies. But in the\ncurrent context, rapid population growth is creating\
    \ challenges for the government and its services. So, smart cities\nare the most\
    \ acceptable solution to such situations of better metropolitan living conditions\
    \ [146]. The emergence of\na smart city has the potential to manage all these\
    \ issues (Fig. 1). But, expeditious urbanization also quickly presents\na major\
    \ challenge worldwide. Though movement from rural to metropolitan areas is unavoidable,\
    \ that’s why cities\npersist in facing many challenges like transport, healthiness,\
    \ air quality, agriculture, and many more [87]. Smart\ncities face many issues\
    \ like pollution, health assistance, overburden on both public and private sectors,\
    \ trafﬁc, etc.\ndue to the rapid growth in population in metropolitan cities [126].\
    \ In this connection, the problems associated with\nthese issues in cities require\
    \ ingenious solutions. They include human strength, ingenuity, and collaboration\
    \ with\ndifferent stakeholders [117].\nIn a recent survey, the United Nations\
    \ estimated that the world’s population will grow by 32% from 2015 to\n2050 and\
    \ that the population will grow by 63% in the metropolitan area. Several researchers\
    \ also stated that by\n2030, more than 60% of the population will be living in\
    \ cities, with the southeast United States experiencing the\ngreatest growth [74,275].\
    \ The extensive and rapid growth of information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\
    has provided possible solutions and mechanisms to various problems in metropolitan\
    \ areas [13] this approach can\nbe used as a tool [267] to increase the effectiveness\
    \ of the city system. In this regard, the thinking or mentality of\nhumans is\
    \ required to be changed, like a smart mind, to raise the standard of living for\
    \ sustainability in the smart\ncity. Furthermore, remote monitoring and management\
    \ systems are being used to improve energy efﬁciency in smart\ncities [316].\n\
    Since the advent of the coronavirus and its declaration as a worldwide epidemic,\
    \ all public and private sectors have\nbeen affected. This virus has affected\
    \ daily routines and activities like education, communication, daily movement,\n\
    labor, and many more. Some public and private sectors have worked with 50% manpower\
    \ on alternative days. Many\nsectors, like IT companies, schools, etc. have run\
    \ Work From Home (WFH). Even doctors have their OPD or patients\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n231\ndiagnosed online.\
    \ The key solution to this epidemic’s key problems for daily life can be solved\
    \ through the smart\ncity. Jasim et al. [129]made a wise decision to help society\
    \ and expand the resources available to individuals in areas\nsuch as healthcare,\
    \ communication, transportation, education, and many others.\nThe Government of\
    \ India (GoI) has a long-term vision for smart cities. GoI deﬁnes smart cities\
    \ as a mission\nto conduct monetary growth and improve the quality of life by\
    \ allowing the development of regional zones and\nutilizing technology that directs\
    \ to smart results. They also designed a workbook “Making a City Smart: Learnings\n\
    from the Smart Cities Mission” with activities in each section to help cities\
    \ plan their smart city journeys. Creating\na smart city incorporates lessons\
    \ from the smart city mission to clarify what, why, and how a smart city works.\n\
    Consolidated at the national level, 100 smart cities have proposed to undertake\
    \ 5,151 projects worth Rs. 2,05,018\ncrores in 5 years from their selected dates.\
    \ New ﬁnancial innovations are built on investment plans. The distribution\nis\
    \ estimated to be from a variety of sources as follows: 6480 projects worth Rs.\
    \ 185,905 Cr are tendered, 5845\nprojects worth Rs. 157,369 are in work order\
    \ stages and 3145 projects worth Rs. 53,256 Cr are completed. The\ncities like\
    \ Gwalior, Thiruvananthapuram, Satna, Udaipur, New Town Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar,\
    \ and Ahmedabad are\ncovered under various smart city projects [183].\n1.1. Role\
    \ of big data in smart city\nBig Data basically stands for velocity, volume, and\
    \ variety of information, which includes complexity in terms\nof speed of data\
    \ generation, the structure of data (variety), and the amount of data to be generated.\
    \ Big data has\na number of deﬁnitions and’V’ principles to make big data processing\
    \ clear and accurate [118]. Anything beyond\nthe human and traditional infrastructure\
    \ and techniques required to store, process, and analyze big data provides\nthe\
    \ solutions for it. With the advent of new technologies such as IoT, ICT, sensors,\
    \ and so on, big data systems are\nbecoming more efﬁcient in sophisticated data\
    \ infrastructures [170].\nThe role of big data in smart cities is heavily inﬂuenced,\
    \ particularly in recognizing patterns, analyzing, and\nprocessing data collected\
    \ from various IoT devices (Fig. 2). Every city is evolving towards being a smart\
    \ city. These\ncities combine basic needs with high technology for a carefree\
    \ and basic lifestyle. To extract important information\nfrom such huge data sets,\
    \ big data analysis is the key [7]. The data collected from different sensors\
    \ and devices in\na smart city’s various gates installed in the city is used for\
    \ better decisions. This growth in data requires efﬁcient\nstorage and handling,\
    \ which is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96]. Big data has different\
    \ effects in\ndifferent parts of the city.\nThe protection of the general public:\
    \ The security and privacy of citizens is the main concern in smart cities.\n\
    To protect their citizens from anything mishappening within the city, various\
    \ analyses of geographical data can be\ndone. This can all be recorded through\
    \ Close Circuit Televisions (CCTVs) and sensors installed on street lights or\n\
    trafﬁc lights. An enormous amount of data is developed and signiﬁcant expansion\
    \ is required when the desired data\ntransforms the city into a considerably safer\
    \ location.\nUrbanism: Cities are investing heavily in transforming to become\
    \ smart cities. The current needs of the city\ncan be identiﬁed through the effective\
    \ use of data, which can aid in identifying areas that require development and\n\
    improvement. As a result, cities can invest by volunteering in areas where they\
    \ are needed.\nFig. 2. Inﬂuence of big data in smart cities.\n232\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nTransportation: After\
    \ Covid-19 both public and private transportation are affected after COVID-19.\
    \ Most people\nrely on their own reasoning to get to work and so on. The congestion\
    \ on the roads is increasing, so the risk of\naccidents or anything else going\
    \ wrong has also increased. To handle or manage trafﬁc on roads, the system requires\n\
    big data and well-structured data. Large data sets will also help reduce risks.\n\
    Sustainable Growth: This is also the main part of a smart city. For sustainable\
    \ growth, a huge amount of past and\npresent data is required. Likewise, storing\
    \ this data is one of the challenges for the smart city. This data is updated\n\
    on a daily basis. Data is a special factor in determining the impact of improvement\
    \ in the city.\nInfrastructure: To maintain sustainability, smart city infrastructure\
    \ needs to improve consistently. Obviously, for\nthis data, a smart city is required\
    \ and used in a good manner to improve or maintain the infrastructure.\nSo, the\
    \ role of big data in smart cities is signiﬁcant for efﬁcient and quick results.\
    \ Big data is the brain of the\nsmart city. The main challenge is the lack of\
    \ awareness of using this data to create smart solutions to fulﬁll the\nrequirements\
    \ of citizens. Citizens are the main stakeholders of smart cities. So, to improve\
    \ the standard of living,\nthe developer needs new data processing tools and techniques.\
    \ There is computational, time, and space complexity\nby using the deterministic\
    \ data structure. Probabilistic Data Structures are one of the key solutions for\
    \ smart storage\nand searching of data in real-time scenarios.\nThe traditional\
    \ methods may also produce accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off\
    \ in space and time,\nwhich is not acceptable due to the massive amount of data.\
    \ Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional\ndata structure is\
    \ shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation solution,\
    \ which may be\nor may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction.\
    \ Since PDSs have some probabilistic compo-\nnents, they are efﬁcient in reducing\
    \ the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,\n\
    storing nonstructural data, helping with fast retrieval, and making approximate\
    \ predictions. Hash functions are used\nto represent these data structures [246].\
    \ The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\ntesting,\
    \ and cardinal counting. Low memory requirements and good processing speed are\
    \ two distinct features of\nPDS [136].\nThe extensive review of this paper has\
    \ found the key challenges faced during the handling of big data in smart\ncities.\
    \ In this regard, the PDS and its variants have provided the key solutions to\
    \ these challenges and also found new\npossibilities. In this paper, the importance\
    \ of big data in smart cities, generation (Section 2), architecture (Section 4),\n\
    and the detailed application (Section 7) of smart cities, worldwide running smart\
    \ city projects (Section 5) and\ncommonly used PDS (Section 6) have been discussed.\
    \ During the survey, it was found that big data has a high\ninﬂuence on smart\
    \ cities. PDS has evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart\
    \ cities to complete\nthis tedious task of handling big data with real-time response.\
    \ PDS has been used in many smart city domains,\nincluding healthcare, transportation,\
    \ the environment, energy, and industry. This paper has thoroughly investigated\n\
    the prominent domain of smart cities, including the origin, current research status,\
    \ and existing applications of PDS,\nas well as research gaps and challenges (Section\
    \ 10).\n2. Generations of smart cities\nTo improve the standard of living there\
    \ is a need to change from rural to urban. Governments and citizens are\nincreasing\
    \ their attention in terms of technologies and new startups in smart cities. The\
    \ concept of a smart city for\nurban transformation has radically changed over\
    \ the years. The generation of smart cities has been concise (Table 1).\nBased\
    \ on analysis and study, several researchers have divided the technical advancement\
    \ in smart cities into different\ngenerations (generations 1.0–5.0) (Fig. 3) [140,265]:\n\
    Generations 1.0: – When the technology vendors started implementing their own\
    \ solutions in cities, it was deﬁned\nas the ﬁrst technology-driven smart city.\
    \ Due to the inﬂuential role of big corporations like IBM and Cisco, they\nare\
    \ criticized for their technology concerns. To improve the efﬁciency of public\
    \ and private services, the creators of\ntechnology development are encouraged\
    \ to use their own solutions in cities.\nGenerations 2.0: – Indirectly concerned\
    \ with citizens, issues like healthcare, transport, air quality, and water qual-\n\
    ity are arising. The technology and tools were developed to address such issues\
    \ in generation 2.0. The participation\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    \ in decision-making in cities [276]. The quality of life and local administration\
    \ was mea-\nsured by modern technology. For this, cities presented agendas and\
    \ schemes that support the execution of trendy\ntechnology.\nGenerations 3.0:\
    \ – Thus, the modern city represents the whole connected ecosystem that integrates\
    \ ICT into a\nsmart city. The modern city building programs were organized and\
    \ the local public participated. It was the time\nwhen the government acted as\
    \ a facility providing services to citizens. Here also, citizens are competent\
    \ to represent\ntheir thoughts and innovative ideas [251]. Here also, the urban\
    \ space is designed for users and their engagement.\nGenerations 4.0: – By adopting\
    \ 4.0 industrial transformation, the beneﬁts of smart cities are valued to outweigh\n\
    city costs through city establishment [298]. This generation of smart cities illustrates\
    \ the most useful parts of the\npast; for example, technology generation 1.0,\

    \ by Industry Revolution 4.0, and they develop new technologies. In this, control\
    \ is over the use\nof existing resources and infrastructure.\nGenerations 5.0:\
    \ – In this generation 5.0, the concept of cognitive computing is introduced for\
    \ developing cities.\nIt is purely based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Systems\
    \ are self-learned from past and present knowledge that\nreﬂects changes in real-time\
    \ like interest, barriers, etc [228]. Each public and private service can be handled\
    \ by an\nindependent agent, which gives fast and efﬁcient results. Generations\
    \ 5.0 is the main focus on decision-making for\nurban development by using behavioral\
    \ analysis and AI [264].\n3. Ranking of smart city\nWorldwide, there are different\
    \ ranking systems based on distinct parameters. Out of these, the most popular\
    \ are,\n“Liveable City Index (LCI)” [204],“intelligent cities” [292], “sustainable\
    \ cities” [28], “global cities” and “competi-\ntiveness cities” [266].\nThe center\
    \ smart city index is used for ranking by researchers’ organizations such as Smart\
    \ City Observatory, in\ncollaboration with IMD competitiveness [44]. To manage\
    \ the infrastructure of smart cities like transportation, trafﬁc,\nstreet light\
    \ etc. the technologies like AI and IoT may be used. Muhammad A.R. Tariq et al.\
    \ [266] tries to identify\nthe preferences of people living with different city\
    \ ranking systems, and the top ﬁve cities in the last three years are\ngiven in\
    \ Table 2. Another ranking criteria is that Juniper Research, an analyst ﬁrm based\
    \ in the UK, has ranked the\ncities as smart cities on various factors like transportation,\
    \ energy, healthcare, connectivity between urban areas, etc.\nShanghai, Seoul,\
    \ Barcelona, Beijing, and New York are among the top ﬁve global cities considered.\
    \ These cities\nmainly work on real-time data, which helps in managing the assets\
    \ and future-prooﬁng them. They also cover the\ndowntown to provide 5G and 99%\
    \ of ﬁber coverage across the city. To fully ﬁll, the needs of residents, these\
    \ smart\ncities are using the “Citizen Cloud App”, which uses ambient technologies\
    \ like AI, Cloud Computing, and Big Data,\nwhich come under Smart City Generation\
    \ 5.0 [20].\n4. Architecture of smart city\nSmart city development includes the\
    \ integration and implementation of digital and IoT. IoT provides essential\n\
    elements of smart cities like data production, data management, and application\
    \ management. The number of smart\ncity architectures proposed over time [226].\
    \ In Fig. 4 the most generic architecture has been represented with four\nlayers.\
    \ All these four layers are integrated with security modules because of sensitive\
    \ data.\nSensing layer: – The bottom-most layer of the architecture represents\
    \ the sensing layer or data collection layer.\nIoT devices are used to build this\
    \ layer. This layer uses various IoT devices like actuator, Zigbee, Radio Frequency\n\
    Identiﬁcation (RFID) sensors etc. to sens these various parameters like humidity,\
    \ temperature, pressure, etc. Data\ncollection on mobile devices is a huge burden\
    \ on the sensor layer, which resides under the structure. This layer\ncaptures\
    \ real-time data from sensors [26,192].\nTransmission layer: – With a variety\
    \ of communication technologies, the transfer layer carries data to higher\nlevels.\
    \ This layer acts as the spine of any smart city architecture. In this layer,\
    \ the various communication networks\nlike 3G, 4G, LTE, the internet, and satellite\
    \ also help in mobile networks. Fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication\nis embedded\
    \ in the base station for transferring huge wireless trafﬁc [100].\nData management\
    \ layer: – This layer resides between the transmission and application layers\
    \ and is the brain of\na smart city. The functions of this layer are deception,\
    \ editing, analysis, storage, and decision-making [195]. The\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n235\nFig. 4. Layered architecture\
    \ of a generic smart city [243].\nstored information in this layer is used to\
    \ provide services to various applications in the top layer. The primary role\n\
    of this layer is to preserve data integrity, data puriﬁcation, expansion, and\
    \ optimization [285]. As the ﬁnal function\nof the data management layer, the\
    \ conclusions obtained are transferred to the application layer for proper use.\n\
    Application layer: – An application layer is required to connect the data management\
    \ layer with urban residents.\nThis is the topmost layer of this architecture.\
    \ This layer provides assistance to the users. It operates applications\nthat\
    \ use IoT, for example, smart homes, grid distribution, smart transport, weather\
    \ forecasting, etc., and intelligent\nhealth [317]. As this layer is directly\
    \ connected to the end-users, the satisfaction of users may increase with the\n\
    improvement of services provided.\n5. Projects contributions related to smart\
    \ city\nThe research on smart city buildings has been accomplished worldwide.\
    \ Hence, the concept of smart cities was\nintroduced. The research was conducted\
    \ by various international organizations, universities, and businesses. Various\n\
    countries, like the US and China, have also accomplished research in intelligent\
    \ urban design [156]. The smart city\nencourages the planning of metropolitan,\
    \ oversight through ICT, IoT, CC etc [157]. The evaluation method proposed\nby\
    \ IBM is very focused on building standards and relevant standards. So far, the\
    \ various initiatives, contributions,\nachievements, and projects in smart cities\
    \ are listed in Table 3 [106].\n6. Probabilistic data structure\nThe exponential\
    \ increase in data production services is most evident in the last decade, due\
    \ to the emergence\nof ICT, IoT, etc. The traditional methods may also produce\
    \ accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off in\nspace and time,\
    \ which is not acceptable for a massive amount of data. Due to the huge and limitless\
    \ evolution, the\ntraditional data structure is shifted to PDS for retrieval and\
    \ storage. PDS has given an approximation solution, which\nmay be or may not be\
    \ the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction. Since PDSs have some\
    \ probabilistic\ncomponents, they are efﬁcient in reducing the time or space trade-offs.\
    \ PDS also plays a key role in big data\nprocessing, storing nonstructural data,\
    \ helping in fast retrieval, and making approximate predictions. In general,\n\

    \ of PDS (Fig. 5). But in this paper, we are discussing four types, because these\
    \ are widely\nused by various researchers in their design and development. These\
    \ are very useful for handling and storing large\namounts of data in an appropriate\
    \ and efﬁcient manner. Hash functions are used to represent these data structures\n\
    [246]. The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\
    \ testing, and cardinal counting. Low\nmemory requirements and good processing\
    \ speed are two distinct features of PDS [136].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n237\nFig. 5. Overview of PDS [246].\n6.1. Bloom\
    \ ﬁlter\nIn 1970, the concept of Bloom Filter (BF) was introduced by Burton H.\
    \ Bloom [36]. The BF is a probabilistic\nmodel, a highly efﬁcient random data\
    \ structure. It is used to reduce space problems and is an effective way to query\n\
    the membership of any item in an extensive set. The BF consists of an array with\
    \ m-bits which is initialized to 0 and\nk hash functions. The hash function k\
    \ is used to query an element. To ﬁnd the position of elements in the array, put\n\
    them into the k hash functions.\nFor insertion into BF, the ﬁrst element has been\
    \ added using a hash function (Fig. 6). For elements to be inserted,\nhash functions\
    \ are computed and the corresponding bit is set with that index. In the query\
    \ process, an element is\nchecked to see whether it is a member of the set or\
    \ not. For querying, check all bits correspond to indexes. If all the\nbits are\
    \ set high, then the answer is “maybe” and if at least 1 bit is not set, then\
    \ the answer is “deﬁnitely not”.\nProperties of BF:\n– It is impossible to false\
    \ negative, but if the queried locations are set to 1, then a false positive is\
    \ possible (in\nstandard BF).\n– To process an element, the query time is O (k),\
    \ where k is the hash function.\n– The size of the union and intersection of BF\
    \ is the same and to implement hash functions, the operations bitwise\nOR and\
    \ AND are used.\nFig. 6. Insertion in bloom ﬁlter [246].\n6.2. Count min sketch\n\
    Count-min sketch (CMS) was introduced by G.Cormode and S.Muthukrishna in 2003\
    \ [64]. It is a streaming algo-\nrithm for probabilistic sub-linear space [244].\
    \ Its functionality is also hashing-dependent like BF. CMS is different\nfrom\
    \ BF in only that it uses a 2-dimensional array to handle a given data set, while\
    \ BF uses a 1-dimensional array\nfor representing hashed data.\n238\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 7. Count min\
    \ sketch [246].\nThe basic data structure of CMS consists of a 2-D array (d *\
    \ w) where w is used for storing the counts and it\ndepends on the maximum outputs\
    \ given by hash functions, and d is the hash function h(1 . . . d) and it is pairwise\n\
    independent. To update the counts, calculate the hash positions with the d-hash\
    \ functions. The values determined\nby the hash function are used to get the actual\
    \ occurrence of an item in an array. The minimum of the determined\nvalues by\
    \ the hash function is the actual occurrence of an item (Fig. 7). The space used\
    \ by CMS is equal to the count\nof (d * w). With the use of CMS and appropriate\
    \ values of d and w, we get efﬁcient results with very few errors.\nUse more hash\
    \ functions for more accurate results.\nProperties of Count-Min sketch:\n– It\
    \ supports union operations on cells.\n– The query time to process is O (k), where\
    \ k is a hash function.\n– The accuracy improves when an item appears multiple\
    \ times, with a higher frequency, or with heavy hitters.\n– CMS also has various\
    \ applications like compressed sensing, stream processing, frequency tracking,\
    \ etc.\n6.3. Locality sensitive hashing\nIn 1998, Indyk and Motwani introduced\
    \ the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [123]. LSH works on the principle\nof using\
    \ low-dimensional space for high-dimensional data. The hash functions are selected\
    \ very carefully, which\nhas more chances of collusion in the hash bucket. The\
    \ LSH has three phases. These are: the ﬁrst phase is the\npreprocessing phase\
    \ where different measures are used for mapping data, in the second phase, hash\
    \ tables are\ncreated, and in the ﬁnal phase, these hash tables are used for recognizing\
    \ identical items (Fig. 8). The similar items\nare located in the same bucket,\
    \ so the whole data is located in buckets [104].\nFig. 8. Locality-sensitive hashing\
    \ framework [246].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n239\nA LSH family lshF() is deﬁned with probabilities P1 and P2, an approximation\
    \ factor c ⩾ 1, a threshold R ⩾ 0,\nand for a metric space M = (M, d). This function\
    \ lshF() maps the metric space to buckets sϵS with a set of functions\nh: M →\
    \ S [287]. The following conditions must be satisﬁed for p, qϵM and hash function\
    \ h chosen uniformly at\nrandom from F :\n– if d(p, q) ⩽ R, then h(p) = h(q) (i.e.,\
    \ p and q collide) with probability at least P1,\n– if d(p, q) ⩾ cR, then h(p)\
    \ = h(q) with probability at most P2.\nA family is interesting when P1 ⩾ P2. Such\
    \ a family lshF() is called (R, cR, P1, P2)-sensitive.\nProperties of Locality\
    \ Sensitive Hashing:\n– The same items are hashed to the same buckets as different\
    \ items, so LSH hashes the items a number of times.\n– Cosine, similarity, and\
    \ hammering distances are examples of item LSH functions.\n– The functions of\
    \ LSH are not limited to the same standard measures commonly used for data retrieval,\
    \ overlap,\nand dice coefﬁcient [54].\n6.4. Quotient ﬁlter\nMichael Bender et\
    \ al. proposed a quotient ﬁlter (QF) in 2011 [30]. It uses less memory to sample\
    \ an element that\nis a member or not of the set. Basically, it has performed\
    \ four operations add, delete, is a member, is not a member\non the set. QF uses\
    \ the single hash function for ﬁngerprint generation with a size of p (in bits).\
    \ For insertion of\nelement in QF, remainder fr ← (fp(x) mod 2r) and quotient\
    \ fp ← (⌊fp(x)2r⌋) are calculated, where fp is the\nindex of bucket and fr is\
    \ value inserted in fp bucket. QF gives the speciﬁc result to the query that is\
    \ either probably\nyes or deﬁnitely not the element of the set. There is some\
    \ probability after querying that the element is in the set, but\nactually, it\
    \ is not present (Fig. 9). The storage size is decreased with the increase of\
    \ ﬁlter size, so there is a trade-off\nbetween storage and false-positive [82].\n\
    Properties of Quotient Filter:\n– An Approximate Member Query (AMQ) ﬁlter is used\
    \ to speed up the answers in the storage system.\n– Insertion, deletion, and updating\
    \ are allowed in QF, resulting in the large usage of proxy databases.\n– There\
    \ is no need to re-hash the original key for merging and re-sizing of QF.\nPDSs\
    \ are used in many real-time applications like preserving patient data in healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc control, energy-\nsaving, and also for SEM and SAM, and many more. In\
    \ the next section, the PDS and their applications in smart\ncities and big data\
    \ will be explored in a more detailed manner.\nFig. 9. Quotient ﬁlter [89].\n\
    240\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n7. Smart\
    \ city application\nThe smart city needs to majorly focus on activities like healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, street lights. Intelligent technologies\nlike ICT, IoT, sensors etc.\
    \ and analysis of data are the key requirements to improving the citizen’s standard\
    \ of life.\nThe important application of smart city (Fig. 10) are smart healthcare,\
    \ smart trafﬁc management system, smart\nemergency system, smart street light,\
    \ a virtual power plant in smart grid etc.\nPeoples have a number of reasons like\
    \ job opportunities, education, and many more to move from one city to\nanother\
    \ even in an epidemic like Covid-19. In smart cities data is fetched and analyzed\
    \ through IoT devices like\nsensors, actuators etc. [102]. Further, this data\
    \ is used to improve social services, infrastructure, and decision-\nmaking. This\
    \ information plays an essential role in real-time application and services in\
    \ urban areas [202].\nFig. 10. Applications of smart city.\n7.1. Smart healthcare\n\
    Healthcare is an important service to the growth and development of any smart\
    \ city. In recent years, smart health-\ncare has emerged with the growth of ICT.\
    \ It is a process of managing one’s health by a couple of doctors themselves\n\
    or virtually [112]. The traditional medical system needs to be transformed into\
    \ smart healthcare in order to become\nmore efﬁcient and convenient for patients.\
    \ With the emergence in technologies like ICT, IoT, AI etc. the healthcare\nindustry\
    \ have transformed from old-fashioned like interaction between doctor-patient\
    \ to new i.e. remote health mon-\nitoring [113]. IBM (Armonky, NY, USA) came up\
    \ with the idea of smart healthcare in 2009 [269]. There are some\nchallenges\
    \ while transformation into smart healthcare, these are: healthcare systems, equipment\
    \ are under enormous\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in\
    \ smart city\n241\npressure, healthcare data is growing exponentially, inform\
    \ decision-making process with detailed information, ad-\nditional wisdom for\
    \ nurses, challenges in consolidating and resolving legal issues, making the patients\
    \ run from\none department to another for collecting reports, accurate precision\
    \ diagnostics, and right measurements. With the\nincrease of population, these\
    \ challenges are also heightened with demanding health services. The preponderance\
    \ of\nindustrialized nations is facing vital difﬁculties regarding the quality\
    \ and cost of numerous healthcare and wellbeing\nservices [3]. Due to limited\
    \ resources, some cities are deprived of proper healthcare services. In view of\
    \ this, there is\na need for new systems, smart healthcare. In the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ healthcare, devices, the internet, and IoT can connect\npeople with each other,\
    \ as well as manage healthcare activities and resources. Smart healthcare is one\
    \ of the highest\nlevels of knowledge building in the medical ﬁeld [108]. To collect\
    \ information dynamically, liking between insti-\ntutions and healthcare, smart\
    \ healthcare is used to take advantage of advanced technologies, devices like\
    \ wearable,\nmobile internet, and the IoT. Smart healthcare can reduce workload\
    \ at the information desk, and also Help patients\nand their wards.\n7.1.1. Evolution\
    \ of healthcare\nVarious authors and researchers in their studies are categories\
    \ the healthcare system in different generations\n(Fig. 11) (Healthcare 1.0–Healthcare\
    \ 5.0). The different functionality evolution of healthcare system are discussed\n\
    as:\nHealthcare 1.0: – In the year between 1970–1990 the ﬁrst evolution ‘Healthcare\
    \ 1.0’ was introduced. Due to\nlimited digital resources, it was restricted to\
    \ paper documentation. It was mainly focused on improving the efﬁciency\nof health\
    \ services and a reduction in paperwork. The revolution transformed the home remedy\
    \ system and the\nuntrained physicians who provide paternal care into a more sophisticated,\
    \ intelligent, and data-driven system that\ncan be called the “medical complex”.\
    \ In the 1830s the British government start piping the water to homes, when\n\
    the plague was caused due to drinking of polluted water [114,171]. Shortly thereafter,\
    \ the scientiﬁc vaccine theory\nwas established [48]. In the 19th century, a better\
    \ environment for healthy living integrated measures for sanitation,\ninfection\
    \ control, vaccination, and epidemiology surveys have been created.\nHealthcare\
    \ 2.0: – The era of Healthcare 2.0 was between 1991–2005, the main focus was to\
    \ combine with digital\ntechnology. Industrial machinery kept working and changing.\
    \ In the 20th century to increase the productivity of\ncheap products, the automobile\
    \ industry introduces the concept of mass production [120]. The healthcare system\n\
    also follows the same. At the end of the 19th century, few large pharmaceutical\
    \ companies were formed [214]. A few\nyears later various antibiotics were introduced,\
    \ with the advent of mass-industrial manufacturing technology [299].\nAlso at\
    \ that time in medical education importance was given to both clinical training\
    \ and basic science education\n[93]. Hospitals are expanding, being provided by\
    \ more specialists, and doctors are being trained to deal with more\npatients\
    \ with complex conditions. The main focus is on building a part of healthcare\
    \ 2.0 [58]. The second version of\nhealthcare is aimed at improving productivity\
    \ and data sharing. The focus on information sharing is not limited to\nwithin\
    \ the organization but among a group of other healthcare providers. The new version\
    \ is entrenched in response\nto the symptoms, illness, and needs of the individual.\
    \ Information was shared with other organizations with privacy\nand security.\
    \ It was electrical energy-oriented.\nHealthcare 3.0: – The era of healthcare\
    \ 3.0 was between 2006–2015. In this evolution, Electronic Health Records\n(EHRs)\
    \ were introduced. It helps the doctors in accessing patient records through cloud\
    \ gateway. It was a step\ntowards creating a value-based model based on Telecommunication\
    \ and information communication technology\n(TICT), which provides database enhancement\
    \ and additional data efﬁciency to prevent medical-related problems\n[1]. The\
    \ advent of microcontrollers in the 1980s allowed for the production of small\
    \ computers and fast-tracking\nenvironments, as well as large data storage [127,255].\
    \ With advanced computer technology, tomography jumped\nfrom single images to\
    \ redesigned images, and doctors could diagnose ulcers with more information and\
    \ diagnose\ndiseases earlier. Doctors are provide evidence-based medicine after\
    \ diagnosis disease [85]. They have additional\ninformation gathered from e-libraries\
    \ using fast computer technologies. Healthcare 3.0 focused on providing emer-\n\
    gency care and was able to ensure preventive care before the onset of illness\
    \ or symptoms of the disease. Internet\nchanges learning because much medical\
    \ literature is available at e-libraries. In Healthcare 3.0 major concern is to\n\
    use technologies like BDA and IoT-based wearable devices along with advanced E-Medical\
    \ record databases.\nHealthcare 4.0: – From 2016 to 2020, the era of Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 was introduced with patient-centric healthcare\nservices with the advent\
    \ of new technologies and IoT devices [261]. This healthcare evolution is inspired\
    \ by ‘In-\n242\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\nFig. 11. Health generation.\ndustry 4.0’ by establishing personalized\
    \ healthcare platforms and augmented virtualization [271]. It was focused on\n\
    smart devices, involving capabilities of empowering data analytics with ML, DL,\
    \ AI, and IoT for the detection of\ndiseases, [151]. It is the successive approach\
    \ of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Patients get medicine from suppliers by using their\n\
    websites and also get medical assistance through blogs [240]. In this case, patient\
    \ records are shared with healthcare\nprofessionals via an e-Health record over\
    \ the cloud or on the LAN, where many patients and healthcare workers\ncan be\
    \ connected. It helps the physician to access patient records anywhere and also\
    \ communicate with fellow doc-\ntors for better treatment. However, data sharing\
    \ has introduced new challenges such as authentication, security, and\nauthority,\
    \ and so on, [280]. New hands & a new brain, which includes robots, mini-laboratories,\
    \ wearable devices,\nand 3D printers. Every device works faster and more efﬁciently;\
    \ illnesses can be quickly diagnosed using a drop of\nblood; custom-designed surgery\
    \ of body joints can be performed, and bone framework can be prepared using 3D\n\
    printing [280]. Healthcare 4.0 also involves technologies like robotic surgery,\
    \ CC, CPS, information security, and\nmany more.\nHealthcare 5.0: – The era of\
    \ healthcare 5.0 began in 2020 and is going on. This machine includes AI features\n\
    such as a robot nurse, a smart IoT device, and a 6G network speed. [186]. With\
    \ latency (10–100 ms) and reliability\n(99.9999%) [150], and based on ultra-high\
    \ accuracy for remote connections [314], 6G communication addresses\nreliability\
    \ and latency issues in smart cities. Why not 5G? According to [141] 5G will fall\
    \ short of meeting future\ndemands for big data connections such as holographic\
    \ communications (e.g., 3D video conferencing), games, and\ntelesurgery. This\
    \ evolution comes up with device-to-device, machine-to-machine, and human-to-machine\
    \ commu-\nnication. The human-machine cooperation and participation improve the\
    \ diagnosis system and fast results. This\nsystem is more secure than its predecessors.\
    \ A blockchain-based architecture for healthcare applications that auto-\nmatically\
    \ collects data and removes unreliable systems from external companies. The system\
    \ is not dependent on a\nsingle-point failure due to a decentralized network [150].\n\
    The evolution of the healthcare system has also been succinct in Table 4.\nM.\

    \ in smart healthcare are research institutes and hospitals,\npatients, and doctors.\
    \ Smart healthcare has many beneﬁts, like disease prevention and monitoring, diagnosis\
    \ and\ntreatment, hospital management, health decision-making, and medical research.\
    \ ICT, IoT, AI, 5G internet, big data,\nand modern biotechnology are the foundations\
    \ of the intelligent healthcare room, according to [108]. Doctors use\nLaboratory\
    \ Information Management system, Electronic medical record etc. for managing health\
    \ data [207].\n7.1.2. Challenges in smart healthcare\nTrusted Communication: –\
    \ Many medical devices experience network failure, which is unacceptable when\
    \ real-\ntime data access is required. It is challenging to maintain connections\
    \ on mobile devices such as wearable devices\nwhile moving anywhere a patient\
    \ walks, crossing boundaries, and covering areas. In mobile devices, switching\n\
    the network to the most powerful available signal also affects data generation.\
    \ The different amounts of data are\ngenerated while switching to the network,\
    \ which is dependent on the roaming relationship between the SIM provider\nand\
    \ the location of the feed. As there are many subcategories for mobile connectivity,\
    \ we should also adjust the\nnetwork type and location to the value, speed, audio,\
    \ and video required by our device.\nCyber security: – Cyber security is one of\
    \ the challenges when we talk about smart healthcare. As it requires\ninternet\
    \ access and IoT devices, the data may be stolen or attackers may attack data\
    \ or modify the data. So the ﬁrst\npriority of the healthcare system is to ensure\
    \ the privacy of patients and their data. There are some private IoT-based\nnetworks\
    \ (e.g. APNs, VPNs, and IPsec protocol) that are available, which create private\
    \ areas only accessible by\nauthorized users or devices.\nScalable Platforms:\
    \ – The smooth functioning of a smart healthcare system, a scalable platform is\
    \ required. For\nthe effectiveness of a smart healthcare system to be enhanced,\
    \ it must be integrated and supported seamlessly with\npatients and their big\
    \ data. So, the authorized professionals, physicians, and patients use the devices\
    \ and system\neasily for monitoring remotely.\nCost: – Meet, the requirements\
    \ of the healthcare system are also cost-effective. The healthcare system may\
    \ take\nless time for decision-making and information gathering. So, it must require\
    \ new tools and techniques for efﬁcient\nstorage and retrieval.\n244\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nData Availability:\
    \ – The availability of data is facing some issues like resource management and\
    \ device identiﬁ-\ncation. Systems don’t need any redundancy; they only need consistent\
    \ data. So it requires identifying the resources\nand storage management with\
    \ new technologies in healthcare systems.\nData Security: – While accessing the\
    \ data, it is mandatory that only the authorized user can access the concerned\n\
    data. It still needs to be improved.\nUnique Identiﬁcation: – In the healthcare\
    \ system, it is required to uniquely identify patients by their doctor and\nvice\
    \ versa. This is required for providing or getting the best and correct treatment.\n\
    Privacy Issue: – This is one of the major issues while we are talking about big\
    \ data and IoT devices in a smart\ncity. Many kinds of research provide many tools\
    \ and techniques. But still, it needs to be improved.\nDevice Communication: –\
    \ Machine to machine, a device to machine, and human to machine communication\
    \ is\nchallenging. Patients need a quick response to their records, medical tests,\
    \ and medical reports. A 5G/6G network\nis required for the smooth transformation\
    \ of data communication. It is cost-effective, and also required some tools\n\
    and algorithms for privacy and data exchanges.\nData Integrity: – Ensuring the\
    \ integrity of healthcare data is also challenging because it is important for\
    \ providers\nto use it in making decisions about patient care. It is also required\
    \ for information exchange between doctors and\npatients.\n7.1.3. Application\
    \ of PDS in smart healthcare\nDue to the rapid growth in the population and an\
    \ epidemic, hospitals are overburdened and overcrowded. Patients\nare struggling\
    \ to ﬁnd the doctor’s ofﬁce and pre-body check-up center. Patients and their guardians\
    \ also face the\nissue of understanding medical terms, and they need someone’s\
    \ help to get the proper information. For that, a\nproper healthcare system is\
    \ required with the use of new technologies like sensors, IoT, ICT, etc. On one\
    \ hand, the\nIoT has beneﬁted patients, physicians, hospitals, and health insurance\
    \ companies. On the other hand, challenges\nhave increased. Because sensors and\
    \ IoT have produced massive amounts of data, To handle this data, the following\n\
    is the application of PDS which may be used in smart healthcare systems:\nData\
    \ Processing: – The data generated by devices is homogeneous or heterogeneous,\
    \ semi-structured or unstruc-\ntured, which will result in the trafﬁc load on\
    \ switches. The storage capacity of switches is limited, so the perfor-\nmance\
    \ of routing may be compromised. A scheme ‘BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom Filter-based\
    \ Secure rule-space\nmanagement’ is proposed for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\
    \ [245]. The scheme uses two self-dependent hash\nfunctions for security checks\
    \ and also manages the network resources to handle the trafﬁc in data. Smart healthcare\n\
    systems provide system-assistance analysis for dedicated medical care to patients.\
    \ The security of this data is in dan-\nger. The data security features are improved\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access to information in healthcare systems.\nBF is\
    \ also useful in data transmission elimination [300].\nData Sharing: – The Garbled\
    \ Bloom ﬁlter is used to support authentic search results and secure data sharing\
    \ for\nmultiple users [260] in the Veriﬁable Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (VMKSE).\
    \ This scheme supports single-\nkeyword search. The author also compares his programme\
    \ with a modern solution to evaluate its effectiveness. This\nscheme helps in\
    \ doctor-patient data sharing. The multi-keyword search veriﬁcation mechanism\
    \ is introduced based\non pseudo-random and it is IoT-cloud-enabled for healthcare\
    \ data systems [283]. The mechanism also takes care\nof authentication and advanced\
    \ encryption with advanced privacy of data. BF is used in a secure two-dimensional\n\
    calculation protocol, to compare a unit of characters and record [277].\nData\
    \ Security and Privacy-Preserving System: – The use of IoT in smart cities plays\
    \ a big role in smart healthcare.\nA huge amount of data is exchanged between\
    \ machines, humans, and devices. This big data can be encrypted and\nthen stored\
    \ on a cloud so that only authenticated users can access it. There are also privacy\
    \ issues. A scheme for\nefﬁciently sharing data is proposed to address this issue.\
    \ The author uses attribute-based encryption with attribute BF\nto control access.\
    \ While transforming data or sharing sensitive information, a lot of privacy concerns\
    \ may arise. Xu\net al. propose a scheme using BF, which is privacy-preserving\
    \ for patient health information for sharing information\n[293]. The author uses\
    \ an encrypted search method that allows numerical search for encrypted data.\
    \ The BF and\nmessage veriﬁcation code are used to ﬁlter patient data and check\
    \ the accuracy of search results. Liu et al. design\ncooperative privacy preservation\
    \ for wearable devices that ensure authenticity and consideration for controlling\
    \ data\naccess in the context of space and time information [162]. In space-aware,\
    \ they use MinHash-based authentication,\nand in time-aware, attribute-based encryption\
    \ is applied. They adopted BF to determine the existence of sensitive\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n245\nFig. 12. Status\
    \ ledger’s block size with and without using BF. [11].\ndata in storage without\
    \ exposing secret information, and for secure data interaction, positive and negative\
    \ ﬁlters\nare used. Seham A., et al. [11] introduce a system for infection control\
    \ with the use of Blockchain for privacy-\npreserving. In this system, one leader\
    \ elected by authority updates the two BFs, one for infected users and the other\n\
    for close contact users. Two BF are used for infected and suspected users, which\
    \ reduces the storage space. The\nblock size of the COVID-19 status ledger with\
    \ and without using BF is also compared (Fig. 12).\nFast Response and Congestion\
    \ control: – The number of connected devices in the network (like trafﬁc lights,\n\
    vehicles, laptops, smartphones, etc.) is increasing exponentially. For resource\
    \ sharing and effective communication,\nall devices with different conﬁgurations\
    \ have to be integrated into the same network. Due to the rapid growth of\nthese\
    \ devices, the trafﬁc in the network also increases, causing difﬁculty in predicting\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. G. S. Aujla\net al. propose an approach to handle these issues.\
    \ “Blockchain-as-a-Service for Software Deﬁned Network (SDN)\nin Smart City Applications”\
    \ is mentioned [23]. Multiple etiquette ﬁrmware can be integrated into a single\
    \ network\nusing the SDN controller [22].\nIn “Software-deﬁned Content Dissemination\
    \ Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-19 like Sce-\nnarios”, [111]\
    \ introduces a new way to ﬁnd the right online distribution channel described\
    \ in the healthcare ecosys-\ntem software. Internet of Healthcare Vehicle (IoHV)\
    \ is an emerging concept that depends on smart transport, includ-\ning ambulances\
    \ and additional healthcare vehicles (testing Covid-19 immediately). To connect\
    \ to the internet, espe-\ncially when possible, for testing COVID-19 immediately\
    \ and contact tracing, this IoHV is helpful and is deployed\nacross a smart city\
    \ setup. All healthcare vehicles are connected to each other through different\
    \ types of links: vehicle-\nto-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), infrastructure-to-infrastructure\
    \ (I2I), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),\nand cellular links [147]. To overcome\
    \ congestion and improve response, the global information of devices is stored\n\
    in the deletable BF in the proposed framework. While implementing in the real\
    \ world, there are many ambient\nintelligence challenges. Some of them related\
    \ to healthcare are listed below:\nAdopting Advance healthcare technology: Almost\
    \ all medical devices are connected to IoT devices. The man-\nagement systems\
    \ like appointments, patient administration, laboratory information, etc. are\
    \ now handled by ML and\nAI. So it is necessary to develop a connected network\
    \ of healthcare leaders, clinics, manufacturers, and software\ndevelopment companies.\
    \ which enhances the new business models and also helps adopt the new technologies.\n\
    Integration between healthcare services: The massive amount of data is generated\
    \ while using medical devices\nand AI-integrated applications. Many top healthcare\
    \ companies lack data management systems and new architec-\nture.\nRising Healthcare\
    \ cost: The rising costs of healthcare are always a serious issue, which includes\
    \ the manufac-\nturing cost of healthcare vehicles and disease detection and testing\
    \ processes. Due to this, many patients skip lab\ntests and do regular follow-ups.\n\
    246\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nPayment\
    \ Veriﬁcation: – In this digital world and epidemic, the maximum number of transactions\
    \ is done digitally\nand payment veriﬁcation is required. In this lieu, Pratim\
    \ et al. a lightweight payment veriﬁcation based on the\nblockchain using BF is\
    \ proposed as IoT-Assisted e-Healthcare [223]. If BLWN simply asks for the full\
    \ location of\na small set of blocks/topics, there may be a chance for privacy\
    \ leaks as the full area can peer into BLWNs’ assets. It\nmay allow the full site\
    \ to call for Denial of Services (DoS) and the insigniﬁcant liaison service for\
    \ funds available\nfrom BLWN. Therefore, it may be completely overwhelmed by the\
    \ great difﬁculty in its ability to make a computer\nwhile crashing its system.\n\
    Real Time Analysis/Support: – Wearable devices are mainly used in real-time Electronic\
    \ Health Records (EHR)\ncollection. Obviously, encryption is required for searching\
    \ targeted EHRs by medical institutions. In this reference,\nYuan et al. [259]\
    \ propose a scheme in which medical institutions can search and access EHRs in\
    \ the cloud. They\nimprove the search accuracy and privacy of users in EHRs. To\
    \ improve search efﬁciency, the Cuckoo ﬁlter is used\nand gives a facility to\
    \ data owners for modiﬁcation (insert and delete) in their EHRs in the cloud.\n\
    7.2. Smart transportation\nFor moving from one place to another, horses and camels\
    \ were used for a long time in society. The world has\nentered the next phase\
    \ of the movement, namely smart transport, with the advent of new technologies\
    \ and smart\ntransportation systems [180]. “Moving smarter is not our future –\
    \ it is already our present”, says Lisa Jerram, senior\nanalyst at Pike Research,\
    \ simply to make sure the easy journey is acceptable as cities become more populous\
    \ and\nface potential budget crises by building new infrastructure, as is the\
    \ case in Europe, North America and Japan, [38].\nAccording to [274], the population\
    \ of the world’s urban areas increased from 29% to 50% between 1950 and 2008,\n\
    and it is expected to increase to 70% by 2050.\n7.2.1. Application of smart transportation\n\
    To meet the increased demand of citizens, the easy option is to provide then better\
    \ transport services. With this\nthe growth in supply of automobile is increases,\
    \ due to that the trafﬁc congestion is also increases. The attraction to\nthe\
    \ development of smart transport system took a lot of attention to addressing\
    \ trafﬁc congestion and rapid urban\ngrowth [71]. It is identiﬁed that the implementation\
    \ of smart technologies is the key factor in gaining intelligence\nand stability\
    \ [107,233]. Also several researchers shown that how this sustainability achieving\
    \ the environmental and\neconomic efﬁciency [71,115]. Therefore, sustainable transportation\
    \ is very important in today’s society. There are\nvarious application under smart\
    \ transportation are discussed as follows:\nSmart Street Light: – Smart city should\
    \ also needs to upgrade Road street light to smart street light. It helps in\n\
    reducing the energy consumption by dimming the lights. This saved energy are then\
    \ used for other services like\npollution monitoring, update about whether, GPS\
    \ etc. and also help in signing available parking in nearby area.\nBut smart street\
    \ lights are depending on its feature and requirements, and involve a combination\
    \ of cameras and\nsensors. Sensors and Cameras are collecting the data can either\
    \ process locally if street light have computing device\nor propagate through\
    \ network. These devices can detect the movement which enable dynamic lighting\
    \ and dimming\n[102]. Chen et al. present a system which used for controlling\
    \ the street lights using TX2 device and also help in\nupdating the parking status\
    \ to users (Fig. 13).\nIntelligent Transportation System (ITS): – Today, the state-of-the-art\
    \ transport system is heavily inﬂuenced by\nMachine Learning (ML) and Dynamic\
    \ Range Learning (DRL) based strategies to detect autonomous vehicles,\ndispatch\
    \ passengers in a safe manner and ensure the safety of vehicles. ITS uses the\
    \ various advance technologies\nlike senros, IoT devices, ICT and many more [302].\
    \ The huge amount of data is being generated by these IoT devices\nand sensors\
    \ which contributes to the concept of intelligent cities and the future of ITS\
    \ [312]. The techniques like\nAI, ML, and especially DRL play an important role\
    \ as an integral part of sustainable in precisely monitoring and\nmeasuring real-time\
    \ data trafﬁc ﬂow in an urban area [301,305].\nThe various applications of ITS\
    \ are discussed by [302] like: The intelligent highway in Britain, which reduces\n\
    the trafﬁc and accident rate, The CRITER system in Lyon, France, offers transportation\
    \ workers a schematic plan\nlike a map and also predicts the bottleneck points.\
    \ In Japan, electronic toll collections (ETC) measure the physical\ncharacteristics\
    \ of vehicles and check and deduct charges automatically if they are in ETC. It\
    \ is useful to avoid\nillegal entry into the city. Include IoT in ITS to build\
    \ a system where communication between road facilities,\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n247\nFig. 13. Smart street light\
    \ scenario [59].\nvehicles, and management equipment is done without barriers.\
    \ The Global Positioning System (GPS) is replaced by\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) in the IoT to become the Smart Transportation System (STS). The author\n\
    also discusses the services for passengers on public transport, like service range,\
    \ charging, security control, and\nadministration.\nAvailability of Parking: –\
    \ With the rapid growth of vehicles in the city, it is a trick for drivers to\
    \ ﬁnd available\nparking. This dilemma is seen as an opportunity to increase the\
    \ efﬁciency of parking facilities, thereby decreasing\nroad accidents and taking\
    \ less time to ﬁnd free space in a smart city. The troubles related to parking\
    \ and trafﬁc\ncongestion could be solved if drivers were aware in advance of the\
    \ availability of parking in the area and surround-\ning areas [39]. A smart and\
    \ automated system that can detect empty parking spaces can reduce search time,\
    \ by\nﬁnding out where parking is available and bypassing lawful information to\
    \ drivers. Maria et al. proposed an image\nprocessing system that takes video\
    \ as input from a drone and feeds it into a frame extraction block [176]. These\n\
    frames are then preprocessed to reduce complexity. These systems may be improved\
    \ if the availability of data and\nthe techniques to manage this data were improved\
    \ or changed with new technologies.\nStreet lights can also play an important\
    \ role in detecting empty parking spaces in open environments. Traditional\nparking\
    \ (sensor-based) occupancy systems are more expensive, as demonstrated by [59].\
    \ They use Jetson TX2, an\nNVIDIA’s Computer Uniﬁed Device Architecture embedded\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence supercomputer, which has high\npower efﬁciency. This\
    \ system works both day and night with an on-off street parking smart control\
    \ system. Parking\nspace is detected by marker-based image processing using the\
    \ onboard camera of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) [67].\nTrafﬁc Control: –\
    \ The authorities are facing chaos trying to manage the trafﬁc with an increase\
    \ of vehicles on the\nroads. Because of a lack of human resources, authorities\
    \ are moving toward smart trafﬁc control to manage the city’s\ntrafﬁc. To reduce\
    \ congestion in the context of VANETs, robots can play a key role. The aim of\
    \ smart robots is to give\ninformation to avoid ideal roads and manage trafﬁc\
    \ congestion in urban areas. To detect illegal trafﬁc behaviour or\ntrafﬁc violations,\
    \ the system uses street cameras [66]. But it is not possible to install street\
    \ cameras everywhere in\nthe city. Modern cars with video storage cameras have\
    \ been introduced to control trafﬁc violations in the city. These\ncars capture\
    \ the videos in the city and report any violations that happen to the authorities.\
    \ Rathore et al. propose a\nsystem to detect the front car and road line using\
    \ the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Hough transform\nfor self-driving.\
    \ A violation detection algorithm is designed for the fog device smart to identify\
    \ driving violations,\nU-turns, and driving central dividers [222]. Steve Mazur\
    \ has also presented a trafﬁc control system (Fig. 14) in\n[180].\nAutomated Toll\
    \ Collection: – To decrease the fuel consumption used in automobiles, the use\
    \ of the cream road\nis required. The government and road contractors are working\
    \ on making the new highways and ﬂyovers in the\ncities, and contractors are installing\
    \ their toll on those roads to complete their expenses. Motorists and commuters\n\
    are spending their valuable time at the toll plazas paying the amount of tax.\
    \ Due to this, the parking problem, trafﬁc\n248\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nFig. 14. Smart trafﬁc control [180].\ncongestion,\
    \ and pollution are increasing near the toll plaza. Commuters are also facing\
    \ delays, which increases\nthe travel time for their journey [34]. Automatic toll\
    \ collection is on the rise nowadays, both by governments and\nresearchers. The\
    \ main concern with this automated toll collection system, the RIFD tag, is that\
    \ it is installed on\nthe windshield of vehicles. To collect the required amount,\
    \ the vehicles pass through the sensor system before the\ntollgate [134]. Regular\
    \ user may also have facility of prepaid smart cards. So that the trafﬁc at tollgates\
    \ can be\navoided. M.A. Berlin et al. propose an alert message based toll collection\
    \ system using smart Road Side Unit (RSU)\n[34]. This system also helps in stopping\
    \ the payment violation by send the alert message if the any vehicle violate\n\
    the toll payment. This system is totally man free and barricade free, which also\
    \ help in rush hours to handle the\ntrafﬁc [34]. As the use RIFD tags not only\
    \ the time is saved but also eliminate the corruption in toll plazas [8].\nSmart\
    \ Mobility: – Smart mobility is also the main concern in smart transportation\
    \ as it is consistent with the\ndevelopment of a sustainable world [101]. In particular,\
    \ either ICT is the initiative to smart mobility or a complete\nfailure [31].\
    \ Smart Mobility is providing solutions to users by using new technologies like\
    \ IoT, ICT etc. Some\ntourists use apps to plan their journey, but they get limited\
    \ information and priorities for travel recommendations\n[205]. Smart mobility\
    \ is also helpful for citizens to roam and move freely in the vicinity of a smart\
    \ city. Smart\nmobility also helps in improving the trafﬁc control system by giving\
    \ access to other routes in emergencies or trafﬁc\njams. Intelligent navigators\
    \ facilitate providing routes and navigating to essential services like ambulances\
    \ and\ngovernment. can be facilitated by intelligent navigation. In the coming\
    \ year, smart mobility transform into mobility\nas a service paradigm, like car-sharing\
    \ [205].\n7.2.2. Beneﬁts of smart transportation\nFigure 15 explores a picture\
    \ of smart transportation in the city. Smart transportation has many beneﬁts,\
    \ some of\nthem are discussed as.\nSmart Transportation is safer: – In smart transport\
    \ the integration of ML with IoT, 5G help in reducing trafﬁc\nand road accidents.\
    \ In these IoT devices, cameras and other safety devices help in monitoring the\
    \ trafﬁc situation\nand intimate the same to users for improving road safety.\n\
    Smart Transportation is better managed: – Smart transportation facilitates the\
    \ public administration by allowing\nto monitor the performance of road safety\
    \ and trafﬁc. It also gives information on critical sources of problems and\n\
    tracks where maintenance is required.\nSmart Transport is very effective: – With\
    \ better management of resources in smart transport gives more efﬁcient\nresults.\
    \ If we are having quality data, then easily identify the areas where improvement\
    \ is required. It also provides\nbetter-quality ﬁlling rates.\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n249\nFig. 15. Smart transportation\
    \ [180].\nSmart Transportation is more cost-effective: – Smart transportation\
    \ also helps in reducing the cost by providing\nthe best shortest routes, giving\
    \ information regarding facilities available with approx distance and price, and\
    \ many\nmore. Commuters also take beneﬁt if they get affordable public transport\
    \ as compared to hiring a private CAB.\nSmart Parking Management: – In smart parking\
    \ the driver or car owner can’t face the problem of ﬁnding the avail-\nable space\
    \ for parking. The system provides the information by collecting real-time data\
    \ from connected devices\nand sensors.\nSmart Trafﬁc Management: – With the smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system users can get information about conges-\ntion on road.\
    \ So that they can plan their journey accordingly.\nSmart Transportation provides\
    \ instant information: – Smart transport system can also provide information in-\n\
    stantly regarding the issue in the city, trafﬁc congestion, and problem areas\
    \ using trafﬁc management centers. They\nalso ensure public safety and provide\
    \ information on affordable insurance plans.\nIntegrated Ticket Systems: – It\
    \ will also provide diverse services to citizens by providing the intelligent\
    \ ticket\nsystem in some local services.\n7.2.3. Challenges in smart transportation\n\
    A large number of vehicles in major cities around the world has posed major transportation\
    \ and stability chal-\nlenges, like air pollution, trafﬁc congestion and energy\
    \ problems [284]. Following are some challenges to smart\ntransportation.\nSecurity:\
    \ – Vulnerable to cyberattacks is one of the biggest fears among smart city dwellers.\
    \ Cyber attacks are\nmore common to criminals as the world’s connectivity to the\
    \ internet increases. The data ﬂow during the smart\ntransport management system\
    \ are may be hacked or used to thief the vehicle if there is no secure communication.\n\
    The security of data used in toll collection systems is also in danger. During\
    \ ﬁnding the available parking space user\nshare their location, this also may\
    \ create problems in user security.\nData Privacy: – User data cannot be retrieved\
    \ without their knowledge. The user’s personal identity must not be\nidentiﬁed\
    \ or traced. Data privacy in smart transport is the main concern. Under the new\
    \ law, data processing must\nhave legitimate.\nSupply Chain: – Due to epidemics\
    \ like Covid-19 the global supply chain is affected. While transportation may\n\
    face various problems during this epidemic. Due to that many businesses are affected.\
    \ When the drivers may ill and\nmove from one region to another it may cause public\
    \ health.\nEnvironmental Problem: – With the rapid growth in the automobile industry\
    \ the trafﬁc on roads also increases.\nThis may affect the air quality and water\
    \ pollution in nearby residential areas. The environmental problems caused\nby\
    \ the IoT devices are currently serious and need to be addressed urgently [180].\n\
    Health Concern: – Health concern is also one of the challenges to smart transportation.\
    \ If the transport system is\nnot connected to hospitals, then it may cause major\
    \ problems or may loss their lives in road accidents. The system\nneeds to improve\
    \ its service on road, and proper intimation of the concerns (hospitals and police\
    \ stations).\n250\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n7.2.4. Applications of PDS in smart transport\nThe trafﬁc on roads in\
    \ both rural and urban areas is increasing day by day. It needs to smartly manage\
    \ the trafﬁc\nand distribute the trafﬁc load by making the transport system to\
    \ be smart. It includes smart parking, smart street\nlights, violation check on\
    \ the roads, trafﬁc control system etc.\nData Dissemination: – It means the statistical\
    \ data is transmitted or distributed to end-users. In Pursuing a\nPub/Sub Internet(PURSUIT)\
    \ project use BF to store the path information in source routing. The main scenario\n\
    of this project is general data dissemination [16].\nPrivacy Preserving: – The\
    \ IoT devices and sensors are used to collect and exchange a huge amount of data,\
    \ to\nimprove the transport system. As Cloud Computing progressed, more sensitive\
    \ information (like vehicle registration\nnumber, chassis number, insurance detail,etc.)\
    \ was released to the cloud. The most accurate way to protect data\nprivacy is\
    \ to encrypt data before extracting it [253]. Enabling keyword searches directly\
    \ over encrypted data is a\ndesirable way to make the best use of encrypted data.\
    \ Wang et al. has proposed a brand new idea for acquiring\nmultiple keywords (compound\
    \ keywords) in random search [282]. Unlike most existing keyword search programs,\n\
    the program eliminates the requirement of a predeﬁned keyword dictionary.\n7.3.\
    \ Smart environment\nMany developed cities suffer from poor air quality as population\
    \ and industry growth rapidly. Increasing accep-\ntance of smart transport data\
    \ in smart cities around the world has provided unprecedented opportunities to\
    \ improve\nair quality management in transportation [284]. Government agencies\
    \ and residents are increasingly concerned with\nair grade, which contributes\
    \ to a wide range of human environments and human development. The most common\n\
    methods of predicting air pollution especially utilize low-level simulations.\
    \ These standards produce disappointing\neffects that have led to aspects inﬂuencing\
    \ the measurement of air corrosion based on the overall structure of the\nbuilding.\
    \ Estimating air quality using atmospheric scattering standards is time-consuming.\
    \ Modeling incorporated\ntesting is a new expansion to measure air pollution and\
    \ conservatory gases in an intelligent environment. Normally,\nmaximum houses\
    \ in a smart city are used solar and wind turbines for green energy [140]. Liu\
    \ et al. suggested a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in planning smart environment\
    \ in smart cities, which predict air quality\nthat assists Staked Auto-Encoder\
    \ (SAE) [165]. LSTM is used to evaluate air quality forecasts in smart cities.\
    \ The\ninternal components that occur due to air pollution are removed by optimizing\
    \ SAE. The total error rate is 0.46 and\nthe class accuracy of 91.22% is shown\
    \ by this model, it still needs to be improved.\nJovanovska et al. proposed and\
    \ air quality system based on IoT and Cloud computing [130]. They visualize and\n\
    control air pollution using mobile applications. Sulfur oxide (SO2), Ozone(O3),\
    \ Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and most\nimportant PM10 and PM2.5 are common indicators\
    \ of contamination that cause health risks like heart and lung\ndiseases. So,\
    \ improving the quality of air is a good effort by everyone for the weather and\
    \ health of every citizen.\n7.3.1. Challenges in smart environment\nThe major\
    \ challenges for the environment are water pollution, air quality, and radiation.\
    \ To achieve sustainable\ngrowth by maintaining a healthy society proper vigilance\
    \ is needed in the world. With the development of IoT and\nsmart sensors, Smart\
    \ Environmental Monitoring (SEM) is the system for environmental monitoring, in\
    \ the latest\nyears [273]. Figure 16 shows various issues of environment like\
    \ temperature, radiation, dust, humidity, ultraviolet\nsignal etc. For establishing\
    \ the system Silvia et al. used the WSN which provides an interface between smart\
    \ sensors\nand IoT Devices [273].\nAir quality Monitoring: – Due to the rapid\
    \ increase in trafﬁc and industries, air pollution is one of the primary\nconcerns\
    \ of our epoch. The earth is becoming increasingly polluted due to the emissions\
    \ of harmful gases like CO,\nNO2, SO2, and CO2. These toxic gases can’t be predicted\
    \ because there are dissolve in the air. So, the air quality\nneeds to be checked,\
    \ and for that, an IoT-based tool is required. An IoT device can collect and analyze\
    \ the data\nto predict the air quality either good or bad. Sensors using Raspberry\
    \ Pi/ Arduino and IoT devices can monitor\nthe local air quality [175]. Dhingra\
    \ et al. develop an application i.e. “IoT-Mobair”, which is mobile-based use to\n\
    monitor and detect the air pollution of the concerned area [76]. This mobile-based\
    \ application has various features\nlike air quality, daily forecasts, health-related\
    \ tips, and risks, air quality map generations etc. But, when dealing with\nbig\
    \ data generated from sensors, then this application has faced some computational\
    \ complexity problems. For that\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\n251\nFig. 16. Challenges in smart environment.\nDhingra et al.\
    \ have suggested using fog computing instead of cloud computing. The IoT is a\
    \ global system of “smart\ndevices” which can detect and communicate with the\
    \ environment and interact with users and other applications.\nQian et al. found\
    \ that due to low sensitivity and low accuracy the exiting monitoring system does\
    \ not work well and\nit also requires laboratory analysis [218]. The data is highly\
    \ correlated in the case of air pollution monitoring, where\nthese systems are\
    \ leads to a lot of obsolete information. To the data delivery cost and to alleviate\
    \ data neglect Qian\net al. the system i.e. ‘Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution\
    \ Monitoring (CIAM)’. In CIAM, the content method\nis used to compile and integrate\
    \ air pollution data.\nWater quality Monitoring: – Monitoring of water quality\
    \ is important in determining water safety and related pub-\nlic health [256].\
    \ Water quality parameters are determined by the same factors as physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological.\nBacterial contamination, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, dispersion,\
    \ free chlorine, and pH are the typical parameters\nof water quality [215,219].\
    \ The various research papers have been studied in terms of intelligent water\
    \ pollution\ncontrol systems using ML, IoT, and smart sensors. The pollution of\
    \ water in the lake can be predicted using an\nML-based neural network for machine-reading\
    \ which analyzes the sensed image [160]. The water is classiﬁed as\npure or polluted,\
    \ and we studied the separation of water pollution with the use of ML methods\
    \ and IoT devices [61].\nThe prediction of water quality parameters using AI and\
    \ neural networks and the amounts of sulfate or chloride\npresent in water were\
    \ studied [220]. In order to separate the pollutants in water using SVM, the analysis\
    \ of big data\nand problems faced during the separation of water pollution were\
    \ discussed [46]. AI-SVM is a classiﬁcation system\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ and technology used for testing and its separation from non-drinking water [41,128].\n\
    Video-based monitoring of water quality and pollution was investigated, which\
    \ used IoT video surveillance and\nML tools to separate dirty and clean water\
    \ [208]. To predict the future and quality of water before use, another\nfunction\
    \ which is a feature-based model, also helped in analyzing the water suggested\
    \ [311]. Different ML models\nwere used to test the concentration of chlorophyll-A\
    \ in pond water and were also recommended for real-time water\nmanagement system\
    \ [163].\nAgriculture Monitoring System: – The growth of industrial and robust\
    \ agricultural production methods has ac-\ncelerated to ensure the quality and\
    \ quantity of the growing demand for food [249]. In “smart or green agriculture”,\n\
    Smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) plays an important role as agriculture is the\
    \ relevant growth factor for any\nnation [210]. It also helps in product development\
    \ and sustainable growth to handle major challenges in the agricul-\nture sector\
    \ [196,239]. Ullo et al. refer to the smart agriculture scenarios (Fig. 17), where\
    \ the SEM system is a smart\nagricultural monitoring system in real. In the agriculture\
    \ sector, various factors are very important for achieving\nsustainable production,\
    \ like water level, water pollution level, moisture analysis, soil health etc.\
    \ These features are\nincluded in the smart agricultural monitoring system, which\
    \ is monitored and controlled using IoT devices, smart\nsensors for agriculture\
    \ data capturing, and WSN to transmit data into the cloud [273].\n252\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 17. Smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system using IoT devices and sensors.\nIn the new agricultural era,\
    \ there is a growing market for IoT that offers a few creative solutions. The\
    \ various\nstudies and research on Smart Agricultural Monitoring systems (SAM)\
    \ are discussed, which include fertilizer con-\ntrol, crop monitoring measures,\
    \ pest control, etc. Kumar et al. propose a system for plant growth monitoring\
    \ i.e.\n‘gCrop’ using IoT, ML and WSN [148]. They use a 3rd-degree regression\
    \ model and provide a prediction with a\nhigh computational complexity of 98%\
    \ accuracy. Shinde and Pathak et al. performed a crop quality test to monitor\n\
    the quality of paddy rice using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data [242]. In the\
    \ rice quality test, SVMs were used\nwith limited sample size and back distribution\
    \ features. The land and its size play an important role in checking the\ngrowth\
    \ level of different crop species that are either satisfactory or not. To measure\
    \ the leaf index Hosseini et al.\npropose a system with a Gaussian process model\
    \ [91] and using SVM as ML method and reported 89% with a lim-\nited sample size\
    \ [119]. To determine the level of fertilizer, pesticides, and water quantity\
    \ used for plant irrigation, an\nexpert system using AI was developed [78] using\
    \ the Naive Bayes [17] method and studying ML using sensory data\ntaken from agriculture.\
    \ UAV is used [77] to investigated the crop quality tests [230] and soil health\
    \ for phenological\ndata of soybean crop [49]. Smart farming [42], pest monitoring\
    \ [164], and crop monitoring [311] are important in\nthe various uses of SEM systems.\
    \ Weather and the environment also affect the health and growth of plants. Ullu\
    \ et\nal. propose a technique that checks the condition of the soil, moisture,\
    \ air, and water quality, temperature etc. in the\ncontext of SEM using IoT devices,\
    \ AI, and smart sensors [273]. The data analysis is performed while smart agricul-\n\
    ture provides estimation, assisting protection, decision making, and storage management\
    \ [249]. The data is moving\nwhile performing the techniques to achieve smart\
    \ agriculture, and various challenges are faced by both farmers and\nresearchers.\
    \ Some of them are addressed below.\n7.3.2. Challenges in smart agriculture\n\
    To increase food production, farmers will face many challenges. The production\
    \ will increase 70% by the year\n2050 [122]. Various challenges in agriculture\
    \ have been discussed (Fig. 18) as.\nIrrigation management: – One of the objectives\
    \ of an irrigation system is to calculate the water requirement for\ncrops based\
    \ on collected data and water ﬂow without interference from humans. Irrigation\
    \ systems use dispersed\nsensors to monitor the different soils, water bodies,\
    \ vegetation, and microscopic elements. Climate is one of the\nmost important\
    \ variables in estimating agricultural water requirements. A farmer can adjust\
    \ his irrigation system in\na variety of ways according to soil and weather conditions\
    \ [216]. The entire farm can track, manage, and forecast\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n253\nFig. 18. Challenges in smart\
    \ agriculture.\nweather from almost anywhere. IoT will help in developing the\
    \ new infrastructure for irrigation in a very exciting\nway. Smart IoT-operated\
    \ irrigation systems use embedded sensors in the ﬁeld to monitor soil structures,\
    \ climate,\nand agricultural irrigation conditions.\nSoil management: – Soil monitoring\
    \ is one of the most challenging agricultural activities for both businesses and\n\
    farmers. Various soil parameters like pH, humidity, etc. are involved in soil\
    \ management and IoT sensors can be\nused to calculate these parameters. Soil\
    \ management helps in ﬁnding the right kind of plants and helps to identify\n\
    fertilizer requirements in the soil. Crop production can be affected by soil testing\
    \ due to a number of environmental\nconcerns. The process and patterns of farming\
    \ can easily be understood, if these types of problems are well deﬁned.\nCrop\
    \ production may improve and fertilization practices can be promoted based on\
    \ ﬁndings of a soil survey study for\nfarmers [37]. The moisture and humidity\
    \ sensors can monitor the moisture in the soil, and IoT technology identiﬁes\n\
    the contaminated soil and shields the ﬁeld from over-fertilization and damage\
    \ to crops. Agricultural productivity\nand quality may increase, pollution can\
    \ be avoided, and input costs may be reduced due to soil management.\nClimate\
    \ management: – Climate has a profound effect on crop production. With the use\
    \ of an IoT-enabled weather\nforecast system, farmers can determine the best time\
    \ to plant, irrigate, and harvest. With the help of distant sensors\nattached\
    \ to the ﬁeld, farmers can learn about natural conditions like humidity, soil\
    \ moisture, and air temperature.\nOn the basis of historical results, to maximize\
    \ the yield, farmers should properly prepare and market the harvest and\nirrigation\
    \ season. By editing and updating the collected data, farmers should take immediate\
    \ steps to ensure a safe\ncrop yield. Many of the right things are put together\
    \ to maintain and establish a good plant environment while living\nunder stringent\
    \ limits like airﬂow, temperature, CO2, and O2 levels. With the use of IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, where for\nadvanced decisions data can be exchanged between intelligent\
    \ sensors and devices, this can be achieved [288].\nAccurate farming: – The traditional\
    \ method of farming to increase yields and preserve crops was based on phys-\n\
    ical examination. If any issue was found, then it was resolved by trial and error\
    \ after being involved in a serious\n254\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nincident on the farm. Farmers will face various\
    \ different types of challenges while farming, like less water, ﬂoods,\nlack of\
    \ suitable planting space, and cost control. Productivity can be improved with\
    \ the use of IoT in agriculture.\nWith the use of gathered information, farmers\
    \ can organize their farming activities, including what seeds they should\nsow,\
    \ what crop yields should be expected, the time to harvest, and how much fertilizer\
    \ to use. Example: The natural\nsoil diversity of a ﬁeld is an accurate agricultural\
    \ practice. The plants can be planted thicker and the irrigation can\nbe used\
    \ sparingly if the soil in a certain area holds more water. Alternatively, if\
    \ the site is used for grazing, we can\ntake more cattle than an equivalent area\
    \ with a lower level of the soil.\nNutritional management: – As the human body\
    \ needs proper nutrition to grow, the same plants may require\naccurate nutrition.\
    \ Nutrients help to produce the best yield when given at the right prices and\
    \ at the right times.\nToo much and too limited nutrients for plants will affect\
    \ the environment. For example, too much phosphorus,\nammonia, or nitrogen may\
    \ reduce water levels. To grow in one place, the selection of the best crop cycle\
    \ allows\nfor balancing soil fertility. While reducing environmental degradation\
    \ and economic costs, achieving sustainable\nagriculture, nutrition, and technology\
    \ are essential [6].\nGarbage Management: – The wastage of water, soil, and seeds\
    \ is common during farming. This needs to be\ncontrolled, but in an intelligent\
    \ manner. For garbage collection, create smart trash cans using IoT sensors, which\n\
    can smartly sense and collect the garbage. The collected data related to network\
    \ disposal is used to read, store and\ntransmit with the help of these smart trash\
    \ cans. Garbage management can be done with the help of some smart and\nsystematic\
    \ algorithms [10].\nLivestock monitoring: – Livestock plays an important role\
    \ in agriculture, so they need intention, proper care,\ntimely feeding, etc. It\
    \ is a growing worldwide issue to provide enough food to the world’s people with\
    \ the grow-\ning agricultural production. As a result, the importance of livestock\
    \ management on farms is crucial to survival.\nTo improve the quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products, new technology like IoT advances is important. It\n\
    also improves the quality of livestock by allowing farmers to make decisions based\
    \ on data-driven. To monitor the\nlivestock’s welfare remotely and identify their\
    \ habitats, cloud-based technologies are used with power communica-\ntion sensors\
    \ [50]. The health condition of livestock like respiratory rate, digestion, blood\
    \ pressure, heart rate, and\nother day and night vital signs can be checked by\
    \ farmers using connected sensors. But the data ﬂow between these\nsensors and\
    \ smart devices is interrupted or tempered, so it needs to be secure and well\
    \ managed to get efﬁcient\nresults.\nFarm Management System (FMS): – Smart farming\
    \ promotes productivity while minimizing environmental in-\nﬂuences, but this\
    \ smart agriculture technique is merely possible with the help of FMS [97]. With\
    \ the help of WSN\nand GSM in FMS, farmers can track the entire farm and capture\
    \ the data with a small controller [199]. With the\nuse of sensors and smart devices\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the identiﬁer is used to provide appropriate awareness of soil,\
    \ fertility,\nand weather, to the farmers. The data collection and storage, monitoring,\
    \ and analysis of the farm operations can\nbe automated using an IoT-based farm\
    \ management system. It can also help in managing agricultural budgets and\nbusiness\
    \ operations. The irrigation scheme helps in protecting the farms from animals\
    \ and pests. But also automatic\nirrigation systems can increase the water consumption\
    \ [105,137].\nTracing and tracking: – Satyanarayana et al. [236] develop the structures\
    \ to remotely track soil structure and\nits status in accordance with the needs\
    \ of plant culture. The different agricultural areas and locations are tracked\n\
    using GPS devices and wireless network connections. The real-time data processing\
    \ is tracked and approved by\nconnecting WSN and ZigBee to other devices like\
    \ the Central Monitoring Station (CMoS), GSM, and GPRS. The\nGPS also enables\
    \ the farmer to take actions based on notiﬁcations sent to the farm manager through\
    \ SMS or MMS.\nIt is often used in agriculture to detect precise location and\
    \ control capacity, despite it having high operating and\nmaintenance costs.\n\
    Plant management: – The growth of a farmer’s crop is most important in farming.\
    \ Farmers use good seeds,\norganic fertilizers, proper watering etc. for best\
    \ results. For farmers to protect themselves from them, they use\nchemical medicines\
    \ and fertilizers, which may later affect the human body. So, it required an intelligent\
    \ system that\nprotects the crop from insects and does not affect the human body.\
    \ This can be done by plant management, which\ninvolves monitoring and recording\
    \ the welfare of the crop. The plant and its diseases can be detected using RFID\n\
    chips and IoT sensors. The farmers can process the data remotely and take necessary\
    \ steps like keeping the insects\nfrom plants. The production of rice for a speciﬁc\
    \ country with a Chinese monitoring station using SVM [152].\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n255\nFarmers can also prevent\
    \ the risk and plan their farming practices by demonstrating an effective calculation\
    \ strategy\nfor coffee fruit [68].\nWater Management: – The major challenge in\
    \ greenhouses is to determine how much water is required i.e. wa-\nter management\
    \ [281]. Intelligent sensors are installed to control the waste of water and operate\
    \ them by using a\nvariety of IoT techniques. Automated drip irrigation is used\
    \ to control the soil moisture in irrigation and storage of\nwater in greenhouses.\
    \ The farmers are checking the water levels in a water tank with their Android\
    \ phones. With\nthe use of IoT devices and sensors, the whole water management\
    \ is done like the motor is automatically started and\nstopped by checking the\
    \ level water level. Due to over-irrigation in conventional irrigation systems,\
    \ up to 50% of\nwater is lost [241]. A smart Irrigation system(SIS) provides a\
    \ system to overcome this issue. This system helps the\nfarmers to avoid water\
    \ wastage and improve the quality of their crops through timely irrigation. SIS\
    \ also transmits\nthe knowledge of the ﬁeld to the farmer using temperature and\
    \ soil sensors. Farmers may also plan and modify their\nirrigation according to\
    \ the local weather information. For Water Distribution System (WDS) an architecture\
    \ WD-\nSchain’, which is blockchain-based in MATLAB, is proposed [172]. For security,\
    \ various consensus mechanisms\nare used, and results show a trade-off is required\
    \ between data validation and system complexity (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19. Water distribution\
    \ systems chain architecture [172].\nBlockchain with Agricultural IoT: – To improve\
    \ agricultural intelligence, data-driven technologies can be allowed\na secure\
    \ data storage system. The data collection is often very costly where the inventory,\
    \ agricultural contracts, and\ninformation about farm conditions from a reliable\
    \ source can be provided. Developing the trust between providers\nand consumers\
    \ and establishing a reliable food supply chain, the blockchain technology helps\
    \ in tracking the food\nfor timely payments to stakeholders [191].\nTo monitor\
    \ the farm and collect the data remotely, smart sensors and cameras were used.\
    \ To adopt the current\ncondition of agricultural land, farmers can use IoT devices\
    \ as they use smartphones anywhere in the world. New\ntechnologies like IoT have\
    \ the potential to increase global productivity and reduce the cost of crop production.\
    \ To\nface the challenges on the farm, the agricultural sector can be restructured\
    \ by providing different IoT-based tools\nand techniques. A massive amount of\
    \ unstructured data has also been generated and the PDS has the potential to\n\
    solve issues like handling big data with real-time response.\n7.3.3. Applications\
    \ of PDS in smart environment\nEnergy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness: – To improve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness. Yousef et al.\npropose a scheme in underwater\
    \ WSN for water pollution monitoring [297]. BF is used in the preprocessing step\
    \ to\nreduce the number of transmissions and eliminate redundancy to save precious\
    \ energy. This type of project is mainly\nused in deep water like the sea and\
    \ ocean. Mahmoud et al. use BF for customer’s identity and privacy-preserving\n\
    of transferred data in WDS [173]. They also suggest the optimal parameters of\
    \ BF i.e. for 200 customers with 2000\n256\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nnumbers of bits and 7 hash functions. In WDSchain,\
    \ BF is used to match the authentication of network nodes in\nproof-of-authentication(PoAuth).\n\
    High-performance communication networks: – IoT devices contain many sensors, routers,\
    \ actuators, and base sta-\ntions that need communications between them and send\
    \ millions of data that need to deliver with high-performance\ncommunication networks.\
    \ IoT devices that may have limited power resources or limited integration areas\
    \ have an\nimportant research challenge. To increase the performance of IoT communication\
    \ networks alassery et al. propose\nan efﬁcient mechanism based on BF [12]. BF\
    \ is used to store the routing information after aggregating packets to\nsend\
    \ receiving packets to upstream routers.\nQuery Optimization: – Under the big\
    \ data domain has been developed an air monitoring system, which poses\nmajor\
    \ challenges to data analysis. Peng et al. proposed a scheme for query optimization\
    \ of air quality big data using\nBF index [211]. The efﬁciency of data collected\
    \ in the air quality monitoring system is improved. They create a\nHive data repository\
    \ in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) ﬁle format and the Row Group Index (RGI).\
    \ For basic\ndata types 64-bits ThomasWang’s hash function is used and Murmur3\
    \ 64-bit hash algorithm for string and binary\ntype by BF in ORC.\nPrivacy-preserving\
    \ Data Aggregation and Analysis: – A data aggregation algorithm is proposed using\
    \ BF for\nprivacy data analysis in mobile crowdsensing system [212].\n7.4. Smart\
    \ industry\nIn world development, industrial growth plays an important role. When\
    \ the word comes to mind ‘Industry’, then\nmost people probably think that it\
    \ is a noisy and big place. The growth of the industry has increased by 18th century.\n\
    Due to the lack of technologies owned by the industry, it faces various challenges\
    \ like production, distribution,\nsupply chain management etc [279]. By the year\
    \ 2050, technology will have progressed to the level of autonomy\n[80]. The industries\
    \ are categorized into three economic sectors: primary, secondary, and tertiary\
    \ [24].\nPrimary industry: – This sector is concerned with the general people,\
    \ means to sell and supply the products.\nThis sector is place dependent because\
    \ the raw material is extracted from the earth. The operation of this sector for\n\
    economic growth revolves around minerals, earth water, vegetation etc. The example\
    \ of these sectors are farming,\nmining, and ﬁshing and they extract the raw material\
    \ like coal, foods, corn etc. There are two types of industries\nunder the primary\
    \ sector: The genetic industry and the Extractive Industry.\nSecondary industry:\
    \ – After the collection of raw material by primary industries the secondary industries\
    \ used this\nmaterial for construction and manufacturing the products. These industries\
    \ are used to make products like steel for\nautomobiles, textiles for cloths,\
    \ wood for furniture, etc. For manufacturing these products heavy machinery is\
    \ used\nin the production plant and also required manpower for packaging and distribution.\
    \ The example of these sectors\nare consumer goods, craft & fashion, construction,\
    \ manufacturing etc. There are two types of industries under this\nsector: Heavy\
    \ industry and Light industry.\nTertiary industry: – The product is manufactured\
    \ from raw material in the above sector and is now ready for use\nby consumers.\
    \ Tertiary industries generally they are not making any products but only provide\
    \ services to consumers\nand local industries & markets. The main feature of this\
    \ sector is discussion, experiences, access, etc. The ﬁnancial\nand education\
    \ sectors are two groups of tertiary sectors one for making money (ﬁnancial) and\
    \ the other (education)\nis non-proﬁtable. Examples of these sectors are banking,\
    \ educators, administrative, medical, ﬁnancial, insurance,\ntransportation retail,\
    \ wholesale, real estate, hotels, police, defense services, media and information\
    \ technology and\nso on. There are three types of industries under the tertiary\
    \ sector: Telecommunication, Professional, and Franchises.\nThese industries help\
    \ in growing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate of the country.\n7.4.1. Industry\
    \ evolution\nThe farming and handicraft economizing processes changed to be monopolized\
    \ by industry and manufacturing\nmachines in the Industry Revolution. These changes\
    \ transformed society fundamentally in terms of living and\nworking styles. In\
    \ the 18th century Britain began this process and spread all over the world. The\
    \ production of\nmanufactured goods and the use of natural resources have increased\
    \ after these technological changes [294]. The\nindustrial evolution has been\
    \ categorized in Fig. 20 and succinct as given in Table 5.\nIndustry 1.0: – In\
    \ the years 1760–1850, the ﬁrst revolution was introduced with the mechanical\
    \ theme [225].\nIt used steam, coal, and water mechanization for the manufacturing\
    \ process. Production through machines had\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n257\nFig. 20. Industry 1.0–5.0.\nincreased, so\
    \ the rate of production had increased by eight times for conventional methods\
    \ [270]. It also increased the\nstandard of life by creating various goods in\
    \ massive amounts. Human productivity was increased by the use of steam\npower\
    \ [83]. Machines, stream power, and water power played an important role in the\
    \ ﬁrst industrial revolution’s\ngrowth. If we talk about the developing sectors\
    \ in this revolution, textile manufacture, chemicals, paper machines,\ncement,\
    \ iron industry, gaslighting, transportation, agriculture, railways, and many\
    \ more are existing there [291].\nIndustry 2.0: – In the year 1880–1973 this revolution\
    \ was introduced with industrialization [131]. With the adop-\ntion of new technologies\
    \ like telephone, electric power, sewage, internal combustion engine, etc. this\
    \ revolution\nmanufactured mass production. The sectors that are developed in\
    \ Industry 2.0 through technology are steel, paper\nmaking, petroleum, automobile,\
    \ fertilizer, Iron, chemical, rubber, electriﬁcation, machine tools, telecommunica-\n\
    tions, and many more. Mainly this revolution occurs in America, Britain, and Germany\
    \ [193].\nIndustry 3.0: – In the year 1989–2013, the industrial revolution ‘Industry\
    \ 3.0’ was started. In this industry the\nproduction was automatically done without\
    \ human interference so, the production sector grew in the engineering\nﬁeld.\
    \ The automation was fully computerized, which increases the efﬁciency and reliability\
    \ of the industrial system.\nBut automation also affects employment. With the\
    \ growth in technology, many industries start using robots and\nreducing manpower.\
    \ Industry robots are designed with programmable integrated circuits and give\
    \ accurate and efﬁ-\ncient results. Robots can do painting, welding, testing,\
    \ labeling, etc. It is estimated by the International Federation of\nRobotics\
    \ there are 1.64 million robots used in industry worldwide [51].\nIndustry 4.0:\
    \ – In 2011 the industrial revolution ‘Industry 4.0’ was ﬁrst proposed by the\
    \ German government. In\nthis revolutionary trend, computerization is used in\
    \ manufacturing [149]. The cyber-physical system was developed\nand all systems\
    \ are communicated using IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning [272,278].\
    \ These IoT\ndevices help ‘Industry 4.0’ for providing services and also in manufacturing.\
    \ This industry transform information\nthrough Industrial IoT (IIoT) [190]. The\
    \ key components of this revolution include IoT, Cloud Computing, Big\nData, Cyber\
    \ Security, Cognitive computing, etc. [286]. German was initiative the Industry\
    \ 4.0 as “smart manufac-\nturing for the future” [155]. This revolution has emerged\
    \ with the aim of achieving mass production and increasing\nproductivity using\
    \ innovative technologies i.e. similar to previous revolutions [25,213].\nIndustry\
    \ 5.0: – This revolution in the industry is declared by the European Commission,\
    \ after discussions with\nvarious funding agencies, and organizations in Research\
    \ and Innovation workshops in January 2021. To provide\nservices to humanity this\
    \ industry focuses on and highlights innovation and research. It uses the blockchain\
    \ concept\nto integrate the generated data from different industries. To achieve\
    \ social goals like employment, the standard of\nliving and development this industry\
    \ plays a key role [43].\nIndustry 5.0 is not entirely new it is the upgrade version\
    \ of industry 4.0. With growing technology, artiﬁcial\nintelligence uses in industries\
    \ also improved. The capability of humans, interaction with computers, and robot\n\
    workers gives efﬁcient and effective results [279]. This industry proposed the\
    \ 3D techniques (like 3D printing or\nadditive manufacturing is used for creating\
    \ 3D objects) with the use of IoT [80].\n258\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    Data Security: – As the rapid growth of technologies in the smart industry a huge\
    \ amount of data is moving\nbetween IoT devices. The security of data is also\
    \ a major challenge in the smart industry. The data protected and\nsafe from unauthorized\
    \ access is also a challenge to the industry.\nData Management: – This is also\
    \ the major challenge when a huge amount of data is following over the network\n\
    and between devices. Data need to be well structured and in a good manner to access\
    \ and get efﬁcient results.\nStorage: – Storage of industrial big data is very\
    \ tough both for users and developers. Data generated from various\nresources\
    \ IoT devices are scattered and not ﬁltered. The storage of that type of data\
    \ is not easy.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n259\n7.4.3. Applications of PDS in smart industry\nRemove ambiguity: –\
    \ The data generated in the smart industry is ambiguous. Wang et al. proposed\
    \ a technique\n“Fingerprint Summary” for cluster data de-duplication which is\
    \ time and space-efﬁcient. They use BF in this tech-\nnique in each node, for\
    \ reducing data duplication. For efﬁcient detect and remove duplicate data [57]\
    \ proposed a\nnew data structure i.e. ‘Improved Streaming Quotient Filter (ISQF)’.\n\
    Validation: – BF is used for data validation. BF is used to reduce memory consumption\
    \ and bypass the unneces-\nsary comparisons in the validation process [109]. This\
    \ process is space-efﬁcient.\n7.5. Smart energy\nSmart energy plays an important\
    \ role in solving the various issues of past, present, and future like healthcare,\n\
    agriculture, the environment, sustainable development, and many more [79]. The\
    \ energy-saving systems have al-\nready been developed in various cities and buildings,\
    \ in the last few years. A lot of studies for efﬁcient energy have\nalready been\
    \ done [142]. Instead of using the word “smart grid”, a broader approach is to\
    \ use the terms “Smart\nEnergy” or “Smart Energy Systems” (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21.\
    \ Smart energy.\nThe energy system is also facing various challenges like stability,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, cost control, operational\nefﬁciency, environmental issue,\
    \ service management etc. [90]. By achieving smart energy management big data\
    \ an-\nalytics provide new opportunities to deal with these challenges [18]. The\
    \ innovative storage solution and distributed\nresources for efﬁcient power transmission,\
    \ clean power generation, dynamic power distribution, and rational elec-\ntricity\
    \ consumption have been proposed [188]. Smart grid achieves the energy transmission\
    \ and data collection at\nthe same time by integrating energy and information\
    \ ﬂow [187]. The primary focus of smart grids is on electricity\n260\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nsectors like cooling,\
    \ heating, electricity, transportation, industry, building etc. It also provides\
    \ affordable, achievable\nsolutions for sustainable and renewable energy [168].\
    \ In the last few years, due to the huge growth in industry,\nenergy consumption\
    \ has also increased. It also increases data generation. With the emergence of\
    \ ICT, the energy\nsystems are being digitized [309]. The massive amount of generated\
    \ data from energy-related sources needs to be\nwell structured for efﬁcient and\
    \ fast results [177]. Due to the rapid increase in the population, energy consumption\n\
    has also increased. Renewable energy like wind and solar power is also in its\
    \ developing stage and has brought\nchallenges like energy security and the adoption\
    \ of new technologies [262]. Industries are using more than one-third\nof the\
    \ total electrical energy used by the country, for production, construction, and\
    \ mining. So in order to gather\nvaluable information, they have collected a big\
    \ database. This data is being used to raise the standard of living [231].\nThe\
    \ variety of big data, like the status of the device, consumption of electricity,\
    \ and interaction with the user, is\nbeing collected by the smart grid. To process\
    \ this big dataset, various techniques like analysis, optimization [310],\nclustering\
    \ [232], classiﬁcation [307] and forecasting [88] have been applied. So, the accurate\
    \ prediction of electricity\ndemand and consumption, the operation and generation\
    \ of power in real-time can be optimized, and also effectively\ndevelop the pricing\
    \ mechanism. With the use of big data analytics, the smart grid gives more control\
    \ over the use\nof energy to the customer, supplies economic and reliable energy,\
    \ responds quickly to the demand for electricity,\nand also quickly restores and\
    \ detect the failure and many more facilities [124]. This also helps in taking\
    \ decision\nfor customers, producers, operators, and regulators in the smart grid\
    \ [308]. Energy management uses emerging\ntechnologies like ICT (Fig. 22).\nFig.\
    \ 22. Energy management (energy cloud) [197].\nThe pattern of consumption and\
    \ production of energy is changed due to involving of big data. The energy big\n\
    data has involved 3Es and 4Vs energy, empathy, exchange, value, velocity, volume,\
    \ and variety [308].\n7.5.1. Challenges in smart energy\nThere are various opportunities\
    \ and some challenges brought by energy big data. Some challenges are listed here:\n\
    Effectively collection of energy big data: It is very difﬁcult to collect data\
    \ from energy resources for giving\nefﬁcient and effective decision-making and\
    \ quick responses.\nManagement storage of energy big data: This is also one of\
    \ the major challenges for energy big data to provide\nbetter services to customers.\n\
    M. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n261\nMining\
    \ and analyzing of energy big data: The mining of data for cleaning big raw data\
    \ and analysis is a very\ntough job.\nLack of effective and efﬁcient decision\
    \ making: The decision making is one of the impotent key points of a smart\nenergy\
    \ system, it also needs to be improved by joining efﬁcient techniques like PDS.\n\
    Privacy preserving of energy big data: This is one of the major concerns to giving\
    \ security to energy big data.\nWith the use of IoT devices, a huge amount of\
    \ data is ﬂowing without any security measures.\nTo achieve the above-discussed\
    \ challenges efﬁcient and effective tools and techniques like PDS are required.\n\
    7.5.2. Applications of PDS in smart energy\nPrivacy Preserving: Zhang et al. proposed\
    \ a mechanism Cuckoo-RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and\nLossy Networks)\
    \ to defend from Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) network from blackhole\
    \ attack. Cuckoo-\nRPL is also useful to defend from other attacks like version\
    \ number and gray hole attack [303].\nNetwork trafﬁc management: Chaudhary et\
    \ al. designed a “SDN-enabled multi-attribute-based secure communi-\ncation protocol”\
    \ in the Smart Grid environment for their entity communication. They use a cuckoo\
    \ ﬁlter for fast\nforwarding of data [56].\nLoad Balancing: Debnath et al. present\
    \ a scheme i.e. ‘BloomFlash for ﬂash storage device. This scheme also\nachieved\
    \ the load balancing of elements across the BF component. This scheme proves that\
    \ the BF is useful in load\nbalancing techniques [72].\n7.6. Smart governance\n\
    Smart governance means accessing the government services free and in a better\
    \ manner using various free data\nprojects. With the emergence of ICT in smart\
    \ cities, smart governance can improve the services provided by the\ncities [159].\
    \ Developing the businesses of the individual smart economies can play an important\
    \ role in providing a\ncollaborative platform. A smart economy also emphasizes\
    \ economic competitiveness in the development of the city,\non the competitive\
    \ edge economic and human activity [143].\nSmart Economy: – Smart economy that\
    \ is for success with high social welfare, sustainability, and resource-\nefﬁcient,\
    \ is based on innovative technologies. It also helps in improving the quality\
    \ of life by adopting new inno-\nvative ideas and building new entrepreneurs,\
    \ and start-ups, which increase competitiveness and productivity [263].\nThis\
    \ whole system is based on technologies and ICT for urban planning and economic\
    \ advancement. For social\nbeneﬁts smart economy is also expected to deliver more\
    \ products and services without compromising energy and\npollution [144].\nSmart\
    \ Government: – Smart government is the timely demand of the 21st century and\
    \ smart governance is its\nkey tool. The key pillar of smart governance is to\
    \ use technology. The public administration is required to update\nitself with\
    \ the emergence of technology. No one can oppose adopting smart governance as\
    \ it is the new face of\npublic administration, governance, and political process\
    \ [237]. The e-government adopts the electronic process in\nthe administration\
    \ system and political system and it is the starting face of smart government.\
    \ There is a trend of\nusing modern technologies in public administration for\
    \ smart governance systems by developed countries and their\nresearchers, academicians,\
    \ politicians, and practitioners [182]. The role of smart government is presented\
    \ in Fig. 23.\nAn intelligent network is created in the sector of governance and\
    \ it is directly related to the internet where people\ncan connect with each other\
    \ for communication even in remote areas. Better communication with real-time\
    \ objects in\nthe intelligent network is done through the distributed network\
    \ [234]. As it is not an automated decision-maker so\nit is not artiﬁcial intelligence.\
    \ It only connects to the people for gathering information and making the decision\
    \ and\nuse it in the future. Due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and digital\
    \ applications, a lot of data is produced. The\nsource of big data is social networking\
    \ websites, mobile phones, daily household appliances, various private and\ngovernment\
    \ websites, and smart devices being used by various researchers.\nBig data plays\
    \ an important role in transforming traditional governance into smart governance.\
    \ Researchers,\nacademicians, and policymakers argued about the transformation\
    \ of traditional public administration to modern and\nsmart administration in\
    \ point of big data. For developing the public administration and government sector\
    \ a large\namount of data is required. It also helps in developing new models\
    \ [238]. Big data also help in effective decisions,\nfast and efﬁcient results,\
    \ and expert users, increasing their accountability and transparency. It also\
    \ helps in solving\n262\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\nFig. 23. Role of smart government.\ncomplex tools for reforming\
    \ the government but some researchers have doubts about future technologies. Many\n\
    countries have adopted big data for smart governance, but some public administrations\
    \ are still not ready to adopt\nbig data as full ﬂedge. It happens because, for\
    \ implementation of these technologies, data collection, production and\nprocessing\
    \ require a big investment. And those public administrations who implement impulsive\
    \ faces threats and\nchallenges like reducing the productivity, efﬁciency, and\
    \ capacity in governing system [248].\nThe solutions to these challenges, problems,\
    \ and threats are big data-driven technologies [75] like PDS. The\ngovernment\
    \ agencies taking future and proper decisions, and identify criminals and corruption,\
    \ with the help of\nproper use of big data. The government is generating and managing\
    \ the knowledge with their major responsibility\n[5].\n7.6.1. Challenges in smart\
    \ governance\nAdopting Big data technologies: Some developing countries are already\
    \ adopting big data technologies in smart\ngovernance. But many are facing problems,\
    \ due to their bad handling and management, lack of knowledge, cost-\neffectiveness,\
    \ and data available being either unstructured or semi-structured.\nData Privacy:\
    \ Much conﬁdential data is uploaded by people and used by public administration.\
    \ So, it needs to be\nprotected from malicious users.\nApplications of PDS in\
    \ Smart Governance: As such, we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart\
    \ gover-\nnance. So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. PDS\
    \ is an efﬁcient data structure for managing\ndata storage and is also compatible\
    \ with new technologies. PDS also helps in protecting data.\n7.7. Smart society\n\
    A smart society means to promote the satisfaction of citizens satisfaction and\
    \ the well-being of metropolitan\nresidents. In this reference, a smart society\
    \ includes a large number of smart: people, infrastructure, education,\nliving;\
    \ water and waste management systems and many more [243]. Society 4.0 faces the\
    \ challenge with information\nsharing and related knowledge, while in society\
    \ 5.0 the increased process complexity and assured sustainability due\nto the\
    \ massive amount of data combined with environment and human physical investigation.\
    \ The major challenge\nwith big data is to take real-time decisions [94].\nM.\
    \ Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n263\nFig.\
    \ 24. Society evolution 1.0–5.0 [95].\n7.7.1. Society evolution\nSociety is coexistence\
    \ with nature, and according to ethnographers, society 1.0 had begun with the\
    \ birth of humans\nknown as the hunting society (Society 1.0). In 13,000 BC the\
    \ settlements had been ﬁrmly established and irrigation\ntechniques had been developed\
    \ known as an agrarian society (Society 2.0). At the end of the 18th century,\
    \ the steam\nlocomotives were invented and mass production had started, it was\
    \ the industrial society (Society 3.0). In the latter\n20th century computers\
    \ were invented and the distribution of information was started, this is the information\
    \ society\n(Society 4.0). At the beginning of the 21st century, “super-smart society”\
    \ has introduced and known as (Society\n5.0). The social evolution has categorized\
    \ and concise as given below (Fig. 24).\nSociety 1.0: – This society’s evolution\
    \ begins with the birth of humans. This society is also called a hunting\nsociety.\
    \ People used simple tools for full ﬁll their daily needs including food. People\
    \ have changed their habits on\nthe availability of resources [138].\nSociety\
    \ 2.0: – In 13000 BC this social evolution was introduced with new developing\
    \ agriculture techniques\nand it is also known as an agrarian society. With the\
    \ advancement of technology and demographical changes, this\nrevolution is transformed\
    \ from the earlier society revolution [29]. In Mesopotamia, the hand-made pottery\
    \ and the\ncultivation of barley and wheat were found at early stages [14].\n\
    Society 3.0: – This societal revolution begin at the end of the 18th century,\
    \ when modern physics, gravity law, and\nthe invention of the steam engine had\
    \ discovered and also called Industrial Society. This society changes the face\n\
    of the earth forever. As already discussed industry revolutions are one of the\
    \ growing ﬁelds in terms of economy\nas well as academia [254]. This also builds\
    \ the relationship through transportation, environment, society, and many\nmore.\n\
    Society 4.0: – This is the Information Society, initially planned in 1972 in Japan.\
    \ This society aims for a new\nera after the post-industrial revolution in the\
    \ year 1985 [179]. Here the production of information promotes human\ncreativity,\
    \ and the transition, and development of society.\nSociety 5.0: – At the beginning\
    \ of the 21st century this revolution was introduced with a vision of a “super-\n\
    smart society”. This society provides solutions to many social problems through\
    \ technologies because it is human-\ncentered. This also improves the quality\
    \ of life, the use of robots also increases, and also environment-friendly\n[14].\n\
    7.7.2. Applications of smart society\nThe smart society is directly concerned\
    \ with citizens and daily lives. The main applications are discussed below\n(Fig.\
    \ 25).\nSmart Home/Houses: – To increase the quality of life and independence,\
    \ the homes are equipped with technolo-\ngies called “smart home” [73]. Smart\
    \ homes include home appliances like television, air conditioners, smart fans\n\
    264\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 25. Applications of smart society.\nand lights, etc. are connected with IoT\
    \ devices to effectively deliver the services. To achieve the goals of providing\n\
    the services efﬁciently, the Smart Home Reasoning System (SHRS) plays an impotent\
    \ role to make decisions [181].\nReducing environmental emissions, energy management,\
    \ and increasing home automation is the primary objective\nof smart home [229].\n\
    Smart Living/People: – Smart living gives new opportunities to citizens to increase\
    \ their standard of living. It\nneeds to follow an inclusive strategic approach\
    \ across all age groups and demographics [203]. It provides solutions\nthat are\
    \ controllable, productive, sustainable, economical, and efﬁcient. Smart living\
    \ is changing people’s lives\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Yan et al.\
    \ propose an architecture that controls home lighting using a\nBluetooth-based\
    \ Android smartphone [295]. Peoples are safer in their homes, if they have to\
    \ face any problem, they\ncall independently also the objective of smart living\
    \ [153].\nSmart Buildings: – Smart building is deﬁned as it is efﬁcient energy\
    \ management, a convenient and comfort-\nable environment with reasonable investment,\
    \ and is designed to provide service and management [169]. A smart\nbuilding also\
    \ includes automated processes like security, heating, lighting, air conditioning,\
    \ ventilation, and many\nmore [221]. To develop the smart building the things\
    \ required are future-proof devices, IT skilled team, and robust\nwireless infrastructure.\
    \ The basic components of smart building for security includes CCTV system, access\
    \ control,\nintrusion system, gate automation etc [184].\nSmart Education: – With\
    \ the advancement of technologies everything may be interconnected, instrumented\
    \ with\nAI [313]. Smart education is also an emerging area nowadays and also needs\
    \ attention from both researchers and\nacademics [135]. Various smart education\
    \ projects [121] have already been performed in recent years, in which the\nﬁrst\
    \ smart education project is carried out by Malaysia in 1997 [52]. Smart education\
    \ [62] faces certain issues like\naccessing student knowledge, comparing behavioral\
    \ patterns of a student, data integration, data mining, detecting\neffective and\
    \ emotional state of the student, and many more [60].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh /\
    \ Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n265\n7.7.3. Challenges in smart\
    \ society\nEfﬁciency: – All resource uses in a smart society have their limits\
    \ like battery power, memory storage, and\nbandwidth required for communication.\
    \ They directly affect efﬁciency, which also increases with the rapid growth\n\
    in data.\nHeterogeneous data: – The data generated in the super-smart city is\
    \ heterogeneous, which leads to challenges in\nprocessing, analyzing, and mining\
    \ data. Getting adequate information from big data in heterogeneous information\n\
    networks is also a big challenge.\nPrivacy preserving: – On increasing of smart\
    \ technologies in a smart society the issue of security, and privacy is\nthe main\
    \ concern. Challenges in all aspects like access control, authentication, policy\
    \ enforcement etc.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Society: As such we have not\
    \ found any existing use of PDS in the smart society.\nSo here the scope of use\
    \ of PDS is highly recommendable. In lieu of the above challenges, there are many\
    \ studies\nand researches available that PDS and its variants give an efﬁcient\
    \ result with memory management, and storage,\nalso to handle heterogeneous data.\
    \ PDSs also provide security to the data.\n7.8. Smart sustainability\nThe idea\
    \ of sustainability was introduced in 1987. Sustainability deﬁne that the to meet\
    \ today’s needs without\nsacriﬁcing the future ability to fulﬁll their requirements\
    \ like social, economic, and environmental [19]. Emerging\ntechnologies and digital\
    \ governance are also part of smart sustainability [178]. It also requires a balance\
    \ between\nthe technology, policy, and management by local government [235]. The\
    \ main pillars of sustainability are environ-\nmental, economic, and social. Smart\
    \ sustainability has the potential for solving the problems of urban areas [296].\n\
    In sustainable development, governance plays an impotent role [84]. In sustainable\
    \ development’s planning and\nimplementation, the stakeholder and policymakers\
    \ lack practical research knowledge. To achieve this new technolo-\ngies like\
    \ ICT, IoT and cloud are being used in a smart city. Modern technology and creativity\
    \ are being focused\non the framework of smart cities as compared to sustainability\
    \ cities depending on the data-driven identiﬁcation\nof the dynamic changes in\
    \ the broadcast relationship [258]. To achieve the required level of sustainability\
    \ the data\ncame from various sources in smart cities are need to be well structured.\
    \ The IoT technologies measures in smart\nsustainable cities are air and water\
    \ quality, green urban areas, tourism and culture, energy, digital transformation,\
    \ le-\ngality, and security (Fig. 26). Sustainable economic advancement includes\
    \ all the factors that are included in a smart\ncity. These factors are green\
    \ building, smart education, social responsibility, water management, sustainable\
    \ energy,\nsmart health, smart governance, natural resource management, sustainable\
    \ transportation, and waste management\n(Fig. 27).\nFig. 26. Smart sustainable.\n\
    7.8.1. Challenges in smart sustainability\nCollection of data: – For developing\
    \ sustainability a huge amount of big data is required at a place.\nStorage management:\
    \ – The management of this data in a proper manner is a big challenge.\nPrivacy\
    \ and Security: – Security and privacy of this data is also the main concern.\n\
    266\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 27. Smart sustainable city.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Sustainability: As\
    \ such we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart city\nsustainability.\
    \ So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. The PDS and its variant\
    \ are very much\neffective in data collection with less time and efﬁcient storage\
    \ management. It also provides security to the data\nmovement in smart sustainability.\n\
    8. Comprehensive analysis of PDS in smart city\nIn the smart city, the data, and\
    \ information are the entrance to instantly bounded competitive beneﬁts. Today,\n\
    billions of people are accessing and releasing huge amounts of data via the internet,\
    \ and social networks. This\ngrowth in data required efﬁcient storage and handling\
    \ of data is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96].\nTo improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of data access and testing, the storage of monthly or annual data\
    \ production from various\ncompanies, hospitals, institutions, and forests is\
    \ at data centers [118]. The variants of data structures in PDSs are\nimportant\
    \ for big data and live streaming systems. A BF is a probabilistic randomized\
    \ data structure given by Burton\nBloom, for efﬁciently storing information of\
    \ static sets to support membership queries [36]. Presently BF is widely\nused\
    \ in many networking and security algorithms [201]. After studying the existing\
    \ uses of PDS in smart cities, it is\nfound that many researchers have used BF\
    \ in healthcare for efﬁcient storage of patient data, privacy-preserving etc.\n\
    in various applications Some of the existing applications of PDS in a smart city\
    \ are recapitulated in below (Table 6).\n9. Generational data management\nA massive\
    \ amount of data is ﬂowing in a smart city. Obviously, this data needs to be managed\
    \ for their well-being\nto be used for both personal and civic data services.\
    \ The use of WEB 3.0 for data management is also important.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\

    \ – May be applicable in smart city applications.\nIslam et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ mechanism using bloom ﬁlter which provides protection from cyber threats\nin\
    \ the healthcare system [125]. In this concern, Liu et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ distributed data storage\nscheme with enabled edge computing. The counting bloom\
    \ ﬁlter is used when the storage checking fails to locate\nthe error data and\
    \ to realize data dynamics [161]. Similarly, Nie et al. propose a secure and privacy-preserving\n\
    blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. For secure proﬁle matching, the ‘Key-policy\
    \ attribute-based encryption’\nalgorithm is used, and to verify the authenticity\
    \ of ciphertext, a bloom ﬁlter with hash functions is designed [200].\nA secure\
    \ framework in a sustainable city environment is proposed by Singh et al. for\
    \ smart parking that is energy\nefﬁcient and blockchain-enabled. For secure communication\
    \ of parking zone data, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n(ECC) algorithm is used\
    \ at the transport layer to encrypt and decrypt the data [247].\n10. Research\
    \ opportunities and challenges in smart city\nAs discussed in Section 1.1, big\
    \ data analysis, retrieval, and processing have very high importance from the\n\
    perspective of smart cities. As storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured\
    \ data, especially when responses\nare required in real-time, remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge for researchers. From the extensive LR done, some of the\nidentiﬁed\
    \ research areas are:\nFiltering and processing of sensor data: – The data generated\
    \ by various sensors and wearable devices have\nsome limitations like security,\
    \ privacy, ethics, data format, user acceptance, and big data concerns. Also,\
    \ have\nincompatibility issues between data and information. The information collected\
    \ by these devices may contain some\nnoise. This sensor data may be also corrupted\
    \ by the signals antiques like missing value and noise issues, which\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ reduce phase performance. Before using data for any future analysis, this issue\
    \ needs to be addressed.\nDifﬁcult to monitoring user’s social networking data:\
    \ – It is difﬁcult to monitor users’ data on social network-\ning sites. In smart\
    \ healthcare, doctors can’t rely on data from social media. But still, a system\
    \ for detecting the\npsychological disturbance in patients is presented named\
    \ emotional healthcare. Some techniques used to detect de-\npressive and stressful\
    \ content are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),\
    \ and\nBi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Also proposed recommendation\
    \ systems for patients to get a\ntext-based on the results while they had been\
    \ monitored.\nLack of efﬁcient computational models and data structures: – The\
    \ expansion of massive data has generated\nlarge and complicated data sets. Traditional\
    \ methods used for storage and retrieval of data, increase the computation\noverhead\
    \ in big processing and hence are unable to meet the requirements of the users.\
    \ For big data handling some\nadvanced data, models are required which produce\
    \ results in minimum time with minimum computation overhead.\nOne of the basic\
    \ problems of massive data is to style efﬁcient computational models and data\
    \ structures for solving\nthese problems in big data.\nThe need for energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data processing: – The rise of uses of IoT devices concept paved the way for\
    \ a\nsmart city. Energy management has become a major issue resource as IoT devices\
    \ are constantly consuming huge\namounts of energy. These concerns must be considered\
    \ in order to establish an effective mechanism. The efﬁcient use\n272\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nof power aims to\
    \ promise a sustainable city. In addition, IoT devices produce a larger amount\
    \ of data which is needed\nfor optimal processing. Enforcing another challenge\
    \ in securing smart cities is the sharing of data and access control.\nData storage\
    \ and processing: – Smart Cities take hold of the relative advantage of being\
    \ robust for storing\ndata and processing it in the information world. The applications\
    \ of smart cities have generated a continuous huge\namount of data from different\
    \ sources. The existing traditional methods are insufﬁcient to manage this volume\n\
    of data and they have restricted processing speed and effective storage expansion\
    \ costs. To overcome this issue,\nefﬁcient computational models and data structures\
    \ are required.\nVolume data: – Although it is difﬁcult to quantify this challenge\
    \ because data sets are typically very big like hun-\ndreds of terabytes or more.\
    \ The traditional storage system like Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n\
    and new big data technologies like Hadoop are developed to efﬁciently count the\
    \ data that must be kept and pro-\ncessed. The new data structures are also required\
    \ to handle and produce results at run time.\nReal time response: – The Response\
    \ Time (RT) in the smart city is very important in term of service, results, data\n\
    transmission etc. The RT directs to the fact that the data transmission and business\
    \ data infrastructure at elevated cost\nand should be considered with fewer delays.\
    \ In this case, various techniques have been used which are depending\non the\
    \ situation and difﬁculty of analysis. In smart cities where responses need to\
    \ be given after processing huge\ndata or by handling streaming data, then traditional\
    \ techniques and approaches are not efﬁcient. So some new data\nhandling techniques/data\
    \ structures are required to provide results in real-time.\nVariety of Data: –\
    \ In the smart city the source of a variety of data is also a major issue. The\
    \ smart city data\nis available in different data sets for different applications\
    \ of smart city and with different format styles like audio,\nvideo, images, text\
    \ etc. The data collected from a variety of sources are ambiguous, unstructured,\
    \ or semi-structured.\nThis data needs to be in a well-structured manner for effective\
    \ and efﬁcient results. The traditional methods are not\nsufﬁcient or even do\
    \ not provide accurate results in the real-time scenarios. For this data management,\
    \ a new data\nstructure like PDS is required.\nSearching and Retrieving for a\
    \ data item from the big data: – In huge data, the task of efﬁciently searching\n\
    and retrieving appropriate data for review in the petabyte and exabyte ranges,\
    \ in a variety of formats, is a major\nchallenge. In some applications when deadlines\
    \ are associated, this challenge becomes more tedious.\nStream Processing(Data\
    \ Collection and Distribution Analysis): – The streaming of big data in smart\
    \ cities is a\nbig challenge. There is a huge amount of data is ﬂow in the smart\
    \ city. The processing and analysis of this set of\ndata are required. When raw\
    \ data is combined like vehicle and road, geolocation sensor and social media,\
    \ weather\ndata, then the streaming of data may cause some issues like a too long\
    \ time in result, access problem etc. Also\nsome problems in development like\
    \ it is still dependent. Various decisions and predictions are based on this type\
    \ of\ndata like trafﬁc, future power consumption, etc. Some traditional systems\
    \ are proposed but with various limitations.\nA new mechanism is required to design\
    \ for efﬁcient and effective results.\nIntegration of Heterogeneous Data Sources\
    \ (Diversity Consolidation): – The data coming from different sources\nis not\
    \ in proper sequence, maybe in a different format, or ambiguous. The operation\
    \ on these data sets is difﬁcult to\napply like validation, authentication, updating,\
    \ alteration etc. This data is need to be well structured and organized.\nNatural\
    \ Text Analysis and Communication(social media analysis): – The analysis of natural\
    \ text from social\nnetworks is available through mobile devices like smartphones\
    \ is also challenging. This data is used for monitoring\nthe behavior and emotions\
    \ of citizens in real life. The information on location from various social networking\
    \ sites is\nnot in a proper format. The data include the comments and statements\
    \ about the user’s feelings, thoughts, interests,\nrelations etc. are integrated\
    \ with sensor data. The reliability of this data is also a big challenge.\nAmbient\
    \ Intelligence issues/challenges (speciﬁc to the current generation of smart city\
    \ domains): – The ex-\npeditious growth of conversion from rural to urban areas\
    \ and urban to smart cities is increasing rapidly. It also\nincreases the usage\
    \ and deployment of smart technologies in everything and everywhere in the city.\
    \ So, smart cities\nmay also face some ambient intelligence issues. The main concern\
    \ in smart cities is AI, and privacy when combine\nwith automation and autonomous\
    \ system [257]. This may also create some design trade-offs like:\nHuman control\
    \ vs. automation: Fail to recognize the speed limit sign or fooled by scam stickers\
    \ on road by\nautonomous driving [86]. Autonomous car driving (Uber) had met a\
    \ deadly accident with a woman walking at night\n[185]. Hard Behavior is also\
    \ one of the problems in autonomous systems. An example of this is conversations\
    \ of\ncustomers with fully automated call centers, and online shopping without\
    \ the involvement of humans. In AI-based\nbehavior, there are missing traceability,\
    \ transparency, and incomprehensible decisions.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n273\nPrivacy vs. smartness: There is also a trade-off\
    \ between privacy and intelligence. To provide smartness, the data\nshould be\
    \ provided to smart services. For this, blockchain is used, which is also cost-effective.\n\
    Infrastructure: To improve the standard of citizens, sensor technology is used\
    \ for analyzing and gathering in-\nformation. These sensors generally collect\
    \ the data like air quality, crime rates, rush hour stats, etc. To install these\n\
    types of sensors a complicated and costly infrastructure is involved [224].\n\
    Hackers vs Security: The threat level to security has also increased, as the uses\
    \ of sensors and IoT technology\nhave expanded.\nBeing Socially Inclusive: The\
    \ programs like ‘smart transit’ which is a great idea for the bustling city for\
    \ real-time\nupdates. This may also raise some issues like: some people in smart\
    \ cities can’t afford to take transit, all elderly\ngrowing people do use smart\
    \ mobile devices or apps, and how it is possible to use and reach technology to\
    \ these\ngroups of people?\n11. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper, we have\
    \ discussed the role of big data in Section 1.1, where we emphasize the importance\
    \ of big\ndata in smart cities. In Section 2 the generations of smart cities have\
    \ been discussed. There are various architectures\nthat have been discussed by\
    \ many researchers, but the most appropriate architecture for the smart city is\
    \ elaborated\nin Section 4. Los Angeles took the ﬁrst action or made the ﬁrst\
    \ contribution to smart city projects in 1974. They\nanalyze the urban big data.\
    \ In Section 5 listed various projects to date and also future plans regarding\
    \ smart cities.\nThe role of big data in smart cities is crucial in a smart city.\
    \ Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) have been discussed\n(Section 6) as a key\
    \ solution to many applications of smart cities. This paper also emphasizes the\
    \ various applications\nof smart cities, such as smart healthcare, smart transportation,\
    \ smart environment, agriculture, smart governance\nand economy, smart society,\
    \ people, education, and smart sustainability (Section 7). It has been found,\
    \ after going\nthrough various proposed techniques in the area of smart cities;\
    \ that there is an inﬂuence of big data in a smart\ncity. Generated data is inconsistent,\
    \ semi-structured, or unstructured, lack of efﬁciency in retrieval and storage\n\
    management of data, privacy, and security has major concerns. In the smart city,\
    \ the collection of data itself is a big\nchallenge. The data collected using\
    \ IoT devices, records (medical history), social media, and web pages are too\
    \ large.\nObviously, this data is redundant and unstructured. Various monitoring\
    \ systems in smart cities also have issues in the\nanalysis and representation\
    \ of this big data with low dimensions. Many researchers have put their sincere\
    \ endeavors\ninto extracting information from a huge amount of knowledge databases.\
    \ The main challenge in this effort is that\nthere is no standard approach to\
    \ efﬁciently map and keep the big data on consistent data structures. The existing\n\
    tool and techniques cannot work efﬁciently and satisfactorily in data management.\
    \ To store and processing of data\nfor optimal recovery and exploring procedures,\
    \ data structures like PDS is one of the adequate standards to use. In\nthe conclusion\
    \ of this paper after reviewing related work, we have listed the exiting and scope\
    \ of PDS in various\napplications of smart cities in Table 7.\nTable 7\nDomain\

    \ municipalities employ the smart city model in large cities to improve the quality\n\
    of life of their residents, utilize local resources efﬁciently, and save operating\
    \ expenses. This model\nincorporates many heterogeneous technologies such as Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Wireless\nSensor Networks (WSNs), and Cloud Computing (ClCom).\
    \ However, effective networking and\ncommunication protocols are required to provide\
    \ the essential harmonization and control of the many\nsystem mechanisms to achieve\
    \ these crucial goals. The networking requirements and characteristics\nof smart\
    \ city applications (SCAs) are identiﬁed in this study, as well as the networking\
    \ protocols\nthat can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are\
    \ required between the dissimilar\nmechanisms. Additionally, we show examples\
    \ of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,\nsuch as smart transport,\
    \ smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,\n\
    and control systems.\nKeywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures;\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\n1. Introduction\n\
    Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve\n\
    the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources.\
    \ Intelligent\nservices can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure\
    \ in smart cities. They can\nenhance performance and operations in a wide variety\
    \ of smart city applications (SCAs)\nincluding transportation, healthcare, energy,\
    \ education, and many more. Smart services are\nprovided by various cutting-edge\
    \ technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples\nof these technologies\
    \ include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data\nanalytics,\
    \ and robots.\nIoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful\
    \ human life beneﬁts [2].\nIoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart\
    \ things into urban environments\nwhere innovative services are offered to support\
    \ every activity at any time and from any\nlocation [2]. Things are monitored\
    \ by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their\nefﬁcient management.\
    \ Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and\nfault reporting\
    \ for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state\nof\
    \ the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices\
    \ can also\nobtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a\
    \ CPS, the computation,\nnetworking, and physical processes are put together to\
    \ control and monitor the physical\nenvironment of a smart city [4]. In smart\
    \ cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical\nconnections between the virtual\
    \ and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can\nbe sustained by the\
    \ ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform\nElectronics\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n2 of 63\nfor computation and IoT data storage [5].\
    \ FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,\nlocation awareness, streaming,\
    \ and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have\ndispersed vast numbers\
    \ of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications\n\
    that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by\
    \ smart cities,\nbig data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal\
    \ temporary and lasting\ndecisions [8].\nThe abovementioned technologies are used\
    \ to implement numerous smart city ser-\nvices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent\
    \ transportation services are applied to improve route\nplanning and avoid jamming\
    \ in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety\nand make possible\
    \ self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light\ncontrols\
    \ are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management\n\
    and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.\n\
    These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional\
    \ smart\nservices are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water\
    \ networks, train and\nsubway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health\
    \ monitoring is also feasible using\nsmart services [11]. Last but not least,\
    \ there are smart services that focus on monitoring the\nenvironment, public safety,\
    \ and security of citizens [12].\nAll these smart city services necessitate a\
    \ reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-\nciently exchange messages between\
    \ the modules of a smart city system implementing a\nparticular smart service.\
    \ In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-\nilar\
    \ scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented\
    \ based\non Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols.\
    \ On the other\nhand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented\
    \ using the WiMAX\n(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart\
    \ city services can exploit\ndissimilar network and communication models and solutions.\n\
    Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have\n\
    received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\
    \ survey\nof network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart\
    \ cities does not exist\nand is the goal of this study. The communication and\
    \ networking issues involved in smart\ncity systems are examined in this study.\
    \ This paper considers networking technologies,\ntopologies, and communication\
    \ requirements for such systems. It also examines if current\nnetwork protocols\
    \ are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent\n\
    developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active\
    \ area, this\npaper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper\
    \ contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents network requirements of the major SCAs\
    \ including intelligent transporta-\ntion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control, smart water networks, smart\ngrids, and manufacturing control and\
    \ monitoring.\n2.\nIt reviews networking architectures used for the above applications\
    \ focusing mainly\non the protocols’ suitability.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;\nSection 3 presents network\
    \ requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;\nSections 4 and 5 analyze\
    \ protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-\nings, smart\
    \ water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6\n\
    summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open research directions; lastly,\
    \ Section 8\nconcludes the paper. Figure 1 provides the layout of the survey.\n\

    1.\nAutomated keyword-based search;\n2.\nSelection of the article based on the\
    \ title, abstract, and quality of the publication;\n3.\nElimination of inappropriate\
    \ articles.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n4 of 63\nIn the ﬁrst stage, the search\
    \ process is automatically performed using searching on\npopular academic databases\
    \ such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer, Science Direct,\nSAGE, and Google\
    \ Scholar. The following search string was deﬁned by adding other\nspellings of\
    \ the main elements to ﬁnd relevant articles. The search string was as follows:\n\
    (“IoT” OR “Internet of Things”) AND (“network architecture” OR “network pro-\n\
    tocol” AND “smart cities” OR “smart rural” OR “smart village” OR “smart trafﬁc”\
    \ OR\n“smart transportation” OR “smart street lights” OR “smart energy” OR “smart\
    \ grid” OR\n“smart buildings” OR “smart home” OR “smart residence” OR “home automation”\
    \ OR\n“smart water” or “smart waste management” OR “smart healthcare” OR “smart\
    \ rural”\nAND “Cloud Computing” OR “edge computing” OR “software-deﬁned networking”\
    \ OR\n“Artiﬁcial Intelligence”).\nWe found 264 articles from journals, conference\
    \ proceedings, books, and patents.\nThese articles were published between 2013\
    \ and 2023. In the article selection based on the\nquality of the publisher stage,\
    \ the search string was constrained by searching for conference\npapers and journal\
    \ articles of IEEE, ACM, Sage, Wiley, Science Direct, and Springer, in\norder\
    \ to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected\
    \ for the\nreview. Consequently, 240 articles were selected.\nIn the third stage\
    \ of eliminating the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment\nChecklist (QAC)\
    \ based on [13] was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the\ninitial\
    \ search were reﬁned. After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated\
    \ articles.\nThe entire body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which\
    \ were not related to\nour concerned ﬁeld were also crossed out. After eliminating\
    \ inappropriate articles, only\n226 studies were identiﬁed.\n2. Smart City Applications\n\
    This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what\n\
    type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs,\
    \ their\nadvantages and design problems were addressed.\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and\nsustainability\
    \ of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart\
    \ grid\nis a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available\
    \ information\nabout supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply\
    \ self-monitoring and\nsuperior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer\
    \ demand, improving grid\nreliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used\
    \ to manage the process of producing\nrenewable energy from wind turbines [15].\n\
    Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy\n\
    consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,\n\
    Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.\n\
    Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the\
    \ environment\nand energy consumption, are typically included in smart building\
    \ systems. A centralized\nmonitoring and control system receives observations\
    \ and measurements from these sensors.\nBased on reported observations, current\
    \ operational circumstances, and environmental\nfactors, the control system employs\
    \ intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems\nemployed in the buildings\
    \ to optimize energy consumption.\nIntelligent transportation is another SCA that\
    \ has attracted a lot of interest in the\ntransportation sector. Applications\
    \ related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial\ntypes of such applications.\
    \ Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,\nsuch as blind spot\
    \ monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane\nchange\
    \ warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-\n\
    automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response\
    \ are these\napplications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing\
    \ vehicle safety must\nbe dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects\

    \ 63\nAnalysis of Smart City Applications/Systems\nThis subsection analyses the\
    \ SCAs shown in Figure 2.\nSmart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are\
    \ based on centralized pro-\ncesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus,\
    \ to automate such an innova-\ntive system, centralized and distributed methods\
    \ must be used to maintain local servers.\nJavaid et al. [26] suggested a smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-\nized and decentralized\
    \ processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm\nto manage\
    \ a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-\n\
    tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes\n\
    trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered\
    \ a theoreti-\ncal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management.\
    \ Notably, existing\ndecision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and\
    \ highway trafﬁc management,\nnot considering the closed campuses and collector\
    \ roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-\ntiﬁed this weakness and proposed\
    \ an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,\nand stores real-time trafﬁc\
    \ data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-\nagement system,\
    \ various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,\nextremely\
    \ sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,\n\
    and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as\
    \ higher costs.\nSmart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health\
    \ parameters, these sys-\ntems are progressively being associated with and connected\
    \ via the Internet to numerous\ntypes of available smart wearable sensing and\
    \ computing devices. These systems face\nseveral problems [29] that must be resolved.\
    \ A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-\nthentication, interoperability\
    \ issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-\ntion and management\
    \ of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]\naddressed\
    \ issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They\n\
    sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-\n\
    tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys\
    \ and\nreviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of\
    \ integrating IoT\nsystems with any healthcare application particularly.\nWeather\
    \ and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,\n\
    these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nimpractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead,\
    \ they are often deployed\nsparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial\
    \ resolutions for useful measurements.\nLately, cheap monitoring sensors have\
    \ evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in\nreﬁning the granularity of\
    \ monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]\nemphasized\
    \ the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality\n\
    monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the\
    \ issue of\ncross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.\
    \ Moreover, these sensors\nare extremely susceptible to unexpected variations\
    \ in humidity, temperature, and wind\ndirection, and as a result, their accuracy\
    \ deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine\nmight be a way to maintain\
    \ and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take\na lot more time and\
    \ work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for\nlarge-scale\
    \ deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex\n\
    and involves three steps [34]:\n(1)\nObserving: It can be performed by monitoring\
    \ satellite imagery, precipitation reports,\nsurface data, and gathering data\
    \ from other nearby forecasters.\n(2)\nForecasting: It can be performed by forecasters\
    \ as short-term and long-term forecasting.\nShort-term forecasting is carried\
    \ out by evaluating the current weather conditions\nand projecting them over the\
    \ next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics\nof the weather. Long-term forecasting,\
    \ however, is possible through weather (nu-\nmerical) modeling and the projection\
    \ of such modeling using computer simulations.\nTo produce these simulations for\
    \ future forecasting, these modeling techniques use\nenvironmental data from satellite\
    \ photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    7 of 63\nservations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters\
    \ translate the\nproduced simulated expected output into a perceptible format\
    \ for non-specialists so\nthat they can respond appropriately.\n(3)\nCommunicating:\
    \ Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to\nappropriate\
    \ authorities.\nDespite the fact that all of these computer models are used to\
    \ forecast the weather, the\nsuccess of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three\
    \ different elements: (a) the quantity of\nprecise data; (b) the length of time\
    \ needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of\ndynamic atmospheric\
    \ weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region\nis the\
    \ placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from\
    \ rural\nareas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough\
    \ information for desert,\nsea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models\
    \ used to predict weather conditions\naccurately. Forecasters also use satellite\
    \ data to combat this issue. However, because\nof cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes\
    \ in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nsatellite data accuracy can\
    \ occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and\nmap information\
    \ or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,\nit\
    \ further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further\
    \ makes\nthings harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there\
    \ is a need to re-\nevaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations\
    \ so that they can predict the\nchanges more accurately.\nSmart Waste Management\
    \ Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for\nthe following reasons:\
    \ (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate\nwaste\
    \ collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;\n\
    (4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies;\
    \ and (5) lack\nof workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical\
    \ skills to handle\ngarbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart\
    \ waste management schemes\ninclude various steps such as (1) waste collection;\
    \ (2) differentiation of waste as per their\nbiological and physical properties;\
    \ (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage\ndisposal infrastructures/treatment\
    \ plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova\nand Porras [35] identiﬁed\
    \ issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from\nsmart deployed\
    \ sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues\n\
    such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly\
    \ managing\nwaste vehicle routes.\nSmart Street Lighting Systems: This system\
    \ is a network-oriented solution that uses\nstreetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators\
    \ and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities\nand connectivity interfaces\
    \ [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a\nmechanism that\
    \ gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting\n\
    with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the\
    \ streetlights, and\nthey are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device.\
    \ Zanella et al. [37] insist\nthat their system could assist in gathering environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, air\ntemperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors\
    \ stated that optimizing street lighting\nefﬁciency is a paramount concern that\
    \ must be addressed. This monitoring system makes\nit possible to maximize efﬁciency\
    \ since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity\nin response to the\
    \ time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this\nsystem\
    \ is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns\
    \ that\nrequire particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions\
    \ and communication\namong heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right\
    \ light lamp is critical for a\npower-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection\
    \ is based on how effective they are in\nterms of power usage and lifespan. The\
    \ existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide\n(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium\
    \ (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen\nas being inefﬁcient\
    \ in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,\nwhich adds\
    \ signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following\n\
    the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201)\
    \ [36].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n8 of 63\nCurrently, there are three kinds\
    \ of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:\ncentralized, decentralized,\
    \ and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a\nvariety of security\
    \ assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem\nthus far.\n\
    Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security\
    \ of\nits residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing\
    \ with natural\ncalamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection\
    \ is ﬁrst and foremost\nimportant for the designing portion of these applications.\
    \ Depending on the gathered\nfacts, the development of intelligence (which aids\
    \ in making important decisions) and the\nability to respond swiftly and quickly\
    \ are the issues that require special attention. When\nit comes to gathering data,\
    \ we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc\nsensors. A developer\
    \ can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will\nconduct\
    \ predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,\n\
    this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information\
    \ that\nwill help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the\
    \ police department,\nand law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and\
    \ preventive measures. The\nconcept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts\
    \ for security and safety. However,\nkeeping track of such vast amounts of data\
    \ also prompts a lot of worries and issues for\ndesigners and developers, including\
    \ storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,\nmost importantly, the\
    \ question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track\nof each\
    \ individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether\
    \ this\nkind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such\
    \ as China and India,\nwhere a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation.\
    \ Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]\nclaimed that combining information transmission\
    \ technologies with well-implemented\ndata analytics models is necessary for quick\
    \ and swift collaboration. To save as many lives\nas possible during natural disasters,\
    \ it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate\nvital information to the\
    \ relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work\nbeing done\
    \ to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this\n\
    system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important\
    \ problems\nthat need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and\
    \ information sharing\nacross heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).\n\
    Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems\nsuch\
    \ as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems,\
    \ TVs,\nand other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances\
    \ that may send\nusers remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing\
    \ machines. A user can control\nthe majority of smart home appliances remotely\
    \ with two recently produced gadgets:\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart\
    \ home, the end-user demands a high-speed\ninternet connection, so they can access\
    \ networking sites that control the home with HD live\nstreaming services. In\
    \ contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to\ncomputing\
    \ servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data\n\
    management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate\n\
    on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending\n\
    distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of\
    \ smart home\nautomation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks.\
    \ A smart home includes\nsecurity monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly\
    \ opening smart door locks,\ntelevisions, phones, and other smart appliances that\
    \ are highly outﬁtted with cameras and\nmicrophones. Although these gadgets improve\
    \ the system, little research has been done on\ntheir privacy and security features.\
    \ If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we\nwill discover that their\
    \ manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.\nIndeed,\
    \ Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining\n\
    Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They\n\
    argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already\
    \ more\nprivileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated\
    \ applications. As a\nresult, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this,\
    \ according to a published document\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n9 of 63\nby WikiLeaks\
    \ [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,\n\
    and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal\n\
    entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate\
    \ private\ninformation, and exploit that information immorally typically through\
    \ user tracking and\nproﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these\
    \ smart applications, grab vital\ninformation, and then use it to launch any kind\
    \ of attack. For instance, based on motion\nsensors, security camera feeds, and\
    \ power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where\nand when to break into\
    \ the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized\nparties,\
    \ they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and\n\
    software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard\
    \ against\nall these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators,\
    \ etc., are impervious to\nsuch security and privacy attacks.\nSmart Grid Networks:\
    \ The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-\ntional (i.e.,\
    \ electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).\n\
    Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks\
    \ to\nthe deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in\
    \ an open-loop\nfashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures\
    \ in the distribution\nsector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little\
    \ or no real-time knowledge of the\nsystem’s operating conditions and dynamically\
    \ changing load. There are also several tech-\nnical, economic, and environmental\
    \ problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,\nthis conventional system\
    \ must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as\nﬂexible, secure,\
    \ and interoperable [42].\nThe smart grid is the next invention of the Electric\
    \ Power System (EPS) that incor-\nporates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication\
    \ networks [43]. Smart grids\nsupplement the conventional electricity grid by\
    \ incorporating renewable energy sources\nsuch as biomass, solar energy, and wind\
    \ energy. These energy sources are much cleaner\nand more ecologically friendly\
    \ than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.\nHowever, it is important\
    \ to identify the most suitable communication technology for the\nsmart grid’s\
    \ successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-\n\
    nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns.\
    \ The\ncommunication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle\
    \ information\nexchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,\
    \ and numerous smart meters\nin such a particular environment with little to no\
    \ human intervention. This type of com-\nmunication, called Device-to-Device (D2D)\
    \ communication, is autonomous and may be\ninitiated in response to an event or\
    \ at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these\nsmart grid applications\
    \ were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly\nin terms\
    \ of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement\n\
    of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent\
    \ grid\nnetworks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the\
    \ same network\npresent the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications\
    \ based on the smart\ngrid can be developed and implemented using the current\
    \ wireless and wired networking\ninfrastructure and technologies. For some devices,\
    \ such as smart meters, designing and\nstandardizing acceptable smart grid-based\
    \ protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,\nthese smart grid-based networks\
    \ are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and\nother devices. This\
    \ makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These\nsmart\
    \ grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain\n\
    unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as\
    \ the existing\nelectricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid\
    \ systems, high-level adjustments\nto current power infrastructure scenarios are\
    \ required. Subsequently, these smart systems\nrequire high installation costs\
    \ because the installation requires a large number of smart\nmeters, sensors,\
    \ and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of\n\
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free\
    \ network\nchannel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent\
    \ applications.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n10 of 63\nMany surveys [42–45,47]\
    \ reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-\ngrid-based networking\
    \ technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-\nous smart grid\
    \ applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on\ntransmission\
    \ grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.\n3. Network\
    \ Requirements for SCAs\nThis section considers several communication requirements\
    \ including reliability, delay\ntolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security,\
    \ network type, heterogeneous network\nsupport, and mobility support. It also\
    \ studies the aptness of different network protocols for\ndissimilar SCAs.\nSmart\
    \ city services and applications need robust and dependable communication\nsupport\
    \ as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent\n\
    message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49].\
    \ Every\nsmart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of\
    \ various networking\ncomponents. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required\
    \ to have a variety of net-\nworking requirements. To access the far-off destination,\
    \ which may be clouds, the network\ntrafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse\
    \ applications uses a common networking\narchitecture and resources. These resources\
    \ may consist of switches, routers, communica-\ntion connections (links), and\
    \ other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing\nfaraway clouds or\
    \ far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings\nup problems\
    \ with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network\n\
    bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when\
    \ develop-\ning, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart\
    \ cities. Otherwise, users\nwould be reluctant to approve the use of such applications\
    \ in the absence of adequate secu-\nrity safeguards. Such intelligent applications\
    \ need a high-speed networking environment\nwhere the quick reaction may be managed\
    \ with the support of the ability of a fast-processing\nspeed. Furthermore, a\
    \ variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,\nbased on\
    \ their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have\n\
    different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security\
    \ [50]. For\nexample, the networking requirements of smart emergency response\
    \ systems are quite\ndifferent compared to other applications such as smart healthcare\
    \ systems. Emergency\nresponse smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick\
    \ to react [50]. In contrast,\nsmart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily\
    \ need to be especially dynamic.\n−\nNetwork Protocols: Monitoring applications\
    \ for smart cities often use a dense network\nof heterogeneous sensor nodes, including\
    \ ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,\nand crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),\nextended coverage GSM IoT,\
    \ and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing\noptions to support\
    \ such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing\nnodes (smartphones)\
    \ is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no\nfurther wireless\
    \ communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can\nbe utilized\
    \ on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered\n\
    by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations\
    \ (the\nbackbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.\n−\nZigbee [53], WiFi,\
    \ and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes\nto communicate\
    \ within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor\nnode\
    \ clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-\n\
    ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance\n\
    simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also\
    \ make\npossible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance\
    \ of real-time\nmonitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance,\
    \ can accommodate video\nstreams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.\
    \ The fast data rates\nprovided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous\
    \ for the sink nodes or clusters.\nThe use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)\
    \ in structural health monitoring\napplications of bridges, tunnels, or towers\
    \ is fairly common. The cluster heads will be\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n11\
    \ of 63\nable to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion,\
    \ practically\nall applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data\
    \ throughput and\nminimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there\
    \ are some new\nsensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56],\
    \ and Narrowband-\nIoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous\
    \ advantages: greater\ncoverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and\
    \ increased device longevity.\nResearchers have tested these standards in more\
    \ than a few applications, including\nstreet lighting, energy metering, and home\
    \ automation, even though some are still\nbeing discussed and revised. The new\
    \ narrowband communication standards enable\nthe sensor nodes to run more sustainably,\
    \ which is beneﬁcial for applications that\naim for long-term monitoring. In addition\
    \ to these protocols and standards, the FogC\narchitecture [58] aids in monitoring\
    \ smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile\nusers (the potential crowd-sensing\
    \ providers) and the cloud are connected via fog\nservers. These fog servers are\
    \ WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users\nare more inclined\
    \ to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing\nmeasurements\
    \ to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and\nenergy\
    \ usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give\n\
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the\n\
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the\
    \ FogC\narchitecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency\
    \ and response\ntime are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates\
    \ directly from\nthe fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone\
    \ network. Lastly,\nusing the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is\
    \ crucial to getting the\nbest possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and\
    \ cost. The networks may be\nhierarchical so that diverse roles and functions\
    \ can be assigned at various layers to\nincrease the networks’ dependability and\
    \ cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes\nmay be able to transmit data\
    \ utilizing various protocols.\n−\nBandwidth requirements: Many video applications\
    \ in smart cities require high band-\nwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors\
    \ capture video from the physical environment.\nMoreover, video transmission is\
    \ more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar\ndata trafﬁc in IoT. Examples\
    \ of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-\nlance systems for\
    \ home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,\ntrafﬁc monitoring\
    \ systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring\nof an environmental\
    \ system.\n−\nDelay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate\
    \ a small\namount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger\
    \ to the ve-\nhicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed\
    \ must arrive within\nmicroseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react\
    \ in time. However, other\napplications have a higher tolerance for delays [49].\
    \ Such applications rely on data\nmonitoring and information gathering for upcoming\
    \ analysis.\n−\nPower Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power\
    \ consumption.\nSmart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy\
    \ sources can tolerate\nprotocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45].\
    \ Other applications have medium\npower needs and require energy sources with\
    \ limited capacities. One example of such\nan application is intelligent transportation.\
    \ Other applications demand protocols with\nlow or very low energy consumption\
    \ characteristics since they have limited energy\nresources. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline\nmonitoring for gas and oil are a\
    \ few examples of such uses.\n−\nReliability: The majority of applications have\
    \ medium reliability requirements. A\ntypical example of such applications is\
    \ smart water networks. Some other applications\nhave high-reliability necessities\
    \ such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].\n−\nSecurity: The majority\
    \ of applications need medium to high security. Applications\nsuch as production\
    \ control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n12 of 63\nothers, such as smart grids, need high security because\
    \ of the sensitivity of the data\nand the importance of the operations carried\
    \ out [50].\n−\nHeterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city\
    \ systems use network-\ning protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent\
    \ transportation and smart\nbuildings are two examples of such systems. These\
    \ protocols must coexist in such\nsituations without conﬂicting with one another.\
    \ To ensure seamless and effective\noperation, it is also necessary to correctly\
    \ map the control information in the head-\ners at the various networking stack\
    \ tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols\nand networks.\n−\nWired/wireless\
    \ connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity\nare UAVs\
    \ and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent\ntransportation\
    \ and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In\nthese situations,\
    \ wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc\nphysical system\
    \ (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used\nto link the\
    \ physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the\n\
    backbone and infrastructure networks.\n−\nMobility: Some systems, such as the\
    \ smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,\nand smart water networks,\
    \ have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such\nas UAVs and intelligent\
    \ transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility\nsmart city systems\
    \ can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and\nadaptable to\
    \ node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control\nmessages\
    \ and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.\nTable\
    \ 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each\n\
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network\
    \ with\nlow, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility\
    \ of devices. Each\nSCA is based on different protocols and requires different\
    \ bandwidth and latency tolerance.\nIn each SCA, the number of devices involved\
    \ differs.\nTable 1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements.\n\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n13 of 63\n3.1. Additional Challenges\n−\nInteroperability:\
    \ Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking\nprotocols\
    \ that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-\ncal and\
    \ data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-\nlessly,\
    \ these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE\n\
    1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between\
    \ physi-\ncal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this\
    \ function. Future\nresearch should focus on the creation of similar protocols\
    \ to increase the support\nsystem for smart city systems.\n−\nScalability: A smart\
    \ city platform must manage many devices that are connected to\nthe city’s infrastructure.\
    \ Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously\nproduced and consumed\
    \ by devices and client applications, must be stored and\nprocessed. The platform\
    \ must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests\nfrom users and services\
    \ that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change\ndepending on the\
    \ features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.\nRecently,\
    \ Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-\n\
    source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale\n\
    systems, apps, and services for smart cities.\n−\nLoad Balancing: To maximize\
    \ the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-\npriate resources (i.e.,\
    \ network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,\nand energy resources)\
    \ to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and\navoids overload\
    \ thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,\ncost, throughput,\
    \ performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of\nQoS parameters.\n\
    −\nThe Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation\
    \ of\nsmart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,\n\
    upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that\
    \ demand\nadvanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems\n\
    for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently,\
    \ FogC and\nEdge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing,\
    \ imple-\nmenting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These\
    \ paradigms\nbring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that\
    \ the primary computa-\ntion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm\
    \ offers particular assistance\nbased on the requirements of the application at\
    \ hand. For example, to support a cloud-\nbased SCA, ClCom offers centralized\
    \ storage and processing capacity. For certain\nSCAs, ClCom can offer scalable\
    \ processing power and data storage [5]. The features of\nClCom (e.g., powerful\
    \ processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge\nsoftware services)\
    \ can be used to provide various support services for a variety of\nSCAs. ClCom\
    \ can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The\ncity’s ClCom\
    \ services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs\nto gather,\
    \ process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes\nof data\
    \ are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The\n\
    sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount\
    \ of\ndata to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing.\
    \ To\neffectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators\
    \ and\nClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures\n\
    used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require\n\
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function\
    \ well\nwith a robust network that offers good communication services linking\
    \ both sides.\nThe fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central\
    \ location or across\nnumerous distributed platforms in various locations is another\
    \ problem that occurs\nwhen adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications,\
    \ the distributed\nClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability\
    \ support [67]. However,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n14 of 63\nit is frequently\
    \ necessary to establish effective communication channels between the\ndistributed\
    \ ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability\n\
    and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another\n\
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and\n\
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,\n\
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control\
    \ of\nnetwork resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot\
    \ be\navoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated\
    \ the QoS require-\nments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment\
    \ to recognize\nQoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog)\
    \ that is\ninspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture\
    \ [69] for\na FogC system.\n3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks\n\
    A smart city network has the following features [70]:\n1.\nLarge Densities: A\
    \ smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart\ndevices are\
    \ distributed in the area of a city.\n2.\nAbnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading\
    \ or synchronization among smart devices produces\nextremely bursty or correlated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from\nthe regular social-generated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and\ntechnology used in our society\
    \ are based.\n3.\nDisorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless\
    \ connectivity features,\nsmart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology.\
    \ The problem arises\nwhen smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless\
    \ channels, where packet\nlosses caused by wireless channel special properties\
    \ are extremely common and even-\ntually have an impact on the functioning of\
    \ the smart city system. Therefore, it appears\nvery improbable that a single\
    \ high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.\n4.\nHeterogeneity: SCAs use\
    \ a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,\nlatency, throughput,\
    \ and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates\nat a unique trade-off\
    \ threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on\na single platform.\n\
    5.\nCoexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used\
    \ in smart\ncities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time,\
    \ independent radio\ninfrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless\
    \ channels. Under such\ncircumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues\
    \ with competence.\n6.\nSecurity and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to\
    \ several risks from malevolent\nusers. The majority of specialized smart sensors,\
    \ actuators, and other intelligent\ndevices are developed by designers without\
    \ considering security measures. Such\napplications may be highly vulnerable due\
    \ to hostile actors’ ease of access to these\ncutting-edge technologies and potential\
    \ threats to people’s security and privacy.\nThe main challenges for smart city\
    \ networks are as follows [70]:\n•\nLack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal\nArea Networks (PANs) and the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the\nconcept of single-hop ad-hoc networking.\
    \ These standards permit direct communi-\ncation between two devices that are\
    \ in the transmission range of each other. At the\nsame time, the multi-hop ad-hoc\
    \ networking paradigm enables the communication\nbetween any two devices which\
    \ are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A\nproblem that researchers\
    \ must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of\ndevices (i.e., actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly\nwithout any standardization.\
    \ Global distributors and manufacturers must propose\nand accept standardized\
    \ network solutions that enable communication between di-\nverse devices on homogeneous\
    \ communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard\nis the dominant solution\
    \ that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.\nThis standard\
    \ deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n15 of 63\npower consumption. Several revisions or amendments\
    \ (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE\n802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released.\
    \ The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment\nallows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing\
    \ data rates and communication ranges\ncompatible with neighborhood mesh (wide)\
    \ networks. Then, it is followed by another\ncutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances\nthe method used by devices to access\
    \ wireless channels while also using time-slotted\nchannel hopping mode. This\
    \ hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption\nand improved dependability.\
    \ From another viewpoint, many researchers customized\nappropriate upper-layer\
    \ protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary\nmodiﬁcations\
    \ there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-\ntructure.\
    \ Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-\n\
    able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],\n\
    which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.\n•\nInterference\
    \ problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio\n\
    space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless\
    \ channels.\nBecause of this, the smart application must handle interference problems\
    \ in such\nsituations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate\
    \ and be\ncompatible with one another.\n•\nVertical handover (soft): Multiple\
    \ radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of\nsmart devices being developed.\
    \ These devices should be able to recognize and use the\nbest interface that is\
    \ currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.\n•\nD2D Communications:\
    \ In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-\nmands. Unfortunately,\
    \ conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated\nmessages from heterogeneous\
    \ devices.\n•\nShort Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support\
    \ and recommend\nacceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However,\
    \ smart devices\ncommunicate with one another using short messages (since most\
    \ of them are tiny\nand operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end,\
    \ short communicating\nmessages will positively impact network congestion detection\
    \ and avoidance policies\nand promote in-band aggregation.\n•\nLocal Network Trafﬁc\
    \ Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the\nsame network\
    \ infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively\nplanned,\
    \ implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc\nfrom\
    \ these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge\n\
    that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc\
    \ from these\ntwo types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure\
    \ due to several\nintrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional\
    \ network. Additionally,\nD2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce\
    \ resources than smartphones,\nunnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness\
    \ in the system [74]. Therefore, we\nmust ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns\
    \ and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns\ngenerated by smartphones. Understanding\
    \ trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into\nmanaging and allocating shared network\
    \ resources more effectively and guarantee\nthe highest level of service quality\
    \ for both types of devices.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are a remarkable threat to the\nsecurity of smart city networks and\
    \ must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods\nhave been proposed to solve this\
    \ problem. Such a statistical method is presented\nin [75] that is based on feature\
    \ distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis\nprocess. Another security\
    \ mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying\nusers and devices in\
    \ a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-\nmanipulated devices.\
    \ Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT\nsystems such as\
    \ the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation\nattack, and\
    \ the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be\nencrypted.\
    \ However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n16 of 63\nbe able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for\
    \ this task. In addition, low\nresources and constrained devices can only embed\
    \ application-speciﬁc integrated\ncircuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic\
    \ primitives are not suitable for low-\nresource smart devices due to their low\
    \ computation power, limited battery life, small\nsize, small memory, and limited\
    \ power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography\nmay be an efﬁcient encryption\
    \ for these devices. Trust management is another security\nmechanism that detects\
    \ and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access\ncontrol. Automated\
    \ and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust\nvalues of the\
    \ participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management\nschemes\
    \ focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control\n\
    methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of\
    \ smart\nthings storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,\
    \ transparent, and\neasy access control management so that different nodes/users\
    \ can be granted different\nlevels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain\
    \ technology can be used to\ncreate secure virtual zones where things can identify\
    \ and trust each other [77]. Self-\norganization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can\
    \ also be planned to set up the relationship\nbetween Blockchain and IoT, as suggested\
    \ in [78].\n•\nAnomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow\
    \ through the IoT system\ncan vary to a great extent, in terms of either format,\
    \ shape (in time and space), and\nsemantics. Therefore, the process of separating\
    \ normal from abnormal sensed data is\nextremely demanding. In the context of\
    \ IoT applications, sensors are the real source\nof big data, which suggests that\
    \ anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful\ntool to address the inevitable\
    \ data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is\nconcerned with identifying\
    \ data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected\nbehavior. This is critical\
    \ in the process of ﬁnding out important information about\nthe IoT system’s functioning,\
    \ detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult\nto model or, otherwise,\
    \ to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to\npreventing\
    \ IoT system failure.\n•\nAdvanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), machine learn-\ning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the\nsmart city sectors [80]. These\
    \ techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-\npletely automated\
    \ IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of\nthe big data\
    \ is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches\ncan\
    \ improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase\n\
    precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,\n\
    person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation\n\
    system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving\
    \ vehi-\ncles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques\
    \ are also used to\nprecisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data\
    \ in an urban environment.\nIn SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned\
    \ techniques can enhance the\nsafety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,\
    \ management, and power\ngrid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective\
    \ use of smart meter big data\nfor different applications such as load assessment\
    \ and prediction, baseline estimation,\ndemand response, load clustering, and\
    \ malicious data deception attacks. In health\nintelligence, extensive use of\
    \ AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to\nhigh-performance IoT devices,\
    \ Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These\ntechniques can play a\
    \ vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-\nlytics\
    \ for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role\
    \ of\nAI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques\
    \ can be used\nfrom an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security\
    \ threats. Notably, the\naccuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques\
    \ can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the amount of training data to strengthen\
    \ their learning capabilities and\nhence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].\n\

    \ and protocols.\nSCAs involve numerous smart things that operate on low-powered\
    \ battery devices [83].\nNew connectivity solutions are being investigated in\
    \ light of the following question:\ndo the currently available methods, tools,\
    \ and techniques—especially those for wireless\nnetworks—allow for the reliable\
    \ handling of such a large number of smart devices?\nYaqoob et al. [84] provided\
    \ details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN\ntechnologies such as\
    \ ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-\nmunication.\
    \ In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-\nnected\
    \ devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies\n\
    (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only\n\
    partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies\
    \ and commu-\nnication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication\
    \ perspective.\nIEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput\
    \ performance\nfor fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior\
    \ context. Due to the\nlimitations of its initial design, this standard does not\
    \ support IoT applications. Hence,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n18 of 63\nto enable\
    \ IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah\nTask\
    \ Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create\
    \ a\nsystem that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor\
    \ devices.\nNevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need\
    \ to be improved by\nthe absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.\nIEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular\n\
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards\n\
    and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs.\
    \ Smart\nhome automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require\
    \ short-\nrange communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth\
    \ and Zigbee) from\nthe WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower\
    \ bandwidth requirement,\nminimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication\
    \ infrastructure environment.\nIn contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used\
    \ for SCAs that require longer-range\ncommunication. Such applications are smart\
    \ transportation management systems.\nThe protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular\
    \ and WiMAX, can be adopted by\napplications that need wide-range communication,\
    \ such as smart emergency response\nsystems, weather and air quality monitoring\
    \ systems, and smart grid systems. These\nfeatures designed in terms of standards\
    \ or protocols have enough capability that allows for\nboth synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can\neffectively tolerate latency)\
    \ allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked\nwith smart city\
    \ services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-\ntions\
    \ is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating\
    \ strict\nQoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity\
    \ [49]. Since IEEE\n802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication\
    \ protocol that often suggests\nhigher ﬂexibility for small devices running on\
    \ low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly\nincrease network lifetime. Moreover,\
    \ such a protocol encourages and indicates support\nfor applications and services\
    \ with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in\nWPANs. The authors\
    \ of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-\ngent\
    \ system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using\
    \ wireless\nemulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment,\
    \ relatively easier in\nexpanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due\
    \ to the use of wireless technology,\nwhich supports the usage of heterogeneous\
    \ devices in the same implemented and deployed\nstructure. Furthermore, they emphasized\
    \ the advantages of employing the same intelligent\ninfrastructure for a variety\
    \ of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,\nand cost-effectiveness.\
    \ For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as\nwater or gas\
    \ meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established\
    \ to\ntarget smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering\
    \ applications.\n5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called\
    \ BDMA and FBMC\nmultiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case\
    \ of BDMA multiple access, an\northogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that\
    \ resources can be distributed in parallel to\neach mobile base station by dividing\
    \ the antenna beam in accordance with the position of\nthe mobile stations to\
    \ enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps\nin\
    \ improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving\
    \ towards\n5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on\
    \ unique customer\nneeds. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented\
    \ 5G cellular networks should\naddress noteworthy complications that are not successfully\
    \ addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced\nnetwork capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-\nsistent user QoE provisioning. In addition,\
    \ massive and rapid growth in the number of\nhighly developed connected devices\
    \ leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a\nwidening range of applications\
    \ with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta\nand Jha [86] studied numerous\
    \ facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive\nMIMO, trafﬁc and power\
    \ management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and\norganizing\
    \ networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing\n\
    and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days thanks\
    \ to 5G. 5G\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n19 of 63\nultimately targets some networking\
    \ possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-\nmunications (uRLLC),\
    \ enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type\nCommunications (mMTC).\
    \ In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a\nvariety of networked\
    \ user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC\naims to\
    \ manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-\n\
    sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for\
    \ managing\nhighly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication,\
    \ base stations, and\nedge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely\
    \ brought about a new\nrevolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown\
    \ challenges still are possible in\nthese cases of communication when 5G is deployed\
    \ in the context of smart cities. One major\nproblem is power-efﬁcient communication,\
    \ especially when communicating low-powered\nbattery devices such as sensors and\
    \ other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when\ntwo distinct technologies\
    \ (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-\nlevel compatibility\
    \ problems might always persist when communication infrastructures\nmigrate to\
    \ next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to\n\
    handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach\n\
    places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining\
    \ 5G\nnetworks.\nTable 2 compares protocols used for smart cities, while Table\

    and quick increase in highly sophisticated connected devices\ncontributes to a\
    \ sharp escalation in network trafﬁc and an\nexpanding variety of applications\
    \ with distinct dynamic\ndemands and features.\nSince LTE user equipment is not\

    \ 802.11 Standards\nTable 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features.\n\
    Table 4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features.\nStandards (Year\
    \ Released)\nEnhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11 (1997) (Original)\n\
    The standard and its amendments serve as the foundation for\nwireless network\
    \ products bearing the WiFi brand. This signiﬁes\ntwo raw data rates of 1 and\
    \ 2 Mbps that must be transferred via\nDSSS and FHSS at 2.4 GHz in the ISM band.\n\
    Wireless Standard (basic)\nIEEE 802.11b (1999)\nThis standard is intended to operate\
    \ in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;\nhowever, the level of interference issues is higher\
    \ when this\nstandard-based device tries to interoperate with many other\ndevices/standards\
    \ operating on the same band. It can attain a\ntheoretical data rate of 11 Mbps.\
    \ Nevertheless, dynamic\nadaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject\
    \ to the current\ninterference level and signal power to minimize the error rate\
    \ (ARS\nPolicy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates\ncan\
    \ be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it\nprovides somewhat\
    \ simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading\nthe current chipsets) as it demonstrates\
    \ backward compatibility\nwith the original standard due to the use of CDMA and\
    \ DSSS (same\nas the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor\n\
    ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-1\nIEEE 802.11a (1999)\n\
    Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least\namount of interference\
    \ compared to other devices. Depending on\nthe needs, the raw data rates can be\
    \ changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,\n24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps.\
    \ However, it can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage\
    \ indoor\nand outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].\nWiFi-2\n\
    IEEE 802.11g (2003)\nAllows for device compatibility with devices that operate\
    \ and\nfollow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical\ntransfer\
    \ rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a\npractical data rate\
    \ of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE\n802.11b-based devices are introduced into\
    \ IEEE 802.11g networks,\nor when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate,\
    \ the\nrate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based\ntransmission\
    \ speeds every time that the compliant device tries to\ncommunicate [89]. The\
    \ coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are\n148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.\n\
    WiFi-3\nIEEE 802.11e (2005)\nIt speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications\n\
    through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed\nQoS requirements\
    \ by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:\n(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme\
    \ and (2) the contention-free\nHCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides\
    \ trafﬁc\nprioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to\ndifferentiated\
    \ services). Conversely, this standard suggests\nparameterized QoS (similar to\
    \ integrated services) via HCCA. It\nalso speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11\npower saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95].\
    \ It\nis designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to\n2.4835 GHz or\
    \ from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes\nthat a high transmission\
    \ rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS\nrequirements imposed by real-time\
    \ audio, voice, video, and\nlive-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions\
    \ of trafﬁc\nprioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.\nQoS improvements\n\

    Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11n (2009)\nThis standard was suggested\
    \ while keeping the increased speed\nrequirement in mind. Later, it was able to\
    \ boost the attainable\nspeeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with\
    \ 802.11g.\nAchieving such high performance required several new features,\nincluding\
    \ a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,\nantenna technology, MIMO, and\
    \ wider channel bandwidth.\nNonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard\
    \ has been\nsigniﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.\nWhenever\
    \ or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts\nto communicate with\
    \ an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g\nnetwork, the network’s operation,\
    \ performance, and other\ncapabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based\
    \ APs can\noperate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst\n802.11a/b/g),\
    \ Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and\noperate on heterogeneous conditions),\
    \ and Greenﬁeld mode\n(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89].\
    \ It can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor\n\
    and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-4\nIEEE 802.11ac\
    \ (2013)\nThis standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping\nincreased\
    \ speed requirements in mind (likewise with other\nstandards). This standard was\
    \ later able to increase the achievable\nspeeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps\
    \ (maximum)) of WiFi\nnetworks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard\n\
    enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,\nlive-streaming,\
    \ and other demanding applications. It operates\nusing MU-MIMO technology, which\
    \ enables a single AP and its\nantenna to send data concurrently to several devices.\
    \ As a result,\nthis helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated\n\
    client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally\nreceives the amount\
    \ of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending\non the technology used.\nWiFi-5\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah (2017)\nDesigned to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz,\
    \ it can\nprovide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional\n802.11\
    \ standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThis standard can\
    \ be employed in those scenarios where accessible\nbandwidth is comparatively\
    \ narrow. It can normally apply with\nWiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale\
    \ WSNs (i.e., smart\ngrid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably\
    \ large\ntransmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale\nnetworks\
    \ where the number of devices may be much greater than\nwhat the conventional\
    \ 802.11 standard can support. It advises that\nchanges to the PHY and MAC layers\
    \ be made to provide important\nimprovements including energy-saving capabilities,\
    \ support for\naccommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access\n\
    techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using\nsmall frame formats\
    \ [96].\nExtended coverage, low-power\nWLAN\nIEEE 802.11ax (2021)\nThis standard\
    \ was proposed with the consideration of higher speed\nrequirements. Later, this\
    \ standard increased WiFi network\nachievable speeds above what was made possible\
    \ by earlier\nstandards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data\
    \ rate,\nconsistency, and low power consumption. It operates using\nMU-MIMO and\
    \ MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which\nenables a single AP and its antenna\
    \ to send data concurrently to\nseveral end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard\
    \ is where\nMU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows\nfor groups\
    \ of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also\nsuggests several improvements\
    \ in spatial reusing policies and\npower-saver schemes [97].\nWiFi-6\n* ARS: Adaptive\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n25 of 63\n4.2. IEEE 802.15.1\nThe IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN\
    \ protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave\ntime division duplex\
    \ mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a\n1 Mbps data\
    \ rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed\n\
    to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth\
    \ and\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98].\
    \ The deployment\nof services offered for tracking and localization devices is\
    \ typically suggested by BLE-based\ndevices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.\
    \ These beacons produce a signal that other\ncompatible devices can pick up between\
    \ 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises\ngreater indoor localization\
    \ accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can\nbe used for\
    \ a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch\n\
    of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally,\
    \ to provide\nspeciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine\
    \ the BLE technology with\nother technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the\
    \ aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth\nClassic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous\
    \ wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth\nBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR).\
    \ It became the perfect option for the IoT\nsince it permits connectivity and\
    \ audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-\ndistance radio, which\
    \ lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need\nnot be\
    \ connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE\n\
    speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous\
    \ devices\n(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected\
    \ to wearables\nin LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends\
    \ to broadcast data\nacross 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range.\
    \ Wireless audio streaming is\nprimarily made possible through BCR, which has\
    \ evolved into the industry-standard radio\nprotocol for in-car entertainment\
    \ systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to\ntransmit data over\
    \ 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the\ndeployment\
    \ of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support\n\
    for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most\
    \ notably,\nmesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution\
    \ and locating\nmaps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user\
    \ localization. Due to BLE’s\ngreater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial\
    \ changes in received signal strength,\nit has been proven that using BLE is more\
    \ efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].\nHowever, Bluetooth technology\
    \ has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly\nwhen its BR/EDR mode\
    \ is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the\nmaster nodes\
    \ to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.\n\
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered\
    \ a variety\nof scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the\
    \ BR/EDR mode reveals\na lack of scalability that further restricts the performance\
    \ of the system.\n4.3. LoRA\nThe LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications\
    \ and operated as a low-\ndata-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum\
    \ that could go up to 10 km.\nLoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth:\
    \ 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while\nthis technology can function at the largest\
    \ bandwidth class, which further improves data\nrate, it still causes issues with\
    \ high power consumption, a shorter communication range,\nand an increase in the\
    \ likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider\nfrequency\
    \ spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation\n\
    and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission\
    \ range\nwill expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption\
    \ will rise\nas well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby\
    \ making it resilient to\nchannel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not\
    \ differentiate the noise in the channel\nsuch as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK\
    \ modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes\nsignals that are 8 to 10 dB above\
    \ the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology\nto sense, perceive,\
    \ and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n26 of 63\narchitecture uses a star network topology and includes\
    \ gateways and end nodes. In this\ndesign, end nodes are referred to as slaves\
    \ and run on battery-powered devices with\nlimited power, but gateways are thought\
    \ of as powerful machines that gather data from\nslave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN\
    \ is a communication layer that operates on top of\nLoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates\
    \ the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability\nand suitability\
    \ for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over\ncellular\
    \ technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,\n\
    LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept\
    \ of\na specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types\
    \ to meet\nthe needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet\
    \ ﬁltering, and\npacket scheduling are all made possible using specialized network\
    \ servers. LoRaWAN\nhas also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission\
    \ power and rate, which\naids in optimizing network performance in terms of power\
    \ consumption and throughput.\nThis technology can be employed for a wide range\
    \ of applications, such as smart health\nnursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105],\
    \ agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],\nand smart grid applications\
    \ [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-\nsensitive\
    \ applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al.\
    \ [109]\nand Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart\
    \ metering,\ntracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time,\
    \ it is not so feasible for\nreal-time monitoring and video surveillance.\n4.4.\
    \ WiMAX\nWiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60\
    \ Mbps for an\nentire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely\
    \ uplink operation, based on\nthe original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard\
    \ (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-\nment [112]. It can be done using two\
    \ antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.\nAdditionally, it may provide support\
    \ for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-\nteristics and wide area\
    \ mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety\nof QoS\
    \ scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet\
    \ data\ntrafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video\
    \ streams [113].\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational\
    \ parameters [114].\nThis standard provides a communication channel between geographically\
    \ separated de-\nvices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges\
    \ between 30 km and\n100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such\
    \ as high installation costs\nand the possibility of complications and irregularities\
    \ when dealing with high-deﬁnition\nmultimedia trafﬁc.\nWireless network trafﬁc\
    \ has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-\nliferation of\
    \ smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with\n\
    smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices,\
    \ are\nthe most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In\
    \ such a dense\nnetwork environment, interference is a critical issue that must\
    \ be addressed if satisfactory\nperformance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency\
    \ reuse is required. Subsequently, the\nstandards IEEE 802.11 were designed and\
    \ implemented to support these requirements.\nNumerous international organizations,\
    \ including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved\ntheir technologies in response\
    \ to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,\nthe original IEEE\
    \ 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior\nthroughput\
    \ performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as\
    \ a\nresult, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a\
    \ result, to address\nthe challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah\
    \ Task Group (TG) was formed by\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to\
    \ redesign and extend the applicability\nof WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They\
    \ focused on the critical issue of power-aware\nefﬁcient schemes and protocols\
    \ to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based\nnetworks while\
    \ dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and\nindoor\
    \ devices [55,97].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n27 of 63\nTable 5. WiMAX standards\

    \ Protocol Suite\nIn IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique\
    \ features such as\nconstrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the\
    \ need for facilitating real-time\nrequirements of smart applications; extremely\
    \ vulnerable radio environments; and little to\nno human involvement after deployment\
    \ [115]. By enabling communication amongst these\ndevices utilizing low-power-cost\
    \ technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart\nservices has been formed.\
    \ Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might\nprovide a solution\
    \ and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication\nscenarios.\
    \ Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,\n\
    designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the\
    \ best way\nto install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally\
    \ use the system’s limited\nresources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of\
    \ such power constraints, researchers\nhighlighted the requirements of low-power\
    \ Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)\nand low-power WiFi usage. In\
    \ contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies\noperate with smaller\
    \ maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission\nspeeds. IoT network\
    \ protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining\nthe ideal\
    \ MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless\n\
    networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies.\
    \ This\nvulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:\n\
    (1)\nThe current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it\
    \ relies on\na multi-link subnet prototype) at all.\n(2)\nIn mesh communication,\
    \ the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are\nquite expensive,\
    \ power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely\npower constrained.\
    \ Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.\n(3)\nUnicasting\
    \ is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while\nforwarding\
    \ and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,\nidle\
    \ nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-\n\
    ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,\n\
    reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful\n\
    delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective\n\
    coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].\n(4)\nThere is a high requirement\
    \ for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-\ncation to take place\
    \ over mesh architectural systems.\n(5)\nFor many IoT applications requiring data\
    \ prioritizing and customized control, original\nTCP-suited features such as those\
    \ operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)\nthat further lead to silly\
    \ window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure\ndependability, are\
    \ unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard\nInternet protocols\
    \ such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize\nprotocol overheads\
    \ that impair the computing ability and memory management of\nthese specialized\
    \ resource-constrained devices.\nWiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling\
    \ support, which helps estab-\nlish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart\
    \ IoT devices. In smart home wireless\nnetworks, this form of connectivity can\
    \ be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP\nprotocol suite supports dependable\
    \ data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-\ntain network throughput\
    \ performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been\nregularly modiﬁed\
    \ and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of\nbyte-stream\
    \ in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency\n\
    needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP\
    \ protocol\nsuite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns\
    \ adequately [119].\nThere are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with\
    \ an IoT application:\n(1)\nTCP connection establishment and termination (three-way\
    \ handshaking) incur signiﬁ-\ncant overhead in the system as most communication\
    \ in an IoT application includes\nthe transmission of brief segments and relatively\
    \ little data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n29 of 63\n(2)\nTCP functionality needs\
    \ resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-\nnections\
    \ in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected\ndevices\
    \ switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].\n\
    (3)\nSome IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,\n\
    and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead\
    \ in the\nentire IoT system and high-power consumption.\n(4)\nSome IoT services\
    \ have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in\nthe form of connection\
    \ establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the\nentire MSS) is completely\
    \ unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to\nprovide much support\
    \ for these IoT services.\n(5)\nIoT applications that rely on wireless communication\
    \ scenarios must deal with crit-\nical wireless channel characteristics such as\
    \ channel error, interference, and wire-\nless interface properties that result\
    \ in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer\ncontention-induced, and collision-induced\
    \ packet losses. When TCP operates in such\na setting, its stringent in-order\
    \ delivery requirements and retransmission policies\n(i.e., fast retransmission)\
    \ may occasionally result in very serious system problems\nsuch as Head-of-Line\
    \ (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in\na reduction\
    \ in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].\nFurthermore,\
    \ wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-\nther impair\
    \ TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP\nRetransmission\
    \ Time Out timer.\nSome standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement\
    \ Layer-4\nfunctionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed\
    \ to utilize UDP as an\nunderlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should\
    \ depend on an application’s\nrequirements, which may vary from application to\
    \ application. However, TCP and its\nupdated variants rely on the concept of data\
    \ delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-\nmissions from an already created\
    \ copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only\napproach to dealing\
    \ with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to\naccept packet\
    \ delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-\n\
    tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution.\
    \ Additionally,\nretransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should\
    \ handle this retransmission\nrather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such\
    \ as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data\nbits, doing so enables the source\
    \ application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations\nwhere real-time\
    \ services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit\n\
    fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the\
    \ initial loss [126].\nClark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and\
    \ subsequently introduced the\nconcept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing\
    \ Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself\nbrings the idea of employing ALF into the\
    \ system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,\na network can recognize individual\
    \ Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently\ncan offer support for ﬂexible\
    \ Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission\nprocedures for\
    \ diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using\nin-network\
    \ caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding\n\
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails\
    \ to provide\nsupport for the ALF scheme [119].\n4.6. Compound TCP for IoT\nCompound\
    \ TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel\nutilization\
    \ and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with\n\
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].\nPokhrel and Williamson [115]\
    \ studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an\nIoT scenario involving\
    \ sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home\nappliances).\
    \ They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-\n\
    nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks\
    \ in the\npresence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded\
    \ transmission\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n30 of 63\nchannel circumstances. The\
    \ authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements\nfor all IoT devices\
    \ as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-\nhungry\
    \ Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a\n\
    thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical\n\
    devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly\n\
    deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested\
    \ models\nthat aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of\
    \ several concurrently\nrunning competitive long-lived compound TCP connections.\
    \ In evaluating and developing\nthese models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions,\
    \ link-layer contention, channel\nfailures, and collision. The authors of [130]\
    \ utilized a transient model suggesting a new\nqueue management scheme to capture\
    \ the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most\nworkable ﬂows in IoT scenarios)\
    \ over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.\nHowever, the performance\
    \ of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using\na single shared\
    \ Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and\n\
    provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when\
    \ wireless\nchannels are often reused by several APs [131].\n4.7. Viewpoints of\
    \ Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems\nThe network architectures for IoT are\
    \ heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless\nMesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular\
    \ Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks\n(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due\
    \ to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing\ndevices, survivability\
    \ and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A\nWSN\
    \ is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and\
    \ military\napplications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which\
    \ the sensor nodes\ncommunicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered,\
    \ low-power sensors\ncapable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating,\
    \ and regulating communication.\nNumerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2,\
    \ TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have\nbeen suggested. Therefore, some standards were\
    \ introduced to enable interaction and\nother compatibilities among these numerous\
    \ heterogeneous platforms. For example, the\nIEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates\
    \ the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide\ncritical functionalities\
    \ for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated\nEnd Devices\
    \ (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be\n\
    considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes.\
    \ Due\nto the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be\
    \ obtained from the\nviewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability\
    \ issue, various works\nsuggested a standardized arrangement that could enable\
    \ the usage of IP over LoWPAN.\nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability\
    \ for Low power and Lossy\nNetworks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard\
    \ outlines the physical and data link\nlayers of the network and offers a low-cost\
    \ framework for network operations. To link\nLPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may\
    \ be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors\nto implement an IP stack and\
    \ become approachable by other conventional devices over\nthe Internet. This adaptability\
    \ layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables\na variety of applications\
    \ and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding\nalgorithms at the\
    \ Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot\n\
    be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72]\
    \ considers\nthe LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained,\
    \ and they are\nconnected by some lossy links that only support low data rates.\
    \ These links are thought\nto be extremely unstable and have poor performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery rates. In\nsuch specialized networks, the trafﬁc\
    \ patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint\n(MP2MP) rather than just\
    \ P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.\nThis makes the\
    \ implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,\nnumerous\
    \ existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and\n\
    AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing\n\
    and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult\
    \ due to the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n31 of 63\nmobility aspect and the resource\
    \ limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’\ndesign principles\
    \ emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end\nlatency [134,135].\
    \ The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations\ntake\
    \ into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the\
    \ node\nenergy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and\
    \ maintain solely\ninside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible.\
    \ However, the interoperability\nof these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when\
    \ such networks are integrated with\nIoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration\
    \ with IoT needs novel routing policies\nthat support scalability and assure QoS,\
    \ fairness, and connectivity between two nodes\n(both in APs and ad-hoc networks)\
    \ with the least amount of power consumption. The\nstandard classical forwarding\
    \ strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of\ndevices/nodes. In\
    \ the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest\nenough\
    \ fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate\
    \ with\nnearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions\
    \ are followed\nto decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers\
    \ have often raised\nconcerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which\
    \ lead to the consumption of\nexcess energy in networks while taking into account\
    \ mobile and static ad-hoc network\nscenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood\
    \ of frequent network disconnections,\nroute failures, and even network partitioning,\
    \ all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant\nMAC-level and routing-level overhead\
    \ problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the\nhigh-power consumption problem,\
    \ many researchers presented numerous smart routing\nparadigms [118,134,135,137].\
    \ Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the\ndesired QoS.\n\
    Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion\n\
    control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless\
    \ channel\nattributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas.\
    \ These designs provide\nsupport for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely\
    \ variable channel parameters\nat lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing\
    \ and Transport layers to further\noptimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations\
    \ decisions [121,134,135,138–140].\nThe Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ indicates how well a device can hear a\nsignal from an AP or router. A network\
    \ layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the\nRSSI (accessible through\
    \ lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR\nare examples\
    \ of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding\n\
    systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing\
    \ mecha-\nnisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and\
    \ link disjoint paths\nwhile discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes\
    \ do not shed light and discuss\nanything related to performance issues when there\
    \ is a signiﬁcant level of interference in\nthe network because of trafﬁc running\
    \ parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned\ntechniques do not always perform\
    \ well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.\nRecently, the scheme [140]\
    \ considered different critical factors such as interference level,\nlink-layer\
    \ contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to\n\
    wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution\
    \ policies’\nefﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,\
    \ different possible\ndisjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might\
    \ be able to interfere\nwith one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting\
    \ behavior in wireless\ncommunication. Consequently, such separate disconnected\
    \ pathways could be utilized to\nenhance the performance of the network as a whole\
    \ [138,140].\nWhen employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend\
    \ on WSN-based\nnetworking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from\
    \ smart things to sink\nnodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes\
    \ (IoT-GW). To balance\nenergy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous\
    \ such static and mobile IoT-GWs\ncan be deployed in the system. In the whole\
    \ system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous\ntypes of critical data, are connected\
    \ to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed\nthree forms of devices:\
    \ Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2490\n32 of 63\nthree forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh.\
    \ Moreover, the Zigbee stack\nembraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the\
    \ case of star network topology, the\nReduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e.,\
    \ RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the\nPAN central coordinator only. They\
    \ are not capable of communicating with one another.\nHere, the PAN coordinator\
    \ may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on\nlow-powered limited\
    \ battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,\nany device\
    \ can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this\n\
    topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and\
    \ FFDs.\nFurthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of\
    \ the integrated\nforwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing\
    \ procedures. Lastly,\nthe tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of\
    \ mesh networking topology, consisting\nof RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators).\
    \ However, the FFD count could be\nmore than the RFD count in the network. RFDs\
    \ may attach to tree (cluster) network\ntopology as the end nodes in the system.\
    \ The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization\nfunctionalities to other connected\
    \ coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single\nPAN coordinator amongst\
    \ these coordinators [144].\n4.8. IoT Application Protocols\nEach IoT application\
    \ is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.\nThese protocols\
    \ can be the following:\n•\nRepresentational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is\nthe primary client/server protocol that\
    \ adopts the request/response model. HTPP has\nbeen related to the REST architecture\
    \ [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar\nentities over web-based services.\
    \ The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices\nto make their status readily\
    \ available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,\nupdate, delete)\
    \ functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,\nPUT, and DELETE\
    \ techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build\na REST model\
    \ for dissimilar IoT devices [148].\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately\nstandardized by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT\ndevices for IP-based, HTTP-like\
    \ interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-\nsages to set up reliable\
    \ communication based on a request/response interaction. It has\nreduced complexity,\
    \ and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications\nand machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) communication.\n•\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is\
    \ established for IoT messaging.\nAccording to MQTT design principles, network\
    \ bandwidth and device resource re-\nquirements should be kept to a minimum while\
    \ also aiming to assure dependability\nand some level of delivery assurance. Since\
    \ June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by\nISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The\
    \ protocol continues to progress by formalizing\npopular capability options and\
    \ adding new functionalities. The most recent version,\nMQTT v5.0, was released\
    \ in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe\nparadigm. Clients connect\
    \ to a centralized broker when using MQTT.\n•\nOpen Platform Communications Uniﬁed\
    \ Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-\nability standard is used for the\
    \ secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial\nautomation domain and\
    \ other industries. It is platform independent and ensures\nthe seamless ﬂow of\
    \ information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-\nports two different\
    \ communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as\nPublish/Subscribe\
    \ (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-\nquirements from\
    \ the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main\nIoT vendors\
    \ including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage\nsecure, standardized\
    \ information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on\nOPC UA.\n•\nExtensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is\n\
    based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n33 of 63\nit can implement both request/response and\
    \ publish/subscribe methods by using\nsuitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant\
    \ messages between clients, and this\nhappens in real-time using a push mechanism\
    \ to avoid increasing unnecessary network\nloads. XMPP also determines the state\
    \ of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.\n•\nAdvanced Message Queuing\
    \ Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing\nbusiness messages between\
    \ applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-\ntems, feeds business\
    \ processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits\nonward the\
    \ instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-\nlish/subscribe\
    \ interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of\nmessage orientation;\
    \ queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.\n•\nData Distribution\
    \ Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management\nGroup (OMG).\
    \ DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-\nperformance,\
    \ interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.\n\
    DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability\
    \ in publish–\nsubscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs\
    \ of various\nIoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed\
    \ using DDS. Such\napplications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems,\
    \ autonomous vehicles, and\nsmart grid management.\nLastly, Glaroudis et al. [155]\
    \ provided a comparison among IoT application protocols\nin terms of well-accepted\
    \ key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the\nframework\
    \ of smart farming.\n5. Networking Architectures and Protocols\n5.1. Generic Architectures\n\
    Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-\n\
    gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of\
    \ an IoT\nisland as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT,\
    \ two methods provide\ndata access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with\nshort-range communication among network nodes\
    \ using unlicensed frequency. The second\ninvolves using licensed frequency band\
    \ long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).\nCentenaro et al. [156] presented\
    \ a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-\nless connectivity)\
    \ called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based\non a star topology\
    \ characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in\nthe unlicensed\
    \ sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide\nconnectivity\
    \ in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed\n\
    the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,\n\
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled\
    \ SCA\nthat uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled\
    \ street\nlighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental\
    \ research\nfacility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander\
    \ supports testing\nproposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic\
    \ setting at an appropriate\nscale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is\
    \ a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana\nand Dohler [159] reviewed currently used\
    \ smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data\nloggers, wireless modems,\
    \ and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-\nment use cases,\
    \ i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount\n\
    of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways\n\
    cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control\
    \ model for\nM2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into\
    \ delay-sensitive\nand delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant\
    \ requests by routing them into\none low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the\
    \ number of requests from various devices\nto the access point in the IoT for\
    \ smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up\narchitecture after\
    \ analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four\n\
    layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates\n\
    security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the\
    \ bottom of the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n34 of 63\narchitecture, collects\
    \ data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above\nthe sensing\
    \ layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the\n\
    transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer\n\
    performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores\
    \ valuable\ninformation that various applications use at the application layer\
    \ to provide services.\nThe majority of the above works mainly focus on a single\
    \ characteristic, such as quality\nof service [162].\nMarques et al. [163] proposed\
    \ a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure\nmanagement architecture\
    \ that allows the integration of physical objects, communication\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cloud platform, and IoT-based services in a pervasive way. This architecture\n\
    (Figure 4) is generic and includes four layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication,\n\
    (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.\nElectronics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    35 of 63\nare processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing\
    \ unit\nresponsible for gathering information used by the application providing\
    \ a service.\nThe local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as\
    \ it pushes part of the\ncomputation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating\
    \ all the computation in\na centralized remote server.\n2.\nThe Communication\
    \ Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access\ntechnologies.\
    \ The communication layer supports the implementation of various\nwireless technologies.\
    \ The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer\ndeﬁnes the\
    \ technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using\nthe\
    \ interface of a network access point.\n3.\nThe Cloud Platform Layer provides\
    \ three services: processing, database queries, and\ndata storage. In the context\
    \ of providing services for smart cities, each of these services\ncan be dynamically\
    \ allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,\nonly some\
    \ applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.\n\
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation\n\
    is optional.\n4.\nThe Services Layer implements four groups, which are called\
    \ classes of services:\n(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III)\
    \ Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-\nnology. In each class, different kinds of applications\
    \ can be implemented to deal with\nthe challenges of smart cities.\nThis architecture\
    \ is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer\nsupport\
    \ to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-\n\
    tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to\
    \ a waste\nmanagement scenario.\nAnother multi-level smart city architecture [164]\
    \ was built on semantic web technolo-\ngies, and its design is mostly used in\
    \ smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data\ncollection, data processing,\
    \ integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make\nup its four layers.\
    \ Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]\n\
    suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects\
    \ privacy.\nSaadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile\
    \ object authentication in the\ncontext of IoT smart cities. Their architecture\
    \ is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-\narchical elliptic curve identity-based\
    \ signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]\npresented a Fog-based\
    \ smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network\n(FOCAN). To\
    \ reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with\nvarious\
    \ capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating\n\
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through\
    \ the smart\ncity environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT\
    \ device can deliver\nservices effectively and with less energy consumption.\n\
    5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach\
    \ to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-\ncient network conﬁguration to enhance a network.\
    \ SDN can provide many advantages\nfor conﬁguring city networks to support different\
    \ applications. For example, SDN can\nimprove the QoS of city networks against\
    \ link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-\nmands [170]. While some\
    \ efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there\nis room\
    \ for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN\nfor\
    \ efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri\
    \ et al. [171]\nconsidered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN,\
    \ and IoT technologies and\nreviewed different frameworks and platforms.\nLiu\
    \ et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications\n\
    from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers\
    \ manage\nphysical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission,\
    \ and processing services\nto develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173]\
    \ proposed a scalable SDN-enabled\narchitecture that integrates a variety of smart\
    \ city components and provides reliable and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n36 of\
    \ 63\ntimely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services.\
    \ They also studied\nthe time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS)\
    \ problem under this architecture\nand proposed a heuristic with an intelligent\
    \ scheme that can maximize the throughput and\nschedule the multi-ﬂow transfer\
    \ dynamically.\nIoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability,\
    \ integrity, and privacy\nthreats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative\
    \ and intelligent-network-based in-\ntrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture,\
    \ namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT\nnetworks. SeArch is a security architecture\
    \ in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS\nnodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS,\
    \ and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration\namong nodes.\n\
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy\
    \ in smart\ncities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network\
    \ architecture for the\nsmart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN\
    \ and Blockchain technologies. To\nachieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations,\
    \ their architecture is divided into\ncore and edge networks. By designing a hybrid\
    \ architecture, their architecture inherits\nthe strength of centralized and distributed\
    \ network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]\nis a Blockchain-based innovative\
    \ framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data\nsharing in a smart city\
    \ environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting\nthe blockchain\
    \ network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved\n\
    businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto,\
    \ smart\nenergy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain\
    \ access control rules\nthat regulate who has access to the users’ data within\
    \ a channel. In addition, private\ndata gathering and encryption are used to further\
    \ isolate and safeguard the data within\na channel.\nIslam et al. [178] designed\
    \ a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT\necosystem that addresses\
    \ the existing challenges through the use of the technologies\nBlockchain, SDN,\
    \ and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-\nture\
    \ confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,\n\
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.\n5.3. Architectures\
    \ for Smart Grid\nThe automated and intelligent management of the next-generation\
    \ electric power\nsystems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart\
    \ Grid (SG) is the name given to\nthe next generation of electricity systems,\
    \ which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts\nover the current systems in\
    \ terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-\nability,\
    \ and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies\n\
    to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric\n\
    devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate\
    \ their local\ndevices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented\
    \ by using the electrical and\ncommunication infrastructures that connect the\
    \ transmission and customer domains. The\ndistribution domain includes distribution\
    \ feeders and transformers to supply electricity.\nIt interacts with much different\
    \ equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),\nplug-in electric vehicles\
    \ (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with\ncommunication\
    \ capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity\n\
    to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality\
    \ electricity,\nthe stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.\nTypical\
    \ applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic\nmeter\
    \ reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.\n\
    DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution\
    \ system.\nDistributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination\
    \ of renewable\nand non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar\
    \ panels, wind turbines,\ncombustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems,\
    \ etc., are a few examples of DER.\nAn electric power system with one or more\
    \ DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    37 of 63\nThe communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities\
    \ of the\nsmart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure\
    \ connects a huge\nnumber of electric devices and manages complex device communications.\
    \ As a result, it is\nbuilt in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected\
    \ individual sub-networks, and each\nsub-network is responsible for separate geographical\
    \ regions. The extremely dispersed\nsmaller area networks that support the power\
    \ systems at various locations are connected by\nWANs, which act as the communication’s\
    \ backbone. When the control centers are located a\ngreat distance from the substations\
    \ or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at\nthe electric devices are\
    \ transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control\ncenters\
    \ to the electric devices.\nThe authors of [43] present a communication architecture\
    \ in an SG. This architecture\nincludes (1) an energy smart house with electric\
    \ appliances connected to the smart grid,\n(2) a residential complex with AMI,\
    \ (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,\n(4) a PEV charging\
    \ station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this\n\
    architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed\
    \ sub-\nnetworks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication\
    \ network\nstandards that have been established for smart grids and should be\
    \ considered in planning\nand implementing new infrastructures. Such standards\
    \ are IEC 61850 for substation\nautomation. This standard is based on open architecture\
    \ and incorporates sampling\nand timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on\
    \ IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].\nNotably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a\
    \ precision clock synchronization protocol for\nnetworked measurement and control\
    \ systems [182].\nDue to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)\
    \ throughout the\npower grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution\
    \ networks in smart grids would\nundergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the\
    \ nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the\nmost part, the low-voltage distribution\
    \ networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be\nattached are not monitored\
    \ by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-\nquisition (SCADA)\
    \ systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,\nAbdrabou\
    \ [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse\n\
    structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage\
    \ distribu-\ntion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also\
    \ presented as a useful\nmethod for prioritizing data transfer across the newly\
    \ introduced network architecture.\nHetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network\
    \ design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method\nfor power distribution grid applications.\
    \ It delivers QoS assurances across the network\nwhile taking into account three\
    \ factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors\ncreated two components\
    \ to accomplish this:\n•\nA multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical\
    \ applications for their high-\nreliability requirements by using end-to-end physically\
    \ disjoint paths, and\n•\nAltruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing\
    \ mechanism that targets communi-\ncation with QoS guarantees for applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.\nThe ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay\
    \ network architecture enables ex-\ntremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks.\nThe major characteristics that set\
    \ SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are\nthe ability to execute\
    \ two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time\npricing. The present\
    \ SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to\nbe protocol\
    \ independent. Therefore, global communication network management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network\nadministrators\
    \ may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane\n\
    from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication\n\
    networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency\n\
    and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and\
    \ protocols\nby virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity\
    \ capabilities to\ncope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185]\
    \ presented SDN-based\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n38 of 63\nSGC architectures,\
    \ along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-\nbased SGC\
    \ and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to\n\
    SDN-based SGC.\nAlam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication\
    \ networks in\nterms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,\
    \ and applications.\nThey proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication\
    \ Network for Smart Grid.\nCR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can\
    \ quickly reconﬁgure its operating\nparameters, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ compression algorithm, and error coding\ntechniques, according to changing circumstances\
    \ and requirements, through cognition. In\nsuch an SDR platform, radio transceivers\
    \ can switch functions and operations on demand\nonly. Molokomme et al. [187]\
    \ reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various\nand strict QoS requirements\
    \ in SG communication systems.\nWireless communication networks have been motivated\
    \ to harvest energy from\nambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic\
    \ and ecological beneﬁts\nthrough improvements in the smart power grid and the\
    \ advocacy of “green communica-\ntions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments\
    \ in energy harvesting, redistribution,\ntrade, and planning for future wireless\
    \ networks integrating with smart grids. The authors\nconsidered the optimization\
    \ of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-\ntional models\
    \ of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how\n\
    to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for\
    \ energy\nunder dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way\
    \ energy\ntrading using smart grids.\nFrom a different viewpoint, including IoT\
    \ devices and providing connectivity, au-\ntomation, and monitoring for such devices\
    \ enables SG systems to sustain multiple network\noperations during the generation,\
    \ distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.\nNumerous IoT-aided SG\
    \ systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on\nIoT-aided\
    \ SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.\n\
    5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings\nThere are various building applications\
    \ such as heating, cooling, load control, air\nquality, ventilation, lighting,\
    \ water management, and cooking gas management. A smart\nbuilding incorporates\
    \ the major building systems on a common network and functionality\nto provide\
    \ operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture\n\
    (SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,\n\
    air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation\n\
    and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management);\
    \ a\nsmart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart\
    \ building [190]\nhas security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality\
    \ system, a ﬁre alarm system, a\nwater management system, and an energy management\
    \ system. Moreover, it can detect\nintrusion and supports HVAC services.\nDiverse\
    \ SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication\ntechnologies.\
    \ Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-\n\
    vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices\
    \ driven\nthrough IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings.\
    \ Tradi-\ntionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking\
    \ protocols and\ncabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex\
    \ and highly infeasible\nfrom both a deployment and a system administration standpoint\
    \ [191]. SBAs entail making\nplans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational\
    \ technologies that improve the\napplication’s, service’s, or provision’s operational\
    \ steps while also boosting the well-being\nof its users. Researchers, policymakers,\
    \ and implementers should pay attention to several\ncrucial issues, such as reliable\
    \ communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient\nmeasures, competent security\
    \ measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-\nics procedures.\
    \ Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)\ntechnologies\
    \ to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n39 of 63\ndeployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc\
    \ engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-\nputing paradigms; big data\
    \ engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction\nprocedures [192].\
    \ The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-\nedness\
    \ of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical\n\
    entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology\n\
    have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies\
    \ for\na particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including\
    \ heterogeneity\nof IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols\
    \ and architectures, power\nefﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One\
    \ solution is the SDN paradigm, which\nmanages the network more efﬁciently than\
    \ a customary one. SDN also assists network\nservices, including storage, routing,\
    \ dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,\nthese simpliﬁcations offer a\
    \ creative environment through the implementation of proper\nsoftware tools for\
    \ smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-\ntelligent\
    \ infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation\n\
    and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based\
    \ on\nSDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves\
    \ critical SB\nparameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency,\
    \ security, and reliability.\nSilva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT)\
    \ SBA that is integrated with the repre-\nsentational state transfer (RESTful)\
    \ application programming interface (API). The RESTful\nAPI employs HTTP requests\
    \ (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT\ndata. Regarding network\
    \ performance and smart building power management, the authors\nshowed how their\
    \ recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.\nSmart sensing\
    \ devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or\nmodifying\
    \ vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These\n\
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.\
    \ These sys-\ntems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms,\
    \ power, and transceiver\nmodules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based\
    \ SBAs for assessing and regulat-\ning air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre\
    \ detection systems, power management, and\nother basic building operations.\n\
    An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for\n\
    monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing\n\
    system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature,\
    \ and\nrelative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198].\
    \ Con-\nsidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed\
    \ in the\nliterature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system\
    \ to satisfy the users’\nneeds. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption\
    \ reduction via energy-efﬁcient\nsmart lighting systems. Today’s smart building\
    \ employs low-power usage LED-based\nlight sources that last longer than Compact\
    \ Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the\ndevelopment of control technologies,\
    \ heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems\nhas made it promising to create\
    \ smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively\naddress the problem\
    \ of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by\nintegrating\
    \ different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved\n\
    energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user\
    \ satisfac-\ntion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors,\
    \ as opposed to a\nsingle expensive sensor, would result in improved performance\
    \ and higher power savings.\nConsidering the same motivation, various authors\
    \ [202–204] have suggested similar types\nof smart lighting systems for several\
    \ room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],\nthe authors provide a\
    \ deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing\non power\
    \ savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration\
    \ of\nvisible light communication technology [206].\nRecently, researchers focused\
    \ on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-\nmance and thermal comfort,\
    \ to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented\nTechnologies (OOT)\
    \ have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal\ncomfort while\
    \ conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n40 of 63\ndrawbacks of the automatic control used today. In\
    \ practice, thermal comfort analysis is\nbased on parallel objective and subjective\
    \ evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises\nmonitoring, assessing, and recording\
    \ the status of environmental parameters through dedi-\ncated sensors and instruments\
    \ following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation\ninvolves monitoring,\
    \ assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and\nthermal\
    \ environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative\n\
    method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].\nGreen building\
    \ refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to\npredetermined\
    \ circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes\n\
    full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently\n\
    allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence\
    \ concept aims\nto conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of\
    \ them to offer comfort to the\noccupants. Through unconventional energy sources,\
    \ it also meets some of the conventional\nenergy requirements [207]. Many aspects\
    \ of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and\npower efﬁciency, are the subject\
    \ of extensive study. However, one of the most important\nfunctions of an SB system\
    \ is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by\nHVAC systems\
    \ [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial\nbuildings\
    \ for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for\
    \ this\ncontext. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of\
    \ rated fan energy\ncan be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect\
    \ on a building’s indoor\ntemperature. The method of computational control for\
    \ passive and active sources was\nused in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized\
    \ the problem that the ambient and\nactive sources of lighting, heating, ventilation,\
    \ cooling, and shading are not synchronized\nin buildings. Such a computational\
    \ control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power\nusage. Similarly,\
    \ numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been\nproposed with\
    \ respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.\n\
    An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes\n\
    when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-\n\
    tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed\n\
    times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed\
    \ spaces)\nthan outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved\
    \ along with that of the\nexternal surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air\
    \ Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).\nThe basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are\
    \ a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal\nconditioning circuit, a\
    \ small amount of external memory, and a communication module\nthat is typically\
    \ wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can\n\
    detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and\
    \ O3, as\nwell as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and\
    \ temperature. These\nsensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values\
    \ of the real-time indoor air quality\nparameters and an external memory used\
    \ to store real-time data [214]. When deploying\nsuch systems, various communication\
    \ (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and\nLoRAWAN technologies, are considered.\n\

    \ IoT and BI stakeholders\nmust make a concerted effort to give modern BI access\
    \ to a generic IoT framework with\ncognitive intelligence and context-aware computing\
    \ capabilities.\n5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring\nRetroﬁtting\
    \ the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some\nbeneﬁts,\
    \ including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].\n\
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert\
    \ utilities\nto pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network,\
    \ allowing them to remotely\nadjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224].\
    \ Automation can be used for both\noperational procedures and components that\
    \ provide functionality. For instance, when a\nwater problem occurs during operation\
    \ or with the element itself, the smart components\ninform the system center and\
    \ then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also\ndetermine a sensor’s\
    \ requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic\nself-veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism [225].\nIn [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid\
    \ architecture that includes\ntechnical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework.\
    \ Moreover, this smart water\nsystem (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms,\
    \ simulation procedures, diag-\nnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control\
    \ mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-\nporates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance\
    \ is deﬁned by online procedures such\nas online data monitoring, online data\
    \ assimilation, online modeling, online charting,\nand online results output.\
    \ An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the\nnecessary smart features\
    \ [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-\nter systems\
    \ that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time\n\
    controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system\
    \ output,\nshould be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered\
    \ that using SCADA\nwould considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229].\
    \ A smart water architec-\nture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical\
    \ layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;\n(3) the communication layer; (4)\
    \ the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.\nWithin the framework\
    \ of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system\nthat allows\
    \ for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a\n\
    user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are\
    \ saved\nand processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and\
    \ the individual user level.\nMeanwhile, the processed data are returned to the\
    \ Water Utility and can be used for billing.\nOn the other hand, they provide\
    \ regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness\nof their consumption\
    \ behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework\nbased on\
    \ FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-\n\
    ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of\
    \ various\nFIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis\
    \ et al. [232]\nconsidered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding\
    \ conventional water\nmetering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted\
    \ bi-directional (whenever re-\nquired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices,\
    \ metering equipment, and end-users.\nThe authors’ ultimate objective is to design,\
    \ implement, and deploy more sophisticated\ninfrastructure offering improved performance\
    \ in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit\nthe amount of data that needs\
    \ to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-\nproach makes use\
    \ of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water\ngrid\
    \ model.\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the\
    \ Efﬁcient\nWater Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission\
    \ under the\nauspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the\
    \ Smart Water project is\nto examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively\
    \ managing urban water systems,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n44 of 63\nwith a\
    \ focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related\n\
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues\
    \ such as\nleakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.\
    \ Kulkarni\nand Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,\
    \ proposed\na framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost\
    \ of ownership, and\nhighlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’\
    \ Smart Water case studies.\nPipelines are used to transport water, gases, and\
    \ oil. Since they are frequently under-\nground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes\
    \ them, which may result in leaks. In addition,\nwater in the pipelines may get\
    \ contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are\nmistakenly or purposely\
    \ introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline\nnetworks is crucial\
    \ for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-\nsor\
    \ node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline\n\
    network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection\
    \ time.\nThe sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s\
    \ junctions [234].\nGiven the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor\
    \ node deployment challenges\nare therefore formulated as integer optimization\
    \ problems, where the integer variables\nrepresent the maximum amount of sensor\
    \ nodes that must be placed at each junction. The\ndeployment difﬁculties for\
    \ pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve\nbecause of the\
    \ integer decision variables.\nPipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a\
    \ result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,\nthe sensing performance of a deployed\
    \ sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern\nis taken into account in\
    \ [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to\ndecide how to\
    \ deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious\n\
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a\
    \ branch\nand bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify\
    \ the ideal answer,\nthe time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that\
    \ large pipeline networks cannot\nbe used with the method. Similarly, the study\
    \ in [236] considers the various demand\npatterns of water ﬂows through pipes.\
    \ The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the\nbest deployment locations\
    \ to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand\npatterns. The\
    \ global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.\n\
    The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.\n\
    Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.\nSingapore’s\
    \ WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate\nburst incidents\
    \ [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline\n\
    leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure.\
    \ To\nreduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track\
    \ water\nconsumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System\
    \ [240] has been\ncreated to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks\
    \ and bottlenecks. With the\naid of all these technologies, the investigators\
    \ had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency\nof the monitoring algorithms.\
    \ However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we\nstill need to put\
    \ innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and\nmobile\
    \ WSN into place.\n5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation\nThe Internet-of-Vehicles\
    \ (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion\nand accidents. It\
    \ also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities\nthat\
    \ may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the\
    \ two\ntechnologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that\
    \ compose\nvehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and\
    \ mobile network.\nVANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication.\
    \ Providing remote loca-\ntion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information\
    \ services is referred to as an\nonboard information service. Every car can be\
    \ utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks\nto mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence\
    \ is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\
    \ big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n45 of 63\n(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people\
    \ and vehicles, as well as between\nvehicles and the environment, infrastructure,\
    \ or other vehicles.\nVehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and\
    \ inter-vehicle communica-\ntion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible\
    \ layered architecture to handle\ncharacteristics such as interoperability, scalability,\
    \ dependability, and modularity. Recently,\nthe research community proposed efﬁcient\
    \ vehicle network architectures. For example,\nthe Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture\
    \ [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and\nchoosing messaging protocols\
    \ are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-\ncessing, big\
    \ data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia\n\
    and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s\
    \ ClCom and\ncloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms,\
    \ infrastructure, and\nsoftware services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication\
    \ layer and the intra–inter\ndevices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity\
    \ of many heterogeneous objects\nand networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter\
    \ devices layer in classical architecture. The\nUIoV system’s physical objects\
    \ layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter\ndevices layer for\
    \ additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are\n\
    identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.\nLiu et al. [242] suggested another IoV\
    \ network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of\napplication management while\
    \ enhancing the scalability and dependability of information\nservices. This architecture\
    \ has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety\nof nodes with\
    \ various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV\nis frequently\
    \ changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-\nmitted\
    \ at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,\n\
    the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,\n\
    communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road\
    \ safety\nmanagement and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible\
    \ for schedul-\ning the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and\
    \ interacting with the application\nlayer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture\
    \ design is dealing with diverse networks.\nInteroperability, scalability, dependability,\
    \ and adaptability are some of its network features.\nThe design seeks to increase\
    \ layer separation and network architecture’s total number of\nlayers. In addition\
    \ to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate\n\
    the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.\n\
    By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning\
    \ ability\nof autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both\
    \ physical and network\ndata space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV)\
    \ paradigm [243] improves network\nsecurity and transportation safety. CIoV enables\
    \ IoV to bear more accurate perceptive\nability through cognition in the intra-vehicle\
    \ network (driver, passengers, smart devices,\netc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent\
    \ intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network\n(road environment, cellular\
    \ network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture\nincludes a\
    \ cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of\n\
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road\
    \ condition\ninvestigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture\
    \ of CIoV. The gathering\nand preprocessing of big data from several sources are\
    \ done by the sensing layer. As\nopposed to the previous communication layer (of\
    \ other architectures), the architecture’s\ncommunication layer uses a cloud/edge\
    \ hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-\ntion schedules. The data cognition\
    \ engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets\nheterogeneous data streams\
    \ (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety\nof cognitive\
    \ analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in\ncharge\
    \ of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies\
    \ such\nas NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There\
    \ are primar-\nily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application\
    \ services and intelligent\ntransportation applications).\nEfﬁcient message authentication\
    \ and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-\nvacy and safeguard vehicular\
    \ communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n46 of 63\nin the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats,\
    \ Karim [244] provided\na cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes\
    \ a data encryption and de-\ncryption mechanism based on attributes and identity\
    \ that has the lowest computational\noverhead while keeping the optimum level\
    \ of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]\nsuggested a seven-layer network\
    \ architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-\nmation exchange\
    \ between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units\n\
    (RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing\n\
    and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data\
    \ before\nsending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission.\
    \ Making\nchoices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities\
    \ of control and\nmanagement. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing\
    \ layer to create\nthe pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop\
    \ assaults, the security layer\ndirectly manages each of the layers above. A unique\
    \ network architecture with enhanced\nthroughput, reduced latency, higher security,\
    \ and widespread connectivity was recently\nproposed by Ji et al. [246]. This\
    \ architecture consists of four layers:\n1.\nSecurity authentication layer: The\
    \ RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment\ndata in real-time after setting\
    \ several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This\nlayer determines the\
    \ legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.\nPerhaps\
    \ an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt\n\
    to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.\n2.\nData acquisition layer:\
    \ This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from\nvarious networks.\
    \ To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it\ndigitizes\
    \ the data.\n3.\nEdge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result,\
    \ processing and\nanalyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant\
    \ delays. As a result, we\nmust process data more closely related to the data\
    \ source. The edge node, a physical\ndevice situated closest to the data source,\
    \ is used by the edge layer to carry out basic\nprocessing and analysis on the\
    \ acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings\nfor nearby trafﬁc incidents\
    \ and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a\nlocal decision-making\
    \ plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud\ndata center’s\
    \ computing power.\n4.\nCloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the\
    \ information it has collected\nabout global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan,\
    \ and rationally distributes trafﬁc\nresources. This layer, having the ability\
    \ to implement connection management, data\nmanagement, aided autonomous driving,\
    \ intelligent navigation, path planning, and\ninformation security, is the “smart\
    \ brain” of the IoV.\nA blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)\
    \ for the smart city was\npresented in [247]. Building innovative distributed\
    \ transport management systems is made\npossible by the robust and secure Block-VN\
    \ architecture. The authors considered how the\nnetwork of vehicles evolves with\
    \ paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-\ntion. To handle real-time\
    \ transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing\ntransportation\
    \ data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four\nlayers:\
    \ data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application.\
    \ Each\nlayer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the\
    \ data processing\nlayer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing\
    \ the suggested event and\ndecision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249],\
    \ the data are made available\nto a smart community member. The suggested approach\
    \ was examined using transporta-\ntion datasets from some reliable sources. The\
    \ outcomes demonstrate data processing and\nreal-time distribution to citizens\
    \ in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop\nenvironment produces\
    \ ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social\nIoV (SIoV)\
    \ are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes\n\
    share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable\
    \ with\ntraditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware\
    \ communication\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n47 of 63\narchitecture for social\
    \ IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and\ninter-vehicle\
    \ communication architecture for SIoVs.\n5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart\
    \ Villages\nThe smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities\
    \ using IoT\ntechnologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried\
    \ out, including smart\nagriculture, waste management, irrigation management,\
    \ livestock management, smart\nenergy, smart healthcare, and smart education.\
    \ A smart village or smart rural area can\nenable real-time data analytics and\
    \ automate decision-making for local villagers regard-\ning healthcare, agriculture,\
    \ environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a\nsmart city as there\
    \ are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)\nbetween\
    \ urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-\n\
    pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to\
    \ interfere\nICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning\
    \ of “smart” in\nrural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European\
    \ Commission-funded\nSmart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal\
    \ of encouraging and motivat-\ning communities to create and execute smart village\
    \ methods and tactics throughout\nEurope as a tool for rural development, serving\
    \ as the authors’ primary source. IEEE\nSmart Village [256] also supports the\
    \ world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-\nviding a complete solution\
    \ combining renewable energy, community-based education, and\nentrepreneurial\
    \ opportunities.\nMalik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart\
    \ villages with different\ntechnologies. They concluded that digitization is only\
    \ possible if a reliable and robust net-\nwork and communication infrastructure\
    \ are installed in the village environment. Shrestha\nand Drozdenko [258] proposed\
    \ a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate\nchange using IoT\
    \ and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University\ncampus.\
    \ Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-\n\
    ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It\
    \ consists of\nthe following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud\
    \ Services, and a Web\nDashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into\
    \ meaningful information from\nwhich public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to\
    \ or frustrate the effects of climate change.\nMonzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban\
    \ [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural\nsystem for gathering and\
    \ processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional\ncommunication\
    \ coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in\n\
    separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).\
    \ Their\nproposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs\
    \ of the system in the\ncollection of IoT data from these remote rural areas,\
    \ its coverage by space vehicles, and its\nprocessing and storage through 5G terrestrial\
    \ networks and cloud services. Their proposal\nincludes the deployment of IoT\
    \ sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.\nConversely, the part of\
    \ the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for\ndifferent space\
    \ channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural\nsystem\
    \ that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet.\
    \ To\nprovide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored\
    \ the integration\nof a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with\
    \ IoT in improving security\nand privacy solutions for villagers and consumer\
    \ electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,\nthe authors designed and evaluated\
    \ the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nin a DFC-based smart\
    \ village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues\nand challenges\
    \ regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed\n\
    a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints\
    \ in a smart\nvillage. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge\
    \ computing as applicable\nto reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural\
    \ facilities. Collaboration occurs\nbetween the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g.,\
    \ the edge data centers or edge routers) for data\nprocessing and storage. For\
    \ example, in times of high computational load demand, one\nvillage’s edge devices\
    \ can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n48 of 63\n6. Summary\n•\nVarious SCAs have different network requirements\
    \ such as bandwidth, delay toler-\nance, power consumption, reliability, wireless\
    \ connectivity, mobility, security, and\nprivacy. Therefore, they need different\
    \ protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network\narchitectures for IoT are heterogeneous\
    \ and include various network technologies such\nas WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless\
    \ Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile\nCommunication Networks (MCNs)\
    \ (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these\narchitectures must allow interoperability,\
    \ while cross-layer design-based recommen-\ndations for power consumption and\
    \ congestion control are well-suited proposals.\n•\nState-of-the-art generic network\
    \ architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm\nand are based on FogC\
    \ to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.\n•\nFog\
    \ and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the\n\
    future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication\n\
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency.\
    \ The\nCR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this\
    \ technology can\nquickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication\
    \ system to the\nchanging requirements through cognition.\n•\nBy extracting usable\
    \ data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible\nto increase\
    \ network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures\n\
    will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines\
    \ that\nwill conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g.,\
    \ driving behavior\nmodel analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.\n\
    •\nThe networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of\
    \ smart\nbuildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been\
    \ facing some\nchallenges such as network management in terms of maintenance,\
    \ east–west interface,\nsouthbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based\
    \ SDN networking for SB,\nand the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.\n\
    7. Open Research Issues\n−Network slicing management is required: IoT services\
    \ such as smart transportation and\nsmart energy have diversiﬁed requirements.\
    \ To accommodate diverse IoT services, the\nnetwork slicing paradigm is suggested\
    \ because it enables multiple independent logical\nnetworks running on the same\
    \ physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented\nan architecture for\
    \ intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nfocusing\
    \ on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).\
    \ The\nauthors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing\
    \ management\nin this ﬁeld.\n−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The\
    \ ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation\nGroup proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions\
    \ that were before performed\nby some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the\
    \ ﬂexible provisioning of software-\nbased network functionalities on top of an\
    \ appropriately shared physical infrastructure by\nseparating the network functions\
    \ from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing\ninexpensive commodity\
    \ servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with\nadministering\
    \ and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is\nused in\
    \ conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome\n\
    the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic\
    \ resource\nmanagement [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service\
    \ environment through\nNFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and\
    \ labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll\na new service request is avoided. In conjunction\
    \ with the use of SDN, NFV also allows\nreal-time and dynamic function provisioning\
    \ along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The\nSDN-IoT network may be improved and\
    \ secured with NVF. It enables the software-based\ndeployment of network devices\
    \ as virtualized components. Throughput is increased\nbecause of NFV integration\
    \ in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.\nTo this end, Sinh\
    \ et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n49 of 63\nSDN controller applications to show that\
    \ SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.\nRecently, Mukherjee et al. [265]\
    \ proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV\nimplementation for smart\
    \ cities.\n−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology\
    \ can address the\nbandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can\
    \ be enabled with cognitive\nfunctionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic\
    \ spectrum accessing, circumstantial\nperceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs\
    \ and services can be based on CR technology\nbecause it can do dynamic sensing\
    \ and cognition of the surrounding environment. For\nexample, in smart grid applications,\
    \ cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling\nusers to know their energy\
    \ consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-\nplications, cognitive-radio-equipped\
    \ sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network\ninterference [268]. At the\
    \ same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-\ntoring over\
    \ longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum\n\
    availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in\
    \ IoT demands\nextensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware\
    \ design, privacy\nprotection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility\
    \ problems, etc. [270].\nFor this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures\
    \ must be proposed to\nsolve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271]\
    \ suggested a CIoT-based smart city\nnetwork architecture that outlines how data\
    \ collected from SCAs may be analyzed using\nthe CogC paradigm and manage the\
    \ scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.\n−Challenges in IoT communication through\
    \ TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access\nPoints (APs) can utilize identical\
    \ WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-\nence problems that\
    \ can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many\nAPs can\
    \ provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with\n\
    the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY\n\
    layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the\
    \ capacity\nof WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations.\
    \ As a result, it\nis possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to\
    \ the number of antennas on APs.\nThus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel\
    \ and Singh [131] stressed the employment\nof CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods\
    \ with many APs to improve the Compound\nTCP’s performance in wide-area Industry\
    \ 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate\nthe learning processes of the\
    \ transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training\ndata are dispersed\
    \ across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-\natively\
    \ slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized\n\
    model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to\
    \ coordinate\nnumerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel\
    \ characteristics and\nWiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use\
    \ of FL and CR approaches in\ndual AP settings, it is now possible to improve\
    \ the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.\nAnother study [274] assumed TCP Cubic\
    \ [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the\nFL approach for IoVs. The\
    \ authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL\ntechnique, which\
    \ enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.\n−Digital\
    \ Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-\n\
    dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital\
    \ twin technology\ncan be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans,\
    \ IoT devices, aircraft en-\ngines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original\
    \ vehicle is created, for instance, when\nan automobile business creates a virtual\
    \ representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car\nmodel. If a manufacturer\
    \ creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the\nreplicated\
    \ process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle\
    \ of\nthe actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this\
    \ virtual graphic, the\ndynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation\
    \ are depicted. The digital twin\ncan offer the location, state, and/or status\
    \ of physical assets in real-time due to continual\nlearning and advancements.\
    \ This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations\nto monitor\
    \ systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital\
    \ twins\nare created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure\
    \ graphs,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n50 of 63\nAI, software analytics, and the\
    \ IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is\ndemonstrated. This\
    \ technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to\nthe optimization\
    \ of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting\n\
    them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.\
    \ If a digital twin\nis in place, government organizations can only fully assess\
    \ what might be achieved with\nthe data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic\
    \ opportunity, and establish a more cohesive\ncommunity. Although the idea is\
    \ currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few\nyears [277].\n\
    −The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense\
    \ and\nAI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc\
    \ is estimated in\nthe future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted\
    \ to the concept of Internet of\nEverything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart\
    \ cities should have a huge bandwidth, low\nlatency, and AI integration. Such\
    \ networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and\non-demand content for\
    \ thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the\nproblem-solving\
    \ network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is\nunder\
    \ development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data\n\
    networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular\
    \ networks,\nin which the service area is divided into small geographical areas\
    \ (cells). It is expected that\n6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures\
    \ such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,\ntogether with new infrastructure. The\
    \ network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:\n(1) ultra-fast data rates\
    \ as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased\n\
    mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects;\
    \ (5) peak\nspectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability;\
    \ and (7) improved network\nsecurity [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is\
    \ that transmitting at a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss,\
    \ making the distance for transmission limited [280].\nThe expected 6G of the\
    \ radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the\ncapability\
    \ of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability\
    \ of\ncarrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks,\
    \ such as short-\nrange and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can\
    \ introduce complications\nand hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ such complications of THz waves\nmust be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric\
    \ multilayer physical network architectures of 6G\nmust be proposed for futuristic\
    \ smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations\nfrom a network\
    \ of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed\na conceptual\
    \ terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a\n\
    scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart\
    \ cities. It\nprovides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to\
    \ run AI applications\npartially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore,\
    \ the distributed and edge\ncomputing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides\
    \ security and reduces trafﬁc load on\nthe upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly,\
    \ pervasive AI is the main enabling technology\nin 6G, while some forms of AI\
    \ are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of\nusing AI on wireless\
    \ communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs\n(e.g., channel\
    \ estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control\n\
    and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell\
    \ and\ntopology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc.\
    \ However,\nDL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might\
    \ not ﬁt in current\nmobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN)-based\nRL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease\
    \ the computational resources required\non these devices [282]. Quantum communication\
    \ [283] offers a promising approach to\navoiding the challenge of limited computational\
    \ resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also\
    \ comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy\nand computational/energy\
    \ requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above\nissues and\
    \ envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous\n\
    systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies\
    \ are as follows:\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n51 of 63\n•\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent\
    \ Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places\nwhere maintaining\
    \ Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on\ndoors, windows,\
    \ and buildings.\n•\nCell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with\na more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further\
    \ developed in 6G\nto include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free\
    \ Massive MIMO im-\nproves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there\
    \ are some health risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs.\n•\nCubeSat\
    \ communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class\n\
    spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up\
    \ to 6U,\nand U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units.\n•\nUAVs/satellite communication.\n\
    •\nTerahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology [290] and quantum communication [283].\nThe development of futuristic\
    \ smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-\nefﬁcient 6G communication.\
    \ Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for\nenergy-efﬁcient 6G\
    \ wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application\nof IoT\
    \ devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency\
    \ rate,\nup to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000\
    \ GHz frequency.\nThis will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other\
    \ concerns in conventional\ncommunication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ 6G in smart cities via IoT\ndevices probably will solve various problems that\
    \ are encountered by existing smart city\nsystems. In futuristic smart cities,\
    \ residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer\ninterface (BCI) technology\
    \ [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals\nand information\
    \ that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and\ndevices.\
    \ It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.\n\
    As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises\
    \ ﬁve\ndatasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction\
    \ with the\nmachine [292].\n8. Conclusions\nUtilizing resources efficiently, reducing\
    \ operating expenses, and enhancing city\ndwellers’ quality of life are the objectives\
    \ of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-\ntained by combining various technologies\
    \ including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big\ndata analytics, and robots. For this\
    \ model, the effective networking and communication\nbetween the many components\
    \ required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its\nobjectives. The\
    \ ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable\nplatforms\
    \ for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,\n\
    and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined\n\
    in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different\
    \ system\nlevels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking\
    \ protocols\nand smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart\
    \ transportation system\narchitectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a\
    \ variety of networking designs, such as\nenergy savings, routing, security, dependability,\
    \ mobility, and support for heterogeneous\nnetworks. In addition, we presented\
    \ open research issues.\nThis survey can assist researchers to recognize research\
    \ gaps/problems working in the\nnetworking architectures for smart cities, and\
    \ it provides an overview of available protocols\nand architectures for SCAs.\n\

    \ \n\"Things\" that are part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) are equipped\
    \ with sensors, software, and network \nconnectivity, giving them the ability\
    \ to gather and share data with one another and with other devices. The \nongoing\
    \ digital transformation is taking place in many different domains, including\
    \ medical, industry, \ntransportation, and urban planning[1]. Connected devices\
    \ and their networks are important to this \ntransformation. This response will\
    \ concentrate on the architecture, applications, and future directions of \npotential\
    \ development of IoT networks.The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes\
    \ a network of actual \nphysical objects that are linked to the internet and are\
    \ capable of exchanging data and information with one \nanother. These items,\
    \ often known as \"smart devices,\" have sensors, software, and network connectivity\
    \ that \nenable data collection and transmission[2]. Healthcare, industry, transportation,\
    \ and smart cities are just a few of \nthe sectors being transformed by IoT networks.IoT\
    \ networks are becoming more and more significant as \nbusinesses all over the\
    \ world continue to utilize this technology to increase operational effectiveness,\
    \ cut costs, \nand improve customer experience[3]. Over the coming years, the\
    \ global IoT industry is anticipated to expand \nrapidly, increasing in size to\
    \ an estimated $1.5 trillion by 2030.This study paper's main goal is to give a\
    \ \nthorough review of IoT networks, covering its design, uses, and prospects.\
    \ Also, this study will emphasize the \ndrawbacks and restrictions of IoT networks\
    \ as well as how they may affect future studies. The reader will have a \nbetter\
    \ knowledge of the potential of IoT network. \nTurkish Journal of Computer and\

    Review of Literature \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) , is an enabling technologies,\
    \ and potential uses. The authors highlight the obstacles \nand prospects in this\
    \ field while discussing the many components of the IoT, such as sensors, communication\
    \ \nnetworks, and data processing systems.The benefits and drawbacks of the IoT\
    \ are explored in this study, along \nwith concerns about privacy, security, and\
    \ standardization. The authors in [4], present an overview of the several \nIoT\
    \ technologies and talk about why it's important for them to work together.The\
    \ vision, architectural aspects, \nand future directions of the IoT are all discussed\
    \ in this article. The authors in [5]present an overview of the \nsupporting technologies,\
    \ including sensors, wireless networks, and cloud computing, and examine the different\
    \ \nIoT applications, such as healthcare, smart homes, and transportation.This\
    \ study examines all aspects of the IoT, \nfrom its definition and structure to\
    \ its potential uses. The writers highlight the challenges and potential in the\
    \ \nfield of IoT and cover its many subjects and developments, such as data analytics,\
    \ security, and standards.The \nauthors in [6], we'll look at the parallels and\
    \ differences between WSNs and the Internet of Things. The authors \ngive a rundown\
    \ of the technologies—sensors, wireless networks, and data processing systems—that\
    \ make \nWSNs and the Internet of Things possible, and then describe their many\
    \ uses in fields like medicine, smart \nhomes, and agriculture.The authors in\
    \ [7], we'll look at how effective resource management is essential to the \n\
    growth of cloud-based vehicle networks. The authors offer a resource management\
    \ paradigm for vehicular \nnetworks in the cloud and then analyze the many issues\
    \ and potential solutions that arise in this setting.The \nauthors in [8]Big data\
    \ analytics and the Internet of Things are discussed in this article and how they\
    \ can be used \nto build smart and connected neighborhoods. The authors in [9]provide\
    \ an in-depth analysis of the potential and \nthreats associated with the Internet\

    \ \nTable 1. Comparative Study of Various Techniques used for IoT System \n \n\
    III. \nArchitecture of IoT Networks \nIoT networks are made up of a variety of\
    \ parts that cooperate to make it possible to gather, process, and transmit \n\
    data. An IoT network's essential elements include: \nA. Definition and components\
    \ of IoT networks \ni. \nDevices: These are actual physical things with processors,\
    \ sensors, and network connectivity. Smart \nhousehold appliances, wearable fitness\
    \ trackers, commercial machinery, and environmental sensors are \na few examples\
    \ of IoT gadgets. \nii. \nSensors: Sensors are used to collect data from the physical\
    \ environment, such as temperature, \nhumidity, pressure, or position. A wide\
    \ range of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nmicrophones, and cameras,\
    \ can be used by IoT networks. \niii. \nActuators: These parts are used to change\
    \ the environment in response to information gathered by \nsensors. For instance,\
    \ an IoT network may employ actuators to modify a room's temperature or turn on\
    \ \nand off lighting. \niv. \nNetwork Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected\
    \ to a network to transmit data. Many network \ntechnologies, such as Wi-Fi, cellular\
    \ networks, and Bluetooth, can be used to do this. \nTurkish Journal of Computer\
    \ and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2070 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \nv. \nData processing is necessary\
    \ in order to make use of the data that IoT devices collect. This can be \ndone\
    \ on the device itself, on a nearby edge device, or on the cloud. Data analysis,\
    \ aggregation, and \nfiltering are all examples of processing. \nvi. \nStorage:IoT\
    \ networks may store, process, and analyse data using cloud services. These can\
    \ include \nservices for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. \n\
    vii. \nApplications: Software applications can be used by IoT networks to let\
    \ users interact with and manage \nthe network. These can include mobile or web\
    \ tools that let consumers access and keep tabs on data \ncoming from their Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. \nviii. \nSecurity: IoT networks need to be secure\
    \ to avoid unauthorized access or modification of data. These \nmay include threat\
    \ detection technologies, access controls, and encryption. \nThese components\
    \ work together to enable IoT networks to collect, process, and send data from\
    \ the real world. \nIoT networks can offer a number of advantages by fusing these\
    \ elements, including increased operational \neffectiveness, lower costs, and\
    \ better user experiences. \nB. Four layers of IoT network architecture \nIoT\
    \ networks can be further divided into blocks or modules, each of which serves\
    \ a particular function. \nDepending on the particular use case of the IoT network,\
    \ these blocks can be organized in a variety of ways. \nSome of the typical building\
    \ blocks or modules for IoT network topologies include the following:All physical\
    \ \ncomponents of the IoT network, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, are\
    \ included in the device layer. These \ngadgets gather information and talk to\
    \ other gadgets in the network.All network elements that permit \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, gateways, and switches, are included\
    \ in the network \nlayer. The network layer also comprises protocols and technologies,\
    \ such Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa, that \nallow devices to connect with one another.\
    \ \ni. \nCloud Layer: This layer consists of cloud-based services that give the\
    \ IoT network access to storage, \ncompute, and analytics. These services can\
    \ be used to store data, handle data processing and analysis, \nand give end users\
    \ insights. \nii. \nApplication Layer: This layer consists of computer programs\
    \ that give end users access to the \ninformation gathered by the Internet of\
    \ Things network. These programs can be used to display data, \nstart processes,\
    \ and provide notifications. \niii. \nSecurity Layer:The security procedures in\
    \ this layer assure the availability, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of the\
    \ data gathered by the IoT network. Threat detection, access limits, and encryption\
    \ are \nexamples of security measures. \niv. \nDevice Layer:Device management,\
    \ network monitoring, and firmware updates are just a few of the \ntools and services\
    \ that help network administrators manage the IoT network. \nIoT networks can\
    \ be designed in a variety of ways depending on the network's needs and the individual\
    \ use \ncase. IoT networks often depend on a combination of physical objects,\
    \ network elements, cloud-based services, \nsoftware applications, security methods,\
    \ and management tools to operate, regardless of the architecture. \nC. Centralized\
    \ and decentralized networks \ni. \nCentralized Networks: All data gathered by\
    \ IoT devices is transmitted to a central server for \nprocessing and storage\
    \ in a centralized IoT network design. On-site or in the cloud are both viable\
    \ \nlocations for this server. The server is responsible for processing and analyzing\
    \ data, and may also \nserve as a gateway to other systems. As all the data is\
    \ in one place, centralized networks can be simpler \nto manage and maintain.\
    \ Yet, centralized networks may be less scalable and more subject to single \n\
    points of failure. \nii. \nDecentralized Networks: With a decentralized IoT network\
    \ architecture, data processing and storage \nis distributed among different devices\
    \ and systems. For instance, instead of being routed to a \ncentralized server,\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices may be processed and analyzed on the edge, in a\
    \ \nnearby gateway or device. While there are several nodes that can handle data\
    \ processing and storage, \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education\
    \  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2071 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \ndecentralized networks can be more\
    \ scalable and resilient than centralized networks. Decentralized \nnetworks,\
    \ on the other hand, can be trickier to run and maintain because data is dispersed\
    \ throughout \nnumerous hardware and software platforms. \nNetwork topologies\
    \ that are centralized or decentralized each have benefits and drawbacks of their\
    \ own. The \nnetwork's size, the amount of data being collected, whether real-time\
    \ processing is needed, and the required \nlevel of security all play a role in\
    \ the architecture choice. To attain the appropriate level of scalability, \n\
    robustness, and security, certain IoT networks may employ a hybrid architecture,\
    \ which mixes centralized and \ndecentralized features. \nIV. \nApplications of\
    \ IoT Networks \nIoT networks are used in a wide range of fields and businesses,\
    \ including manufacturing, transportation, \nhealthcare, and smart cities. Below\
    \ is a summary of some of the major IoT network-using industries: \ni. \nHealthcare:\
    \ By enabling remote patient monitoring, streamlining hospital operations, and\
    \ giving real-\ntime patient data, IoT networks can improve patient outcomes and\
    \ lower expenses. IoT devices, for \ninstance, can be used to track patients with\
    \ long-term diseases like diabetes or heart disease and notify \nmedical professionals\
    \ of any changes in their state. \nii. \nManufacturing: By providing real-time\
    \ monitoring of production processes and equipment, IoT \nnetworks can assist\
    \ increase operational efficiency and decrease downtime. IoT sensors, for instance,\
    \ \ncan be used to monitor machine performance and anticipate maintenance requirements\
    \ prior to a \nbreakdown. \niii. \nTransportation: IoT networks can aid in enhancing\
    \ user experience, reducing congestion, and \nimproving safety in the transportation\
    \ sector. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track traffic \npatterns and\
    \ modify traffic lights to improve flow. \nIoT networks have the potential to\
    \ enhance urban environments' sustainability, safety, and livability. IoT sensors,\
    \ \nfor instance, can be used to monitor air quality, control energy use, and\
    \ improve waste management. \nA. Examples of specific use cases \nThe following\
    \ are some particular use cases for IoT networks: \na) Smart Homes: IoT devices\
    \ can be utilised to build energy-efficient, safe, and simple to maintain smart\
    \ \nhouses. For instance, IoT-enabled security systems can send out real-time\
    \ notifications if there is any \nunexpected activity in the home, while IoT-enabled\
    \ thermostats can automatically adjust the \ntemperature based on user preferences\
    \ and occupancy. \nb) Asset tracking: IoT networks can be used to track assets\
    \ like inventory, equipment, and vehicles in real \ntime. For example, IoT sensors\
    \ can be used to monitor the location and condition of products in transit, \n\
    enabling organizations to optimize their supply chain operations. \nc) Environmental\
    \ Monitoring: IoT networks can be used to keep an eye on things like weather patterns,\
    \ \nwater quality, and air quality. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to\
    \ forecast weather patterns or \nidentify pollution levels in streams to assist\
    \ stop natural disasters. \nd) Agriculture: Agricultural operations including\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer, and pest control can be monitored \nand optimized via\
    \ IoT networks. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to enhance crop development\
    \ \nand output by monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation systems.\
    \ \n \nV. \nIV. Future Directions of IoT Networks \nA. Emerging trends in IoT\
    \ networks \nDigital twins are virtual reproductions of actual systems or gadgets.\
    \ They can be used to imitate the behavior of \nsystems in the real world because\
    \ they are developed using sensor data. Design, testing, and maintenance of IoT\
    \ \nsystems and devices can be made better with the use of digital twins. \nTurkish\

    Research Article  \ni. \nFog Computing: A decentralized computing architecture\
    \ known as fog computing puts processing \npower closer to Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) devices. Although though it uses a more distributed \nmethodology, it\
    \ is comparable to edge computing. For real-time IoT applications, data processing\
    \ speed \nand latency reduction are essential, and fog computing can help. \n\
    ii. \nHybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that combines public and\
    \ private clouds. IoT \nnetworks may balance their needs for affordability, scalability,\
    \ and security with the aid of hybrid \nclouds. For instance, private cloud infrastructure\
    \ can be used to store sensitive data whereas public \ncloud infrastructure can\
    \ be used to store less sensitive data. \niii. \nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs):\
    \ HMIs allow users to communicate with IoT systems and devices. \nHMIs come in\
    \ tactile, aural, and visual forms. These could aid in enhancing IoT networks'\
    \ usability and \naccessibility. \niv. \nPredictive Maintenance: In order to forecast\
    \ when maintenance is necessary before equipment fails, \npredictive maintenance\
    \ uses data from IoT sensors. Reduced downtime, increased dependability, and \n\
    lower maintenance costs can all be a result of predictive maintenance. \nv. \n\
    Smart Energy: To maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste, smart energy utilises\
    \ IoT networks. \nIoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track energy use in\
    \ buildings and modify heating or lighting \nbased on occupancy levels. \nvi.\
    \ \nVoice Recognition: Voice-activated instructions and IoT device control are\
    \ made possible by speech \nrecognition technologies. Speech recognition can help\
    \ make IoT networks more convenient and \naccessible. \n \nB. Edge computing and\
    \ 5G networks \nThe adoption of edge computing and 5G networks is one of the most\
    \ important trends in IoT networks. Instead \nof transmitting data to a central\
    \ server for processing, edge computing uses devices at the network's edge to\
    \ \nprocess data. Many IoT applications depend on low latency and quick reaction\
    \ times, which can be achieved \nwith this method. Contrarily, 5G networks provide\
    \ greater bandwidth and lower latency than earlier wireless \nnetwork generations,\
    \ making them ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nC. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine Learning \nThe growing application of machine learning\
    \ (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in IoT networks is \nanother\
    \ trend. IoT devices can benefit from AI and ML to improve decision-making and\
    \ automate processes like \nanomaly detection and predictive maintenance. Costs\
    \ can be cut, productivity can be increased, and the user \nexperience can be\
    \ improved. \nD. Blockchain technology \nIn IoT networks, blockchain technology\
    \ is another new development. Blockchain is a distributed ledger \ntechnology\
    \ that makes transactions safe, open, and impenetrable. Blockchain can be utilized\
    \ in IoT networks to \nbuild secure, decentralized systems that are impervious\
    \ to hackers or tampering. Blockchain technology, for \ninstance, can be applied\
    \ to develop a safe and open supply chain management system that can monitor the\
    \ flow \nof commodities from manufacture to delivery.IoT networks have a promising\
    \ future, filled with both exciting \nprospects and difficult obstacles. To ensure\
    \ that IoT networks can reach their full potential as the technology \ndevelops,\
    \ it will be crucial to solve challenges like privacy, security, and interoperability.\
    \ \nVI. \nChallenges & Limitations of IoT Network \nIoT networks provide many\
    \ benefits, but they also present a number of obstacles and constraints that need\
    \ to be \novercome. We will look at a few of these difficulties and their potential\
    \ effects in this section. \nA. Privacy and Security Issues \nTurkish Journal\
    \ of Computer and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI:\
    \ https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2073 \n \n \n \nResearch\
    \ Article  \nSecurity and privacy issues are one of the biggest problems facing\
    \ IoT networks. Given that there are billions of \ninternet-connected gadgets,\
    \ the possibility of cyberattacks and data breaches is a major worry. IoT devices\
    \ \nsometimes have poor security safeguards, which leaves them open to hacking\
    \ and other online dangers. \nFurthermore, IoT devices frequently gather and send\
    \ sensitive data, such private health information, \nnecessitating strong privacy\
    \ measures. \nB. Problems with Interoperability and Compatibility \nInteroperability\
    \ and compatibility problems are another difficulty facing IoT networks. IoT systems\
    \ and devices \nare frequently created by several manufacturers and may employ\
    \ various communication protocols or standards. \nAs a result, integrating equipment\
    \ from many manufacturers and developing a cohesive system may be difficult. \n\
    Additionally, the demand for interoperability and compatibility will only increase\
    \ as IoT networks develop. \nC. Congestion in the Network and Scalability \nScalability\
    \ and network congestion are additional issues that IoT networks must deal with.\
    \ The need for \nbandwidth and other network resources increases along with the\
    \ number of devices connected to the network. \nThis may cause network congestion,\
    \ which may have an effect on how well IoT applications work. Scaling the \nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure to meet the rising demand might be difficult as the number of\
    \ IoT devices keeps \nincreasing. \nD. Battery Life and Power Use \nFor IoT networks,\
    \ power consumption and battery life are major obstacles. Many Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \ndevices run on batteries and can be found in far-off or challenging-to-reach\
    \ places. This makes it difficult to \nchange batteries or recharge devices, which\
    \ may affect the network's overall dependability and performance. In \naddition,\
    \ power consumption will become a more pressing issue as the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases.IoT \nnetworks provide many advantages, but there are also a number\
    \ of problems and restrictions that need to be \nworked around. IoT networks may\
    \ realize their full potential by creating strong security and privacy measures,\
    \ \naddressing interoperability and compatibility challenges, managing network\
    \ congestion, and minimizing power \nusage. \nVII. \nConclusion \nWe have covered\
    \ the architecture, applications, and anticipated future developments of IoT networks\
    \ in this \npaper. We have looked at an IoT network's four-tiered architecture\
    \ and all of its components, such as sensors, \ngateways, cloud platforms, and\
    \ apps. We have also discussed the various applications of IoT networks in a \n\
    variety of fields, including healthcare, industry, transportation, and even smart\
    \ cities.We have also looked into \nthe most recent advancements in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), such as edge computing, 5G networks, AI, and \nblockchain.\
    \ The usefulness and value of IoT networks may rise as a result of these tendencies.IoT\
    \ networks \nprovide a lot of advantages, but they also have some disadvantages\
    \ that need to be dealt with. This includes \nproblems with energy use, battery\
    \ life, interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy. It also includes\
    \ \nproblems with network congestion.To fully realize the potential of IoT networks,\
    \ future research should focus \non fixing these problems and overcoming these\
    \ limitations. Managing network congestion, optimizing energy \nuse, creating\
    \ robust security and privacy measures, and resolving interoperability and compatibility\
    \ issues are a \nfew of them.IoT networks, which have the potential to revolutionize\
    \ numerous industries and raise people's \nliving standards everywhere, represent\
    \ a significant advancement in technology. With further research and \ndevelopment,\
    \ IoT networks will without a doubt play a significant role in determining the\
    \ direction of \ntechnology and society. \nReferences \n[1] Al-Fuqaha, A., Guizani,\

    \ \nPublication date: February 28th 2023 \n \n1. Introduction  \nAgriculture,\
    \ like many other industries, is undergoing a digital transformation because of\
    \ population growth, \nclimate change, and food security concerns, which necessitate\
    \ the adoption of innovative crop productivity \nmethods [33]. Agriculture's role\
    \ in climate change and global warming, on the other hand, has been the subject\
    \ \nof a long-running and contentious debate [8]. Precision agriculture drives\
    \ by technological and innovative \nmethods for efficiently managing agricultural\
    \ characteristics such as crop, soil, production, and management by \nunderstanding\
    \ the temporal and spatial changes of these aspects [45]. Agriculture makes an\
    \ important \ncontribution to the global economy [28]. Farming also plays a role\
    \ in the global socio-economic activity. \nBecause of market growth, both agricultural\
    \ research and industry are aiming for sustainable agricultural \nproductivity\
    \ [24], as well as addressing societal needs in acquiring, managing, analyzing,\
    \ visualizing, and \nutilizing data and information in dealing with cross-disciplinary\
    \ precision agriculture problems [45]. The rising \ntrend in crop demand, combined\
    \ with rising fertilizer and pesticide prices, has highlighted the need for resource-\n\
    efficient, environmentally friendly agriculture [8]. Precision farming defines\
    \ as the management of spatial and \ntemporal variability with ICT-enabled technologies\
    \ to provide food security [46]. Precision agriculture, \naccording to [14], is\
    \ a strategic approach that collects, processes, and analyzes temporal, spatial,\
    \ and individual \ndata, integrating it with other information to support managerial\
    \ decisions based on estimated variations to \nimprove utilization efficiency,\
    \ productivity, quality, profit margins, and sustainability of agricultural output.\
    \ \nPrecision agriculture is based on the idea that production inputs such as\
    \ seed, chemicals, fertilizer, and so on \nshould only be applied when and where\
    \ they are needed to achieve the most efficient production [35]. In \nprecision\
    \ agriculture, thorough plant phenology tracking of agricultural plants transversely\
    \ by deep learning at \nlarge spatial levels is critical. The precise information\
    \ aids in the timing of farm management practices such as \nfarm monitoring, harvesting,\
    \ yield prediction, pest control, and disaster warning, among others. Governments\
    \ \ncan use crop-mapping information to invalidate farmer subsidies, detect fraud,\
    \ and process insurance claims. The \napplication's design is similar to that\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT)-based irrigation systems and sensors capable\
    \ \nof tracking pH, soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and digital soil mapping\
    \ [26]. Adoption of IoT, predictive \nanalytics, and deep learning in precision\
    \ agriculture is important for 1) profitability; 2) efficiency of input cost \n\
    reduction; 3) food safety; 4) sustainability; 5) and environmental safety [1].\
    \         \nAgriculture is expected to meet societal values such as increased\
    \ food productivity, cultural diversity, \nrecreation, and climate conservation,\
    \ as well as economic, environmental, and social viability. This has not been\
    \ \nthe case due to a variety of impediments. Precision agriculture is one of\
    \ the farming practices that are efficient \nand safe for the environment. The\
    \ farmer through observation, measurement, and a quick response to variability\
    \ \non crops through the treatment of variable rates with high precision and accuracy\
    \ [29] achieves it. To achieve \nsustainable farm productivity, it is critical\
    \ to forecast and understand the various variability and dynamics of the \nagricultural\
    \ system to improve crop performance. Climate change, fertilization, and irrigation,\
    \ as well as soil \nJournal of Information Engineering and Applications      \

    \ of this. Precision agriculture enables a data-driven method that enables farmers\
    \ to make the \nbest crop variety, selection, and decisions to cope with changing\
    \ conditions, resource scarcity, and the effects of \nagricultural production\
    \ on society. Agricultural activities are a major source of income for the majority\
    \ of \nKenyans. Its practices have long been unsatisfactory in terms of yield\
    \ maximization and cost minimization due \nto an over-reliance on traditional\
    \ farming orientation. The vice is not information-driven, particularly in terms\
    \ of \nmanagement practices as inputs in terms of timing or quantification, but\
    \ most farmers rely on estimates. \nHowever, they failed to account for field\
    \ variability, resulting in resource misallocations such as under or over-\napplication\
    \ of inputs, which had a significant impact on the ecosystem and harmed production\
    \ sustainability [49]. \nThe issues have an impact on food security, requiring\
    \ farmers to adopt other effective, efficient, and \nproductive farm practices.\
    \ This is realized with precision agriculture and the adoption of novel technologies.\
    \ Soil \nvariability and crop management are critical in precision agriculture\
    \ for achieving productivity, profitability, and \nenvironmental effluence control\
    \ [15]. Agriculture is expected to meet societal values such as increased food\
    \ \nproductivity, cultural diversity, recreation, and climate conservation, as\
    \ well as economic, environmental, and \nsocial viability. These have not been\
    \ the case due to various barriers. Precision agriculture is considered as one\
    \ \nof the farming practices that are efficient and safe to the environment achieved\
    \ through observation, \nmeasurement with quick response to variability’s on crops\
    \ by the farmer through the treatment of variable rates \nwith high precision\
    \ and accuracy [29].  \nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization,\
    \ food production must increase by 60% \nby 2050 to keep up with the world's rapid\
    \ population growth. Precision farming is seen as a long-term solution to \nthe\
    \ problem of food scarcity and unprofitable farm practices [19]. The environmental\
    \ impact has been alarming \nglobally because of various pollutants. Sociable\
    \ and sustainable agriculture entails excellent agricultural resource \nutilization\
    \ management for sustainability in fulfilling the food production demand, conserving\
    \ the environment, \nand natural resources. As a result, a policy framework that\
    \ guides the use and effects of poor agricultural \npractices on the environment\
    \ is required. This necessitates a transformation of our dominant conventional\
    \ \nfarming into smart farming through strategic alignment of agricultural product\
    \ development with the \nenvironment using smart technologies. Pollutants can\
    \ be reduced by preventing soil erosion, avoiding the \noveruse of fertilizers,\
    \ herbicides, and pesticides, protecting biodiversity, and conserving natural\
    \ resources [12]. \nThe study will benefit a variety of stakeholders, including\
    \ individual farmers, communities, government, and \nagricultural authorities.\
    \ It will provide insight and understanding to facilitate economic impact by providing\
    \ \ngood agricultural services, important data collection, analysis, and insight\
    \ exposure for decision-making and \nfarming practice management. These will boost\
    \ productivity, food security, and long-term sustainability. It aids \nstakeholders\
    \ in development while also improving their standard of living. It encourages\
    \ entrepreneurship and \njob creation. \n \n1.1 Sustainable Agriculture \nPrecision\
    \ agriculture significantly contributes to addressing agricultural challenges.\
    \ It can also contribute to a \nmore sustainable agricultural system while remaining\
    \ profitable [8]. Precision agriculture and the concept of \nsustainability are\
    \ inextricably linked. The term \"sustainability\" refers to the economic ability\
    \ to maintain \nconsistent productivity without jeopardizing the needs of future\
    \ generations. Sustainable agriculture improves \nenvironmental quality and resource-based\
    \ agriculture, where agriculture is based on basic human food and \neconomic viability,\
    \ thereby improving farmers' lifestyles and society. Sustainability has remained\
    \ a \ncomprehensive examination of the economic, environmental, and sociological\
    \ consequences of any expansion \n[6]. Agro-technology and precision farming,\
    \ as well as digital agriculture, use data-driven approaches to increase \nagricultural\
    \ productivity while minimizing environmental impacts [28].  \nPrecision agriculture's\
    \ critical success is hampered by factors such as a lack of training, a low return\
    \ on \ninvestment, high costs, and a lack of precision agriculture big data analytics\
    \ [45]. Precision farming collects real-\ntime data on farm elements such as crops,\
    \ air, and soil to protect the environment while also ensuring profits and \n\
    sustainability [1]. The incorporation of AI techniques in agricultural practices\
    \ has advanced aspects such as crop \nand soil health, irrigation systems, crop\
    \ disease identification, weed control, and recommended control measures \n[26].\
    \ Farming problems may be addressed by robotics and sensing technologies. As a\
    \ result, adopting a robotic \nagricultural system will have a significant impact\
    \ on crop production, efficiency, and sustainability [22]. \n \n1.2 Precision\
    \ agriculture \nPrecision agriculture has recently received a lot of attention\
    \ due to the world's ever-increasing demand for water \nand food [20]. Precision\
    \ agriculture is no exception to how information systems have influenced and shaped\
    \ \nevery aspect of our society [8]. Precision agriculture, according to [11],\
    \ is the “collection of real-time data from \nfarm variables and use of predictive\
    \ analytics for smart decisions to maximize yields, minimize environmental \n\
    impact, and reduce cost.” Precision agriculture's goal is to understand the soil\
    \ and crop qualities that are specific \nto each section of the field and to streamline\
    \ production inputs in small sections of the field [35]. According to \nJournal\
    \ of Information Engineering and Applications                                \
    \                                                                            \

    \ \nVol.13, No.1, 2023 \n \n21 \n[4], precision farming has the potential to provide\
    \ both economic and environmental benefits by reducing the use \nof water, fertilizers,\
    \ herbicides, and pesticides, as well as farm machinery. Thereby resolving both\
    \ the economic \nand climate change issues that currently plague production agriculture\
    \ precision agriculture is a field in which \ntechnology can be used to effectively\
    \ manage agriculture by understanding the temporal and spatial changes in \nsoil,\
    \ crop, production, and management via innovative techniques [45]. The Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) technology \nplays an important role in precision farming by\
    \ driving the total market value, which is expected to be around \n$4.7 billion\
    \ by 2021. Despite an increase in research and novel projects in smart farming\
    \ projects, agriculture as \nan industry has been slow to adopt emerging M2M and\
    \ IoT technologies in comparison to other industries. \nSmart farming necessitates\
    \ the incorporation of sensor technologies capable of collecting data from the\
    \ crop, soil, \nanimal behavior, tractor status, and a variety of environmental\
    \ characteristics. Sensor data from IoT computing \nand analytics can provide\
    \ a farmer with valuable information on weather conditions, forecasts, yield prediction,\
    \ \ncrop monitoring, animal and plant disease detection, and crop monitoring [33].\
    \  \nPrecision Agriculture enables more efficient use of inputs (such as seed,\
    \ pesticide, fertilizer, or herbicide), \nnew efficient tillage equipment operation,\
    \ better crop and field measurements, and improved management \ndecisions [4],\
    \ [35]. The use of Smart greenhouses encourages crop cultivation with a minimum\
    \ of human \nintervention by constantly monitoring climatic conditions such as\
    \ humidity, luminosity, temperature, and soil \nmoisture, generating automated\
    \ actions based on the assessed changes, and enacting corrective mechanisms to\
    \ \nmaintain the most valuable conditions for development [1]. Deep Learning's\
    \ contribution to improving precision \nagriculture includes the following: 1)\
    \ Optimal control of the agricultural production system 2) Management of \nthe\
    \ agricultural economic system, Agriculture information processing, and smart\
    \ agriculture machinery \nequipment [44]. Growing agricultural technology has\
    \ enabled the use of high-precision sensors to remotely \nmonitor nutrients, water,\
    \ humidity, light, and temperature. The collected data is exposed through an advanced\
    \ \nanalysis using robust algorithms to aid in prediction processes and strategic\
    \ decision-making. Machine learning \nand deep learning technologies are important\
    \ in precision agriculture because they enable computers to become \nintelligent\
    \ through the development of image and video processing algorithms [9]. Information\
    \ and \ncommunication technologies (ICT) are a tool for promoting industrial transformations.\
    \ It is expected that the \navailability of analytics and modern farming techniques\
    \ will increase agricultural production output to 60% by \n2030. Agriculture has\
    \ been influenced by information technology, which has improved cost reduction,\
    \ efficiency, \nand sustainability [26]. Precision agriculture is a method of\
    \ managing farm practices that involve the use of \nvarious technologies such\
    \ as remote sensors, RFID, and cameras to achieve the proximal collection of key\
    \ data \nin real-time. Using data analytics strategies and other intelligent technologies,\
    \ these can be converted into \ninformation insights. Farmers can then use this\
    \ information to optimize their input returns, improve their \nefficiency, and\
    \ reduce their environmental impact. Precision agriculture can be defined as \"\
    applying the right \ntreatment in the right place at the right time.\" It is a\
    \ collection of IT artifacts that includes information systems, \nsmart sensors,\
    \ and improved machinery with cognizance management for production optimization\
    \ via tracking \nand monitoring of uncertainties and variability in agricultural\
    \ structures. It is a concept for managing farm \nactivities that are based on\
    \ observation, measurement, and response to any internal or external field variation\
    \ in \ncrops [13]. Precision agriculture employs IoT, deep learning, predictive\
    \ analytics, and AI-based technologies to \ndetect plant diseases, pests, and\
    \ poor plant nutrition in the field [11]. Precision agriculture enables efficient\
    \ \nobservation and close monitoring of crops as they grow by using information\
    \ collected directly from the field \n(such as weather or soil condition). It\
    \ is also known as satellite farming [32]. Precision agriculture necessitates\
    \ \nthe collection and interpretation of detailed field data to account for variability\
    \ in productivity. New technologies, \nsuch as wireless sensor networks, are now\
    \ assisting in the real-time streaming of data for strategic decision-\nmaking.\
    \ Sensor networks are used in agriculture for a variety of reasons, including\
    \ 1) Agriculture with pinpoint \naccuracy 2) Consumer advertisement 3) Plant growth\
    \ optimization 4) Farm surveillance 5) Research 6) Farming \neducation and training\
    \ 7) Farm administration [27]. \n \n2. IoT Technologies in Agriculture \nThe Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) entailed the connection of objects via RFID [36]. It is no longer\
    \ a buzzword, but it \nis being used practically all over the world as a result\
    \ of the advancement and use of devices such as mobile, \ndistributed systems,\
    \ embedded systems, cloud computing, ubiquitous communication, and big data analytics.\
    \ It \nenables physical object interconnection over a network, sensing, information\
    \ collection, sharing, and analysis, all \nof which aid in decision making, planning,\
    \ and management [40]. Precision farming makes use of smart \ntechnologies such\
    \ as IoT and big data analytics. It can handle farming problems adequately by\
    \ monitoring crops, \nsoil, environment, irrigation, and fertilization with IoT\
    \ sensors, RFID, and cameras. These IoT technologies \ncollect data and relay\
    \ it to data analytics for in-depth analysis. Farmers receive the analyzed data\
    \ via devices \nsuch as smartphones. The data helps farmers manage crop varieties,\
    \ phenotypes, and selection, crop performance, \nsoil quality, pH level, irrigation,\
    \ and fertilizer application quantity [19]. With the use of IoT, farmers will\
    \ find \nthat agricultural problems are a thing of the past. It plays an important\
    \ role in gathering relevant information [32]. \nJournal of Information Engineering\

    \ \nDrones are used in agricultural applications such as monitoring fields, crops,\
    \ and livestock, as well as scanning \nlarge areas, whereas sensors on the ground\
    \ collect a vast amount of data [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers \nto\
    \ intelligent networks that connect objects to allow information exchange and\
    \ communication via sensing \ndevices over the internet using certain standards\
    \ and protocols. An IoT is a framework of integrated technologies \n(such as RFID,\
    \ cloud computing, wireless sensor networks, Internet protocols, data analytics,\
    \ and so on) [36].  It \nidentifies, tracks, locates, monitors, and manages things\
    \ efficiently and effectively [7]. [38] Propose a low-cost \nIoT sensing platform\
    \ that consists of three components: 1) the monitoring sensors; 2) the sensing\
    \ box and 3) the \navailable interfaces. They are intended to provide soil data\
    \ that is critical for increasing crop yield. The soil \nhumidity, pH, temperature,\
    \ light, and camera sensors in the monitoring sensors collect soil images for\
    \ computer \nvision analysis. These sensors are collected in the Sensing Box,\
    \ which collects data from smartphones or clouds. \nThe Sensing Box communicates\
    \ with the smartphone/cloud and sensor essentials via radio and analog/digital\
    \ \ninterfaces, respectively, allowing monitoring and support for other soil,\
    \ environmental, and camera sensors. IoT \nconnectivity includes people, machines,\
    \ tools, and locations that are designed to perform intelligent functions \nsuch\
    \ as data sharing and information exchange. The Internet of Things (IoT) is playing\
    \ an important role in \nagricultural product management in real-time data, alongside\
    \ 1) control; 2) tracking; 3) evaluating; 4) searching; \n5) monitoring; 6) managing;\
    \ and 7) logistic operations [1]. \n. \n \nFigure 1 – IoT Sensing Platform Architecture\

    \ \n3.1 Big Data Analytics (BDA) \nCurrently, big data analytics is being increasingly\
    \ adopted to meet the evolving needs of big data technologies \nacross a wide\
    \ range of topics. Big data's approachability, accessibility, and rapid emergence\
    \ have fueled \nconsistent technological developments and applications [17]. Big\
    \ data is defined as a large data set that can be \nstructured, semi-structured,\
    \ or unstructured and collected, analyzed, distributed, and managed for informed\
    \ \ndecision-making. The data sources for BDA are incorporated through the integration\
    \ of IoT devices (RFID and \nsensors) within a network-enabled environment. The\
    \ BDA enables knowledgeable insights to be extracted from \nmassive IoT data sets\
    \ through the application of data mining approaches aimed at predicting, identifying\
    \ patterns, \ncorrelations, trends, and decision making. The massive amounts of\
    \ data generated by IoT have made a \nsignificant contribution to the vast field\
    \ of big data. Big data characteristics include the 5 Vs: volume, veracity, \n\
    variety, value, and velocity [30], [31]. Big data provides predictive insights\
    \ into farming practices, drives real-\ntime effective decisions, and redesigns\
    \ business processes to create game-changing business models [41]. The \nsmart\
    \ decision made possible by data analytics results in less waste of resources\
    \ such as water, pesticides, \nfertilizer, and so on [11].  \nThe BDA is responsible\
    \ for capturing, storing, analyzing, searching, and identifying hidden patterns\
    \ in the \ncollected data. As a result, BDA necessitates the use of (a) tools\
    \ for classification and clustering; (b) techniques \nfor data mining, machine\
    \ learning, and statistical analysis; and (c) technologies like Hadoop and Spark.\
    \ It aids in \naccurately forecasting and decision-making in agricultural practices\
    \ [1]. Adoption and optimization of \ninnovation and technologies will help to\
    \ ensure the long-term viability of precision farming through better \npractices\
    \ and increased productivity. These can be realized by measuring, storing, and\
    \ analyzing data to improve \nyield quality; managing cost revenues through crop\
    \ risk probability and minimization, and adopting improved \npreventive care methods\
    \ to increase productivity satisfaction [51]. Adoption of IoT Big Data is critical\
    \ in farm \nmanagement practices such as crop imaging, irrigation, soil analysis\
    \ (Acidity, PH), pesticide and herbicide \napplication, fertilizers, temperature,\
    \ and moisture monitoring [2]. Precision agriculture enables efficient \nobservation\
    \ and close monitoring of crops as they grow by using information collected directly\
    \ from the field \n(such as weather or soil condition). It is also known as satellite\
    \ farming [32].  \nThere is a disconnect between research and practice. There\
    \ is a need for researchers to not focus on a \nJournal of Information Engineering\

    \ for farmers to understand crop \nproduction with the incorporation of technology\
    \ and innovation. A farmer focuses on new techniques and \napproaches based on\
    \ individual perceptions such as resource availability, experience, age, education\
    \ level, and \nrisk management attitude [29]. Adoption of IoT big data technologies\
    \ can have a positive economic impact by \nfacilitating the provision of good\
    \ agricultural services, important data collection, analysis, and the dissemination\
    \ \nof insights that assist farmers in making informed and correct decisions about\

    \ and a ready market will allow farmers to sell their products and use \nthem\
    \ for development while also improving their livelihood. It encourages entrepreneurship\
    \ and job creation \n[51]. The government contributes significantly to the success\
    \ or failure of agriculture by encouraging farmers to \nbe risk-averse. Factors\
    \ such as drought, heavy rain, pest and disease infestations, or poor seed quality\
    \ contribute \nto the high risk. The government must provide full intervention\
    \ to farmers, such as input subsidies, permits, rates, \nirrigation facilitation,\
    \ and training and sensitization for the adoption of modern farming technologies\
    \ for high \nyields and productivity [2]. The expansion of big climate data and\
    \ its analytics has resulted in the widespread use \nof smart information management\
    \ systems, precision agriculture, and intelligent automatic agriculture [17].\
    \  \n \n3.2 Deep Learning  \nAccording to [16], deep learning technologies are\
    \ now being used in a variety of agricultural and farming \nsystems. Autonomous\
    \ weed identification can aid in weed control, resulting in higher yields. Weed\
    \ detection in \ncrops using imagery is a difficult task because weeds and crops\
    \ have similar colors, shapes, and textures during \nthe growth stage. Deep learning\
    \ is an important branch of machine learning. Deep learning is a type of artificial\
    \ \nintelligence that is trained on data sets and then learns on its own, and\
    \ it is at the heart of many technologies [39]. \nAside from image segmentation,\
    \ object detection, and identification, deep learning algorithms have several\
    \ \nadvantages over previous machine learning approaches. Machine learning algorithms\
    \ can be used in precision \nagriculture decision support tools to recognize statistical\
    \ correlations rather than causal explanations. It takes into \naccount a set\
    \ of entities such as crop yields in addition to data characteristics (training\
    \ data) linked to entities \nsuch as weather conditions and soil conditions to\
    \ predict the outcome [5]. Deep learning is defined as an \n“algorithm-assisted\
    \ structure that mimics human learning” [9]. Robotic vision is based on machine\
    \ learning from \nreal-world datasets using methods such as deep neural networks,\
    \ allowing robots to share their knowledge by \nlearning from Big Data [10]. Machine\
    \ Learning is an Artificial Intelligence subset that can detect patterns and \n\
    anomalies in data generated by smart sensors [41].  \nDeep Learning algorithms\
    \ have been used in agriculture in a variety of ways. Recurrent Neural Networks\
    \ \n(RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks\
    \ (GAN) are examples of \nthese (GAN). Deep Neural Networks can extract their\
    \ features, allowing them to prompt multifaceted \nrelationships or patterns amongst\
    \ the data [52].  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are Deep Learning \nmodels\
    \ that interact with images by extracting features or objects and learning to\
    \ differentiate between them [18]. \nDeep learning enables computational models\
    \ with multiple layers of processing that represent multiple data \nlevels of\
    \ abstraction. The layering aspect is learned from data rather than created by\
    \ humans using a general-\npurpose learning technique. Several Deep Learning algorithms\
    \ rely heavily on the Back Propagation Neural \nNetwork. Weather forecasting,\
    \ plant disease detection, image translation, fruit counting, land classification,\
    \ \nobstacle detection, plant classification, weed identification, animal behavior\
    \ classification, and yield prediction \nare all areas where deep learning is\
    \ used in agriculture  [44], [9]. \n \nFigure 2: Deep Learning Approach (Adapted\
    \ from [52]) \n \n4. Typical Application Areas \nPest Management is one of the\
    \ most common applications of smart technologies in precision agriculture. Insect\
    \ \npest infestation in agriculture has been a major issue for farmers, resulting\
    \ in significant economic losses. These \ncan be mitigated by the development\
    \ of computerized systems that identify active pests and advise on control \n\
    measures [3]. Modern and intelligent technology, such as the use of drones, can\
    \ independently eradicate pests \nand selectively target agrichemicals, reducing\
    \ collateral damage to the ecosystem, lowering resistance, and \nlowering costs\
    \ [22]. \nJournal of Information Engineering and Applications                \

    \ (online) \n \nVol.13, No.1, 2023 \n \n24 \n \nFigure 3: Drones with precision\
    \ sprayers (adapted from [22]) \nWeed Control: The direct application of herbicides\
    \ in the field to control weeds has had a significant impact \non the environment\
    \ and human health complications. Nonetheless, technological advancements have\
    \ enabled the \nuse of artificial intelligence for safe and risk-free herbicide\
    \ applications. The use of a rule-based expert system; \nmachine vision; neural\
    \ network models (backpropagation, counter propagation, and radial basis function-based\
    \ \nmodel); and image analysis are among the approaches that are now taking center\
    \ stage in weed identification and \nelimination [47]. Artificial intelligence\
    \ sensors can detect and target weeds before determining which herbicides \nare\
    \ needed and when. As a result, we save money by not using as many herbicides\
    \ and we reduce the number of \ntoxins in our food. Machine vision can aid in\
    \ site-specific crop management by detecting and distinguishing the \npresence\
    \ of weeds in the crop and identifying the weed for the appropriate chemical to\
    \ spray [27].  \nAgricultural Product Monitoring:  Food monitoring and quality\
    \ control mechanisms based on proper drying, \nstorage, and grading of harvested\
    \ crops are critical. These practices can be aided by the conception of artificial\
    \ \nintelligence [1]. Storage Management: Many agricultural products are lost\
    \ as a result of poor storage \nmanagement systems. Unrequired temperature, moisture,\
    \ and other environmental factors can contribute to the \ntoxicity of food products\
    \ or aid in the infestation of insects, microorganisms, rodents, and other pests,\
    \ all of \nwhich harm the quality and quantity of food products. IoT, AI, and\
    \ data analytics will be used to improve \nagricultural product storage [11].\
    \ Crop disease management: Crop diseases reduce crop productivity yield. \nPrecision\
    \ agriculture is the adaptation of a computer-aided system that can assist in\
    \ the identification of crop \ndiseases and proposed control measures. Various\
    \ systems and algorithms for predicting, classifying, detecting, \nand controlling\
    \ crop diseases have been proposed. Rule-based systems, a fuzzy logic-based model,\
    \ an artificial \nneural network-based model, an image processing model, and the\
    \ k-means segmentation algorithm are among \nthe techniques used [3]. Weather\
    \ Monitoring: The growth of plants is dependent on weather conditions and \nfactors\
    \ such as sunlight and rainwater, which are now naturally unpredictable as a result\
    \ of human pollution and \nglobal warming. The new technologies can monitor and\
    \ predict the weather, providing farmers with useful \ninformation to help them\
    \ avoid unfavorable conditions that can reduce crop yields [42]. Irrigation Management:\
    \ \nIoT-based smart irrigation systems help improve irrigation efficacy by reducing\
    \ water loss and conserving \ncurrent water resources [1].  \nYield Prediction:\
    \ The prediction model is critical for precision agriculture analytics because\
    \ it forecasts \ncrop yield, which is critical for marketing strategies and crop\
    \ cost estimation. A backpropagation learning \nalgorithm of an artificial neural\
    \ network has been used to forecast yield based on soil parameters, atmospheric\
    \ \ninputs, and fertilizer consumption [3]. Management of Soils: Soil management\
    \ is a critical area in agriculture that \nrequires attention because improper\
    \ soil management results in a loss of crop yield and quality. Soil minerals and\
    \ \npH levels must be measured and monitored for plants to grow healthier as a\
    \ result of proper soil minerals and pH \nlevels [42]. Any farmer will find the\
    \ soil to be a fascinating resource. The use of large harvesters has greatly \n\
    damaged and compacted soil, and the overuse of agrochemicals, such as nitrogen\
    \ fertilizer, has harmed the \nenvironment. Aside from autonomous technologies,\
    \ the use of robotics could be of great assistance and relief to \nfarmers. Drone\
    \ data analytics are used to make smarter nitrogen fertilizer applications for\
    \ healthy vegetation. \nBonirob (a car-sized robot) is used to measure soil value\
    \ indicators using various sensors and components, \nincluding a moisture sensor\
    \ and a penetrometer that can evaluate soil compaction [22]. Artificial intelligence\
    \ \ntechniques can help with supervised activities such as crop and land suitability\
    \ mapping, stem water intake \nestimation, soil water content management, soil\
    \ moisture, and rainfall prediction [3]. \nJournal of Information Engineering\

    \ from [22]) \nAgricultural Machinery Management: Agricultural machinery, such\
    \ as tractors, must be managed to \nimprove agricultural efficiency, competitiveness,\
    \ and sustainability. Integrating these types of machinery with \nsmart technologies\
    \ will aid in reducing negative environmental effects, increasing soil productivity,\
    \ and \npromoting economic yields. Smart agricultural machines are quick, versatile,\
    \ precise, and intelligent, with low \ncarbon dioxide emissions and bioenergy\
    \ utilization [1]. IoT-enabled agricultural machinery can boost crop \nproductivity\
    \ while reducing grain losses. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems\
    \ and global \nnavigation satellite systems can improve machinery because they\
    \ can be driven in autopilot mode. Machines \nwith vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles,\
    \ and robots can be controlled remotely, allowing farmers to map their \nfield\
    \ management practices such as fertilizing, irrigation, nutrition, and so on [11].\

    \ \nAdvances in technological services, new business models, and markets drive\
    \ significant GDP growth [45]. \nRadical advancements in information systems,\
    \ such as satellites, the internet, mobile phones, and social media, \nare now\
    \ being used to solve agricultural challenges. Artificial intelligence and the\
    \ Internet of Things are \nrevolutionizing agricultural activities, addressing\
    \ productivity issues such as weather unpredictability, crop loss, \nand economic\
    \ stagnation [26]. These IoT technologies collect data and relay it to data analytics\
    \ for in-depth \nanalysis. Farmers receive the analyzed data via devices such\
    \ as smartphones. The data helps farmers manage \ncrop varieties, phenotypes,\
    \ and selection, crop performance, soil quality, pH level, irrigation, and fertilizer\
    \ \napplication quantity [19]. \nAs of the popularity of IoT, it can now be used\
    \ in a variety of fields (i.e. smart home, smart agriculture, \nsmart city, smart\
    \ health-care, smart logistics, smart transport, smart energy, and so on) It is\
    \ estimated that the \nworld's population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, up from\
    \ 7.7 billion today [20]. This raises concerns about food \nsecurity, in addition\
    \ to global warming, which has made climatic conditions uncertain, scarcity of\
    \ natural \nresources, and arid land, which are the most significant challenges\
    \ faced by the majority of countries. This \nnecessitates the implementation of\
    \ novel and strategic agricultural production methods. As a result, for future\
    \ \nfood sustainability, most countries are opting for precision farming with\
    \ the use of both IoT and data analytics. \nThis will enable smart agriculture,\
    \ which is expected to improve operational efficiency, crop quality, and crop\
    \ \nyields [11]. Big data's role is to extract valuable insights from massive\
    \ amounts of heterogeneous data about crop \ngrowth and other parameters measured\

    \ of Sustainable Precision Farming  \nThe adoption of innovative technologies\
    \ in precision agriculture has not been easy. Industrial agriculture \ntechniques\
    \ are already heavily criticized for harming the environment, according to [8].\
    \ Examples of such effects \ninclude: I Monocultures reduce biodiversity in plants\
    \ and animals. (ii) The use of chemical pesticides and \nfertilizers pollutes\
    \ the soil and groundwater. (iii) Soil degrades much faster than it can be replenished.\
    \ (iv) \nExtinction of fish. (v) Excessive use of water and fossil fuels. (vi)\
    \ The global population is expected to increase \nsignificantly, increasing global\
    \ food demand. (vii) Fertilizer and pesticide prices are also projected to increase.\
    \ \nAccording to [35], the following are the barriers to precision farming implementation\
    \ in developing countries: a) \nThe cultures and perceptions of users. b) A scarcity\
    \ of technical expertise on the local level. c) Taking into \naccount system heterogeneity\
    \ and market imperfections. d) The availability, quality, and cost of data. e)\
    \ A small \nfarm size and a lack of success stories. f) Knowledge and technology\
    \ gaps. h) Land ownership, infrastructure, \nand institutional constraints. \n\
    Among the factors impeding full implementation among farmers are Concerns about\
    \ privacy and trust: The \npresence of malware attacks and data thefts is a risk\
    \ factor for connected systems. Because of their presence in \nthe complex IoT\
    \ system, these malicious third-party programs are difficult to detect and remove.\
    \ There is an \nurgent need for a strong security and policy framework for agricultural\
    \ IoT and other technologies for systems to \npromote trust and be more acceptable\
    \ to customers [43], [50]. Agronomical challenges include a lack of basic \ninformation,\
    \ limited sampling and inspection procedures, information misuse, a lack of qualified\
    \ agronomic \nservices, and a lack of site-specific fertilizer references [25].\
    \ Profitability issue: The inability to demonstrate that \nthe use of precision\
    \ agriculture technology improves farm profitability through the strategy of “right\
    \ quantity of \ncrop inputs in the right location at the right time” [34], [21].\
    \ Lack of skills: Precision agriculture is primarily \ninformation-intensive and\
    \ technology-driven, necessitating extensive technical skills gained through education\
    \ \nand training to analyze data and exhaustively interpret information derived\
    \ from data mining techniques and \nalgorithms [37],[25]. Cost challenge: Precision\
    \ agriculture management activities such as the use of machinery \nsuch as driverless\
    \ tractors with sensors that are suitable for large-scale farmers are not cost-effective\
    \ for \ndomestic farmers. Financial constraints and a lack of credit for technological\
    \ machinery and inputs are deterring \nfarmers from adopting precision farming\
    \ [50].  \nLack of broadband infrastructure: Due to the unfavorable landscape,\
    \ internet connectivity in remote rural \nareas in developing countries is unreliable.\
    \ As a result, improved network performance and bandwidth speeds are \nrequired\
    \ in these areas. Precision agriculture systems located in farm environments with\
    \ poor connectivity \ncannot effectively share data with other systems on the\
    \ same farm. The issues with GPS signals and agro-\nsensors/gateways have an impact\
    \ on cloud services in terms of data transmission and storage [48]. Technical\
    \ \nchallenges: Any mechanical failure in technological equipment, such as hardware\
    \ or IoT sensors, causes serious \ncrop damage. For example, if a smart irrigation\
    \ sensor fails, crops may be under-watered or over-watered, \naffecting crop growth.\
    \ Food security can also be jeopardized if storage technologies fail or if there\
    \ is a power \noutage with no backup power [25], [48]. Perception of utilitarianism:\
    \ Farmers' negative attitudes toward the use \nof precision agriculture technologies\
    \ in comparison to traditional farming methods. This has had a significant \n\
    impact on adoption rates, necessitating the need for farmer education, sensitization,\
    \ and awareness [25]. \n \n7. Critical Success Factors for Implementation of Precision\
    \ Agriculture \nAgricultural service providers are filling the gap in assisting\
    \ farms in making use of the data they collect and \noptimizing it for strategies\
    \ such as variable rate application, zone-based soil sampling, soil electrical\
    \ \nconductivity mapping, cloud solutions, and areas-based plant tissue testing\
    \ [14]. Adoption of new technologies: \nSmart devices and methods for detecting\
    \ and monitoring biotic factors such as weeds and diseases must be \nimplemented.\
    \ This technology aids in the management of soil moisture as well as variable\
    \ irrigation applications \n[23]. Transdisciplinary approach: By combining several\
    \ competencies and academic fields, ICT can make a \nsignificant contribution\
    \ to long-term sustainable development. These disciplines must collaborate to\
    \ help \ndevelop sustainable agricultural development through a transdisciplinary\
    \ approach that has the potential to \nimpact society on multiple levels [29].\
    \ The assistance provided by governments and the private sectors: As a \nresult,\
    \ early adoption assistance from governments and the private sector is critical\
    \ [35]. \nTraining programs: Farmers must be trained in the proper use of innovations\
    \ and consultation, particularly \ndata, software management, and analysis resources.\
    \ This can instill confidence that today's precision agriculture \ntools provide\
    \ the most critical insights [23]. Bringing together temporal and spatial data:\
    \ Bringing together \ntemporal and spatial output data can help farmers and advisers\
    \ manage fields or farms due to differences in \nagricultural average yield and\
    \ variation to improve nutrient uptake [14]. Data quality assurance is required\
    \ \nbecause quality data must be handled and retrieved. It is necessary to ensure\
    \ the use of predictable or precise \nsensors for smarter agronomic data for inputs\
    \ explaining receptiveness under various environmental pressures \n[23].  \nJournal\

    \ assessed the application of various technologies in precision agriculture. Farmers\
    \ will find agricultural \nproblems obsolete as a result of the use of IoT, Big\
    \ Data, and Deep Learning. Big data provides predictive \ninsights into farming\
    \ practices, drives real-time effective decisions, and redesigns business processes\

    \ \nand yield prediction are all areas where deep learning is used in agriculture.\
    \ The study also looks at the typical \napplication areas and challenges in precision\
    \ agriculture adoption. The study examines the critical success \nfactors for\
    \ implementing precision agriculture. According to the findings, technological\

    \ Data driven sustainable agriculture involves the collection,\nstorage, processing,\
    \ and analysis of enormous spatiotemporal data related\nto crop production processes,\
    \ systems, infrastructure, and environment.\nLiterature survey on smart agriculture\
    \ research projects indicates that there\nis a need for improving handling of\
    \ spatiotemporal data. There are gaps in\nhandling spatial and temporal variability\
    \ of parameters, division of crop ﬁeld\ninto management zones to reduce the variability\
    \ for optimizing application of\ninputs such as fertilizers, water or pesticides.\
    \ These gaps are to be addressed\nat design level of spatiotemporal database for\
    \ smart agriculture. Objective: To\nengineer a spatiotemporal database schema\
    \ that can be used for data driven\nsustainable agriculture. Methods: The methodology\
    \ involves spatiotemporal\ndata representation and modeling, Object oriented analysis\
    \ and design of the\ndatabase and Veriﬁcation of the database using life cycle\
    \ model and algorithmic\nsteps. Findings: The resulting database is capable to\
    \ store spatial and temporal\nvariability of soil, plant and water parameters\
    \ as well as handle spatial split,\nspatial merge, geometry and location changes\
    \ of spatiotemporal objects.\nNovelty: Novel Use cases in smart agriculture along\
    \ with spatiotemporal\nattributes are identiﬁed so that eﬃcient applications can\
    \ be realized. Adaption\nof the spatiotemporal database schema for Smart Irrigation\
    \ System and its\nimplementation methodology are presented.\nKeywords: Spatiotemporal\
    \ Database Design; Data-Driven Agriculture;\nAgriculture Informatics; Database\
    \ Veriﬁcation; Spatiotemporal Data Analysis\n1 Introduction\nCuriosity to process,\
    \ analyze and understand the nature of data has been increasing\ntremendously\
    \ in all sectors including agriculture. Many kinds of spatiotemporal\napplications\
    \ require spatial and temporal data for modeling different entities. The\navailability\
    \ of huge volume of spatiotemporal data related to smart farming in the future,\n\
    often continually collected and updated, poses great challenges to our capability\
    \ to\nunderstand the data and to extract potentially useful knowledge from it.\
    \ But analysis\nof the data in spatiotemporal context and its use within the decision-making\n\
    https://www.indjst.org/\n12\nRao / Indian Journal of Science and Technology 2023;16(1):12–22\n\
    processes need research for representation and modeling spatiotemporal data, design\
    \ and validation of spatiotemporal databases\nand applications.\nThe Motivation\
    \ for this research is as follows. Agriculture is an important industry as well\
    \ as the backbone of the economy\nfor many countries. It plays an important contribution\
    \ to Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) under the United Nations.\nThe total\
    \ population of the world, as revealed in November 2020 is 7.8 billion according\
    \ to United Nations estimates. It is\nassessed that this number will be projectile\
    \ to 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.9 billion by 2050 (1,2). With the rapid growth\
    \ in\nthe total population, food consumption is also growing rapidly worldwide.\
    \ As the global population is growing higher, the\nfood and agriculture organizations\
    \ calculated that agriculture production will need to increase by 70% by 2050\
    \ to provide\nnutritious food to the whole population of the world. The emergence\
    \ of new technological trends like artificial intelligence\n(AI), Machine learning,\
    \ Big Data Analytics enable farmers to take a data-driven approach to collect\
    \ and analyze large amounts\nof data to gain knowledge about the real-time status\
    \ of their fields to improve farm yield and mitigate risks from weeds,\npests,\
    \ and diseases. The development of intelligent sensors, instrumentation and machines\
    \ is beginning to play a crucial role\nin agricultural systems, which are affected\
    \ by several factors such as environmental conditions, soil characteristics, water\n\
    availability, harvesting practices, plant diseases, weeds, and other pests. In\
    \ the near future, the integration of automated data\ncollection and analysis,\
    \ AI algorithms and decision support tools will provide advanced tools towards\
    \ Precision Agriculture\n(PA). Moreover, robotic systems, on the ground and in\
    \ the air, will also have a major role in bringing PA and digitalization to the\n\
    field, for harvesting, pest control or data collection, just to name a few. The\
    \ agriculture processes have been changing in order to\nenable technological adoption\
    \ to move farm productivity, product quality, profitability and sustainable development\
    \ to the next\nlevel. New Technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for\
    \ measuring various parameters such as temperature, humidity,\natmospheric pressure,\
    \ illumination, electrical conductivity of soil are available to deploy in agriculture.\
    \ Monitoring a farm using\nIoT sensors and use of data analytics can prevent low\
    \ productivity of crops. One of the main challenges for the implementation\nof\
    \ artificial intelligence in agriculture includes the low replicability and the\
    \ corresponding difficulty in systematic data gathering,\nas no two fields are\
    \ exactly alike. The information of interest in the agricultural sector consists\
    \ of traits or features of systems\nthat vary in space and time. Understanding\
    \ how to manage agricultural processes implies considering many hundreds if not\n\
    thousands of variables. Even within a single field, conditions are always changing\
    \ from one zone to the next.\nFood production and sustainable agriculture have\
    \ been under increasing pressure due to global climate change and\nenvironmental\
    \ deterioration(3). This led to the use of smart sensors(4) in agriculture practices\
    \ generating huge spatiotemporal\ndata resulting in data-driven agriculture that\
    \ employs Data Analytics (DA) to enhance effective decision-making capability,\n\
    the operational efficiency and productivity in the agriculture sector(5). Data-driven\
    \ agriculture has potential to improve\ncrop yield, reduce production cost, and\
    \ ensure sustainable agriculture(2). It involves the collection, storage, processing,\
    \ and\nanalysis of enormous, dynamic, complex spatial data related to all farming\
    \ operations and processes(6). The data can be sensor\ndata, historical data,\
    \ live streamed data, product business and market related data. Spatiotemporal\
    \ Data Analytics and smart\nalgorithms can be developed to predict the environmental\
    \ changes and provide data driven solutions(5,7,8).\nSpatiotemporal data help\
    \ in building various potential Applications(9), such as Irrigation Management\
    \ System, Pest and\nDisease Control, Controlled Use of Fertilizers, Farming Systems\
    \ Monitoring, Livestock Monitoring, and Animal Health\nMonitoring. But research\
    \ focus on spatiotemporal database design and its use for smart agriculture is\
    \ not adequate. Two gaps\nidentified in current smart agriculture research projects\
    \ are 1. Inadequate provision to capture spatial and temporal variability\nof\
    \ soil and plant parameters properly and 2. Lack of support to divide crop fields\
    \ into management zones based on spatial\nand temporal variability. These problems\
    \ are due to lack of provision in the databases to handle spatial split events,\
    \ spatial\nmerge events, and temporal changes to spatial and non-spatial attributes.\
    \ The key contributions of this research article are\nto address the two gaps\
    \ identified above at design level, offer provision to handle more Use cases in\
    \ smart agriculture and\ndiscuss adaption of the database schema for smart irrigation\
    \ system and its implementation strategy. The article describes\nrepresentation\
    \ of spatiotemporal data in section 2.1, modeling of spatiotemporal data in section\
    \ 2.2, analysis, and design of\nspatiotemporal database schema in sections 2.3\
    \ and 2.4 respectively. Data driven smart agriculture platform is also discussed\n\
    in section 2.5. Thorough analysis of how research gaps are eliminated in the design\
    \ is provided in the results and discussion\nsection. Adaptability of the database\
    \ schema for smart irrigation systems is discussed in section 3.1.3.\n2 Methodology\n\
    This section describes spatiotemporal data representation, reviews its modeling,\
    \ object-oriented analysis and design of a\nspatiotemporal database and presentation\
    \ of object relational spatiotemporal database. It then positions the database\
    \ into a\ndata driven smart agriculture context.\nhttps://www.indjst.org/\n13\n\
    Rao / Indian Journal of Science and Technology 2023;16(1):12–22\n2.1 Spatiotemporal\
    \ Data Representation\nAn object with at least one temporal and one spatial characteristic\
    \ can be considered as spatiotemporal object. The spatial\ncharacteristics are\
    \ geometry and location of the object. The temporal characteristics are time intervals\
    \ or timestamps for\nwhich the existence of the object is true. The spatiotemporal\
    \ object comprises temporal, spatial and non-spatial or thematic\nattributes.\
    \ Moving Combine harvester, earthquake, forest fire and flood are examples of\
    \ spatiotemporal objects. Changing values\nof thematic and spatial characteristics\
    \ of a spatial object over a time are generally captured and represented as spatiotemporal\n\
    datasets. The Spatial, Temporal and Spatiotemporal database objects and their\
    \ mathematical representation are described in\nthis subsection.\n2.1.1 Spatial\
    \ Data Representation\nSpatial data identifies the location and shape of the objects\
    \ on earth. Its management is very useful in applications in different\ndomains\
    \ such as natural resource management, global climate change and urban and rural\
    \ planning and development. A\ngeospatial object(10) can be defined using two\
    \ components:\n• Spatial component: It contains geometry (e.g., a point, line,\
    \ polygon) of the spatial object and its topological relationship\nwith other\
    \ geographic objects (e.g., overlaps).\n• Descriptive component: It contains a\
    \ set of attributes\nMathematical notation for representing the Spatial component\
    \ can be formulated as follows.\nP = (x,y) Where P is a Point and x, y are real\
    \ numbers.\nPS = { (p, q) / (p, q ε P) Λ (p < q) } where PS is a Set of Points,\
    \ and (p < q) means ( p.x < q.x ) V ( (p.x = q.x) Λ (p.y < q.y) )\nS= (b, e) where\
    \ S is a Line Segment Λ (b, e ε PS) Λ (b ̸= e).\nLS = { (u,v) / (u,v ε PS) Λ (u\
    \ < v) } where LS is a set of Line Segments\nPolyline = { (m, n) / (m, n ε LS)\
    \ Λ ( (m.e = n.b) V (n.e = m.b) ) }\nPolygon = { (l1, l2, l3, ..., lk−1, lk) /\
    \ (l1, l2, l3,..., lk−1, lk ε LS ) Λ\n(l1.e=l2.b) Λ (l2.e=l3.b) Λ ... Λ (lk−1.e=lk.b)\
    \ Λ (lk.e=l1.b) }\nIn essence, a spatial object is characterized by its position\
    \ or location, geometry and attributes.\nSpatial Online Analytical Processing\
    \ (SOLAP)(10–12) integrates spatial data into multidimensional databases. Spatial\n\
    dimension(10) can be spatial, non-spatial or mixed. Spatial measures(10) can be\
    \ analyzed along spatial and/or non-spatial\ndimensions. Spatial database research\
    \ involves modeling, querying, analysis, and mining. This requires a spatial referencing\n\
    system(13) to be incorporated into a spatial database.\n2.1.2 Temporal Data Representation\n\
    A temporal data consists of built-in time aspects. It has its own geometry and\
    \ topology. Instant and period are two primitives\napplicable to time dimension.\
    \ Temporal point (TP) or instant is a location in a temporal reference system(13).\
    \ Temporal interval\n(TI) or a time interval, [tm, tp] where tm and tp are time\
    \ points and tm < tp, can be defined as a set of instants. It has a duration.\n\
    Mathematical formulation for instant and time interval are given below.\nTP =\
    \ t where (TP = Temporal Point or Instant) Λ (t = Timestamp)\nTI = { [tm, tp]\
    \ / (tm = TP) Λ (tp = TP) Λ (tm < tp) }\nThe time associated to an object may\
    \ be valid time or transaction time. The valid time indicates that an object exists\
    \ in real\nworld during that time. The transaction time is the time when that\
    \ element became part of the database. Bi-temporal databases\nmaintain both transaction\
    \ time and valid time for the objects. Valid time and transaction time can be\
    \ a time point, time interval\nor period. A period is a combination of a set of\
    \ time points and/or time intervals. Time is generally recorded for two basic\
    \ facts\n– states and events.\n2.1.3 Spatiotemporal Data Representation\nSpatiotemporal\
    \ database(8,14) concepts are the result of combining spatial and temporal data\
    \ concepts. Therefore, a\nspatiotemporal database is a temporal record of spatial\
    \ objects. This implies that changing spatial aspects such as geometry\nand/or\
    \ location with time are captured simultaneously by spatiotemporal object. A spatiotemporal\
    \ object can be represented\nas (NScT, ScT, T) where NScT is the time-stamped\
    \ non-spatial conventional component, ScT is the time-stamped spatial\ncomponent\
    \ and T is the temporal component indicating its valid time. The spatial and non-spatial\
    \ conventional components\ncan take many values along the timeline. ScT is a set\
    \ of records where each record contains a spatial component value at ith time\n\
    point, Ti. Similarly, NScT is a set of records where each record contains non-spatial\
    \ component value at time point, Ti. All Ti’s\nare contained in T and they do\
    \ not intersect.\nhttps://www.indjst.org/\n14\nRao / Indian Journal of Science\
    \ and Technology 2023;16(1):12–22\nThe mathematical model defining spatiotemporal\
    \ data structure is given below.\nSDS = ( THC, SC, TC) where\nSDS = Spatiotemporal\
    \ Data Structure\nTHC = Thematic Component\nSC = Spatial Component\nTC = Temporal\
    \ Component\nTHC = { (A,T) /A = Thematic Attribute Λ T = Temporal Attribute }\n\
    SC = { (S,T) /S = Spatial Attribute Λ T = Temporal Attribute }\nTC = { T / T =\
    \ Temporal Attribute }\nThematic Attributes are non-spatial properties of spatial\
    \ objects whose values may change with time. Spatial Attributes are\ngeometry\
    \ and location of the spatial objects whose values also may change with time.\
    \ Temporal Attributes are temporal point\nand temporal interval.\nThe practical\
    \ classification of changes of spatiotemporal objects can be described as geometric\
    \ change and thematic change.\nGeometric change can further be classified as born,\
    \ growing, shrinking, dying and location change.\n2.2 Spatiotemporal Data Models\n\
    A conceptual framework for describing and computing the real world is generally\
    \ provided by a data model. The spatiotemporal\ndata model is the key to handling\
    \ spatial and temporal data because representation of spatio-temporal data and\
    \ operations\nperformed on such data are dealt by the model. The key issue is\
    \ the representation and querying of spatiotemporal changes\nbecause it is primarily\
    \ in this aspect that spatio-temporal databases differ from spatial databases.\
    \ Spatiotemporal phenomena\nmodeling and representation is also complex\nVarious\
    \ models proposed(14,15) are Space-Time Cube, snapshot model, Space-Time Composite\
    \ (STC) Model, Triad Model,\nEvent-based Spatiotemporal Data Model, Spatio-Temporal\
    \ Entity-Relationship (STER) Model, Three-Domain Model, The\nHistory Graph Model,\
    \ Object-Oriented Data Models and Moving Object Spatiotemporal Data Model.\nThe\
    \ snapshot model applies timestamp to layers and has the data redundancy problem.\
    \ The Space-Time composite data\nmodel timestamps the attributes. The Spatiotemporal\
    \ Object Model applies timestamps to spatial objects. An Event-based data\nmodel\
    \ needs to merge changed states to the first layer to generate a recent state.\
    \ Modeling using object-oriented data models is\neasy, but their implementation\
    \ is difficult. Appropriateness of the spatiotemporal data model depends on the\
    \ application that\nuses it. All these models provide weak support for spatiotemporal\
    \ changes that involve more than one object such as split and\nmerge. Most spatiotemporal\
    \ data models(14,15) are reviewed, applied to land information system case study,\
    \ and are critically\nevaluated and compared to identify open issues and problems\
    \ for further investigation. The model used in this paper is object-\nrelational\
    \ model with provision to capture split and merge of spatial objects during their\
    \ temporal evolution.\n2.3 Spatiotemporal Data Analysis\nSpatiotemporal data analysis(16)\
    \ that integrates temporal and spatial aspects of the data leads to a more fundamental\n\
    understanding of the dynamic processes involved in applications such as water\
    \ management, Pest location and distribution\nanalysis and traffic congestion\
    \ analysis. A multidimensional model for exploratory spatiotemporal analysis focused\
    \ on\ncomputational support for reasoning about data at various levels and at\
    \ multiple dimensions. The concepts embodied in\nhierarchy theory are extremely\
    \ relevant for analysis in the spatiotemporal domain. Hierarchical reasoning supports\
    \ the study\nof scale and categorization effects in data analysis. Spatiotemporal\
    \ analysis can be grouped as follows.\n• Temporal data analysis\n• Spatial data\
    \ analysis\n• Static spatiotemporal data analysis\n• Dynamic spatiotemporal data\
    \ analysis\nSpatial dimension is fixed in temporal data analysis and then change\
    \ in thematic attributes data with time is analyzed.\nAnalysis of phenological\
    \ parameters(17) of a crop over a time is an example of this category. Temporal\
    \ dimension is fixed in\nspatial data analysis and then change of thematic attributes\
    \ data with changing distance from a spatial reference is analyzed.\nAn example\
    \ of this category is analysis of change in humidity and temperature values with\
    \ varying distance from seacoast\nat a given time. Thematic attribute dimensions\
    \ and temporal dimensions are fixed in static spatiotemporal data analysis and\n\
    then the spatial data are analyzed. Identifying regions having the same soil moisture\
    \ at same time is an example of this type\nof analysis(18). Thematic attributes\
    \ dimensions are fixed in dynamic spatiotemporal data analysis and then changes\
    \ in spatial\nhttps://www.indjst.org/\n15\nRao / Indian Journal of Science and\
    \ Technology 2023;16(1):12–22\nattribute values with time are analyzed. The dynamic\
    \ Spatiotemporal data analysis applications can be grouped into three major\n\
    categories based on the kind of spatiotemporal data change.\n• Applications dealing\
    \ with location change of spatial objects with time: In this category of applications,\
    \ objects change their\nlocation with time, but not their geometry or shape, for\
    \ example, combine harvester moving in an agriculture farm for crop\nharvesting.\n\
    • Applications dealing with shape change of spatial objects with time. Two sub\
    \ classes of this category are applications dealing\nwith continuous change of\
    \ shape of spatial objects such as forest fire and applications dealing with discrete\
    \ change of shape of\nthe spatial objects such as change of geometry of “land-parcels”\
    \ or “rivers” in cadastral information systems. Spread of flood,\nspatial variability\
    \ of soil and plant parameters(19) over time are examples that fall in this category.\n\
    • Applications dealing with both location and shape change of spatial objects\
    \ with time. For example, a ‘storm’ or a cyclone\nis recorded as a moving phenomenon,\
    \ which changes its location and geometry over time.\n2.4 Spatio-temporal Database\
    \ Design\nSpatiotemporal Database Design involves study of different requirements\
    \ of various spatiotemporal applications, the\nrequirements analysis, and then\
    \ design. Various types of spatiotemporal applications requirements are surveyed,\
    \ an object-\noriented analysis of the requirements and design of generic Spatiotemporal\
    \ Database schema for applications is done and\nreported in(15).\nThere are two\
    \ approaches to handle representation of various versions of a spatiotemporal\
    \ object in the design.\ni) Representation of changes at object level\nii) Representation\
    \ of changes at attribute level\nThe first approach calls for creation of a new\
    \ object identifier (oid) for each version of the object and chaining the object\n\
    identifiers for tracking the object evolution. The second approach involves maintaining\
    \ the same object identifier (oid) with\nversions linked to changing attributes.\
    \ The attributes can be grouped into three categories.\ni) Version Significant\
    \ attributes\nii) Version insignificant attributes\niii) Invariant attributes\n\
    Updating the values of first category attributes is to be done in a non-destructive\
    \ manner. The second category attribute\nvalues can be updated in a destructive\
    \ manner. The third category attribute values are not allowed to be modified.\n\
    The mathematical representation of the relations in the spatiotemporal database\
    \ designed in(15) is presented below. The L.H.S\nis the table name and R.H.S is\
    \ the list of attributes in the table.\nSpatial_Objects_Table = (Object_Id, Object_Geom,\
    \ From_Time, To_Time, Object_Category, Object_Type, Change_Type,\nGspi_Flag)\n\
    Split_Table = (Object_Id, New_Object_Id, Split_Time)\nMerge_Table = (Object_Id,\
    \ New_Object_Id, Mergr_Time)\nGeom_Version_Table = (Object_Id, New_Object_Id,\
    \ Change_Time)\nAttribute_Info_Table = (Object_Id, Attribute_Id, Attribute_Name,\
    \ Attribute_Type, Attribute_Category)\nVersion_Insignficant_Attribute_Table =\
    \ (Object_Id, Attribute_Id, Attribute_Value)\nVersion_Signficant_Attribute_Table\
    \ = (Object_Id, Attribute_Id, Attribute_Value, Version_From_Time, Version_To_Time)\n\
    Temporal_Table = (Change_Occur_Time)\nUsing this Spatiotemporal database, the\
    \ applications for discovering History Topology and Topological Relationships\
    \ of\nspatiotemporal objects are developed and reported in(15). Systematic Survey\
    \ on issues, tasks and applications of Spatiotemporal\nData analysis and mining\
    \ is described in(7,14).\n2.5 Data-Driven Smart Agriculture Platform\nCapturing\
    \ data in agriculture using smart sensors(4) and developing potential spatiotemporal\
    \ database applications(9) are\ncrucial for digital agriculture. Information-based\
    \ management cycle(20) for Data driven agriculture is described in Figure 1.\n\
    The platform refers to Soil, Plant, Water, Ambient and Sensors. It is the physical\
    \ means for acquisition of data. Data includes\nthe parameters measured from the\
    \ ambient, crop and soil using the sensors(5,21). The data goes through filtering\
    \ routines(18),\nStatistical, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\
    \ (ML) techniques(5,19,22,23) for getting only the right data and correct\ndecisions.\
    \ Finally, Actuation refers to the physical execution of an action commanded by\
    \ the decision system. As actions take\nplace over the soil, crop, or ambient,\
    \ the cycle starts. The responses of the soil, crop and ambient are then captured\
    \ by specialized\nsensors and the loop continues systematically till harvesting\
    \ time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle(20).\nhttps://www.indjst.org/\n\
    16\nRao / Indian Journal of Science and Technology 2023;16(1):12–22\nFig 1. Information-based\
    \ management cycle for Data driven agriculture\nRegardless of how better the soil\
    \ and crop are managed, a certain degree of spatial and temporal variability of\
    \ parameters\nexists for all fields by nature. The variability is influenced by\
    \ ambient and weather within a growing season and from year to year.\nThen, data\
    \ for several years may be collected and analyzed to determine trends in parameters\
    \ of interest. Hence data becomes a\nregular input into the farm information management\
    \ system. Therefore, the necessity of monitoring soil and crops comes from\nthe\
    \ existence of variability, but it is required to manage this variability in a\
    \ feasible way. A widely accepted method to do it is\nby dividing the field into\
    \ subfields, called field management zones. As subfield areas will have homogeneous\
    \ features, the crop\nmanagement practices can be customized to each management\
    \ zone. This results into a cost-effective and practical approach to\nPrecision\
    \ Agriculture. The adoption of management zones would reduce the usage of pesticides,\
    \ reduce the cost of fertilizing,\nimprove crop yields(22), and provide better\
    \ farm records and information for decision management systems(20). The taxonomy\n\
    of various spatiotemporal database applications in agriculture is described in(4).\n\
    3 Results and Discussion\nThe database schema designed can store spatial and temporal\
    \ variability of various parameters related to soil, crop, and weather.\nThis\
    \ is the key goal specified in future work in(19) to optimize application of fertilizers,\
    \ water, or pesticides to the crops. The\ndatabase can store the data with valid\
    \ timestamps for multiple crop cycles for a few years. This enables construction\
    \ of data\nwarehouse solutions for crops. The database schema design is also supporting\
    \ spatial split for each crop to create management\nzones (subfields) of the crop\
    \ to maintain the variability within the limits. The data warehouse built in(12)\
    \ can be enhanced by\nmodifying its fact table to incorporate field management\
    \ zones to have details at field zone level for better understanding of\nresults\
    \ and effective decision making. The database schema also incorporated spatial\
    \ merge, location, and geometric changes\nof spatiotemporal objects to develop\
    \ new applications for smart agriculture. As part of this, some of the Use cases\
    \ in smart\nagriculture are identified and few Spatiotemporal Attributes for each\
    \ Use case is described in Table 1 . The table also lists various\nreferences\
    \ of the applications that can be reengineered using the spatiotemporal database\

    \ discussion sections deals with the verification of the spatiotemporal database\
    \ schema for providing justification\non how it has achieved merits as mentioned\
    \ in the results and its adaption to data driven smart agriculture.\n3.1 Veriﬁcation\
    \ of Spatiotemporal Database Schema\nThe spatiotemporal database schema that is\
    \ presented in previous section 2.4 is being verified to ensure that it could\
    \ capture\nvarious changes of spatiotemporal objects during its lifetime. The\
    \ verification is done using\ni) Information Life Cycle Model\nii) Algorithmic\
    \ steps for processes that change spatial objects\niii) Adaption of the database\
    \ schema for a Use case in data driven smart agriculture\n3.1.1 The Design Veriﬁcation\
    \ using Lifecycle Model\nThe values of spatial attributes such as geometry, location\
    \ and non-spatial version significant attributes of the spatial objects\nmay change\
    \ with time. Whenever the value of the version significant attribute of any spatial\
    \ object is changed, a new record is\ncreated with the values of the object identifier,\
    \ attribute identifier, new value, and time of change. This new record is stored\
    \ in\nVersion_Significant_Attribute_Table of the spatiotemporal database. This\
    \ provision in the design enables storage of spatial and\ntemporal variability\
    \ of soil, plant, and water parameters for optimization of application of fertilizers,\
    \ pesticides, and water.\nHow changes of geometry and location of a spatial object\
    \ were captured into the spatiotemporal database is described in\nthe information\
    \ life cycle model as shown in Figure 2 . The geometry of the spatial object,\
    \ when first created, is stored in\nSpatial_Object_Table with its creation time.\
    \ Whenever the object ceases to exist, its time is recorded in the same table.\
    \ This\nfacilitates capturing the parameters for entire duration of the crop cycle\
    \ as each crop is stored in the table as a spatial object.\nChanges that occur\
    \ to spatial object during its lifetime can be categorized as follows:\ni) Spatial\
    \ object splits into two or more objects\nii) Two or more spatial objects merge\
    \ to form a new spatial object\niii) The geometry of the spatial object changes\n\
    iv) The location of the spatial object changes\nhttps://www.indjst.org/\n18\n\
    Rao / Indian Journal of Science and Technology 2023;16(1):12–22\nFig 2. Information\
    \ Life Cycle Model Showing Changes of Spatial Object with time\nv) Both geometry\
    \ and location of the spatial object change\nWhenever any spatial object gets\
    \ split into two or more objects, the details of split are recorded in Split_Table.\
    \ The object that\ngot split ceases to exist and the new objects, created due\
    \ to split, are recorded in Spatial_Objects_Table. Handling spatial object\nsplit\
    \ event facilitate division of crop into field management zones based on spatial\
    \ and temporal variability of the parameters\nfor customization of crop management\
    \ practices. Whenever two or more spatial objects get merged to form new spatial\
    \ object,\nthe details of the merge are recorded in Merge_Table. The objects which\
    \ participated in merge cease to exist and the new object\ncreated is stored in\
    \ Spatial_Objects_Table. This feature of the database enables to merge field management\
    \ zones to form larger\none when spatial and temporal variability of the parameters\
    \ for the zones is insignificant.\nThe geometry change that occurs to spatial\
    \ object over time can be handled in two ways as discussed below. This helps in\n\
    applications such as climate change and spatial spread of flood over time.\ni)\
    \ The time of change to the geometry of the spatial object is recorded in Geom_Version_Table\
    \ and new geometry of the object\nis stored as a new spatial object in Spatial_Object_Table.\
    \ The link between old object identifier and the new object identifier is\nmaintained\
    \ in Geom_Version_Table. The old object now ceases to exist.\nii) A new object\
    \ with old object identifier is created to represent the geometry change and this\
    \ new object is stored in\nSpatial_Object_Table. The creation time of old and\
    \ new object is different even though their object identifiers are same.\nThe\
    \ location change occurring to the spatial object is captured by forming a new\
    \ version for the object with same identifier\nbut with different time of creation\
    \ and storing it in Spatial_Object_Table. The creation times of old and new versions\
    \ of the object\nare different even though their object identifiers are same.\
    \ This feature of the database facilitates tracking of farm equipment\nand products.\
    \ If both location and the geometry of the object are changed, then this is captured\
    \ by forming a new version for\nthe object with same identifier but with different\
    \ time of creation and storing it in Spatial_Object_Table. This feature of the\n\
    database helps in cyclone tracking applications to represent spread and location\
    \ of the cyclone.\n3.1.2 The Design Veriﬁcation through Algorithmic Steps\nThe\
    \ algorithmic steps of formal process description for the changes of spatial object\
    \ in the life cycle model are described below.\nEach formal step is numbered in\
    \ sequence and brief explanation is give below the step if required.\nStep 1.\
    \ SO = (id, Geom)\nSO is a Spatial Object type with its identifier (id) and Geometry\
    \ (Geom).\nStep 2. Create( s1: SO, t: Timestamp)\nStore tuple (s1,t) into Spatial_Objects_Table\

    \ Database Schema for Smart Irrigation System\nThis section discusses how the\
    \ spatiotemporal database schema, discussed so far, can be used in realizing “Smart\
    \ Irrigation\nSystem” Use case. The smart irrigation system uses various sensors(4)\
    \ and different methods for sensing(21) the parameters at\nregular intervals.\

    \ Journal of Science and Technology 2023;16(1):12–22\nVarious attributes/fields\
    \ identified for smart irrigation system and the corresponding tables of the database\
    \ schema are\nmentioned in Table 2. The algorithmic steps specified in section\
    \ 3.1.2 are used for creating these attributes and the database\nstores the spatiotemporal\
    \ data for the agriculture farm as discussed in the Life cycle model. Once sufficient\
    \ data is available\nin the database, an appropriate machine learning models need\
    \ to be developed for dynamic irrigation scheduling so that\nthe performance of\
    \ application in(24) can be improved as the database schema has provision to create\
    \ and maintain field\nmanagement zones for optimal use of fertilizers, water or\
    \ pesticides.\nThe implementation methodology of Smart Irrigation System deals\
    \ with reading sensor values to database schema as\ndiscussed below.\ni) Dividing\
    \ the form field into zones based on various features such as slope, soil type,\
    \ fertility values, crop to be grown etc.\nii) Installation of various sensors\
    \ such as Moisture sensor, Humidity sensor, Temperature sensor etc. at identified\
    \ location in\nthe field for measuring values of the respective variables.\niii)\
    \ Connecting the sensors to Arduino or Raspberry PI board. Connect both Arduino\
    \ and Raspberry PI together to have\nplenty of sensors connected because\n• Arduino\
    \ Mega has 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTS, 54 digital inputs, 15 of those can be used\
    \ for PWM. and all of them can be\nassigned as outputs by software, and a USB\
    \ port.\n• Raspberry Pi 3 has over 26 GPIO pins. But Raspberry Pi has only digital\
    \ pins and no analog pins like Arduino. Raspberry\nPI can also be used for communicating\
    \ the data to other systems.\niv) Following is a listing of few example sensors\
    \ that can be connected to Raspberry PI.\n• DHT11 and DHT22 humidity and temperature\
    \ sensor\n• BMP180 Barometer\n• MCP3008 Soil sensor\n• MQ Gas Sensor\n• PIR Motion\
    \ Sensor\n• HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor\n• Magnetic Switch / Reed Relay\n• GP2Y0A02YK\
    \ infrared distance meter\n• RFID-RC522 – Inductive RFID card reader\n• MPU-6050\
    \ Gyroscope\nv) A multithreaded python program is to be loaded into Raspberry\
    \ PI to configure and carryout following tasks.\n• Read the sensors data and do\
    \ required calibration. It uses spidev and time packages of python.\n• Install\
    \ Raspberry-gpio-python or RPi. GPIO Python module to control the GPIO interface\
    \ on the Raspberry Pi and gpsd-\nclients Module to communicate with the GPS daemon\
    \ that in turn communicates with the GPS receiver for getting latitude and\nlongitude\
    \ information. GSM/GPRS module can be used to establish communication between\
    \ a computer and a GSM-GPRS\nsystem.\n• Pack the sensor data and send it to the\
    \ connected clients. It uses python socket programming. The server software runs\
    \ in\nRaspberry PI and Client runs on field server.\nvi) Install PostgreSQL, Post\
    \ GIS and create the database schema using SQL. Connect to Raspberry PI using\
    \ the Python socket\nclient module, then receive the data from Raspberry PI and\
    \ store it in the database.\nvii) As the field server is limited in its storage\
    \ and processing capacity, the data from the field server can be loaded into\n\
    Spatiotemporal Big Data Processing System such as ST-Hadoop or Beast or JUST.\
    \ Apache Flume tool can be used for this\npurpose.\nviii) The spatiotemporal big\
    \ data can be used to build and test machine learning and deep learning models\
    \ for using in\ndecision making in Smart agriculture. The Apache Mahout or Spark\
    \ MLLib can be used to build machine learning models.\n4 Conclusion\nThe fundamental\
    \ nature of Spatial, Temporal and Spatiotemporal data and its modeling is analyzed\
    \ and described well.\nThe literature survey addressed requirements of spatiotemporal\
    \ applications and object-oriented analysis and design of\nspatiotemporal database.\
    \ The generic spatiotemporal database schema to support spatiotemporal applications\
    \ in smart\nagriculture is presented. The database schema is verified using the\

    \ AND APPLICATIONS\nMuhammad Zaigham Abbas Shah, Syed\nNovember 8, 2022\nInternet\
    \ of Things is a system that integrates different devices and technologies,\n\
    removing the necessity of human intervention. This enables the capacity of having\n\
    smart (or smarter) cities around the world. By hosting different technologies\
    \ and al-\nlowing interactions between them, the internet of things has spearheaded\
    \ the develop-\nment of smart city systems for sustainable living, increased comfort\
    \ and productivity\nfor citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart Cities\
    \ has many different domains\nand draws upon various underlying systems for its\
    \ operation, in this work, we provide\na holistic coverage of the Internet of\
    \ Things in Smart Cities by discussing the fun-\ndamental components that make\
    \ up the IoT Smart City landscape, the technologies\nthat enable these domains\
    \ to exist, the most prevalent practices and techniques which\nare used in these\
    \ domains as well as the challenges that deployment of IoT systems for\nsmart\
    \ cities encounter and which need to be addressed for ubiquitous use of smart\
    \ city\napplications. It also presents a coverage of optimization methods and\
    \ applications\nfrom a smart city perspective enabled by the Internet of Things.\
    \ Towards this end,\na mapping is provided for the most encountered applications\
    \ of computational opti-\nmization within IoT smart cities for five popular optimization\
    \ methods, ant colony\noptimization, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization,\
    \ artificial bee colony op-\ntimization and differential evolution. For each application\
    \ identified, the algorithms\nused, objectives considered, the nature of the formulation\
    \ and constraints taken in\nv\nto account have been specified and discussed. Lastly,\
    \ the data setup used by each\ncovered work is also mentioned and directions for\
    \ future work have been identified.\nWithin the smart health domain of IoT smart\
    \ cities, human activity recognition\nhas been a key study topic in the development\
    \ of cyber physical systems and as-\nsisted living applications. In particular,\
    \ inertial sensor based systems have become\nincreasingly popular because they\
    \ do not restrict users’ movement and are also rel-\natively simple to implement\
    \ compared to other approaches. Fall detection is one of\nthe most important tasks\
    \ in human activity recognition. With an increasingly aging\nworld population\
    \ and an inclination by the elderly to live alone, the need to incor-\nporate\
    \ dependable fall detection schemes in smart devices such as phones, watches\n\
    has gained momentum. Therefore, differentiating between falls and activities of\
    \ daily\nliving (ADLs) has been the focus of researchers in recent years with\
    \ very good results.\nHowever, one aspect within fall detection that has not been\
    \ investigated much is di-\nrection and severity aware fall detection. Since a\
    \ fall detection system aims to detect\nfalls in people and notify medical personnel,\
    \ it could be of added value to health pro-\nfessionals tending to a patient suffering\
    \ from a fall to know the nature of the accident.\nIn this regard, as a case study\
    \ for smart health, four different experiments have been\nconducted for the task\
    \ of fall detection with direction and severity consideration on\ntwo publicly\
    \ available datasets. These four experiments not only tackle the problem\non an\
    \ increasingly complicated level (the first one considers a fall only scenario\
    \ and\nthe other two a combined activity of daily living and fall scenario) but\
    \ also present\nmethodologies which outperform the state of the art techniques\
    \ as discussed. Lastly,\nfuture recommendation have also been provided for researchers.\n\

    Motivation\nThe world is experiencing a bulging world population and increasing\
    \ urbanization\nwhich is set to grow by more than 10% in the next 30 years [1]\
    \ resulting in a total\nof 70% living in cities by 2050. Countries around the\
    \ world are looking at equipping\ntheir cities to deal with the influx of people\
    \ and the stress it will bring to current\ncity systems [2]. This is to be performed\
    \ keeping in view the UN Sustainable De-\nvelopment Goals 2030 [3]. In this regard,\
    \ Smart Cities have come out as a major\ninitiative by various governments in\
    \ making cities more navigable and welcoming to\nthe expected population increase\
    \ and providing city dwellers a better living experi-\nence, as is evidenced by\
    \ the multiple projects ongoing on both the public and private\nlevel [4, 5, 6,\
    \ 7]. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been the prime enabler of smart\ncities\
    \ as it has provided the means in terms of sensors, architectures, storage and\n\
    other technologies to instrument cities. It allows stakeholders to gather data,\
    \ pro-\ncess it and then make decisions based on the analyses performed. There\
    \ are various\ndomains within smart cities, these include Smart Agriculture, Smart\
    \ City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\
    \ Infrastructure and\nSmart Transportation.With improvement of Artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) capabilities\nin the last decade, there have been different applications\
    \ of machine learning (ML)\nand deep learning (DL) algorithms within each of these\
    \ domains providing for better\ndecision making and improvement of services. Apart\
    \ from various supervised and un-\nsupervised learning applications, several tasks\
    \ within different components of smart\ncities can be formulated into optimization\
    \ problems and/or require heuristics to be\nincorporated in some form. However,\
    \ in both such tasks, there is a dearth of an\noverall coverage of Smart City\
    \ IoT based ML/DL and combinatorial optimization\nproblems. Such a coverage would\
    \ be very beneficial to researchers starting in the\nfield and has been presented\
    \ herein.\nOne of the major applications of the IoT Smart Cities is for health\
    \ purposes.\nMany countries around the world, especially in the developed world\
    \ are facing an\naging population. With the retirement of the ’baby boomer’ generation,\
    \ countries\naround the world are facing a big question over caring for their\
    \ elderly population.\nOne of the major issues that elderly people face today\
    \ are falls [8]. In the US, falls\naccount for a majority of the deaths caused\
    \ by injury in population aged 65 and\nabove [9] and a fall related injury occurs\
    \ every 19 minutes [10]. As indicated in [11],\nfalls have been associated with\
    \ estimated medical costs ranging from $31.5 billion for\n2013 to $49.5 billion\
    \ for 2017. Moreover, Floerence et al. [12] notes that in 2018,\nfalls contributed\
    \ to 8% of Medicaid expenses in the US for older adults, consequently\n1\nfalls\
    \ have huge health as well as financial ramifications for people and governments.\n\
    Determining when a person has experienced a fall is therefore an important task\
    \ in\nthe healthcare of people, more so in the old age population who tend to\
    \ increasingly\nlive alone and are at increased risk of suffering from falls.\
    \ Apart from just detecting\nif a fall has occurred or not, the direction of a\
    \ fall is an important consideration\nas well. Bourke et al. [13] notes that even\
    \ though 60% of falls occurring in older\nadults are forward falls, falls occurring\
    \ sideways may result in fracture and thus\nare important to determine. Quick\
    \ dispatch of healthcare providers can result in\ntimely treatment of fall related\
    \ injuries, thereby reducing the overall impact to life\nand wealth. Additional\
    \ information about the fall could benefit the medical dispatch\nteam to help\
    \ decide emergency procedures which could be matched up with patient\nhistory\
    \ of potentially being injury prone in a certain part of the body. In light of\

    CHAPTER II\nIOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides an overeview\
    \ of the use of IoT in Smart Cities and discuss\nhow it facilitates such initiatives.\
    \ It starts by laying out the structure of Internet\nof Things in a Smart City\
    \ context, discussing its various applications, components\nand architectures\
    \ while also discussing the technologies used at the different levels of\nthe\
    \ IoT architecture. Lastly, a discussion of the technical challenges that exist\
    \ in the\ndeployment of IoT in the Smart City domain is provided along with identification\
    \ of\npotential solutions to those challenges followed by future directions.\n\
    It is hard to define a Smart City, in fact, cities claim to be ‘smart’ based on\
    \ a\nvariety of criteria, for e.g. implementing novel e-governance schemes, creating\
    \ so-\ncial learning ventures and community engagement programs, focusing on sustainable\n\
    living as well as the more typical application of Information and Communication\n\
    Technologies for innovation [14]. In this work, Smart Cities are defined to be\
    \ the ap-\nplication of various information and communication technologies (ICT)\
    \ with the aim\nof creating a better living experience for a city’s population.\
    \ This encompasses use\nof these technologies in all the domains discussed previously,\
    \ including governance,\ntransport, housing, business, sustainable living, social\
    \ learning, community engage-\nment, providing opportunities and more. In an ideal\
    \ sense, the idea of a smart city\ntranscends the typically set boundaries of\
    \ a traditional city’s administrative and so-\ncial structure by allowing interaction\
    \ between the two, thereby enabling it to operate\nin a more cohesive and engaged\
    \ manner. Smart cities offer several advantages (in\nterms of value) compared\
    \ to a traditional city ecosystem:\n1. Climate goal achievement: Smart cities\
    \ are at the forefront of pioneering tech-\nnologies to help enable countries\
    \ meet climate goals. Smart city focuses on\nsmart energy management, smart transportation\
    \ systems and city administra-\ntion which aim to reduce the carbon footprint\
    \ of cities and enable development\nand use of new technologies for cleaner living.\n\
    2. Money value: Smart City ventures will be a market of USD 1 Trillion by 2025\n\
    [15], this provides a huge monetary incentive for not only governments but\nprivate\
    \ companies to actively contribute to the development of technologies\nsupporting\
    \ smart city development.\n3. Societal impact: The centerpiece of the smart city\
    \ project is to improve the qual-\nity of life of a city’s inhabitants and help\
    \ develop an inclusive society wherein\nevery opinion is catered for and equal\
    \ opportunity is provided. Information and\n3\nCommunication Technologies in the\
    \ smart city context are a fundamental com-\nponent to the provision of public\
    \ services by facilitating interactions of citizens\nwith the city environment\
    \ and making life easier.\n2\nSmart City Components\nA smart city is made up of\
    \ several components which are illustrated in Figure 1.\nSmart city applications\
    \ typically have four aspects associated with them, the first is\nthe collection\
    \ of data, the next is its transmission/reception, third is the storage and\n\
    fourth is analysis. The collection of data is application dependent and has been\
    \ a real\ndriver for sensor development in the various domains. The second part\
    \ is the exchange\nof data, this involves data transmission from the data collection\
    \ units towards the\ncloud for storage and analysis.\nThis task has been achieved\
    \ in several manners,\nmany smart city ventures have city-wide Wi-Fi networks,\
    \ 4G and 5G technologies are\nbeing used, as well as various types of local networks\
    \ which can convey data either\non a local level or a global level. The third\
    \ stage is storage in the cloud, different\nstorage schemes are used to arrange\
    \ and organize data so as to make it usable for\nthe fourth stage which is data\
    \ analysis. Data Analysis refers to the extraction of\npatterns and inferences\
    \ from the gathered data to guide decision making. In some\nsituations, simple\
    \ analysis such as basic decision making and aggregating would work\ntoo. For\
    \ more complex decision making, the availability of the cloud allows not only\n\
    for heterogeneous data gathering/storage and processing but also analysis through\n\
    the use of statistical methods as well as machine and deep Learning algorithms\
    \ in\nreal-time [16].\n2.1\nSmart Agriculture\nFood security is one of the most\
    \ important parts of the United Nations Sustainable\nDevelopment goals for 2030.\
    \ With an increasing world population, worsening climate\nchange causing erratic\
    \ weather in food centers of the world, the race to ensure that\nfood production\
    \ is made sustainable and that dwindling resources such as water are\nutilized\
    \ efficiently has been a high priority for countries around the world. Smart\n\
    agriculture is the use of sensors embedded into plants and fields to measure various\n\
    parameters to help in decision making and prevent/diseases, pests etc [17]. A\
    \ part\nof the smart agriculture paradigm is precision agriculture, which involves\
    \ sensors\nbeing placed in plants to provide targeted measurements and therefore\
    \ allow for\ntargeted care mechanisms to be deployed. Precision agriculture will\
    \ be necessary\nfor food security in the future [18] and therefore is an essential\
    \ part of the fight for\nsustainable food production. The major applications of\
    \ AI in IoT for agriculture are\ncrop monitoring/disease detection and data driven\
    \ crop care and decision making.\n2.2\nSmart City Services\nSmart city services\
    \ encompass the activities that sustain a city’s population, these\ninvolve municipal\
    \ tasks such as supply of water, waste management, environmental\n4\nSmart \n\
    Energy\nSmart \nTransportation\nSmart \nAgriculture\nSmart \nInfrastructure\n\
    Smart  \nCity Services\nSmart Health\nSmart Homes\nSmart  Industry\nFigure 1.\
    \ Smart City Components\ncontrol and monitoring etc. Sensors for water quality\
    \ can be deployed to continually\nprovide an update about the quality of water\
    \ being used in the city and detect leaks\n[19]. One popular component of smart\
    \ city initiatives is the management of waste,\nand it has been the part of many\
    \ of the smart city initiatives mentioned earlier, from\nchutes in Barcelona to\
    \ having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud\nso as to not only\
    \ inform the relevant authorities of the need to empty them but also\nusing AI\
    \ to determine the best route to reduce cost [20]. Sensors can also be used to\n\
    monitor the environmental conditions in a city to determine pollution levels [21]\
    \ and\nguiding citizens to the next free parking space to save fuel costs [22].\n\
    2.3\nSmart Energy\nTypical electrical systems have one-way energy flow from a\
    \ main generator source,\nusually a hydroelectric or fossil fuel based power plant.\
    \ Power generation is controlled\nvia feedback from the substations, however,\
    \ since there is no information feedback\nfrom the consumer end, the power generation\
    \ scheme used with these systems requires\nthat the power being produced by these\
    \ sources outstrips the demand by a large\namount to ensure continuous supply\
    \ of power. The process of detecting faults and\nperforming corrective actions\
    \ in such systems is also a time taking process. Moreover,\nwith renewable energy\
    \ technologies becoming cheaper, the consumer of today not\nonly has a supply\
    \ from the main utility but also performs their own generation.\nSmart Grids is\
    \ the use of ICT to make the current and newly installed grids more\nobservable,\
    \ allow for distributed energy generation, both at the consumer end as well\n\
    as the utility end and introduce self-healing capabilities in to the grid. One\
    \ aspect\n5\nof smart grids is that real time power data is transmitted to utilities\
    \ at different\npoints on the grid throughout the supply lines till the customer.\
    \ Since smart grids\nprovide real-time data about consumer usage, it allows for\
    \ better management of\npower generation using prediction models developed through\
    \ acquired consumption\ndata, integrating different energy sources as well as\
    \ self-healing [23] of the network\nto ensure an uninterrupted supply.\n2.4\n\
    Smart Health\nSmart Health refers to the use of ICT to improve health care availability\
    \ and quality.\nWith an increasing population and rising costs of healthcare,\
    \ this area has been of\nintense focus of researchers as well as healthcare providers.\
    \ Current health systems\nare over burdened and therefore cannot cater to the\
    \ increasing demand from the pop-\nulace. In this regard, smart health aims to\
    \ ensure that healthcare be available to as\nmany people as possible through telemedicine\
    \ services [24] and improved diagnosis\nassistance to doctors utilizing AI [25].\
    \ With the ubiquitousness of mobile phones\nand health trackers [26] that can\
    \ capture real-time data about peoples health (ECGs,\ntemperature, body oxygen\
    \ saturation and other biosensors) while also recording daily\nactivity and detecting\
    \ abnormal movements using inertial sensors, it has become pos-\nsible to leverage\
    \ cloud capabilities for processing this data to make better healthcare\ndecisions.\
    \ Thus reducing the overall costs as well as burden on healthcare facilities.\n\
    2.5\nSmart Home\nOne major component of Smart Cities is the Smart Home since it\
    \ is central to the\nlife of the city’s inhabitants. Smart Homes involve the use\
    \ of sensing units installed\nthroughout a person’s home that provide information\
    \ about the home as well as\nits occupants. These sensors might include user activity\
    \ monitors such as ambient\nsensors, motion trackers and power/energy consumption.\n\
    2.6\nSmart Industry\nIndustries around the world are busy in a continuous pursuance\
    \ of being more ef-\nficient and increasing productivity while reducing cost.\
    \ The industry 4.0 paradigm\nentails the vision of a connected factory where all\
    \ its intermediary functionaries are\nseamlessly integrated, working in tandem\
    \ with each other. This is made possible be-\ncause of the internet of things\
    \ [27]. The use of IoT in manufacturing and production\nprocesses, cyber physical\
    \ systems integrating workers and machines has led to several\nbenefits to the\
    \ industry such as faster and better innovation, optimization of manu-\nfacturing\
    \ schemes (resources and processes), better quality of products and enhanced\n\
    safety for factory workers. However, smart industries come with several challenges\n\
    for IoT usage, working with a set of heterogeneous devices and machines has its\
    \ own\nchallenges and requires cyber physical systems to have flexibility in configuration,\
    \ con-\nnectivity and quick implementation for use in IoT applications for Smart\
    \ Industry\n[28]. Artificial Intelligence has gone hand in hand with IoT to spur\
    \ the development\nand deployment of industry 4.0 services. With sensors being\
    \ embedded in machines\n6\nand other processes in the factory, data from these\
    \ sources provide an opportunity for\nusing AI techniques to increase automation,\
    \ perform business intelligence operations\nand more. In fact, researchers have\
    \ suggested frameworks for integrating AI within\nIoT for Smart Industry [28,\
    \ 29, 30]. The major applications of AI in the industry are\npredictive maintenance,\
    \ monitoring/fault detection (machine health) and production\nmanagement.\n2.7\n\
    Smart Infrastructure\nThe infrastructure of a city is paramount to its living\
    \ quality, city governments need\nto construct new bridges, roads and buildings\
    \ for the use of its inhabitants and also\nperform maintenance for uninterrupted\
    \ usage. Smart infrastructure helps cities in\nensuring their infrastructure is\
    \ in shape and usable by utilizing sensors for measuring\nbuilding/bridge structural\
    \ state for structural health monitoring using accelerome-\nters [31] and smart\
    \ materials [32]. Data collected through these sensors allows for\npredictive\
    \ maintenance of these essential units to maintain normal operation of the\ncity.\n\
    2.8\nSmart Transport\nMany urban centers suffer from traffic problems, this includes\
    \ congestion, pollution,\nscheduling and cost reduction issues for public transport.\
    \ The rapid development\nand implementation of new Information and Communication\
    \ Technologies, Vehicle-\nInfrastructure-Pedestrian communication has become commonplace.\
    \ Whether it be\nVehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle\
    \ to Pedestrian (V2P)\nor Pedestrian to Infrastructure (P2I), such technologies\
    \ have made the design of smart\ntransportation systems possible. With cars having\
    \ a GPS device and the common-\nality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\
    \ use GPS data to track driver\nbehavior and traffic patterns [33]. This real-time\
    \ data is already used for route map-\nping in applications such as Waze and Google\
    \ Maps and used for trip scheduling in\npublic transport. Parking systems equipped\
    \ with sensors can also guide drivers to\nthe nearest free parking spot.\n3\n\
    Internet of Things for Smart Cities\nAt the heart of the smart city initiatives\
    \ is the internet of things, it is the enabling\ntechnology that has allowed for\
    \ the pervasive digitization that gives rise to the con-\ncept of smart cities.\
    \ The internet of things refers to the ubiquitous connection of\ndevices to the\
    \ internet, allowing them to send information to the cloud and poten-\ntially\
    \ get directions for performing actions. IoT involves the collection of data and\n\
    performing data analytics operations to extract information in order to support\
    \ de-\ncision and policy making. It is estimated that by 2025 more than 75 billion\
    \ devices\nwill be connected to the internet [34], spearheading even more application\
    \ develop-\nment. Within the smart city context, IoT allows for sensors to collect\
    \ and send data\n7\nabout the city’s state to a central cloud, which is then mined\
    \ or processed for pattern\nextraction and decision-making purposes.\n3.1\nIoT\
    \ Architectures for Smart cities\nThe Internet of Things unifies the operations\
    \ of data sensing, transmission/recep-\ntion, processing and storage through the\
    \ use cloud services. Based on technology, a\ngeneric IoT architecture consists\
    \ of five layers where successive layers operate on the\ninformation from the\
    \ previous layer as shown in Figure 2. It also shows the three\ndifferent architectures\
    \ that exist for IoT systems.\nCloud Computing\nEdge computing\nFog Computing\n\

    Layer\nNetwork Layer\nSensing Layer\nFigure 2. IoT Architecture\nThe Sensing layer,\
    \ also called the Perception layer consists of sensors that can\nget information\
    \ about physical quantities of interest in any application as well as\nactuators\
    \ which can act upon physical objects, such as Radio Frequency IDentification\n\
    (RFID) readers for reading RFID tags and other such devices. The data read by\
    \ the\nsensing layer is passed onward to the Middleware layer using the networking\
    \ layer\nthrough wireless network technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular internet,\
    \ Zigbee and\nBluetooth etc.\nThe Middleware layer provides a generic interface\
    \ for the sensing\nlayer hardware and the Application layer which uses the data\
    \ through various API’s\nand database management services to provide users with\
    \ services. The Business layer\nis attached to the application layer and is used\
    \ to develop strategies and formulate\npolicies that help manage the complete\
    \ system.\nIn terms of architectures, typically, IoT architectures are categorized\
    \ based on\nthe type of operation responsibilities allocated to parts of the IoT\
    \ system, this cat-\negorization is based mainly on processing of data responsibilities.\
    \ There are three\narchitectures of IoT systems with respect to the stage of the\
    \ IoT framework where\nprocessing of data can be carried out and these are Cloud,\
    \ Fog and Edge Models.\nTable 1 lists the traits of each of three layers of the\
    \ IoT system. It is important to\n8\nmention that the three IoT architectures\
    \ discussed here are not mutually exclusive,\ninstead the aim of this hierarchy\
    \ is to complement the higher layer by providing it only\nuseful information which\
    \ makes the system more productive and dependable. For any\nIoT system designer,\
    \ the aim is to establish a balance between the capabilities of the\nthree layers\
    \ keeping in view system costs and requirements.\n3.1.1\nCloud Computing Model\n\
    This was the first proposed architecture for IoT systems and is based on the premise\n\
    that processing of data from the various components in the IoT system should take\n\
    place in the cloud. Cloud computing allows for the remote accessing of uninterrupted\n\
    shared resources (computing, storage and services) over the network. It should\
    \ be\nable to dynamically allocate these resources without human intervention,\
    \ schedule\nor pool as necessary and be able to be accessed from a variety of\
    \ different platforms\n[35]. The cloud can provide both hardware as well as software\
    \ services for smart city\napplications. It has the advantage that it provides\
    \ a central management platform\nfrom which to observe, control the IoT system\
    \ as well as to disseminate command\nactions based on the received data. Moreover,\
    \ this centralization also allows for cloud\nsystems to have sufficiently large\
    \ computing and storage capacities thereby allowing\nthem to perform complex tasks\
    \ of data mining, pattern extraction and making infer-\nences from sensor data\
    \ in smart cities to make use of it in the best manner possible.\nHowever, there\
    \ are a few disadvantages with using the cloud computing model for\nthe IoT. First,\
    \ transmitting all gathered data to the cloud increases network traffic,\neven\
    \ though this may not be true for applications in which measurements are not\n\
    very frequent, but in other cases, this could increase network costs. Moreover,\
    \ data\ntransmission overheads may increase due to the large amount of data that\
    \ needs to\nbe transmitted by the many sensors existing in the smart city scenario.\
    \ Another\ndisadvantage that the cloud computing model suffers from is data latency,\
    \ since the\nsensing units exist at the sensing layer and the decision making/data\
    \ processing takes\nplace in the cloud, this gives rise to data latency in the\
    \ transmission of sensing infor-\nmation, especially when many devices start sending\
    \ data at the same time. Network\nreliability can be an issue when using this\
    \ model, with the large volume of data traffic\non the network, it might not be\
    \ possible to enforce robust data transmission schemes\nas IoT systems get bigger.\n\
    3.1.2\nFog Computing Model\nSince most of the information produced with in IoT\
    \ takes place towards the sensing\nend of the IoT system, also called the edge,\
    \ Fog Computing was proposed in [36]\nto overcome some of the problems of the\
    \ cloud computing model for the IoT. Fog\ncomputing provides a more diverse distribution\
    \ of responsibilities than are dictated\nby the cloud computing architecture by\
    \ moving some of the processing to devices\non the local network.\nTypically,\
    \ Fog computing refers to data processing that is\ncarried out by routers and\
    \ other network devices within in the Network layer in the\nIoT. Since network\
    \ devices nowadays increasingly offer better computational capabil-\n9\nities,\
    \ one can leverage them to perform rudimentary operations on data. Operations\n\
    such as aggregation and collection of sensor data, simple processing operations\
    \ and\ndecision-making can be performed to reduce the amount of information flow\
    \ towards\nthe higher cloud layer. Questions that need to be answered for the\
    \ decision-making\nprocess include but are not limited to for e.g., does the decision\
    \ require the use of\naveraging for one quantity and instantaneous values of the\
    \ other? Is it possible to\nextrapolate data received for one quantity and use\
    \ the currently measured value for\nanother one? Based on the previous data for\
    \ a given period, can one provide higher\nlayers with decision options rather\
    \ than just data, thereby providing better quality\ninformation to the cloud layer\
    \ thus resulting in better utilization of cloud resources.\nFog layers can localize\
    \ decision making since they have access to the local state of a\ngiven region\
    \ [37]. This would be helpful in implementing distributed decision mak-\ning mechanisms\
    \ which might be necessary in some applications. Moreover, they also\nallow for\
    \ local networks to be established using non-internet technologies such as Zig-\n\
    bee, Bluetooth, RFID etc where sensors and other end devices transmit data to\
    \ the\nFog node (also referred to as access points in such systems) which is connected\
    \ to the\ncloud.\nFog computing results in reduced costs for deployment of IoT\
    \ systems, increases ro-\nbustness as latency, data overhead and errors in transmission\
    \ are reduced. This also\nimproves the efficiency of the applications as quicker\
    \ decisions can be made on the\nreceived data, which is important in critical\
    \ decision-making situations. Moreover,\nFog devices have the capability to not\
    \ only receive data from similar devices at the\nedge but also collect it from\
    \ many different types of devices. This capability to mea-\nsure different parameters\
    \ in the edge environment enable for an application neutral\nIoT system architecture\
    \ to be developed.\nData sent upward by the Fog layer in the IoT hierarchy would\
    \ be used to gain insights\nin to system behavior and to guide new rules of system\
    \ operation, this will typically\nbe carried out in the cloud. Devices in the\
    \ Fog layer may be provided decision making\nguidance from the higher cloud layer\
    \ to ensure smooth system operation. However,\na balance needs to be struck as\
    \ to the division of responsibilities between the cloud\nand the fog layer keeping\
    \ in view the costs involved.\n3.1.3\nEdge Computing Model\nThe purpose of Fog\
    \ Computing was to push some of the decision making towards\nthe edge of the network.\
    \ In recent years, with increasingly capable devices being\ndeveloped that are\
    \ attached to ‘edge’ nodes, simple decision making, and processing\nof data has\
    \ been increasingly moved on to these devices so as to reduce network\nand device\
    \ costs even further at the fog level and make for even deeper distributed\ndecision-making\
    \ schemes. Edge computing refers to data processing that is done at\nthe ”thing”\
    \ level, i.e. by sensors and other devices in the IoT system [38]. Another\nconcept\
    \ about Edge computing as discussed in [39] defines the Edge computing layer\n\
    as an intermediary layer between the Fog and the ‘things’ (sensors) rather than\
    \ edge\nnodes. The difference between them in this case is the Edge computing\
    \ nodes act\nas aggregation and decision-making units on a smaller scale compared\
    \ to fog devices\n10\nwhich act to provide seamless connectivity and data integrity\
    \ throughout the IoT\nnetwork. The aim of the Fog and the Edge computing paradigms\
    \ is to decentralize\nthe IoT system for purposes of reducing cost, increasing\
    \ scalability and increasing\nrobustness.\nTable 1. Comparison of Cloud, Fog and\

    \ Internet of Things promises the digitization of all aspects of our lives. For\
    \ smart\ncities, this digitization process entails the proliferation of sensing\
    \ nodes in every\ndomain of a city’s operation mechanism. With an application\
    \ scope this broad, the\ncreation and subsequent deployment of IoT systems in\
    \ smart cities carry enormous\nchallenges that need to be considered. In this\
    \ section, a discussion is provided of\nthe challenges that IoT system designers\
    \ face when making deployments in smart\ncity applications.\nThe focus in this\
    \ work is on the technological challenges that\npertain to IoT use in smart cities\
    \ and has also been the focus of researchers. Figure 3\nshows the different challenges\
    \ which Smart City IoT system deployment encounters,\nnamely Security and Privacy,\

    3.2.1\nSecurity and Privacy\nSecurity, along with Privacy is the primary concern\
    \ in smart cities.\nSmart cities\ninvolve having essential city infrastructures\
    \ online, any aberration in the operation\nof the city’s services will bring inconvenience\
    \ to its citizens and put human lives and\nproperty at risk. Therefore, security\
    \ is a big concern in smart cities. In today’s age\nwhere cybercrime and warfare\
    \ have become a tactic in world politics, smart cities\nare at an ever-greater\
    \ risk of being the target of such malicious attacks. Encryption\nof data transmitted\
    \ over the network is necessary in this scenario. For smart city\nprojects to\
    \ be successful, they require the trust and participation of citizens. The\nproliferation\
    \ of sensors in smart cities, which continuously collect data about the\nactivity\
    \ of people may expose the daily activities of citizens to unwanted parties.\n\
    Moreover, companies and corporations on the IoT network may use citizen data\n\
    without their approval for things like targeted advertising and may perform acts\
    \ such\nas eavesdropping etc. Solutions to this will require processes that anonymize\
    \ data\ncollection while retaining the integrity of the context of the measured\
    \ task so that\napt decision making is possible. Security and Privacy has been\
    \ covered in detail in a\nlater section.\n12\n3.2.2\nSmart Sensors\nSmart sensors\
    \ are the hardware components that gather data in smart cities. These\ndevices\
    \ are manufactured by a host of different vendors that adhere to different sens-\n\
    ing mechanisms, standards of measurement, data formats and connectivity proto-\n\
    cols. Smart city deployment will require all these devices to exchange data, perform\n\
    scheduling of tasks between them and be able to aggregate data together for mak-\n\
    ing inferences. A solution to this issue is to develop and use open protocols\
    \ and\ndata formats that will enable manufacturers to create equipment that can\
    \ communi-\ncate between each other, further spurring IoT system deployment. Another\
    \ solution\ncould be the development of ‘standard’ access point nodes for IoT\
    \ systems that can\ncommunicate to devices using several different communication\
    \ protocols and are able\nto decode the information received. Some manufacturers\
    \ have, in fact, made their\nproducts compatible with other protocols as mentioned\
    \ in [40].\nAnother challenge for smart sensors is reliability and robustness.\
    \ Reliability and\nrobustness refer to the dependability and correctness of the\
    \ IoT system. IoT is the\nbackbone of future smart cities and being imperative\
    \ to their operation, the IoT\nsystem needs to provide a smooth experience to\
    \ its users. This requires that service\nrequests from users of the application\
    \ receive an accurate and timely response. The\nquality of service needs to be\
    \ ensured for every citizen in the smart city. Systems\nthat deliver critical\
    \ utilities such as transport, electricity etc. should be decentralized.\nThe\
    \ distributed connection points will allow for robustness and increase reliability.\n\
    One such example is self-healing in Smart Grids [23].\nMany current networking\
    \ protocols are developed for infrastructure networked\ndevices which have access\
    \ to continuous power, however, sensors in smart cities will\nbe mobile in many\
    \ scenarios and thus be battery powered. Moreover, they will need\nto measure,\
    \ transfer and in some cases save data they have collected. This requires\nthe\
    \ development of not only low power, low overhead data transmission schemes\n\
    but also development of new memory and storage technologies as well as low power\n\
    devices that extend battery life as much as possible. Storing this large amount\
    \ of\ndata would require development of compression algorithms which will be employed\n\
    and database schemes that will need to be developed in the future as smart cities\n\
    and IoT are scaled up. Solutions for power issues necessitate the development\
    \ of new\nbattery technologies and perhaps the incorporation of energy harvesting\
    \ mechanisms\nin such devices to make long lasting service provision possible.\n\
    3.2.3\nNetworking\nThe IoT depends on the capability of sensing and other devices\
    \ to be able to send\nand receive information to each other and the Cloud. With\
    \ new smart city appli-\ncations coming up, providing networking to these devices\
    \ to remain connected is a\nbig challenge. Current networking methods are not\
    \ optimized to providing network-\ning services for smart city components. Many\
    \ devices in smart cities have mobility\nand data throughput requirements which\
    \ need to be met to provide an acceptable\nquality of service. Different approaches\
    \ have been suggested in terms of defining ac-\n13\ncess points, local networks\
    \ etc. to solve this problem. Another aspect of networking\nwould be working on\
    \ efficient and dynamic routing protocols that can serve IoT re-\nquirements capable\
    \ of working with stationary as well as devices in motion, which\nmany current\
    \ protocols do not offer sufficiently [41].\n3.2.4\nBig Data Analytics\nIoT connected\
    \ devices generated 13.6 Zetta Bytes of data in 2018 and this is expected\nto\
    \ grow to 79.4 Zetta Bytes till 2025 [34]. To make use of this data and continuously\n\
    improve the services that are delivered in smart cities, new data analytics algorithms\n\
    need to be developed. With the myriad of the different parameters that are measured\n\
    in smart cities, these algorithms need to be applicable to data of varying nature\
    \ (both\nstructured and unstructured), better data fusion techniques need to be\
    \ developed as\nwell so as to combine them in meaningful ways and be able to extract\
    \ inferences and\nrecognize patterns. Deep learning has been of interest in this\
    \ area as it can lever-\nage on this large amount of data to provide better results\
    \ for different applications.\nAnother important consideration would be to ensure\
    \ that the developed algorithms\nare scalable in that they have enough generality\
    \ and can be used through out the\nintended application. For, e.g., for the purposes\
    \ of activity recognition, the authors\nin [42] found that a CNN trained for activity\
    \ recognition on one dataset failed to\nperform well on others or in [43] where\
    \ the deep learning network performs poorly\nwhen the color of tomatoes is different\
    \ from what it was trained on. Concept drift is\nanother issue of concern as with\
    \ the continuous acquisition of data, the properties of\ndata may change over\
    \ time. Techniques such as incremental learning may be useful\nin this respect.\
    \ Explainability is another important factor for Smart City analytics\nto be widely\
    \ acceptable, specially in the area of smart health. There have been some\napproaches\
    \ suggested towards this end, in [44] a hybrid deep learning classifier and\n\
    semantic web technologies based solution is demonstrated for the application of\
    \ flood\nmonitoring. In [45], the authors present an explainable deep learning\
    \ based health-\ncare system at the Edge for COVID-19 care based on a distributed\
    \ learning paradigm\nwith promising results. However, more work needs to be performed\
    \ to incorporate\nexplainability techniques such as distillation, visualization,\
    \ and intrinsic methods into\nMachine and Deep Learning based smart city applications\
    \ in order to increase smart\ncity application proliferation.\n3.3\nSensing Technologies\n\
    Sensing is at the heart of smart city technologies. Sensors provide the knowledge\
    \ and\ndata from which smart city innovations are created. With the vastly different\
    \ nature\nof Smart City projects and its various components, there are numerous\
    \ sensors which\nare used as part of these initiatives. The authors in [58] have\
    \ provided a framework\nfor the comparison of IoT sensors and have listed sensors\
    \ they found in use for the\nInternet of Things. We use their work to direct our\
    \ survey of the sensing technologies\nused in smart cities. Sensors within IoT\
    \ can be divided in to several groups, these are\nambient, motion, electric, biosensors,\
    \ identification, presence, hydraulic and chemical\n14\nTable 2. Smart City IoT\

    \ are the key component in smart city IoT\nsystems which provide the interaction\
    \ between the smart city system and the city’s\ninhabitants and allow for new\
    \ services to be developed. One thing to note is that\nmany of the sensors find\
    \ applications in multiple areas as discussed. Furthermore,\nany given application\
    \ will require measuring different physical quantities and will\nrequire the use\
    \ of many different types of sensors. For, e.g., ambient, motion, electric,\n\
    identification, position, chemical and hydraulic sensors have been found to be\
    \ used in\nsmart homes. As noted in the challenges, working with different sensors\
    \ which might\nhave different output data types is a task that needs to be dealt\
    \ with when working\nwith multiple types of sensors. Table 3 presents a summary\
    \ of the sensors used in\neach smart city component.\n3.3.1\nAmbient Sensors\n\
    Ambient sensors include sensors used to measure physical quantities indicating\
    \ to\nenvironmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, light intensity\
    \ and pressure.\nAmbient sensors are used in a variety of smart city applications\
    \ including smart homes\nwhere they are used to regulate the comfort level, they\
    \ are also used for smart city\nservices.\n3.3.2\nBio-Sensors\nBio-sensors are\
    \ used for measuring health parameters of living things. Bio-sensors in\nsmart\
    \ cities are used for monitoring patients for healthcare purposes. Such sensors\

    and more.\n3.3.3\nChemical\nChemical sensors are used to measure chemical properties\
    \ of materials, this includes\ngas sensors which can measure/detect carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2)\nand other gases for air quality monitoring, sensors\
    \ for detecting smoke, pH and other\nsensors for water quality monitoring etc.\n\
    3.3.4\nElectric Sensors\nElectric sensors allow for the measurement of electrical\
    \ power and are widely used in\nsmart grids and smart homes to monitor the power\
    \ consumption of consumers/ap-\npliances. Types include current transformers and\
    \ voltage sensors to measure current\nand voltage, respectively.\n3.3.5\nHydraulic\n\
    Hydraulic sensors refer to sensors used for liquid measurements such as level,\
    \ flow,\nleak detection. These are used for measurement of liquid levels in tanks\
    \ [59].\n16\n3.3.6\nIdentification\nIdentification sensors refer to RFID tags\
    \ and Near Field Communication (NFC) de-\nvices. These sensors are used in applications\
    \ involving payments, data exchange in\nthe domain of smart transportation and\
    \ smart city services.\n3.3.7\nMotion Sensors\nMotion sensors refer to sensors\
    \ that can be used for the detection of motion. Sensors\nfor motion sensing involve\
    \ inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.\nThese sensors are used\
    \ in smart health applications such as activity tracking as well\nas applications\
    \ like vibration sensing in smart homes and industry.\n3.3.8\nPresence\nPresence\
    \ sensors indicate to the presence of a humans or objects. Passive InfraRed\n\
    (PIR) sensors are very popular and are used to detect human motion, reed switches\n\
    can be used on windows and doors for security purposes, inductive loop sensors\
    \ which\nuse electromagnetic induction can be used to detect presence in transport\
    \ systems.\nUltrasonic sensors are also used to determine the distance of objects.\n\
    Capacitive\nsensors are also included in this type, these may be used to determine\
    \ position.\n3.3.9\nOther Sensors\nVarious smart city applications make use of\
    \ different sensing modalities such as audio\nor visual information or other signal\
    \ measurement devices, for, e.g., bluetooth and\nWi-Fi signal strength. Since\
    \ the sensors for these modalities capture raw information\nabout signals (visual,\
    \ sound or signal strength etc.), the gathered data is typically\nprocessed further\
    \ before it indicates to the target variable being measured.\n3.4\nNetworking\
    \ Technologies\nThe internet of things in smart cities depends on the aggregation\
    \ of data measured by\nindividual sensing units placed throughout the smart city\
    \ environment. Systems that\ncan use these measurements individually have long\
    \ existed and provided automation\nfor small projects. However, the ‘smart’ in\
    \ smart city comes from the collective usage\nof the data from these individual\
    \ sensing units to perform complex decisions while\ndelivering services to citizens.\
    \ The collective use of this data enables its analysis over\na wider scope compared\
    \ to individual levels so as to determine long term patterns\nand provide meaningful\
    \ insights to support services. The number of such IoT devices\ncurrently present\
    \ in the world [34] are multiple times that of the world population.\nTo enable\
    \ these devices to exchange data, wireless technologies need to be used as\nphysical\
    \ connections would, for one, be too costly (where ever they can be used),\nsecond,\
    \ would not satisfy the mobility requirements that are typical of many smart\n\
    city applications. The internet has provided connectivity to computers, smartphones\n\
    and other electronic devices around the world with each other, allowing for instant\n\

    transfer of information between them. However, for IoT the internet may not neces-\n\
    sarily be the only communication method [72] as many applications do not possess\n\
    edge devices that can connect to the internet. An application may consist of a\
    \ local\nnetwork of sensing units which can exchange data between them and rely\
    \ on a multi-\nhop communication protocol to send data to a central node, hub\
    \ or gateway. The\ngateway might be fixed and would be connected to the internet,\
    \ thereby relaying any\nmonitored data to the cloud for further processing or\
    \ use. It might also be possible\nthat devices within an application may use many\
    \ different protocols with the central\nnode having the capability to communicate\
    \ with all of them, a common case for such\narchitectures is the smart home where\
    \ manufacturers produce devices using propriety\nor incompatible protocols for\
    \ which a hub may be used, an example of such a system\nwas provided in [73] and\
    \ several hubs are commercially available. In this section, we\ndiscuss the network\
    \ types, topologies and protocols used in the Internet of Things for\nSmart City\
    \ applications as illustrated in Figure 5. We later provide a comparison of\n\
    these protocols in Table 4.\n3.4.1\nNetwork Topologies\nThere are three IoT network\
    \ topologies, point to point, star and mesh [74]. The first\ntype of topology\
    \ is the point to point topology where devices are connected to each\nother sequentially\
    \ in a point to point manner. Point to point networks introduce\ndata hops for\
    \ packets that need to be sent to other nodes as data needs to go through\neach\
    \ node in the path of the two nodes wanting to exchange data. Point to point\n\
    networks are not very popular in IoT systems as it ranks low on fault resiliency\
    \ and\nwill breakdown if there is a fault in any of the intermediate nodes. In\
    \ Star topology,\n18\nall units in a network are connected to a central node or\
    \ gateway and cannot send data\nto each other directly. In order to perform an\
    \ exchange of data among themselves, the\ndevices need to send it through the\
    \ central node. Star topology networks, with their\ncentral node structure provide\
    \ a natural aggregation scheme for data collection within\nthe internet of things,\
    \ however, large networks consisting of many devices, which can\nbe the case in\
    \ most smart city applications, may result in high latency and possible\nbottlenecks\
    \ in high information throughput scenarios. Star topology has been used in\nvarious\
    \ applications including disaster management [75] and environmental sensing\n\
    [76]. The last type of network topology that is used in IoT is the Mesh network\n\
    topology, mesh networks allow all individual devices to communicate between them.\n\
    By enabling communication between the nodes in a network, mesh topology offers\n\
    a larger range as data transmitted towards a certain node can make multiple hops\n\
    through the network, this also increases the networks resilience as alternate\
    \ paths\ncould be used if packet delivery fails due to any node becoming faulty.\
    \ In fact, such\ntopologies have been used in smart homes [77] as well as in smart\
    \ grids [78]. There are\nother topologies which have not been mentioned, for,\
    \ e.g., tree (which has multiple\nstar networks connected in a point by point\
    \ fashion).\n3.4.2\nNetwork Architectures\nNetwork Architecture refers to the\
    \ structure of the network used for a given appli-\ncation. As discussed earlier,\
    \ the ‘things’ in IoT may not necessarily be connected\nthrough the internet,\
    \ in fact a distributed connectivity structure may be imple-\nmented with only\
    \ one unit in the network being capable of sending data to the\ncloud depending\
    \ on the requirement. Work in [72] mentions three types of network\narchitectures\
    \ that are used for smart cities based on IoT. These are Home Area\nNetworks (HANs),\
    \ Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Field/Neighborhood Area Net-\nworks (FANs/NANs).\
    \ Home Area Networks are short range networks and are usually\nused to transmit\
    \ information to a central node which is responsible for data collection\nbefore\
    \ it is sent to the cloud. Communication within the network is performed using\n\
    some low power communication protocol such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc. HANs\n\
    are very popular in smart homes where they are used to gather power consumption\n\
    and times of operation data from a multitude of appliances which are then sent\
    \ to\na smart meter as part of a smart grid [79]. The second type of network architecture\n\
    is Field Area Networks (FANs), sometimes also called Neighborhood Area Networks\n\
    (NANs). Field Area Networks have a larger communication range than HANs and\n\
    are used to provide connection between a customer (for, e.g., in a smart grid)\
    \ to the\nutility company. Wide Area Networks are used for network structures\
    \ that require\ncommunication over large distances. These networks are not as\
    \ dense as HANs or\nFANs and utilize technologies such as cellular services, wired\
    \ connections such as fiber\noptics as well as a class of low power protocols\
    \ designed for WANs themselves [80].\nWANs are used in a variety of smart city\
    \ applications including Smart Grids where\nthey are used to connect multiple\
    \ substations together or exchanging data between\nthe customer and the substation\
    \ [81].\n19\n3.4.3\nNetwork Protocols\nThe type of network to use depends on the\
    \ requirements of the application. It is\nimperative that the communication protocol\
    \ used in a smart city application meet\nthe desirable quality of service (QoS).\
    \ Several protocols have been used in the internet\nof things for smart cities\
    \ [48, 82, 83, 84], herein, we discuss the traits of the most\npopular wireless\
    \ networking protocols used in smart cities.\n3.4.3.1\nRFID\nRadio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) utilizes radio frequencies\nto transmit and receive data. RFID communication\
    \ consists of two types of devices,\none device is the Reader and the other is\
    \ called the Tag. The Reader is usually\npowered and once a tag comes in the vicinity\
    \ of the reader, an exchange of information\ntakes place after authorization as\
    \ the tag harvests the energy from the reader. Such\ntags are called passive tags,\
    \ there are also active tags which are do not depend on the\nreader for their\
    \ power. Depending on the standard, RFID can operate on different\nfrequencies\
    \ in the radio frequency spectrum between 125 KHz to 928 MHz and can\nbe used\
    \ over short ranges. They are used in applications such as smart transport\n(toll\
    \ tax collection, parking), smart health and more.\n3.4.3.2\nNear Field Communication\n\
    Near Field Communication (NFC) is very\nsimilar to RFID, however, the structure\
    \ of NFC communication doesn’t consist of\ntags and readers. Unlike RFID, both\
    \ devices which want to communicate using NFC\nneed to be powered and data tranmission/reception\
    \ can take place in both directions\nunlike RFIDs. This enables the use of NFC\
    \ to control and configure devices unlike the\nRFID which cannot be used for measurement\
    \ or control tasks. NFC utilizes similar\nfrequencies to RFID but is used for\
    \ very short distances. NFC devices are popular\nfor applications involving payment\
    \ using smart phones and are also used in smart\nhomes.\n3.4.3.3\nBluetooth\n\
    Bluetooth is a low energy protocol popular in IoT applica-\ntions as it can support\
    \ an unlimited number of nodes [82]. The protocol is designed\nfor short range,\
    \ low bandwidth communication in an arrangement where devices can\neasily exit\
    \ or enter the network. Bluetooth natively supports the star topology as it\n\
    has a master device at the center of the communication mechanism. It operates\
    \ in\nthe 2.4 GHz ISM band and can have maximum data rates of 2 Mbps. Bluetooth\
    \ has\nbeen widely used in smart home due to it providing a direct connection\
    \ interface to\nsmart phones without the need for any intermediary hub device.\n\
    3.4.3.4\nZ-Wave\nZ-Wave or Zensys wave is a low power protocol developed to\n\
    be used in home automation applications. It is a low speed protocol with a short\n\
    range, operating in the frequencies of 868 MHz and 900 MHz. It operates in a master\n\
    slave fashion where a master can have multiple slave devices which can respond\
    \ to\ncommands from the master node. Therefore this is well suited for applications\
    \ where\na central control element is present and needs to gather data from multiple\
    \ sensing\nunits such as smart homes and smart healthcare systems.\n20\n3.4.3.5\n\
    Li-Fi\nLi-Fi (Light Fidelity) uses visible light instead of radio frequency\n\
    (RF) to exchange data. The advantage with using Li-Fi over RF communication is\n\
    that it can utilize already present lighting systems which also results in conservation\n\
    of power [85]. It offers very high speeds of data transfer for short distances\
    \ and has\nbeen used in parking systems.\n3.4.3.6\nWi-Fi\nWi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)\
    \ operates using wireless frequencies in the\n2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands to provide\
    \ high speed internet connectivity in a limited\ndistance. Wi-Fi is popular in\
    \ many smart city applications as it provides ready to\nuse interface to smart\
    \ phones, computers and other wearable gadgets.\n3.4.3.7\nZigbee\nThe ZigBee protocol\
    \ was developed as a low power low cost pro-\ntocol for wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) and has evolved to be used in the Internet\nof Things. The ZigBee protocol\
    \ operates in the 868 MHz/915 MHz/2.4 GHz band\nand offers moderate data transfer\
    \ speeds with distances similar to Wi-Fi in a multi-\nhop data transfer scheme.\
    \ Zigbee radios are low cost devices and therefore it is a\npopular protocol used\
    \ by many manufacturers of smart home, smart healthcare de-\nvices. A ZigBee network\
    \ will have three devices, one called the coordinator which\nis the controller\
    \ of the network, the router which is responsible for moving data to\nother devices\
    \ and the ZigBee end device (sensors and actuators).\n3.4.3.8\nWi-SUN\nThe Wireless\
    \ Smart Utility Network (Wi-SUN) is a network\napproved by Institute of Electrical\
    \ and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and is used in\nfield area networks for utility\
    \ metering, automation of distribution for utilities such\nas electricity, gas\
    \ etc. and also for demand response systems for utility-based appli-\ncations.\
    \ It supports IPv6 addressing and can be used in star or mesh configuration\n\
    where it also allows for multi-hop communication [86].\n3.4.3.9\nCellular\nCellular\
    \ technologies refers to 3G, 4G and 5G communications.\nAlong with Bluetooth and\
    \ Zigbee, they are the most popular IoT enabling technolo-\ngies. Cellular communication\
    \ provides high data rate and supports more content rich\napplications compared\
    \ to the other protocols. With the long range they provide, they\nare preferred\
    \ for a variety of applications where power is not an issue. Depending on\nthe\
    \ technology, cellular bands range from 600 MHz to 80 GHz with very high data\n\
    rates.\n3.4.3.10\nLoRaWAN\nLoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network (Lo-\n\
    RaWAN) and it is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) that consists of several\n\
    gateways and multiple end devices with the gateways connected to a back-end net-\n\
    work server. The back-end server provides connection to the cloud. End devices\
    \ do\nnot have a fixed association with a specific gateway and may send data to\
    \ multiple\ngateways when it needs to transfer data to the cloud.\n21\n3.4.3.11\n\
    6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN which is short for IPv6 over Low Power Net-\nworks was created\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifically for\ninternet of\
    \ things applications with the aim of making it possible for providing in-\nternet\
    \ connectivity to small devices. It is an IP based network and leverages IPv6\n\
    communication. This is a short-range network operating in Industrial, Scientific\
    \ and\nMedical (ISM) bands.\n3.4.3.12\nSigFox\nSigFox is a proprietary standard\
    \ developed by SigFox Inc., France.\nIt uses unlicensed bands to perform ultra-narrowband\
    \ bidirectional communication\nwith low speeds [87]. SigFox has a similar architecture\
    \ to LoRaWAN and like Lo-\nRaWAN and 6LoWPAN, SigFox is a popular LPWAN in the\
    \ IoT domain offering\nsufficiently large distances of communication of up to\
    \ 50 km. SigFox finds applica-\ntions in security in buildings, smart lighting\
    \ and environmental monitoring.\n3.4.3.13\nNB-IoT\nNB-IoT (Narrow Band IoT) is\
    \ a type of LPWAN which oper-\nates on Global System for Mobile Communications\
    \ (GSM) and Long-Term Evolution\n(LTE) bands. In fact, it can operate using the\
    \ same hardware with a software up-\ngrade as it is considered a bare bones version\
    \ of LTE. It allows for connecting up to\n100,000 devices per cell.\nTable 4.\

    \ Smart Cities.\n3.5\nSecurity and Privacy in Smart City IoT\nSmart Cities involve\
    \ the transmission of sensing data, control information through\nthe internet\
    \ as well as local networks. Moreover, several components in smart cities\ntend\
    \ to critical aspects of a citys operation and are highly intertwined with the\
    \ social\nand private life of its citizens. Consequently, security and privacy\
    \ in Smart Cities\nis of great importance and has been of high interest to researchers\
    \ [51, 88, 89, 90,\n91, 92]. The topic of Security of IoT has been covered in\
    \ [93] who deliberate upon\nthe challenges faced in the different architectures\
    \ of the IoT and present issues and\nsolutions. We cover security for IoT in smart\
    \ cities so as to highlight issues that are\npertinent to in the Smart City context\
    \ and to complete our discussion on this topic.\nSmart Cities are enabled by collecting\
    \ data through sensors within a city as well\nas its populace, process it and\
    \ then mine it to provide a better quality of life to the\npeople living. These\
    \ sensors can provide an estimate about the internal state of a\ncity’s components\
    \ such as transportation, power system, building condition/state,\nhuman mobility\
    \ and more. All of this data is sent to the cloud where it is processed\nand mined.\
    \ However, there are several issues that pertain to how these data are\nsent and\
    \ used and raises questions about integrity, protection and the confidentiality\n\

    \ for Smart Cities.\nof this process. In fact, this concern is not unwarranted\
    \ for, in 2015 an attack on\nthe Ukranian power grid which left 225,000 people\
    \ without power [94] opened the\nworlds eyes to the very real threat posed by\
    \ cyber attackers. Data gathered in Smart\nCity applications can be used to perform\
    \ many undesired acts, GPS devices that are\npresent in every phone and most vehicles\
    \ are susceptible to providing information\nabout a persons location, habits as\
    \ well as lead to privacy issues as discussed in [91],\npower consumption and\
    \ ambient sensor data from a building may indicate to occu-\npancy [95] and even\
    \ indicate to the individual identities [96]. This information may\nbe used by\
    \ bad actors to carry out unlawful acts causing risk to life and property.\nTo\
    \ secure the Internet of Things for Smart Cities, typical security schemes might\
    \ not\nbe as effective in many cases and new methods will need to be developed\
    \ to cope\nwith the security and privacy issues in IoT for Smart Cities. In order\
    \ to provide a\nstandardized framework and terminology for discussing security\
    \ attacks, we adapt the\nstandard attack incident taxonomy [97] suggested by the\
    \ Computer Emergency Re-\nsponse Team (CERT) which was established by Defense\
    \ Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) for use towards IoT for Smart Cities.\
    \ This is shown in Figure 6.\nThere are different types of security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT in Smart Cities,\nthey exist on each of the three levels of the\
    \ IoT architecture, application software\nlayers, network layer and the perception\
    \ layer along with some system wide issues, a\ndiscussion is provided for each\
    \ of them. Furthermore, Table 5 provides a summary\nof the security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT for Smart Cities and the counter measures\nthat one can take to\
    \ mitigate them.\n3.5.1\nApplication Software Layers\nApplication software layers\
    \ are comprised of the Middleware, Application and Busi-\nness Layers. Security\
    \ and privacy in the application software layers tend to issues\nrelating to storage\
    \ of data and its usage. These are data visibility, access and injec-\ntion.\n\
    24\n3.5.1.1\nData Visibility/Identification\nOnce data is gathered, it is sent\
    \ to the\ncloud where it is stored and mined to make inferences. Since the cloud\
    \ would be used\nby multiple entities with different standards of security protocols\
    \ and practices, it is\nextremely important that data stored in the cloud is encrypted\
    \ so as not to allow its\nexposure to unwanted entities. Any data stored in plain\
    \ form would be a risk to not\nonly user privacy but also company rapport.\n3.5.1.2\n\
    Data access/Secondary Use\nAccess control is also a major issue in\nsmart city\
    \ data. Most Smart City applications rely on the usage of data from different\n\
    applications to provide smart services, thus resulting in the gathered data to\
    \ be used\nby many different enterprises. To allow this to take place smoothly\
    \ while preserving\nprivacy, suitable access control schemes will need to be devised\
    \ to allow for responsible\naccess to users of this data. A well-defined hierarchy\
    \ of data users will need to be\ndeveloped and implemented to limit access only\
    \ to intended authorized personnel.\nInformation flow control should also be employed\
    \ that can track data flow as access\nto it is made and to detect any violation\
    \ of access or usage rules. Moreover, data\nmashups that will occur in the cloud\
    \ where multiple entities merge their data to\nwork on some common goal, should\
    \ be carried out with proper oversight.\nData\nanonymization may also be required\
    \ in such a scenario where specific values may be\nconverted in to a range perhaps\
    \ ( e.g., using k-anonymity [90]) and unwanted data be\ndeleted as necessary.\
    \ Blockchain has been suggested to be used for access control as\nwell as access\
    \ tracking of users in IoT applications where each user access to a service\n\
    or an application ends up as a transaction to form the applications IoT trail\
    \ [98].\n3.5.1.3\nData Injection/Data Integrity\nData injection refers to the\
    \ injection\nof false information or modification information about a user in\
    \ the system after\ngaining access. Since data is typically stored in databases,\
    \ SQL injection involves\nan attacker inserting queries to modify data or make\
    \ false data insertions into the\ndatabase. This can have far reaching consequences\
    \ for smart city applications such\nas patient record manipulation as well as\
    \ manipulation or deletion of government\nrecords. SQL injection prevention schemes\
    \ involve the validation of data before using\nit [99] such as positive pattern\
    \ matching. It also involves limiting database access\nbased on the user requirements\
    \ and performing penetration testing.\n3.5.2\nNetwork Layer\nLike other networks,\
    \ the IoT in Smart Cities are also susceptible to network attacks\nsuch as Denial\
    \ of service, Eavesdropping, Man in the middle attack, Side Channel\nand spoofing\
    \ attacks [100]. We discuss these attacks and discuss remedial actions\nthat should\
    \ be taken to prevent them.\n3.5.2.1\nMan in the Middle Attack\nMan in the middle\
    \ (MITM) attack refers\nto the interception of data on the network by faking the\
    \ identity of a network node\nor device. This is carried out by appearing as the\
    \ intended recipient to the sender\n25\nand the original sender to the recipient\
    \ by unauthorized actors. To prevent this,\nthe exchange of data between two entities\
    \ should employ cryptographic protocols\nwhich can ensure secure communication.\
    \ Many public networks do not make use of\nencryption when exchanging data, this\
    \ endangers user data and can give access to\nunwanted persons to user information\
    \ [90]. Policies need to be devised to allow for\nsuitable data communication\
    \ standards for such networks while keeping the user as\nwell as commercial interests\
    \ in mind.\n3.5.2.2\nEavesdropping/Sniffing Attack\nEavesdropping refers to the\
    \ listening\nof data on the network. In eavesdropping an unauthorized entity joins\
    \ the network\nand can listen to the data that is being exchanged between the\
    \ devices on the network.\nTo avoid this, strategies include the use of authenticate\
    \ always protocols which initiate\nauthentication steps whenever devices need\
    \ to communicate with each other. This will\nensure that no unwanted users are\
    \ allowed access to network traffic to prevent such\nattacks. Moreover, industry\
    \ standard security protocols such as the Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS), Wi-Fi\
    \ Protected Access 2 (WPA2) should be used for authenticating\nremote access.\
    \ Furthermore, remote sessions should have time-outs implemented to\nensure that\
    \ mistakes are not made by forgetful employees.\n3.5.2.3\nSide Channel Attack\n\
    Side Channel Attacks refer to the extraction\nof information by observing operation\
    \ characteristics of the implemented computer\nalgorithms or systems such as power\
    \ consumed, time taken, traffic analysis, fault\nanalysis, acoustic analysis [101].\
    \ Side Channel attacks don’t give nonpermitted parties\naccess to the data within\
    \ the network but may allow them to determine important\ninformation about the\
    \ system, such as the protocol used, or allow them to drop\npackets so as to degrade\
    \ performance of the network. One solution to counter network\ntraffic side channels\
    \ attacks is to saturate network bandwidth to prevent patterns\nfrom being observed.\
    \ Another popular method of preventing side channel attacks is\nto make use of\
    \ masking [102].\n3.5.2.4\nDenial of Service Attack\nDenial of Service (DOS) or\
    \ Distributed DOS\n(DDOS) attacks involve an entity getting access to the network\
    \ and using legitimate\nnodes within it to flood the target with unnecessary requests\
    \ to consume network\nbandwidth and degrade quality of service. With a smart city\
    \ depending on sensors\nto provide it with a ‘view’ of the city, DOS attacks can\
    \ make the smart city system\nblind which can lead to loss of property and life.\
    \ Countermeasures for DOS attacks\ninvolve anomaly detection by monitoring of\
    \ network data to check for any irregular\nbehavior. Artificial Intelligence has\
    \ found applications in this area as noted by [103],\nfor, e.g., it has been used\
    \ to identify abnormal data in smart grids [104] as well as\ndetecting attacks\
    \ [105, 106].\n3.5.2.5\nSpoofing Attack\nIn a spoofing attack, an attacker adds\
    \ itself to the\nnetwork by appearing to be a legitimate device on the network,\
    \ thereby allowing\nthem to send irregular or abnormal data to upset normal operation\
    \ of a smart city\n26\nsystem. Due to the varying nature and types of IoT devices\
    \ having different levels of\nbuilt-in security, spoofing is a particularly dangerous\
    \ attack for IoT systems. Methods\nto prevent spoofing are the use of cryptography,\
    \ hybrid encryption [107] as well as the\nuse of blockchain [108] to validate\
    \ data exchange and as well as authenticate devices.\n3.5.3\nPerception Layer\n\
    Perception layers attacks refer to physical attacks on an IoT based smart city\
    \ system.\nThis requires the physical presence of an attacker near the sensing\
    \ elements in an IoT\nsystem. We cover these attacks to provide a holistic assessment\
    \ of the security and\nprivacy issues in IoT Smart Cities. Tempering and Radio\
    \ Interference (jamming)\nare attacks which can affect the performance of smart\
    \ city systems. Tempering may\noccur during the development or the manufacturing\
    \ process while jamming can take\nplace due to a generation of radio frequencies\
    \ which interfere with the frequencies\nused by devices on the network to exchange\
    \ data. To circumvent this, policies may\nbe incorporated into software which\
    \ alert businesses and other Smart City partners\nto missing or abnormal data\
    \ from sensing devices.\n3.5.4\nSystem Wide Issues\n3.5.4.1\nData Leakage\nData\
    \ leakage refers to the unintentional conveyance of\ninformation about subjects\
    \ in smart cities. The many data sources in smart cities\nmay contain information\
    \ related to a user’s identity, health, quality of life etc. Smart\nCity application\
    \ managers use this data to improve their services and provide a bet-\nter user\
    \ experience, however, it is possible that this data might be shared with third\n\
    party entities. It is therefore necessary to anonymize data before such assignments\n\
    are taken. Data leakage can also take place when devices within a network perform\n\
    discovery tasks and may provide personal information to rogue nodes in the network.\n\
    In Smart Grids, power consumption data should be anonymized by considering the\n\
    data on a neighborhood level rather than on the individual level, moreover, systems\n\
    could be installed in homes using batteries to modify the demand response signal.\n\
    Data aggregation is an important tool in preserving individual privacy and preventing\n\
    data leakage. Moreover, data should be encrypted when sending it over the network\n\
    so that any unauthorized access is avoided. Another strategy would be to use data\n\
    minimization. Typically, sensors used in smart cities will gather data of less\
    \ ‘interest’\nin addition to data of interest. For, e.g., navigation systems many\
    \ times record loca-\ntion information even when not in use or video applications\
    \ such as facial recognition\nsystems typically record other activities apart\
    \ from being activated whenever a face is\nobserved in the video. This extra information\
    \ increases the risk of data leakage. Data\nminimization can be employed in such\
    \ cases to limit the data that is being gathered\non the user.\n3.5.4.2\nTrustworthiness\n\
    Apart from the technical steps that need to be taken\nto provide a secure usage\
    \ experience of smart city applications and to encourage its\nuse, it is important\
    \ that smart city users be provided clear policy guidelines to how\n27\nTable\

    \ are the fact that they provide an improved quality of life for\na city’s population\
    \ along with reduction of costs in terms of operation and also enable\ncities\
    \ to be sustainable. IoT enables sensors and devices to be deployed throughout\
    \ a\ncity to give an overview of the state of the city’s main functions such as\
    \ transportation\nsystems, electric, water and gas distribution as well as crime\
    \ monitoring to name\na few. This real time information helps city administration,\
    \ businesses and other\nstakeholders to provide better services to people, increase\
    \ the effectiveness of those\nservices and reduce the cost through efficient operation.\n\
    On the technical side, IoT data has made possible to use data analytics to gauge\n\
    various aspects of the multitude of services which are being provided in the city\
    \ as\nwell as to determine interactions between them and utilize that information\
    \ for better\ndecision making to make life easier for citizens. Furthermore, the\
    \ distributed nature\nof IoT systems and the flexible architectures which enable\
    \ fluidity through movement\nof sensing units is easily scalable thereby requiring\
    \ little additional cost to upgrade\nand expand currently deployed systems. Moreover,\
    \ this distributed architecture also\nmakes such systems very robust to faults\
    \ thereby increasing reliability of deployments\nand offering self-healing in\
    \ applications such as electricity systems.\n29\n4.2\nWeaknesses\nIoT in Smart\
    \ cities do suffer from some weaknesses in terms of technology, for, e.g.,\nthe\
    \ current deployment scenario has a myriad of different technologies relating\
    \ to\nnetworks, hardware platforms and software frameworks which do not often\
    \ work to-\ngether very well as discussed. Different standards’ bodies such as\
    \ the IETF, European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), IEEE and\
    \ other organizations have\nbeen contributing with standards for communication,\
    \ network discovery, identifica-\ntion, management of devices etc. However, the\
    \ sheer number of ‘standards’ with\nmany of them not being compatible with each\
    \ other has not fully solved the inter-\noperability problem and this can cause\
    \ hurdles for expansion of IoT systems without\na significant overhaul of system\
    \ components. Another problem currently facing IoT\nsystems is the lack of data\
    \ policies and legislation. The concern here is that data\npolicies are not mature\
    \ enough to regulate how data is handled in IoT systems, as\nhas been discussed\
    \ previously. This is a major problem given the growing issue with\nuser data\
    \ privacy in a connected world.\n4.3\nOpportunities\nIoT in Smart cities presents\
    \ many opportunities to researchers and businesses alike\nin lieu of mitigating\
    \ the weaknesses and also in the provision of new city services.\nThe data gathered\
    \ by the sensors in IoT systems has the potential to provide a\nholistic overview\
    \ of the city’s state allowing for the use of big data algorithms to\ndevelop\
    \ new applications and services. For researchers in the data analytics domain,\n\
    this heterogenous data provides a wonderful opportunity for the development of\
    \ new\ndata science algorithms for service delivery. There is a large monetary\
    \ value towards\nthe development and usage of computationally cheap encryption\
    \ techniques, efficient\ndata storage methods and networking technologies to make\
    \ IoT deployment easier\nand cheaper.\nDevelopment of new sensor technologies\
    \ is another opportunity for\nresearchers in IoT for smart cities.\nThe development\
    \ of newer, efficient, low-cost\nsensors would aid to the creation of IoT services\
    \ and enable even wider usage.\n4.4\nThreats\nWith a connected system, there are\
    \ several threats that come with IoTs for Smart\nCities involving trust issues\
    \ among users, privacy concerns due to network attacks,\npotential data theft\
    \ etc. Privacy and security are the most important concerns of\nIoT applications,\
    \ with such a personalized interaction mechanism between people\nand devices as\
    \ is the case of smart cities, the risks for privacy breaches, data theft\nand\
    \ leakages are high and this is a constant concern for service users as well as\n\
    providers. Numerous attacks on Smart City systems have exposed the vulnerability\n\
    of this technology to cyber attacks and also demonstrated the consequences that\

    \ as access\nauthentication, routing and networking might not be enough or possible\

    31\nCHAPTER III\nAI IN IOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides\
    \ insight into different ways in which AI has been applied in\nthe IoT for Smart\
    \ Cities using the application of clustering, regression, classification\netc.\
    \ In addition, various applications, solutions and data used for implementing\
    \ the\noverall framework of Smart Cities are discussed in detail. along with the\
    \ types of\ndeployment used by these proposed approaches.\n2\nBig Data Algorithms/Artificial\
    \ Intelligence\nThe various sensors that make up the internet of things in a smart\
    \ city relay in-\nformation about the city’s state to the cloud. However, measuring\
    \ raw data is not\nenough, to utilize this data and to make the city ‘smart’,\
    \ data analysis is key. Data\nanalysis in smart cities has four layers, the first\
    \ is Data Acquisition, which deals with\nthe collection and storage of data, this\
    \ is followed by the Preprocessing layer which\nperforms operations (such as imputing\
    \ missing values, scaling, removing erroneous\ndata points etc.) on the data to\
    \ ensure that data is of suitable quality to be used for\nthe data analytics stage.\
    \ The data analytics stage involves the application of data\nscience techniques\
    \ on the data to extract patterns and insights which would be used\nfor policy\
    \ making, planning and other actions in the Service layer. In this section, we\n\
    focus our attention on the third stage of the data analysis process, i.e., data\
    \ analytics.\nData analytics in the Smart City based on the IoT involves the use\
    \ of Deep Learning\nand Machine Learning on the gathered data. The discussion\
    \ in this chapter considers\nthe following aspects of the use of AI (ML/DL) in\
    \ the IoT for smart cities:\n1. The type of application: This refers to the aim\
    \ of the application.\n2. Algorithm/Network: This refers to the algorithm being\
    \ used to perform the\ntask and can be any of the ML/DL algorithms covered.\n\
    3. System Architecture: System architecture refers to the IoT architecture pro-\n\
    posed for the covered work. This can be Cloud, Fog or Edge.\n4. Task: This refers\
    \ to the type of machine learning task being performed. This can\nbe classification,\
    \ clustering or regression. In this category, a brief description is\nalso presented\
    \ about what quantities/outcomes are being worked with.\n32\n5. Data Type: This\
    \ refers to the type of data being used. Data can be of two\ntypes, heterogeneous\
    \ or homogeneous. Heterogeneous refers to the use of data\nof different modalities\
    \ whereas homogenous refers to a single modality being\nused. The aim of providing\
    \ this information is to capture the complexity of the\ndata involved in an application.\n\
    2.1\nMachine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) has been a crucial element of smart\
    \ city application develop-\nment [109], helping in prediction (classification),\
    \ estimation (regression) and cluster-\ning tasks. Machine learning refers to\
    \ the set of approaches through which computers\ncan be used to learn from empirical\
    \ data [110] and has been used in smart cities\nin various applications. Since\
    \ there has been a lot of work in this area using ML\nalgorithms, we focus on\
    \ work in the last few years. It was found that most commonly\nused ML algorithms\
    \ have been the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests\n(RF), Decision Tree\
    \ (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)\nand Logistic Regression\
    \ (LR).\n2.2\nDeep Learning\nDeep learning is the use of successive layers of\
    \ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to\nlearn patterns. The idea is that successive\
    \ non-linear layers of interconnected artificial\nneurons can be used to learn\
    \ patterns in data that simple machine learning algorithms\nmight not be able\
    \ to do. Deep learning architectures can process noisy data to provide\noutput\
    \ for classification and prediction tasks. This makes them very useful in the\n\
    Smart City environment where the IoT enables the collection of heterogeneous sensor\n\
    data which can be of varying nature. Data derived from sensors can be processed\
    \ to\nextract features or can be fed directly to deep learning algorithms which\
    \ can perform\nboth feature extraction as well as classification/prediction. Deep\
    \ Learning methods\nsuch as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)(Long Short-Term Machines\
    \ (LSTM) and\nGated Recurrent Units (GRU)), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),\
    \ Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNN) and Stacked Autoencoder Networks (SAE) were the\
    \ preferred deep\nlearning methodologies used for smart city applications and\
    \ our discussion revolves\naround the utilization of these methods.\n3\nAI Applications\
    \ for Smart Cities\nIn this section, the applications for of AI in smart cities\
    \ have been discussed, we also\nmention the kind of deployment as well as the\
    \ nature of data utilized to achieve their\ntask.\n3.1\nSmart Agriculture\nThe\
    \ major applications of AI in IoT for agriculture are crop monitoring/disease\
    \ de-\ntection and data driven crop care and decision making. Considering the\
    \ scarcity of\n33\nwater, the authors in [111, 112, 113] develop irrigation systems\
    \ which monitor and\ncontrol the amount of water being used for crops, all structured\
    \ around a cloud com-\nputing system. This problem has been devised both as a\
    \ classification as well as a\nregression problem as in [114], who develop a closed\
    \ loop water irrigation system using\nsupport vector regression and K-Means clustering.\
    \ The authors in [115, 116] propose\ncloud based greenhouse monitoring systems\
    \ using images and a host of physical pa-\nrameters from plants such as temperature,\
    \ humidity and light using several machine\nand deep learning methods. Plant disease\
    \ detection is also an important task within\nsmart agriculture and has been worked\
    \ on by the authors in [117, 118, 119, 120] who\npresent schemes for disease detection\
    \ for various crops including tomatoes and pota-\ntoes. The proliferation of sensing\
    \ systems in agricultural fields has also provided an\navenue for data driven\
    \ decision making and planning for farmers. This involves pre-\ndicting various\
    \ physical parameters which can affect crop growth like solar radiance\n[121]\
    \ and temperature, humidity, windspeed [122, 123, 124, 125, 126] to help in deci-\n\
    sion making in terms of plant care but also classification systems for recommending\n\
    crops to be sown [127, 128]. It is important to note that all of these implementations\n\
    are cloud based.\nThere have been some suggested methodologies for bringing fog\
    \ processing for AI\nin smart agriculture, for, e.g., in [129] a deep learning\
    \ entrusted to fog nodes (DLEFN)\nalgorithm is described to support efficient\
    \ use of resources and reduce cloud resource\nusage. However, as noted in [130],\
    \ who use an edge system for temperature prediction\nusing an LSTM, edge device\
    \ performance still lacks that of similar cloud systems but\nthe inclusion of\
    \ DL capable hardware does provide opportunities for further innova-\ntions. Previous\
    \ work by the same author [131], where they aimed to monitor crops\nfor frost\
    \ signs and trigger anti-frost measures, compared edge and cloud computing\nsystems\
    \ for outlier detection and determined that cloud implementations to provide\n\
    much better performance. However, they do note the potential for edge systems\
    \ to\nprovide highly responsive data analytics in smart agriculture. More applications\
    \ can\nbe envisaged for AI deployment in smart agriculture, for, e.g., monitoring\
    \ of crop\ngrowth, selection of the fertilizer and the timeline for it to be used\
    \ as well as targeted\napplication, pest detection and intelligent pesticide spraying\
    \ so as to reduce harm to\nthe environment, environmental monitoring to track\
    \ the effects of climate change and\nmore. Some of these applications have potential\
    \ to be deployed as edge computing\nsystems. A summary of the use of IoT based\
    \ AI in Smart Agriculture is presented in\nTable 7.\n3.2\nSmart City Services\n\
    A popular component of smart city initiatives is the management of waste and involves\n\
    having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud to not only inform\
    \ the\nrelevant authorities of the need to empty them but also using AI to determine\
    \ the\nbest route to reduce fuel consumption. The use of IoT systems for waste\
    \ management\nhas been observed in the works of [133] who utilize IoT systems\
    \ to help reduce energy\nwastage in waste collection by municipalities. Hussain\
    \ et al. [134] develop a waste\nmanagement system that not only determines if\
    \ bins are full and need collecting\n34\nTable 7. AI use for Smart Agriculture\n\

    \ air quality\naround it using RNNs. The sensing modalities in each of these applications\
    \ is pretty\nsimilar in that they indicate to whether a waste bin is full or not\
    \ which is then\nused for route planning. Considering the requirements of such\
    \ a system, in terms\nof implementation, all of these systems are cloud based.\
    \ Sewer monitoring has been\nperformed in [135] in a cloud based system, they\
    \ use sewer water level and rain gauge\ndata along with a RNN to perform sewer\
    \ overflow monitoring. The RNN is used to\npredict sewer overflow ahead in time.\
    \ Water quality has monitoring has been the focus\nof [136, 137, 138] where the\
    \ authors use multiple sensors measuring pH value, chloride,\nnitrate content\
    \ and hardness of water to determine whether it is fit for drinking or\nnot. In\
    \ [139], Liu et al. use data from water monitoring stations along the Yangtze\n\
    river to predict water quality. Like the classification-based systems, they use\
    \ multiple\nchemical measurements from the water such as oxygen, pH, turbidity\
    \ etc. Apart from\nair quality, smart city monitoring systems are an important\
    \ application within the\nsmart city services domain. This includes urban noise,\
    \ which has been the focus of\nresearchers in [140, 141] as well as other more\
    \ comprehensive monitoring systems as\nproposed in [142, 143]. All these systems\
    \ are cloud based and use a combination\nof sensors for sound and/or image data\
    \ for performing noise monitoring/detection\nand various smart city dashboard\
    \ applications. In Table 8, we summarize the type\nof deployments, applications\
    \ task and data for smart city services applications. It\nis noted that most of\
    \ the applications relating to city services such as air quality\nmonitoring and\
    \ prediction, sewer monitoring, waste collection have been proposed as\ncloud\
    \ systems as data needs to be collected from nodes at various points in a city.\n\
    It is envisaged that due to the nature of the applications, many smart city services\n\
    would still rely on cloud or fog architectures as the decision-making taking place\
    \ in\nsuch situations isn’t possible on only a local level. It is also observed\
    \ that most of the\napplications required data from multiple sensors and therefore\
    \ utilized heterogeneous\ndata to carry out the task at hand.\n3.3\nSmart Energy\n\
    Load/energy consumption forecasting is an essential task for monitoring and control\n\
    of electrical power supply in the electricity grid and ensure appropriate demand\
    \ side\nmanagement. It has been performed by the authors of [148] who use data\
    \ collected\nfrom consumers in a smart grid to determine load for up to 24 h in\
    \ advance. They treat\nthis as primarily a clustering problem where they form\
    \ clusters of similar load profiles\nand then use distance functions to determine\
    \ energy consumption for the future. The\nauthors in [149] also use a cloud based\
    \ clustering approach, using historical power\ndata, they use K-Means clustering\
    \ to determine the closest historical records and then\ncombine them to predict\
    \ energy consumption 24 h in advance. The load forecasting\nproblem has been dealt\
    \ as a regression by [150] using a SVM and by [151] through an\nRNN using electricity\
    \ power data. A regression approach is also followed by [152, 153]\nwho use electricity\
    \ consumption in addition to environmental data for load forecasting\nusing deep\
    \ learning methods (DNN and a combination of Autoencoders and RNNs\n(GRU)). Edge\
    \ based systems have been suggested by the authors of [154, 155, 156]\n36\nTable\

    \ grid management/monitoring is also a\nnecessary application in this domain.\
    \ The authors in [157] use decision trees in a cloud\nbased system to classify\
    \ between different faults in a smart grid. In [158], the authors\nuse power consumption\
    \ data from consumers in China to determine electricity theft\nin a cloud based\
    \ system. They use wide and deep convolutional neural networks to\ncapture the\
    \ periodic and nonperiodic components from electricity consumption data\nand show\
    \ their network to be suitable for electricity theft detection. The authors in\n\
    [159] present a framework for edge computing based monitoring of the smart grid.\n\
    Edge computing in the smart grid has several advantages as it reduces delay and\
    \ also\nit is secure in terms of data privacy. A summary of the use of IoT based\

    \ two major applications of IoT with AI in health, these are activity recog-\n\
    nition/fall detection and disease diagnosis/health monitoring, a summary of the\
    \ IoT\nbased AI systems used in Smart Health is presented in Table 10. Activity\
    \ recog-\nnition involves the use of movement sensors such as accelerometers,\
    \ gyroscopes and\nmagnetometers with the aim to help provide the user with feedback\
    \ on their health.\nThis can be in terms of them having enough physical exercise\
    \ or not, used for sports\ntherapy, fall detection and for monitoring of different\
    \ diseases such as Parkinson’s or\nother motor degenerative ailments. The most\
    \ popular sensor for activity recognition\nare inertial sensors which have been\
    \ used by [160, 161] in a cloud based setting using\nvarious deep and machine\
    \ learning algorithms. In [162], Castro et al. include vital\nsign data in addition\
    \ to movement information for human activity recognition in a\ncloud environment,\
    \ they utilize the DT as their classifier. In [163],, the authors pro-\npose an\
    \ edge-based system to perform activity recognition for people by recording\n\
    their movements using the accelerometer and gyroscope present on the phone. They\n\
    use a SVM as their classifier and differentiate between six different activities\
    \ of daily\nliving. Fall detection has been performed by [164, 165] in a fog and\
    \ edge environment,\nrespectively, using an accelerometer, Santos et al. [164]\
    \ use a CNN while Yacchirema\net al. [165] useRFCwith both approaches showing\
    \ promising results.\nEquipped with the power of AI in IoT, Smart Health systems\
    \ facilitate the provi-\nsion of telehealth services as well as real time monitoring\
    \ of patients, giving doctors\nand patients feedback on their health.\nHealth\
    \ monitoring systems and real time\ndisease diagnosis have been one of the most\
    \ important applications of IoT technol-\nogy. The authors in [166, 167, 168,\
    \ 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176] develop\ncloud based health monitoring\
    \ systems for detecting various types of diseases, such\n38\nas heart (stroke\
    \ [167], irregular sound [169], irregular rhythm [171, 173]), epilep-\ntic seizures\
    \ [172], Parkinson seizure [176] and multiple disease diagnosis systems\n[174,\
    \ 175]. In [174, 175], the authors formulate the problem of disease diagnosis\
    \ as\na classification problem and utilize medical data such as ECGs, EEG, heart\
    \ rate,\nblood pressure, blood sugar, heart sound, blood glucose, liver health\
    \ along with var-\nious machine and deep learning methods to achieve this task.\
    \ Fog and edge based\nhealth monitoring/disease diagnosis systems have also been\
    \ suggested by a number\nof researchers. The authors in [177] present a fog based\
    \ system using a deep neural\nnetwork to detect heart disease from a patients\
    \ vital signs (blood oxygen, heart rate,\nrespiration rate, EEG, ECG, EMG, blood\
    \ pressure, glucose) and activity data. In\n[178], Devarajan & Ravi work on a\
    \ fog computing based Parkinson detection system\nusing a persons speech. Moreover,\
    \ an edge computing system is presented in [179]\nwhich utilizes EEG signals to\
    \ determine seizures in patients.\nTable 10. AI use for Smart Health\nApplication\n\

    \ Smart Homes.\nThis is especially\nneeded for the elderly and is typically achieved\
    \ by the use of ambient sensors, Wi-Fi\nand radio frequency systems in smart homes.\
    \ In this work, we include all monitoring\nmethods that depend on sensors placed\
    \ in the home/within the smart home domain.\nIn [182], Pirzada et al. use a network\
    \ of reed switches connected to the cloud to\nmonitor the activities of elderly\
    \ people as a clustering problem. They use the K-\nNN algorithm to determine anomalies\
    \ in the daily activities which can then be used\nto send medical or other help\
    \ requests to assist people. A similar setup for activity\nrecognition for ambient\
    \ assisted living has been presented in [183, 184, 185] where they\nuse data from\
    \ a number of different sensors including motion, presence, water float,\ntemperature\
    \ etc to determine various activities being performed in a home. In [186],\na\
    \ cloud based assisted living system for the deaf has been developed that performs\n\
    haptic conversions for sounds detected in a home. An array of sensors are used\
    \ to\nmonitor environmental sound and the authors use RNNs for detecting the sound\n\
    event before its passed on to the haptic vibration producer. Another task within\n\
    in monitoring is localization of people, this part of smart homes is also applicable\n\
    to smart infrastructure in that such systems are used in smart buildings as well.\n\
    Applications of localization include security, i.e., detecting unauthorized presence\n\
    and people monitoring in general (for, e.g., locating elderly people in homes)\
    \ etc.\nThe authors in [187] perform localization using a grid of Wi-Fi units\
    \ that measure\nsignal strength to determine peoples locations indoors for buildings.\
    \ They formulate\nthis both as a classification problem as well as a regression\
    \ problem. The classification\nproblem being formulated as coded locations (for,\
    \ e.g., a given room no) while the\nregression case estimating the location of\
    \ the user in a coordinate grid. Their system is\ncloud based and they use a deep\
    \ neural network to perform this task and have found\nsuitably good results. Occupancy\
    \ detection has been performed by the authors of\n[188] making use of various\
    \ ambient measurements (temperature, humidity, pressure\netc.) and passing them\
    \ to a cloud before using a deep neural network to classify\nbetween the various\
    \ number of people present in an indoor environment. In [189],\nZimmermann et\
    \ al. also make use of ambient sensors for the occupancy problem and\nuse a na¨ıve\
    \ bayes learner to determine both the presence of occupants as well as their\n\
    number.\nHome automation is another application that the IoT finds application\n\
    within the Smart Home domain. The integration of AI has helped develop smart\n\
    home automation systems that aim to reduce energy consumption in homes as well\n\
    as maintain user privacy, security. Chowdhry et al. [190] use a combination of\
    \ visual\ndata and motion sensing to perform home automation for security using\
    \ a SVM.\nAn interesting use of AI in home automation is presented in [191] who\
    \ develop a\ncloud based home automation system, they take measurements from various\
    \ ambient\nsensors and control appliances and use a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier to\
    \ determine which\ntechnician to call whenever sensor measurements appear aberrated.\
    \ The problem of\nintelligent consumption of energy has been considered by [192]\
    \ who develop an energy\ndisaggregation system on the appliance level in smart\
    \ homes using stacked denoising\nautoencoders. They achieve this using power data\
    \ for individual appliances as well\n40\nas the total power consumed in the home\
    \ and send it to a local cloud. Data is then\ndisaggregated for various appliances\
    \ to provide feedback to the user.\nMore work\nproviding energy intelligence to\
    \ consumers has been performed by [193, 194, 195].\nKonstantakopoulos et al. [195]\
    \ pose this as a regression problem, they propose a\ncloud-based system utilizing\
    \ both ambient sensor data (lighting, temperature etc)\nand appliance power data\
    \ to forecast resource usage for consumers using a RNN.\nThey show a reduction\
    \ in energy consumption for their users using this information.\nEventhough applications\
    \ covered in smart homes have been cloud based systems,\nthere have been recent\
    \ proposals for frameworks that combine edge and cloud pro-\ncessing as in [196]\
    \ who discuss a hierarchical control system for smart homes through\na edge microgrid\
    \ and a cloud power grid. Due to the nature of smart homes in that\nthe sensing\
    \ scheme is present within a finite space (within the home), edge and fog\ncomputing\
    \ based systems are expected to be increasingly incorporated smart home\napplications.\
    \ A summary of the use of IoT based AI in Smart Homes is presented in\nTable 11.\n\
    3.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the major applications of AI in the IoT powered smart\
    \ industry is towards\nfault detection in products and anomaly detection in industrial\
    \ processes. This has\nseen the use of both Machine Learning (SVM [197, 198],RFC[199,\
    \ 200]) as well as\nDeep Learning (DNN [201, 202, 203], CNN [204]) methods using\
    \ a cloud computing\nstructure to perform anomaly detection/product inspection\
    \ and monitoring using a\nvariety of heterogeneous and homogenous data sources\
    \ such as inertial sensors for ma-\nchines, images for products and processes\
    \ and other process specific variables. Other\napproaches suggested in [205, 206]\
    \ propose a fog computing method along with edge\ncomputing systems suggested\
    \ in [207, 208]. An edge computing system for anomaly\ndetection is presented\
    \ in [209] where edge devices collaboratively train a deep anomaly\ndetection\
    \ model. Production management is another application that has found usage\nof\
    \ AI in IoT based smart Industry. For, e.g., the authors in [210, 211, 212, 213,\
    \ 214]\nuse cloud based data driven systems along with machine and deep learning\
    \ algorithms\nto help with task dispatching, performance analysis as well as worker\
    \ activity recog-\nnition utilizing a variety of sensing modalities. The work\
    \ of [213, 214] are especially\ninteresting as they aim is to not only perform\
    \ production management but also pro-\npose data for various health related analysis\
    \ to create a safer working environment\non the factory floor. A fog system for\
    \ production management has been presented in\n[215] who use activity data to\
    \ determine resource allocation locations to contribute\nto management of a production\
    \ operation. Furthermore, product inspection, which\nis a common application of\
    \ instrumentation systems in a factory, has been performed\nby [216, 217] who\
    \ utilize images and sensor data in a cloud based system to monitor\nproduct quality.\n\
    A factory has a multitude of machines and equipment working round the clock\n\
    manufacturing goods. Maintenance is an important aspect of this operation where\n\
    regular checks are performed on the equipment to ensure that no breakdown occurs\n\
    during the production process, which might result in monetary loss or loss of\
    \ life.\n41\nTable 11. AI use for Smart Homes\nApplication\nNetwork\nSystem\n\

    \ with the data gathered by various sensors on these machines, it is often\nmore\
    \ beneficial to take an active approach rather than a passive one by using this\n\
    data for predictive maintenance purposes. Predictive maintenance utilizes data\
    \ from\nthe daily operation of machines in an industry to optimize the manufacturing\
    \ op-\neration [218] and is one of the main uses for AI in the industry. In [219,\
    \ 220], the\nauthors suggest a predictive maintenance scheme using SVMs utilizing\
    \ data from ac-\ncelerometers measuring vibration in a crane motor and data from\
    \ various sources in\na semiconductor manufacturing process, respectively, both\
    \ work in a cloud environ-\nment as evidenced from the architecture. Prediction\
    \ of failure can also be a regression\noperation, as was demonstrated by [221]\
    \ who use RNNs to predict future values of\na physical parameters of a pump using\
    \ a number of heterogeneous sensors used to\nmonitor it. As with the other two\
    \ systems, this system also had a cloud architecture.\nThe authors in [170] also\
    \ present a regression based health prognosis system for the\nindustry using a\
    \ CNN on machine data (Images, stress, temperature, vibration, po-\n42\nsition\
    \ and electromagnetic signal measurements). The use of IoT based AI in Smart\n\
    Industry has been presented in Table 12.\n3.7\nSmart Infrastructure\nAn application\
    \ within smart infrastructures also involves monitoring of civil structures\n\
    for structural health. The authors in [222] take a clustering approach to perform\n\
    health monitoring of a bridge using vibration data in a cloud setting.\nThey use\n\
    clustering to determine clusters of abnormal behavior in accelerometer measurements\n\
    from a bridge. In [223, 224, 225], accelerometer signals have been used where\
    \ as [226]\nhave used piezo electric transducers for performing structural health\
    \ monitoring of\nbridges formulated as a classification problem between different\
    \ damaged states of\na bridge. The prime sensing modality for monitoring has been\
    \ measuring vibration\nusing accelerometers, however, other sensors such as fiber\
    \ optic gratings can also be\nused to measure stress.\nThe second avenue for AI\
    \ applications in IoT for smart infrastructure is the use\nof IoT devices for\
    \ building environment control and energy management as well com-\nfort aware\
    \ control. This involves the prediction of building energy usage based on\nenvironmental\
    \ data (such as temperature, humidity) and electrical power data. The\nauthors\
    \ in [227] and [228] use electric power data and heat flow information in a\n\
    building to predict the energy requirements in the future so as to better manage\
    \ en-\nergy consumption. Ambience control of a museum has been performed in [229]\
    \ where\nthe authors use deep learning algorithms to predict the CO2 and humidity\
    \ levels\nfor the care of exhibits. Comfort aware energy management has been performed\
    \ in\n[230] where the authors use a CNN to regulate thermal comfort in a building\
    \ using\nvarious physical quantities. It can be noted that all of these mentioned\
    \ systems have\nbeen deployed in the cloud, this is due to the nature of the application.\
    \ However,\nthere have been efforts for developing fog/edge systems for smart\
    \ infrastructure. The\nauthors in [231] describe a framework for deploying edge\
    \ and fog computing services\nin smart buildings and demonstrate their systems\
    \ effectiveness for the case of energy\nmanagement. Table 13 summarizes the use\
    \ of IoT based AI in Smart Infrastructure.\n3.8\nSmart Transport\nMajor smart\
    \ transportation applications involve smart parking and transportation\nmanagement.\
    \ Smart parking aims to solve the problem of helping users finding park-\ning\
    \ spots in order to save time as well as reduce gas emissions and is therefore\
    \ a much-\nresearched topic for AI deployment towards smart transportation. Solutions\
    \ to this\nproblem have been formulated both as a regression problem as well as\
    \ a classification\none, both utilizing imaging and/or other occupancy sensing\
    \ modalities. Regression\nsolutions [232, 233, 234] are typically used to predict\
    \ a parking lots occupancy levels\nin the future whereas classification systems\
    \ [235, 236, 237] involve guiding drivers ac-\ncording to the shortest distance\
    \ as well as used for user localization purposes within\nsuch lots. In addition\
    \ to cloud based approaches, edge computing systems for smart\nparking have also\
    \ been devised as suggested in [238, 239] who deploy CNNs on edge\n43\nTable 12.\

    \ determining traffic flow as well as\nprediction of traffic flow for traffic\
    \ light control and other management tasks such as\naccident detection. In this\
    \ regard, video cameras are popular for detection of vehicle\ndensity on roads\
    \ for traffic congestion determination. However, with most cars having\na GPS\
    \ device and the commonality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\n\
    use the data from the GPS along with weather and generic traffic flow information\n\
    to determine traffic prediction. The nature of traffic flow prediction using sensing\n\
    modalities such as GPS require systems to be operated as cloud-based systems as\n\
    is the case in [240, 241, 242, 243]. Of these, Wangyang et al. [242] and Xiao\
    \ et al.\n[243] use deep learning based sequential modeling approaches to predict\
    \ traffic flow\nahead of time where as Aung & Naing [240] and Yunxiang Liu & Wu\
    \ [241] solve this\nthrough a classification formulation. A traffic management\
    \ system for public buses\nhas been proposed in [33, 244] where GPS data is used\
    \ to predict bus arrival times\nfor public transportation systems. Accident detection\
    \ has been performed using car\nposition and velocity information in a Vehicular\
    \ Adhoc NETworks (VANET) envi-\nronment by the authors of [245]. They do this\
    \ through a cloud based system that\ncan use this information to predict whether\
    \ an accident has occurred or not. Apart\nfrom typical sensing modalities, with\
    \ smart phones and user participation in social\nmedia, smart transportation systems\
    \ are expected to increasingly include more sens-\ning modalities [246] fused\
    \ together for use in decision making for traffic management\npurposes. Mukherji\
    \ et al. [247] use Wi-Fi signals to determine commuter traffic a\nsubway station.\
    \ They do this by using the measured signal strength of the Wi-Fi\nsignals along\
    \ with a Random Forest classifier in a cloud-based setting. Their system\nis able\
    \ to determine if a person is on the train or on the platform which can be used\n\
    to help with planning train times and routes. A summary of IoT based AI for Smart\n\

    This chapter presents a coverage of combinatorial optimization in IoT based smart\n\
    cities by deliberating on the most popular applications of optimization algorithms\n\
    and providing an insight to how those problems are formulated and worked upon.\
    \ It\nprovides a mapped overview of the optimization landscape in the smart city\
    \ domain\nwhile considering the IoT. Through this mapping, the common optimization\
    \ problems\nacross the various components of the IoT enabled smart city have been\
    \ identified. For\neach problem discussed, the objective function used, the nature\
    \ of the objective as\nwell as the constraints considered have also been elaborated\
    \ on.\n2\nOptimization and Heuristics in IoT Smart Cities\nAs has been observed\
    \ by [249], combinatorial optimization problems in the real-world\nare known to\
    \ be difficult to formulate and generally are hard to solve. Moreover,\nchoosing\
    \ the right algorithm is also a tedious task as each comes with a different\n\
    set of characterizations. This is very applicable to the IoT bases smart city\
    \ where\napplications in each component caters to a different environment and\
    \ aspect of the\ncity’s operation and therefore requires intricate design of the\
    \ problem. This chapter\ntakes guidance from the work of [249]. They note that\
    \ the most popular algorithms for\nuse in combinatorial optimization problems\
    \ are the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),\nGenetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm\
    \ Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution\n(DE) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC).\
    \ Moreover, following from their discussion, six\nfactors are considered for each\
    \ application identified. These are:\n1. The type of application: This refers\
    \ to the problem being optimized within the\nsmart city domain.\n2. Data Setup:\
    \ For each application, we mention the data setup used. While doing\nso, we aim\
    \ to capture the various ways in which researchers have sourced data\nfor their\
    \ proposed method.\n3. Single-Parallel problems: Another thing to note in smart\
    \ city optimization\nproblems is whether a problem has been considered as a single\
    \ problem or\nmultiple sub-problems/parallel.\n4. Objective direction, function\
    \ and number of objectives: Maximization or mini-\nmization, lowest fitness function\
    \ value desirable or higher fitness function value\n49\nis desirable.\nSince we\
    \ list the objectives, we also covere the number of ob-\njectives inherently.\
    \ Single objective, where a single fitness is optimized for its\nbest value or\
    \ multi-objective where multiple objective functions need to be con-\nsidered\
    \ at the same time. The latter is a complex process as some objectives\nmay have\
    \ conflicts and thus requires the need to perform trade-offs with what’s\nacceptable.\n\
    5. Constraints: Constraints are a set of restrictions or prerequisites that may\n\
    sometimes be necessary to determine if a solution is considered valid or not.\n\
    Soft constraints are desirable but not necessary whereas hard constraints are\n\
    mandatory to be met. Constraints are put on the fitness function according to\n\
    application being considered. Covering this aspect is particularly important as\n\
    constraints are determined by the application being worked on.\n3\nMeheuristic\
    \ Algorithms\nMetaheuristic algorithms are widely used to solve combinatorial\
    \ optimziation prob-\nlems in the real-world [249]. The aim of these algorithms\
    \ is to determine the minima\nor maxima of an objective function which translates\
    \ an optimization objective in to\none or more mathematical equations. Five algorithms\
    \ have been considered in this\nchapter, these are the Ant Colony Algorithm, Genetic\
    \ Algorithm, Particle Swarm Op-\ntimization Algorithm, Differential Evolution\
    \ and Artificial Bee Colony. As mentioned\nearlier, these have been chosen as\
    \ these were the most commonly used optimzation\nalgorithms identified by [249].\
    \ In this section, we provide a brief intuitive description\nfor each of them.\n\
    3.1\nAnt Colony Optimization\nAnt colony optimization is derived from the behavior\
    \ of ants searching for food\n[250]. It was observed that during this process,\
    \ each ant deposits a chemical called\npheromone on the path which it takes towards\
    \ the food. The more the ants take a\ngiven path, the more the pheromone is deposited\
    \ on it. Subsequent ants that want\nto go towards the food use the amount of pheromone\
    \ on a given path or sub-path\nto decide which path to take so as to determine\
    \ the optimal route to the food. In\nthe artificial ant colony optimization algorithm,\
    \ the points on the path that form the\nsub-paths are encoded on a graph where\
    \ each ant can only visit a given vertex (travel\non the same sub-path) once.\
    \ Each iteration starts with a number of artificial ants,\nan ant would choose\
    \ the next vertex to visit based on the level of pheromone on the\npossible sub-paths\
    \ available to it as well as whether that path has been used before.\nAt the end\
    \ of each iteration, the pheromone levels are updated so as to prioritize the\n\
    use of the most used path for ants in the next iteration.\n3.2\nGenetic Algorithm\n\
    A genetic algorithm [251] is based on evolutionary science. The idea behind the\
    \ ge-\nnetic algorithm is that starting from a given population set of organisms,\
    \ subsequent\n50\nreproduction will result in fitter organisms being produced\
    \ given that the organisms\nchosen for reproduction have some level of fitness.\
    \ To solve an optimization prob-\nlem, a genetic algorithm begins with a given\
    \ population size of strings also called\na chromosome. Each ‘chromosome’ consists\
    \ of a ‘gene’ which may represent points\nin the population. The sequence in which\
    \ the genes are present would represent a\nsolution to the problem. For e.g. for\
    \ a route scheduling problem, this may be the\ncoordinates of the stops. The ‘goodness’\
    \ of a chromosome is determined by a fitness\nfunction that quantifies how appropriate\
    \ a given chromosome is as a solution for the\nproblem. Choosing the right fitness\
    \ function is an important consideration in genetic\nalgorithms as it needs to\
    \ gauge the kind of optimization that is to be performed.\nThe optimization process\
    \ starts with an initial population of a given size. Once a fit-\nness function\
    \ has been defined, in each iteration, two or more chromosomes (parents)\nare\
    \ taken at random from the population and one or more offsprings are generated.\n\
    The random selection takes the selected parents fitness function value in to account,\n\
    however, its necessary that not all parents chosen are the fittest of the population\
    \ as\notherwise, diversity will be compromised, and the algorithm may get stuck\
    \ in a local\nminimum. The method by which these offspring are generated is called\
    \ the Crossover\nfunction and the number of parents mated to form offsprings from\
    \ them depends\non the crossover rate. The Crossover function defines the way\
    \ the genes within the\nchromosomes are exchanged. Usually, the crossover rate\
    \ has a high value. Moreover,\ndepending on some mutation rate, a given fraction\
    \ of all offsprings are mutated. Mu-\ntation depends on the mutation function\
    \ used and involves members of the offspring\nbeing swapped in some manner. When\
    \ one iteration of the offspring creation from\nthe parents in the entire population\
    \ is completed, the offsprings replace members of\nthe original population (typically\
    \ the weakest) and one generation of the GA is said\nto be completed. In order\
    \ to converge to a sufficiently good result, GA’s need to run\nfor many generations.\n\
    3.3\nParticle Swarm Optimization\nParticle Swarm Optimization is modeled on the\
    \ social behavior of animals rather than\nthe evolutionary biological behavior\
    \ on which Genetic Algorithms are based. PSO\n[252] is particularly based on the\
    \ behavior of a flock of birds searching for food. Each\nbird in the flock searches\
    \ for food and can communicate with other birds in the flock\nas soon as it finds\
    \ food or a good direction for it. Therefore, each bird has two food\n‘directions’\
    \ that it needs to consider, first is on an individual level which is called\n\
    the personal best and the second is on the flock level which is the global best.\
    \ Using\nthese two values the bird will proceed towards that path and will inform\
    \ other birds\nin the flock too. The idea here is that after enough time and with\
    \ all the individuals\nworking together, the swarm will find the place with the\
    \ highest concentration of\nfood. In terms of using PSO for optimization tasks,\
    \ individual birds are equivalent\nto a solution as in a GA and each is considered\
    \ as a point or a particle, collectively\nthey make up the swarm. This swarm population\
    \ may be initialized randomly or\nbased on some domain knowledge about the problem.\
    \ The highest concentration of\nfood represents the optimal solution for the whole\
    \ swarm where as a good direction\n51\nrepresents the local optimal solution for\
    \ each case. The aim here, like birds in a flock\nis to determine the global optimal\
    \ solution using information from each individual\nparticle. Each particle has\
    \ three aspects to it, its position, its velocity and a value of\nits current\
    \ position’s ’goodness’. This ’goodness’ as in the GA is defined by a fitness\n\
    function. Like birds, each particle has a personal best fitness value and is also\
    \ aware\nof the global best fitness value. For any particle, the new direction\
    \ of movement is\ndecided by a combination of the personal best and the global\
    \ best as well as the\nparticle’s intention to maintain its current movement.\
    \ Furthermore, several different\ntopologies can be utilized, and a neighborhood\
    \ can also be set for each particle to\nconvey positions when limiting the global\
    \ best parameter to the local best scheme\nrather than the whole swarm. The algorithm\
    \ may be stopped till the best solution is\nreached or no more improvement is\
    \ observed.\n3.4\nDifferential Evolution\nDifferential evolution [253] is a stochastic\
    \ evolutionary algorithm which is used for\noptimization problems for continuous\
    \ functions. The DE algorithm does not expect\ngradient information and thus it\
    \ doesn’t need to be differentiable. Like other evolu-\ntionary algorithms, a\
    \ solution is searched for in the design space by maintaining a\nset of individual\
    \ candidate solutions. In each iteration, the solutions with the best\nfitness\
    \ are combined together and retained for the next iteration. The aim is to im-\n\
    prove upon the fitness value and this process is repeated until a pre-decided\
    \ condition\nfor termination of this process is satisfied. Differential Evolution\
    \ is very similar to\nGenetic Algorithms in that both are evolutionary in nature,\
    \ however, the difference\nis that the DE uses real numbers in the chromosome\
    \ and also that the mutation oper-\nation consists of the difference between two\
    \ or more chromosomes of the population\nwith the possible addition of some type\
    \ of noise to create a new individual. Like\nGA, DE also suffer from getting stuck\
    \ in local minima. The DE algorithm also has\nthree control parameters, the population\
    \ size, the mutation factor and the crossover\nprobability.\n3.5\nArtificial Bee\
    \ Colony\nArticle Bee Colony [254] is a swarm intelligence algorithm based on\
    \ the behavior of\nbees. Within bees, there are different social classes who work\
    \ together to complete\ntasks such as harvesting pollen and nesting through the\
    \ use of smell, ’swing dance’\nand other methods. Bee colonies consist of three\
    \ types of bees, queen, male and\nthe worker bees which work on activities such\
    \ as searching for food, gathering and\nstorage of honey.\nAfter gathering honey,\
    \ the worker bee comes to the nest and\ninforms other bees about the location\
    \ of the honey source site through a dance. The\nABC algorithm simulates the behavior\
    \ of bees by considering three elements, the\nfood source, employed bees and unemployed\
    \ bees. The food source is represented as\nrevenue considering its distance and\
    \ quality, the higher the revenue, the better is the\nvalue. In computational\
    \ optimization terms, the food source is a potential solution\nto the objective\
    \ formulation of the considered problem and the quality or value of\n52\nthe food\
    \ source represents the fitness value of that particular solution. At the start,\n\
    all bees are used as scouts, searching for food sources. When a food source is\
    \ found,\nfor a high value food source, bees who find those food sources become\
    \ hire bees and\ncollect the food source. If the food source is of intermediate\
    \ value, the bees become\nfollow bees and if the food source value becomes low,\
    \ the bees become scout bees to\nlook for better food sources. Hire bees, the\
    \ bees with a food source location having\na high value, lead the follow bees\
    \ to develop solutions in their neighborhood in order\nto come up with more solutions.\
    \ A subset of the highest-ranking solutions are then\nconsidered before this process\
    \ is repeated again until the end conditions are met.\n4\nOptimization Applications\
    \ in Smart Cities\nSeveral tasks in smart city operations require the use of metheuristics\
    \ to be solved,\nthe aim being to optimize the resources present in the city.\
    \ This section presents\nthe different uses of optimization techniques for IoT\
    \ enabled Smart Cities.\nThis\ntask is performed for all eight components, Smart\
    \ Agriculture, Smart City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart\
    \ Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\nInfrastructure and Smart Transportation.\n4.1\n\
    Smart Agriculture\nSmart Agriculture involves the use of digital technologies\
    \ such as sensors and in-\ntelligent systems to improve agricultural productivity.\
    \ The sustenance of agriculture\ndepends on water, and it is central to the agricultural\
    \ production of food items around\nthe world. However, water is becoming an ever-scarce\
    \ resource due to the increasing\ndemand caused by human population growth, increased\
    \ economic activity by indus-\ntries and also due to climate change. It therefore\
    \ is necessary to utilize this precious\nresource wisely so as make use of it\
    \ in the best manner possible.\nOne approach\ntowards ensuring that water and\
    \ land is used appropriately is by introducing irriga-\ntion management schemes\
    \ such as irrigation scheduling and water allocation in the\nfarming process.\
    \ A summary of the optimization problems, objectives, constraints in\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and the use of IoT is illustrated in Figure 8.\nMeasurements in water irrigation\
    \ systems are typically performed by sensors\nplaced at different points in the\
    \ canals and rivers to determine water flow, volume and\nspeed. This information\
    \ regarding water movement can be combined with economic\ninformation such as\
    \ yeild, crop profit to optimize water distribution. Irrigation man-\nagement\
    \ through scheduling has been performed by the authors of [255, 256, 257, 258]\n\
    to maximize net return on crop profits, water use efficiency and to minimize leakage\n\
    losses. In [259] Fuqiang et al. aim to optimize water delivery through canals\
    \ while\nalso performing scheduling. They do this using a genetic algorithm and\
    \ work with\ntwo objectives, minimizing the difference between the time of water\
    \ delivery and wa-\nter demand and the fluctuation in water discharge of the main\
    \ canal. Their model\nwas applied to a district in China.\nThe authors in [260,\
    \ 261] work on optimal allocation of water. Of these, Ikudayisi\net al. [260]\
    \ use the differential evolution algorithm to minimize the water allocated to\n\

    \ terms of job creation, ensuring\nfood security and the yield of crops.\nWu et\
    \ al.\n[261] approach this as problem\nof reducing deviation between different\
    \ channels and minimizing water seepage to\nensure a more consistent supply to\
    \ all water channels. An approach presented by\nOcampo et al. [262] tackles this\
    \ problem not as a task of allocation directly but\nconsiders the scenario of\
    \ providing sufficient water to a smart farm while controlling\ntwo water pumps.\
    \ The objective function is formulated to minimize the energy cost\nof the water\
    \ pumps while maintaining sufficient supply of water to the plants on the\nfarms.\
    \ Constraints considered for such applications include the limited quantities\
    \ of\nwater being worked with, the time for which the water was available and\
    \ the area\nof land which was to be considered. Another allocation based scheme\
    \ is presented\nby Zhuo et al. [263] who use a genetic algorithm for an irrigation\
    \ system based on\na reservoir and two pumping stations. Their aim is to ensure\
    \ that there is no water\n54\nshortage. The objective function used by them is\
    \ the minimization of the annual sum\nof squared water shortage. Other work in\
    \ [264] also minimizes use of groundwater\nand increase benefit to the regional\
    \ water supply through reduction of water deficits\nin the Dujiangyan region of\
    \ China.\nA precision agriculture scheme is presented by Roy et al.\n[265] who\
    \ combine\nan IoT system consisting of sensors on plants using a GA based rainfall\
    \ predictor.\nCombining predicted rainfall information along with the sensed moisture\
    \ level in\nthe crops, they control plant watering. Lin et al. [266] propose a\
    \ framework for the\nmanagement of fertigation and irrigation in precision agriculture.\
    \ They perform short\nterm management and long-term management. Soil and crop\
    \ growth data is gathered\nfrom IoT based sensor systems. Long term planning refers\
    \ to the allocation of water\nand fertilizer resources to crops in terms of quantity\
    \ so as to meet demands whereas\nshort term refers to when and how to use them.\
    \ They use a genetic algorithm for long\nterm planning considering the allocation\
    \ of water and fertilizer for crops to maintain\npH value and electrical conductivity.\
    \ This information has been presented in Table\n16 while a summary of the identified\
    \ data sources used by each considered work has\nbeen provided in Table 17.\n\
    4.2\nSmart City Services\nAccording to the world bank, the amount of annual solid\
    \ waste generated is set to be\n3.40 billion tons [268] in 2050. Managing this\
    \ waste and its collection in an efficient\nmanner is imperative for health and\
    \ climate reaons. The most common application\ntowards smart city services optimization\
    \ is waste management as illustrated in Figure\n9 which summarizes the objectives,\
    \ constraints and the use of IoT.\nSmart waste collection systems include sensors\
    \ attached to trash cans which can\ninform the municipal authority about the status\
    \ of the garbage amount present in\nthem.\nOnce the trash cans are close to being\
    \ full, it is the responsibility of the\nmunicipal corporation to perform garbage\
    \ collection in an efficient manner. In this\nrespect, data provided by the sensors\
    \ on garbage cans can be used to determine\nan optimized route for garbage collection\
    \ to construct the Vehicle Routing Problem\n(VRP) in the Smart City Services domain.\
    \ As such, this problem has been performed\nkeeping in view various goals. The\
    \ minimization of the route distance taken by a\ngarbage tuck has been performed\
    \ by the authors in [269, 270, 271, 272, 273]. The\naim in this case is to determine\
    \ a route for garbage collection vehicles that minimizes\nthe total distance traveled\
    \ by the them. Zhang et al. [273] consider multi-vehicle\nallocation while considering\
    \ the single objective of minimizing route distance. Wei\net al. [274] use the\
    \ Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to determine garbage collection\nroutes resulting\
    \ in the minimum emission of CO2. Another optimization objective\nin route optimization\
    \ for waste management has been the minimization of the total\ntravel time, such\
    \ a target is described by the authors of [275, 276, 277, 278] who aim\nto reduce\
    \ travel time while considering emptying of waste bins. Another optimization\n\
    consideration in route optimization for waste management is to reduce cost. This\
    \ has\nbeen carried out by Tirkolaee et al. [279] who formulate a multi-objective\
    \ function of\ntravel cost and total useage cost of vehicles and determine the\
    \ route with the minimum\n55\nTable 16. Optimization in Smart Agriculture\nApplication\n\

    the applications, objectives, constraints and IoT usage for optimization algorithms\
    \ in\nSmart Grids has been illustrated in Figure 10.\nAn increasing population\
    \ has led to an increasing demand for electricity around\nthe world. This burdening\
    \ of the electricity grid has led to measures for increasing\nthe performance\
    \ of the electricity distribution system by reducing loss, prevent over-\nload\
    \ and reduce cost. The authors in [282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288] work on\n\
    the improvement of grid performance by minimizing cost and reducing power losses.\n\
    Power loss minimization is specifically targeted by [282, 286, 284]. Of these,\
    \ Ettappan\net al. [282] aim for the reduction of power losses, voltage deviation\
    \ and increasing\nvoltage stability. Atteya et al. [286] also address this problem\
    \ by considering net-\nwork redistribution to minimize losses in the grid whereas\
    \ Sakr et al. [284] focuses\non minimizing transfer losses in the smart grid to\
    \ accomplish this task. Nguyen and\nMohammadi [285] attempt the reduction of power\
    \ losses and line congestion by deter-\nmining the location of thyristor controlled\
    \ series compensator devices. The problem\nis formulated as a multi-objective\
    \ problem aiming to minimize loadability of the lines,\nactive power loss and\
    \ the reactance of the transmission line. A cost reduction-based\napproach to\
    \ improve grid performance is followed by Das et al. [283] who aim to\nreduce\
    \ cost of maintaining electrical stability and also the cost of management of\
    \ the\ndistribution network. They do this by considering changing the location\
    \ of energy\nstorage systems within the grid. Kanwar et al. [287] take maximizing\

    \ while considering sizing of a distributed energy resource\ngeneration system.\n\
    Distributed energy resource (DER) management is another area where optimiza-\n\
    tion algorithms are used in Smart Grids. The management of distributed energy\n\
    sources within smart grids is dependent on the interconnectivity provided by IoT\n\
    in the smart grid system.\nSmart meters within the smart grid provide real-time\n\
    information relating to power consumption which can be used for controlling DER\n\
    electricity. Moreover, IoT devices allow for switching loads and generation sources\
    \ as\nrequired. This assists in creating a virtual power plant to aggregate all\
    \ energy sources\nin a DER scenario. With global warming and a changing climate,\
    \ utilities around\nthe world are increasingly incorporating various renewable\
    \ energy sources within their\ngrid which often times are an economically convenient\
    \ option as well. However, many\n59\nof these sources such as wind and solar (photo\
    \ voltaic [PV]) do not offer a consistent\nsupply of power throughout the day.\
    \ In this regard, systems such as batteries as\nwell as conventional generation\
    \ plants need to be used together along with renewable\nenergy sources. For utility\
    \ companies, it is necessary to optimize power production\nso that the maximum\
    \ amount of energy is utilized from these renewable sources so\nas to reduce cost\
    \ to the user while also maintaining the quality of service. The au-\nthors in\
    \ [289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302] provide\n\
    a management scheme for DERs to minimize cost. In this regard, the authors in\n\
    [292, 293, 294, 297, 289, 290, 300, 301, 302] all formulate the problem of distributed\n\
    energy resource management as a single objective problem where the cost incurred\
    \ is\nminimized. On the other hand, the authors in [298, 295, 291] and [299] formulate\
    \ this\nas a multi-objective problem. Azaza and Wallin [299] not only target reduction\
    \ of\nelectricity production cost but also maximize reliability of the system\
    \ while reducing\nthe environmental impact of the distribution system. It is interesting\
    \ to note that the\nimprovement of system reliability is formulated as a minimization\
    \ problem as well.\nSimilarly, Das et, al. [291] consider the reduction of both\
    \ the total cost as well as\nthe environmental cost of the system. Their considered\
    \ scenario also consists of a\nPV, Wind Turbine and battery. The constraints considered\
    \ were constraints regard-\ning power flow, limitations on power and voltage values,\
    \ power balance constraint\nand power generation constraints on the renewable\
    \ energy sources. In [289, 302], a\nDER management system is developed for a microgrid\
    \ which consists of a controllable\ncollection of energy storage and generation\
    \ sources powered by IoT devices.\nPlanning in distribution networks has been\
    \ considered by the work of [303] and\n[304]. Mahdavi et al. [303] work on expanding\
    \ transmission lines utilizing the artificial\nbee colony algorithm to minimize\
    \ cost of network expansion, power losses in load\nand generation. On the other\
    \ hand, Maji and Acharjee [304] aim to determine the\nminimum number of Phase\
    \ Measurement Units (PMUs) to make the distribution\nnetwork observable. The constraints\
    \ used were power flow and balance of power as\nwell as limits on the number of\
    \ transmission lines available. The internet of things also\nfinds usefulness\
    \ in terms of the use of Phase Measurement Units that provide voltage\nand current\
    \ measurement capabilities within smart grids to perform maintenance and\nmonitoring\
    \ operations. A summary of this discussion has been provided in Table 20\nand\
    \ the data setups used by the covered research work is presented in Table 21.\n\

    \ healthcare to patients.\nThis can be in the form of developing tools for better\
    \ diagnosis of diseases or the use\nof algorithms for better planning and healthcare\

    ambulance dispatch increases mortality [307], moreover, economically speaking,\
    \ a\none-minute delay in response time for cardiac patients found that the mortality\
    \ in-\ncreases by 1% and adds annual costs of USD 7 billion in healthcare expenditure\n\
    [308]. Keeping this in mind ambulance deployment and location determination have\n\
    been of considerable interest in the area of optimization for smart health. These\n\
    two problems are specific cases of the Vehicle Routing Problem [309] and Maximum\n\
    coverage problem [310] sometimes called the Ambulance Routing Problem [311] and\n\
    Ambulance Location Problem [312]. The authors in [313] work on the optimal allo-\n\
    62\ncation determination based on fixed sites and a finite number of ambulances\
    \ while\nminimizing lateness of ambulance arrival using the Ant Colony Optimization.\
    \ Later\non, in their work in [314], they do a comparison with using GAs and find\
    \ that GAs\nprovide better performance. Kochetov and Shamray [315] attempt localization\
    \ of\nambulance fleet at base stations with the aim to minimize the average waiting\
    \ time\nfor arrival of ambulances. An interesting approach to this problem is\
    \ presented in\nYan et al. [316] who work on this problem from a scheduling perspective\
    \ where they\ncontrol scheduling of emergency vehicles to reduce the total cost\
    \ in terms of money\nand time using a Genetic Algorithm. Another approach for\
    \ sequencing vehicles to\nensure emergency vehicles reach their destination in\
    \ time is presented by Lu et al.\n[317] who aim to prioritize emergency vehicle\
    \ thoroughfare on traffic intersections.\nThey do this by minimizing the entrance\
    \ time of the vehicle by manipulating vehicle\norder. Constraints used for these\
    \ problems include constraints on the speed of the\nambulances, the flow of vehicles\
    \ on the road, specific road connections present as well\nas time constraints.\
    \ The internet of things serves a pivotal role in enabling the allo-\ncation and\
    \ routing of emergency vehicles. The connectivity provided by IoT through\nvehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ communication as well as vehicle to infrastructure communication\nfacilitates\
    \ providing a real-time indication of the vehicle’s location as well as the con-\n\
    dition of traffic in a given area. This information can then be used to determine\
    \ an\noptimal route for emergency vehicles as well as for their optimal deployment\
    \ to serve\npeople in need. Information about optimization methods for smart health\

    \ energy management has been the prime application of optimization in smart\n\
    homes, a summary of the objectives, constraints and the use of IoT has been shown\n\
    in Figure 12.\nSmart Homes \nHome Energy Management \nAppliance\nScheduling \n\

    \ as temperature etc for comfort determination in homes, smart meters\nprovide\
    \ interconnectivity betwen homes\nFigure 12. Optimization applications in Smart\
    \ Homes.\n64\nHome energy management refers to the development of demand side\
    \ manage-\nment schemes that aim to reduce the electricity cost billed to a customer\
    \ or maintain\ncomfort for the user. One way this is performed is by appropriate\
    \ appliance schedul-\ning. The idea here is to schedule the usage of appliances\
    \ in such a way that the\nmost power-hungry devices are turned on during off peak\
    \ hours when electricity costs\nmight be lower. The combination of the Smart Grid\
    \ and Smart Homes facilitates the\ndevelopment of optimization schemes that not\
    \ only benefit the customer (in terms\nof reduced electricity costs and maintaining\
    \ comfort) but also be useful for the util-\nities in ensuring that load profiles\
    \ (though minimizing the peak to average ratio)\nare more consistent thereby allowing\
    \ better planning of the power generation mix\nused by them. The authors of [319]\
    \ perform appliance scheduling for the purpose of\nminimizing electricity cost\
    \ and the waiting time for appliance usage. Interestingly,\nthey incorporate comfort\
    \ maintenance by adding it as a constraint. A similar ap-\nproach has been followed\
    \ by Bui et al [320] and Makhadmeh et al. [321] who aim to\nminimize the cost\
    \ of electricity usage with a constraint for maintenance of comfort.\nMakhadmeh\
    \ et al. [321] also include the reduction of waiting time rate for appliances\n\
    by the user and the reduction of the peak to average ratio of the power consumed\
    \ as\nconstraints. The authors in [322, 323, 324, 325] perform appliance scheduling\
    \ while\nconsidering electricity cost and peak to average ratio which need to\
    \ be minimized.\nAll of the authors present a multi-objective function for this\
    \ purpose combining the\nobjectives of minimizing the cost and the peak to average\
    \ power ratio. Azimi et al.\n[326] combine the problem of reducing cost and power\
    \ together as a single objective\nby considering the minimization of the ratio\
    \ of operating cost and load factor in a\nbattery supported system. The works\
    \ of [327, 328, 329, 330, 331] also consider user\ncomfort as part of the objective.\
    \ In [327], Essiet and Wang form a multi-objective\nminimization problem of electricity\
    \ cost, peak to average ratio for power and discom-\nfort of users in a smart\
    \ home supported by a renewable energy system consisting of a\nbattery and PV\
    \ system. In Chanra et al. [332], the authors aim to reduce electricity\ncost\
    \ by appliance scheduling in such a manner so as to make as much use of onsite\n\
    energy units as possible so as to reduce usage of utility provided electricity.\
    \ The\nenergy units they consider are a diesel generator, renewables and battery.\
    \ Another\napproach that aims to reduce cost of consumed electricity is presented\
    \ by Faia et\nal. [333] who formulate it as a problem of minimizing the energy\
    \ bill and the cost\nassociated with curtailment of power in a system with a battery\
    \ and a photovoltaic\nsystem. Work in [334, 330, 335, 336] also perform appliance\
    \ scheduling to reduce\ncost of electricity. Appliance scheduling for smart homes\
    \ has also been performed by\nFatima et al. [323] and Abid et al. [322] considering\
    \ a microgrid for homes where\ninstead of optimizing data from single homes, the\
    \ authors used data from connected\nsmart meters to determine an optimized control\
    \ scheme for appliances across the grid.\nThe constraints used for optimization\
    \ in smart homes are on the comfort needing to\nbe maintained, constraints on\
    \ the powerflow, time of operation, the maximum power\nthat is present or used\
    \ and which appliances are switchable appliances. Appliance\nscheduling is based\
    \ on smart meters as well as individual control and monitoring of\nappliances\
    \ using IoT systems. IoT devices enable the microgrid which is used to\ngather\
    \ data as well as control the switching on and off of sources from the houses\n\
    65\nelectricty supply. The information gathered from these IoT units can be processed\n\
    to optimize energy consumption patterns to reduce cost to the customer as well\
    \ as\nincrease comfort. The use of the considered optimization schemes for smart\
    \ homes\nhas been presented in Table 24 with the data setups presented in Table\
    \ 25.\n4.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the biggest enablers of the Industry 4.0 concept\
    \ has been the use of AI tech-\nniques to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing\
    \ and production process. This\nhas led to the development of cyber physical systems\
    \ aiming to assist in activity recog-\nnition [339], machine health prediction\
    \ [340] and production management in terms of\nbottleneck prediction [341]. Apart\
    \ from conventional AI applications of anomaly de-\ntection, classification and\
    \ regression, computational optimization also finds numerous\napplications as\
    \ it fits well with the objective of efficient and streamlined manufac-\nturing.\
    \ The major applications for the use of computational optimization have been\n\
    in the area of routing and location for logistics and are variations of the vehicle\n\
    routing problem and are typically represented as Multidepot Vehicle Routing Prob-\n\
    lem (MVRP), Vehicle Routing Problem Pick-up and Delivery with Time Windows\n(VRPPDTW)\
    \ or Large-scale Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (LSDVRP). Figure\n13 summarizes\
    \ the objectives utilized, constraints and the role of IoT in optimization\nfor\
    \ Smart Industry.\nThe authors in [342] and [343] use the ABC and the GA respectively\
    \ to determine\nthe best location of service sites for logistic operations. Both\
    \ these approaches use\nmulti-objective formulations aiming to reduce cost of\
    \ operations, transportation as\nwell as the establishment of the centers. The\
    \ authors in Su et al. [344] use ACO,\nAlinaghia et al. [345] PSO and Utama et\
    \ al. [346] use ABC to address the problem\nof determining the best route for\
    \ logistics operations.\nThe routing and coverage\nproblem for logistics involves\
    \ determining the best route for either a single or multiple\nvehicles at a depot\
    \ which have to visit every customer. The works of [344, 345, 346]\nfocus on reducing\
    \ the cost incurred in the routing for vehicles in logistics as a single\nobjective\
    \ formulation. On the other hand, the authors of [347, 348] and [349] all\nwork\
    \ on the minimization of distance as their objective in determining the optimal\n\
    route for delivery vehicles trying to serve multiple locations.\nMounia and Bachir\n\
    [348] address routing in logistics as a multi-objective problem where they not\
    \ only\naim to minimize the distance traveled by the vehicles but also aim to\
    \ reduce CO2\nemissions and the number of vehicles used. A time based optimization\
    \ approach is\npresented by the authors of [350] and [351] with [350] also factoring\
    \ in reduction of fuel\nconsumption in their objective function formulation. Constraints\
    \ used for the routing\nand location determination problem are related to time,\
    \ capacity constraints for the\nvehicles, each customer being served only once,\
    \ constraints related to the route. The\ndetermination of the location and the\

    Smart Infrastructure\nWithin the infrastructure domain, the most common optimization\
    \ problem is the\narea of health monitoring of structures. Structural Health Monitoring\
    \ (SHM) is a\nnecessary application within the smart infrastructure domain as\
    \ it makes for safe\nusage of different structures of public use.\nThese structures\
    \ can be buildings as\nwell as transport structures such as bridges, tunnels.\
    \ Structural health monitoring\ntypically involves the use of sensors attached\
    \ to a structure at several points that can\ngauge some type of physical variable\
    \ (vibration, strain, acceleration, temperature,\ntilt etc) from the structure.\n\
    Data gathered from these connected sensors is then\nused to determine if any structural\
    \ damage has taken place or not.\nWithin the\ndomain of SHM, optimization algorithms\
    \ find application towards the Optimal Sensor\n69\nTable 27. Data setup for Smart\

    For the optimal sensor placement problem, the aim is to determine the best num-\n\
    ber and placement of sensors over a structure so as to reduce the number of sensors\n\
    used as well as improve the measurement process, both these aims result in increased\n\
    reliability of the SHM system as well as potentially lower the cost of the system\n\
    too. The authors in [353, 354, 355, 356, 357] work on the placement of sensors\
    \ for\nstructural health monitoring focusing on improving the effectiveness of\
    \ the deployed\nsystem. In this regard, [353] and [356] use the genetic algorithm\
    \ to solve a multi-\nobjective problem aiming to minimize the measurement error\
    \ and cost. Yang et al.\nin [355] formulate OSP as single objective minimization\
    \ where they aim to reduce\nthe ratio of sensor placement performance to the redundancy\
    \ of information resulting\nfrom each tested placement. Another approach that\
    \ works on the error is presented\nby [354] who use the Particle Swarm Optimization\

    \ It must be noted that the objective function is for-\nmulated as minimization\
    \ of negated accuracy and negated robustness measurement.\nOptimized structural\
    \ health monitoring for aircraft monitoring has been targeted\nin [358]. In their\
    \ setup consisting of vibration sensors, the authors optimize sensor\nplacement\
    \ by minimizing the cross correlation of the vibration waves in the sensing\n\
    network. The most common constraint for sensor placement is restrictions on the\n\
    places where sensors can be placed. This information has been provided in Table\
    \ 28\nand the data setups are presented in 29.\n4.8\nSmart Transportation\nOne\
    \ of the most popular optimization applications within smart cities are within\
    \ the\nsmart transport domain. These include parking system routing, traffic signal\
    \ control\nand scheduling. A summary of the applications, their objectives, constraints\
    \ and the\nrole of IoT is illustrated in Figure 15.\n71\nSmart TransportaƟon \n\

    emissions, traffic flow\nConstraints: Road\nconnections are fixed,\nnumber of\

    Smart transport systems consist of sensors along roads and traffic intersections\n\
    to measure relevant parameters while also providing communication services between\n\
    vehicles and infrastructure. This allows for measurement of the current state\
    \ of roads\nin terms of traffic congestion and usage thereby allowing for the\
    \ use of optimization\ntechniques to improve trip experiences for users and make\
    \ the transportation system\nmore efficient. The authors in [361, 362, 363, 364,\
    \ 365] work on the minimization\nof time (wait and travel) in traffic signal control.\
    \ The aim of such systems is to\nreduce traffic build up on signal intersections.\
    \ Of these, the work in [361, 362] and\n[363] use the artificial bee colony and\
    \ the genetic algorithm respectively for a single\nobjective function of minimizing\
    \ delay time. An interesting approach for this problem\nis presented by Li et\
    \ al. [365] who use a multi objective formulation targeting the\nminimization\
    \ of the average travel time both overall and individually for all vehiclesl.\n\
    Another multi-objective approach in traffic signal control is presented by Chen\
    \ and\nYuan [366] who form a mixed problem of minimizing vehicle emissions and\
    \ travel\ntime together. Korkmaz [367] work on the estimation of delays in traffic\
    \ signals using\na genetic algorithm, they use it to minimize the difference between\
    \ the estimated\n72\nand simulated values.\nTang et al.\n[364] carry out distributed\
    \ optimization in a\nfog and cloud hierarchy.\nFirst, fog nodes optimize phase\
    \ timings within a single\ncycle and if the number of vehicles exceeds a threshold,\
    \ the results are sent to the\ncentral controller to further optimize over different\
    \ cycles so that a traffic jam is\navoided or alleviated. Zhang et al. [368] attempt\
    \ traffic signal optimization using\nmulti objective optimization functions of\
    \ reducing time delay and increasing traffic\ncapacity.\nConstraints used for\
    \ traffic signal control are timing constraints on the\nphase durations, flow\
    \ rate of vehicles and on the travel time.\nTraffic routing is also another important\
    \ aspect in smart transportation. This\ntypically involves the determination of\
    \ the best route to the destination keeping in\nview various criteria such as\
    \ reduction of distance, time, cost etc.\nThe problem\nof traffic routing is addressed\
    \ by the works of [369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375,\n376, 377, 378, 379]. The\
    \ authors in [369] and [370] use the ant colony optimization\nand genetic algorithm\
    \ to minimize the travel distance in parking system routing.\nThey aim to minimize\
    \ distance traveled by a driver looking to find a free parking\nspot, using the\
    \ algorithm, an optimized route is determined for the parking spot.\nIn, [371,\
    \ 373] and [372] the ant colony optimization algorithm is used to determine\n\
    the best route in a generic traffic scenario where cars can communicate with road\n\
    side units in a VANET architecture. Routing for public transport is performed\
    \ by\n[380] and [375] in a connected vehicle scenario aiming to minimize travel\
    \ time. An\neconomic objective approach to traffic routing is taken by the authors\
    \ of [376, 378]\nand [379] who minimize the total cost of the trip.\nMao [379]\
    \ also include traffic\ncongestion and travel time as well in their computation.\
    \ Hassoune et al. [381] work\non a parking guidance using the ant colony optimization\
    \ algorithm to reduce traffic\ncongestion and minimize distance. Constraints for\
    \ traffic routing are related to the\nroad network allowing travel in specific\
    \ directions, signaling and travel time. Within\nsmart transportation, IoT nodes\
    \ are used to determine occupied parking spaces and\nthis data is used for routing\
    \ applications in parking. Traffic routing is based on vehicle\nto vehicle and\
    \ vehicle to infrastructure communication provided by VANETs within\nthe IoT framework.\
    \ These systems enable cars to exchange data with each other and\nalso with fixed\
    \ infrastructure on the roads. This discussion is also presented in Table\n30\
    \ and the data setups for the covered work are presented in Table 31.\n5\nConclusion\n\

    \ algo-\nrithms in the IoT enabled Smart City. It provides a mapping of the various\

    As discussed earlier, IoT finds usage in many different Smart City domains, both\
    \ for\nuse in classification/regression tasks as well as for optimization applications.\
    \ One\nof the most important applications of IoT within Smart Cities is within\
    \ the Smart\nHealth domain wherein IoT devices enable the monitoring of patients\
    \ for different\ndiseases such as heart disease etc. While there are a multitude\
    \ of IoT within Smart\nHealth, in order to develop algorithms on IoT sensor data,\
    \ the case of ambient assisted\nliving was chosen, in particular, this work considers\
    \ the case of fall detection.\n2\nIoT for Fall Detection\nThe United Nations estimates\
    \ that the number of old people (aged 60 and above) will\nbe 2.1 billion by 2050\
    \ and 3.1 billion by 2100 [382] leading to an increased old age\npopulation. With\
    \ people above 65 years suffering the greatest number of fatal falls\namong adults\
    \ aged 60 and over [383] healthcare costs related to fall related injuries\nrun\
    \ in to billions of dollars. These falls can result in injuries of moderate to\
    \ severe\nnature in the people experiencing the falls and may lead to decreased\
    \ mobility [384],\nespecially for the elderly [385]. Furthermore, following the\
    \ initial fall, the likelihood\nof experiencing additional falls increases [386]\
    \ and can lead to mental stress in the\nform of post-fall syndrome [387].\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things has spearheaded the development of cyber-physical systems\n\
    that facilitate the recognition of activities/events being performed by people\
    \ in their\ndaily life. One aspect of this application scenario is fall detection.\
    \ Falls can occur\ndue to a variety of reasons [388] and Fall Detection Systems\
    \ (FDS) are used for\npeople with different of health related ailments such as\
    \ in Parkinsons disease [389],\nepilepsy [390], arthritis, people suffering from\
    \ cardiovascular diseases and various\nneuro-degenerative diseases [391]. In any\
    \ scenario, it is pertinent that when a person\nundergoes a fall, they be provided\
    \ care as quickly as possible. Providing timely care\nafter a fall may improve\
    \ post-fall life quality of a patient. Fall detection Systems can\nplay a vital\
    \ role in contributing to the provision of timely care [389, 392] by alerting\n\
    healthcare professionals. As noted by [393] fall detection systems are necessary\
    \ for\nold people with cognitive impairments who may not be able to get up after\
    \ a fall for\nlong durations of time which may result in pressure sores and other\
    \ complications\nand due to vulnerability to injuries when experiencing a fall,\
    \ it may sometimes result\nin death [394].\n76\nA fall is an unintended and sudden\
    \ change of posture resulting in one resting on\nthe ground or some other lower\
    \ level elevation. The aim of a FDS is to monitor the\nmovement of a person and\
    \ determine when a fall has taken place with the aim to\nalert healthcare personnel\
    \ or other caregivers. Over the years different methodologies\nhave been suggested\
    \ to address this problem, however, before discussing the different\nmethods utilize\
    \ for fall detection purposes, it is important to mention what researchers\nenumerate\
    \ to be the traits of a ’good’ FDS [395].\n2.1\nChallenges/Requirements of a FDS\n\
    The following are the typical typical traits/requirements of a good fall detection\n\
    system.\n2.1.1\nNon-intrusiveness\nAn important requirement in fall detection\
    \ systems is to be non-intrusive. Any FDS\nshould not be an impediment in the\
    \ execution of daily activities of a person as it may\nrestrict movement or inconvenience\
    \ their lifestyle.\n2.1.2\nLow Latency\nAn FDS needs to be able to detect a fall\
    \ with low latency. Latency refers to the time\nduration between the occurring\
    \ of a fall and its detection. FDS need to detect falls\nas quickly as possible\
    \ to ensure that caregivers can be notified right away so that apt\ncare is provided\
    \ to the person. Low latency depends on not only the algorithm being\nused to\
    \ detect falls but also parameters like network speed and reliability. Sensor\
    \ data\ntransmission to the main system might also be included in this calculation\
    \ depending\non the FDS proposed.\n2.1.3\nLow power consumption\nPower consumption\
    \ is an important issue in FDS, especially for ones which are battery\npowered.\
    \ Many FDS are expected to be used by elderly people who might not be\nas regular\
    \ in charging the FDS, therefore FDS should consume as little power as\npossible.\n\
    2.1.4\nAllow mobility\nA FDS should not hamper mobility as it might be preventive\
    \ in adoption of a FDS\ntoo. FDS which require people to remain infront of a camera\
    \ at a certain viewpoint\netc can be difficult to deploy and use.\n2.1.5\nDifferentiate\
    \ between Falls and Activities\nA FDS should have low false positives and false\
    \ negatives. In other words it should\nbe able to confidently detect falls and\
    \ be able to differentiate them from activities of\n77\ndaily living such as walking,\
    \ sitting, jumping, running etc. Any false alarms will result\nin wastage of valuable\
    \ healthcare resources, on the contrary, any false negatives might\ncause the\
    \ patient/person having undergone the fall to not get appropriate medical\ncare\
    \ in time and lead to potential death or trauma.\n2.1.6\nNotify caregivers\nA\
    \ complete fall detection solution should have some mechanism of informing care-\n\
    givers whenever a fall is detected. Typically this is carried out in terms of\
    \ email,\nnotifications via some system or messages. Moreover, this process should\
    \ be quick so\nas to ensure the dispatch of any needed help as quickly as possible.\n\
    2.1.7\nTrack history\nA complete fall detection solution should be able to provide\
    \ the history about a\npatient in terms of falls that a person may have suffered\
    \ from as this will help monitor\nthe patients health and determine likelihood\
    \ to suffer from falls in the future. FDS\nmay sometimes also look at other biological\
    \ parameters during falls so as to help\ninvestigate the causes of falls using\
    \ the conditions prevalent at that time. Biological\nparameters that could be\
    \ measured include heart rate, perhaps an ECG or others as\ndeemed necessary based\
    \ on a patients history.\n2.2\nTypes of Fall Detection Systems\nFall detection\
    \ systems can be categorized in to three types based on the sensing\nmechanisms\
    \ used and their placement. These are Ambient Sensor based systems,\nVisual based\
    \ systems and Wearable Sensor based systems.\n2.2.1\nAmbient Sensor based systems\n\
    Ambient sensor based systems are also sometimes referred to as environmental sensor\n\
    based systems since these types of FDS rely on the use of a number of wirelessly\n\
    connected ambient sensors placed in a given area for the detection of falls. These\n\
    FDS make use of various sensors including Passive InfraRed (PIR) Sensors [396],\n\
    Acoustic sensors such as microphones, thermal sensors as well as sensors measuring\n\
    Wi-Fi signal strength etc. For e.g., the authors in [397] develop a fall detection\
    \ system\nbased on two PIR sensors and a vibration sensor to detect vibrations\
    \ on the floor\nwhen a person falls down. Using the PIR sensor to detect a persons\
    \ motion. feature\nextraction is performed on vibration measurements and an SVM\
    \ classifier is used to\ndetermine whether a fall has taken place or not. Another\
    \ approach presented in [398]\nutilize sounds in a home to determine falls in\
    \ the elderly. They do this by extracting\nfeatures in sound signals and like\
    \ [397] use a Support Vector Machine classifier to\ndetermine falls. The authors\
    \ in [399] make use of Wi-Fi channel state information\nfor fall detection. They\
    \ achieve this by feature extraction in the frequency domain\nfollowed by an SVM\
    \ classifier.\n78\nAmbient fall detection systems offer the advantage of not requiring\
    \ people to wear\nanything on their bodies and are thus nonrestrictive in that\
    \ sense. However, such\nsystems are prone to suffer high false positives due to\
    \ the large number of external\nfactors such as other heat emitting devices, multiple\
    \ people moving around at the\nsame time etc. Another issue that comes with ambient\
    \ fall detection systems is that\ndeployment could be cumbersome to cover a large\
    \ space, therefore they are typically\ndeployable in small places such as a home\
    \ or a small building but are very difficult\nto use outdoors due to the nature\
    \ of the setting as well as the possible sources of\nexternal interference.\n\
    2.2.2\nVision based systems\nVision based systems rely on the processing of video\
    \ frames or other visual infor-\nmation such as depth and thermal images or their\
    \ combination [400] to detect falls.\nTypically, the recorded data is sent to\
    \ a server or central computer which provides\nprocessing capabilities. Moreover,\
    \ recently, with the use of deep learning algorithms,\nsuch systems have found\
    \ to provide improved performance. For e.g. [401] use Convo-\nlution Neural Networks\
    \ on velocity information in video frames. Another approach\nthat uses CNNs is\
    \ given in [402] who model human motion from video frames using\nCNNs and then\
    \ use a logistic regression classifier to determine falls. Other approaches\n\
    with CNNs include the works in [403] and [404], both of which achieve very high\
    \ de-\ntection accuracy. Another DL network which has been useful in fall detection\
    \ systems\nbased on cameras is Long Short Term Machine, a recent example of that\
    \ is the use of\na CNN + LSTM combination on 360 degree video recordings of an\
    \ indoor facility to\ndetermine falls. The LSTM allows for capturing the changing\
    \ characteristics between\nvideo frames to provide fall recognition.\nEventhough\
    \ vision based FDS have been able to provide improved fall detection\nperformance\
    \ recently, like ambient sensor based systems, these systems suffer from\nsome\
    \ drawbacks. They are affected negatively in terms of performance and deploya-\n\
    bility from external factors such as occlusion, restricted mobility of the people\
    \ being\nmonitored, typically usable in environments over a small area, have high\
    \ computa-\ntional costs and are expensive. One other issue with vision based\
    \ systems is privacy,\nvision systems which use normal cameras pose risk of violation\
    \ to the privacy of peo-\nple being captured on video. The question of privacy\
    \ can be circumvented by the\nuse of depth cameras for e.g. a kinect [405, 406]\
    \ or using heatmaps using infrared\ncameras/sensors [407].\n2.2.3\nWearable Sensor\
    \ based systems\nWearable fall detection systems involve the use of a device attached\
    \ to the subject.\nThe wearable device monitors user activity by means of sensors\
    \ and can determine\nwhen a fall has occurred. Information about the fall is then\
    \ conveyed to a doctor or\nother medical professionals. Various types of sensors\
    \ can be used in these systems\nincluding inertial measurement sensors such as\
    \ accelerometers, gyroscopes, magne-\ntometers [408] or health sensors such as\
    \ ECGs, oxygen level and pulse rate sensors\n79\nas well. The devices that contain\
    \ these sensors can be worn on the hand, wrist, arm,\nchest, waist, legs, thigh\
    \ or even put inside shoes and are usually battery powered.\nWearable fall detection\
    \ systems have the advantage that they do not restrict move-\nment of the person\
    \ using them and consume less power than the other two approaches,\nhowever, a\
    \ disadvantage to this is the need to ’carry’ the device all the time. Another\n\
    disadvantage is the need to charge the device regularly which might be difficult\
    \ to do\nfor older people, a way this has been addressed in some approaches is\
    \ to make use of\nenergy harvesting [409].\n2.3\nTypes of Wearable FDS\nThere\
    \ are two types of wearable systems in use for fall detection purposes.\n2.3.1\n\
    Threshold based systems\nThe first of type of wearable FDS are threshold-based\
    \ fall detection systems where\nauthors have used various thresholding techniques\
    \ on sensor values measuring motion,\nparticularly the accelerometer. The major\
    \ advantage of threshold based fall detection\nsystems is their relative low computational\
    \ cost and use of sensor fusion techniques\nto improve fall detection accuracy\
    \ , however, the big disadvantage of such systems is\nthat threshold based systems\
    \ do not generalize well across subjects since people may\nhave different gaits,\
    \ this is especially true for people of different ages. As a result,\nthreshold\
    \ based FDS may suffer from having many false positives as well as false\nnegatives\
    \ since the FDS needs to differentiate between activities of daily living and\n\
    falls, which many times may appear to be fairly similar to each other in terms\
    \ of\nsensor readings.\n2.3.2\nMachine/Deep Learning based systems\nSince threshold-based\
    \ systems are rigid in terms of their usage, ML/DL methods\nprovide a flexible\
    \ method for fall detection. ML/DL algorithms can learn complex\npatterns from\
    \ sensor data which indicate to a fall while monitoring a persons activities\n\
    and therefore are useful in fall detection systems. As opposed to threshold based\n\
    systems, their generalizing capability allows them to be used across subjects.\n\
    A\ntypical ML framework for fall detection will involve data acquisition, prepossessing,\n\
    feature extraction and then usage of a suitable ML algorithm to make the inference\n\
    for a fall or no fall. A deep learning framework based FDS might have a similar\n\
    methodology, but depending on the DL algorithm used, feature extraction might\
    \ be\nomitted.\n2.4\nSensors used in Wearable FDS\nAs mentioned before, the sensors\
    \ used in wearable FDS are accelerometers, gyroscope,\nmagnetometer, ECG, Pulse\
    \ Rate and oxygen saturation levels. In this section, we will\ndiscuss briefly\
    \ the role of these sensors in wearable FDS and parameters of interest\nwhen using\
    \ them in FDS.\n80\n2.4.1\nAccelerometers\nAccelerometers, together with gyroscopes\
    \ are the most widely used sensors in wear-\nable FDS. One reason for this is\
    \ that both these sensors are typically present in\nsmartphones, which have been\
    \ used to either collect data for and/or deploy fall de-\ntection systems. An\
    \ accelerometer provides a measure of absolute acceleration and\nare used to detect\
    \ vibrations, force in a variety of applications involving monitoring\nof machines,\
    \ planes, civil architectures and more. In an FDS, an accelerometer is\nable to\
    \ capture the movement patterns of individuals which can be used to determine\n\
    falls.\n2.4.2\nGryroscope\nGyroscopes are used to measure tilt/orientation.\n\
    Gyroscopes find applications in\nvarious areas where orientation measurement is\
    \ required, for e.g. in airplanes and\nsubmarines where they are used in stabilization\
    \ systems, smartphones and game re-\nmotes for interactive gameplay, among other\
    \ things. Since orientation is an important\ncharacteristic of a fall, gyroscopes\
    \ are one of the most widely used sensors in FDS\nalong with acceleratorometers.\n\
    2.4.3\nMagnetometer\nA magnetometer is a device that measures the direction and\
    \ strength of magnetism\nrelative to the earths magnetic north. In addition to\
    \ other applications, magnetome-\nters are used in aircrafts for direction referencing.\
    \ These sensors are not very popular\nin FDS but have been proposed in some approaches\
    \ [410, 411] to be used for fall\ndetection in addition to accelerometers and/or\
    \ gyroscopes.\n2.4.4\nVarious Medical Sensors\nWearable fall detection systems\
    \ may also incorporate different types of medical sen-\nsors such as ElectroCardioGraphs,\
    \ ElectroMyoGraphs, Pulse Rate or Oxygen Level\nmeasurement in the FDS solution.\
    \ Even though there have been some approaches\nwhich have used medical sensors\
    \ exclusively for fall detection (such as EMG[412]),\nhowever, like magnetometers,\
    \ these sensors are usually used along with accelerome-\nters and/or gyroscopes.\
    \ Adding these sensors to fall detection systems has the added\nadvantage of assessing\
    \ falls from a health standpoint too as this information can be\nused to determine\
    \ risk of falls [413].\n2.5\nDesign considerations for Wearable FDS\nWearable\
    \ fall detection systems utilize sensor measurements to ascertain the occur-\n\
    rence of a fall. Since wearable FDS units are always attached to a persons body,\
    \ they\ncontinuously provide measurements of a persons movements and activities.\
    \ In order\nto use these measurements in a FDS, there are some design considerations\
    \ involved.\nWe discuss them in this section.\n81\n2.5.1\nSampling frequency\n\
    The sampling frequency dictates the number of sensor measurements recorded per\n\
    second. The sampling frequency used in an FDS should be high enough to capture\n\
    fall motion but not too high so as to increase data processing, storage requirements\n\
    as well as allow for energy efficient operation. In fact, depending on the position\n\
    of the sensors, significant reductions can be made in the sampling frequency used\n\
    for sensors with little or no change in performance as demonstrated by [414].\
    \ Such\nreductions could result in low power consumption by the wearable module\
    \ thereby\nenabling longevity of operation.\n2.5.2\nWindowing\nSince wearable\
    \ fall detection systems provide a continuous stream of sensor data, the\ndata\
    \ needs to be windowed for fall detection to be performed. Windowing refers to\
    \ the\nextraction of a subset of the sensor data stream in a sliding manner or\
    \ otherwise and\nis typically specified in terms of time duration for its size.\
    \ It is typical for wearable\nFDS designers to test different window sizes for\
    \ their fall detection algorithms. The\nsize of the window used would dictate\
    \ memory and computational requirements of\nthe unit used for deploying the FDS\
    \ system. Another important factor in windowing\nsensor signals is whether overlapping\
    \ is used during the windowing process or not.\nThis might be important to allow\
    \ for smooth transitions between different windows.\n2.5.3\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is the process of determining quantities from data which charac-\n\
    terizes it for a desired task appropriately. Feature extraction not only aims\
    \ to capture\nimportant aspects of the data being worked on but also to present\
    \ its content in a\nreduced size, thereby, making use of the data easier. Feature\
    \ extraction is a typ-\nical step of the a signal processing and machine learning\
    \ workflow and follows the\nwindowing step. There are different types of features\
    \ which have been computed\nfor fall detection applications, common feature computations\
    \ include the determina-\ntion of time domain features, frequency domain features,\
    \ statistical features etc. or\nsome combination from sensor data in FDS. Feature\
    \ extraction is followed by either a\nthresholding algorithm to sensor values\
    \ or a machine/deep learning model. For deep\nlearning, there have been some end\
    \ to end deep learning approaches which skip the\nstep of manual feature extraction.\
    \ In such approaches, deep learning networks such\nas CNN may be used to extract\
    \ features followed by other networks such as LSTM\nto determine falls, an example\
    \ is proposed in [415].\n2.6\nLiterature Review\nAs discussed previously, wearable\
    \ fall detection systems present several advantages\nwhen used for fall detection\
    \ purposes such as non-intrusiveness, ease of mobility, small\nsize of deployment,\
    \ low cost and that many implementations are typically standalone\nsystems. This\
    \ added with the fact that sensors and other components which are used\n82\nin\
    \ such systems have been becoming cheaper and cheaper to produce has resulted\
    \ in\na lot of interest in the development of wearable FDS by researchers and\
    \ technologists\nalike. Therefore, wearable FDS methodologies have gained considerable\
    \ interest in\nfall detection research. We discuss some of the popular methodologies\
    \ proposed in\nthis regard.\nThe authors in Mrozek et al. [416] present a complete\
    \ design of a wearable fall\ndetection system for an Internet of Things scenario.\
    \ They conduct two experiments\nwith their system, in one experiment, data is\
    \ collected from a gyroscope and an\naccelerometer and sent to the cloud for fall\
    \ detection (as a web service) while in\nthe second experiment, fall detection\
    \ is performed on the edge node (smart phone).\nThrough their experiments they\
    \ conclude that performing fall detection on the edge\nnode results in less network\
    \ traffic and storage requirements for the cloud. Algo-\nrithmically speaking,\
    \ they extract 3 second overlapping windows from measurements\nof both sensors,\
    \ perform feature extraction and pass it on to a boosted decision tree\nclassifier\
    \ for determining whether a fall has taken place or not. Moreover, the boosted\n\
    decision tree classifier was trained using the SisFall [417] dataset. Another\
    \ IoT based\nsystem is proposed by Marquez et al. [418] who develop a fall detection\
    \ system for\nIoT on the edge. They first gather data from an accelerometer and\
    \ a gyroscope placed\non the waist of multiple subjects and train a support vector\
    \ machine classifier on a\ncombination of raw sensor values and its standard deviation.\
    \ They are able to deploy\ntheir system successfully and achieve satisfactory\
    \ results. Moreover, feature selection\nis also performed before the classification\
    \ stage. A fog based fall detection model has\nbeen proposed by Sarabia-J’acome\
    \ et al. [419] who utilize a Long Short Term Memory\nRecurrent Neural Network\
    \ in their method. Edge nodes collect Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) measurements\
    \ and relay them to a fog node which processes the data to\ndetermine if a fall\
    \ has taken place or not. One motivation for them to develop RNN\nmodels over\
    \ a Convolutional Neural Network one is the requirement of less param-\neters\
    \ and thus less computational requirements. Their final model consists of a 1D\n\
    CNN layer followed by two LSTM layers and a fully connected layer for classification\n\
    and is trained using raw data (window of 15s) from the SisFall dataset.\nZurbuchen\
    \ et al. in [420] provide a comparison of various machine learning al-\ngorithms\
    \ for fall detection while using data from the SisFall dataset. They perform\n\
    experiments using Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting\
    \ tree,\nK-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines. Segments of 10 seconds\
    \ are ex-\ntracted from the trials in the SisFall dataset and various time and\
    \ frequency domain\nfeatures are computed for those segments. These are then passed\
    \ on to the classifiers.\nThrough their experiments, they find that Random Forest\
    \ and Gradient Boosting\ntrees perform the best among the considered methods.\
    \ Another comparison of var-\nious ML algorithms is provided by Chelli and P¨atzold\
    \ in [421] who compare the\nperformance of a number of machine learning algorithms\
    \ on two datasets, the Cogent\nLabs dataset [422] and the one provided in [423].\
    \ The algorithms they consider are\nan artificial neural network, K-NN, an ensemble\
    \ bagged tree (EBT) and Quadratic\nSupport Vector Machine (QSVM). They compute\
    \ several time and frequency domain\nfeatures from accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ signals and pass them on to the classi-\nfiers. Their best performing classifiers\
    \ were QSVM and EBT. Kerdjidj et al. in [424]\n83\nuse compressive sensing to\
    \ explore the use of different modalities for fall detection\npurposes. The performance\
    \ of accelerometer only and an accelerometer - gyroscope\nsensor combination in\
    \ a fall detection scenario is compared. A Shimmer device [425]\nis used to capture\
    \ data from 17 volunteers asked to perform activities of daily living\nas well\
    \ as fall like movements. They first extract segments of length 2.56 seconds\n\
    from their recordings before performing feature extraction and passing it on to\
    \ four\ndifferent machine learning classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector\
    \ Machines,\nDecision Trees and an Ensemble Classifier (EC). They conduct two\
    \ such experiments,\none with compressive sensing and the other without. Their\
    \ results indicate that the\nEC classifier and SVM perform the best with the help\
    \ of compressive sensing included\nin the pipeline. A ’transfer learning’ approach\
    \ towards fall detection is provided by\nFanez et al. in [426] and they test it\
    \ on the UMAFall [427] dataset and the FallOVI\ndataset (created by them). Using\
    \ a finite state machine which captures windows\nof accelerometer measurements\
    \ based on peak values, the authors convert the win-\ndowed segments into string\
    \ representations using symbolic aggregate approximation\n(SAX) [428]. During\
    \ training each user performs normal ADLs and falls for a short\nperiod of time.\
    \ Peak values are determined from sensor measurements and used to\ncreate bag\
    \ of words using SAX. After this, normal operation of the system starts\nand information\
    \ retrieval (term frequency - inverse term frequency) values are used\nto determine\
    \ what label to give to new SAX words derived from sensor values. If a\ndetermined\
    \ word is not similar (using Manhattan distance) to any word in the bag of\nwords\
    \ (K-NN clustering is used to group similar words), a fall event is suggested\
    \ to\nhave occurred. ’Transfer learning’ involves the use of clusters formed by\
    \ other users\n(performing activities only) as the starting point of the training.\
    \ Their experiment\ncompared an SVM classifier with their information retrieval\
    \ based scheme. They are\nable to detect falls all the time with the UMAfall dataset\
    \ but have a high number\nof false positives for the FallOVI dataset. An noticeable\
    \ aspect of this approach is\nthe use of clustering and ’feature extraction’ as\
    \ strings. In Giuffrida et al. [429]\nthe authors use data from the SisFall dataset\
    \ and an SVM classifier to differentiate\nbetween falls and no-fall samples. They\
    \ extract slices (of 1 second) from the SisFall\ntrials and label each slice as\
    \ containing a fall or not. A number of features were then\ncomputed for each\
    \ slice before feature selection was performed and an SVM classifier\nwas trained\
    \ to determine the output class.\nDeep Learning methods have also been widely\
    \ used for fall detection purposes.\nCasilari et al. in [430] explore the contribution\
    \ of the gyroscope sensor for use in\ncombined accelerometer-gyroscope based fall\
    \ detection systems.\nTo do this, they\nmake use of measurements from the SisFall\
    \ dataset, extract observation windows of\n5 seconds around peaks of accelerometer\
    \ sensor signal values over a trace and pass\nthem on to a Convolutional Neural\
    \ Network with four convolutional layers, three\nmax pooling layers followed by\
    \ one fully connected layer for classification. Training is\nperformed in two\
    \ different sets of experiments, one including gyroscope data and the\nother without\
    \ it. They note that the results they get while using only accelerometer\nsignal\
    \ measurements are better than that when using data from both sensors. A\nCNN\
    \ is used for fall detection purposes by Santos et al. in [431] from accelerometer\n\
    measurements. Their network consists of six convolutional layers, two max pooling\n\
    84\nlayers in between followed by a fully connected layer for classification.\n\
    They use\ndata from the URFD dataset [432] and the Smart Watch and Notch datset\
    \ [433] in\ntheir experiments. They note that their model performs best when they\
    \ use data\naugmentation for both the datasets. However, this was achieved by\
    \ two different\nvariants of the same model. This highlights the point of a single\
    \ model not necessarily\nperforming well on all datasets. Another interesting\
    \ aspect of their work is the use of\nthe Mathews Correlation Coefficient to evaluate\
    \ performance of their algorithms. A\nmodified AlexNet [434] has been used in\
    \ [435] by Alarifi et. al. They collect tri-axial\ndata from inertial measurement\
    \ sensors consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer at six different\
    \ positions on a subjects body. A total of 16 activities of\ndaily living and\
    \ 20 falls were recorded by them. Feature extraction is then performed\nin terms\
    \ of various statistical measurements as well as frequency analysis. This is\n\
    followed by principal component analysis and then passed on to the classification\n\
    stage consisting of an optimized AlexNet ConvNet. Waheed et. al. in [436] develop\n\
    a FDS using a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network. They\n\
    consider the binary case of fall and no fall and perform experiments using the\
    \ SisFall\ndataset as well as the UP-Fall dataset [437]. Their network consists\
    \ of eight layers\nin total. Two Bi-LSTM layers and two fully connected layers\
    \ with dropouts being\nused for regularization. Training is performed with creating\
    \ missing values in the\ndata to introduce noise tolerancy.\nCasiliri et al.\n\
    in [438] provide a performance\ncomparison for a CNN network on multiple public\
    \ fall detection datasets. The aim\nof their work is to test the cross-application\
    \ of a similar CNN network trained on\ndifferent datasets. They set their experiments\
    \ up by training a four layer CNN on\neach dataset separately for fall detection\
    \ on 14 datasets (using similar positions of\nsensor placement) on windows of\
    \ 5 seconds for accelerometer signals. Their results\nindicate a very good performance\
    \ of the network for the SisFall dataset, however, it\ndoesn’t perform very well\
    \ for most of the other datasets, in some cases, performing\nless than random\
    \ chance, which is quite surprising. Their experiments do however,\nhighlight\
    \ an issue with the well accepted notion that an algorithm developed on some\n\
    benchmark dataset will necessarily work similarly well with other datasets.\n\
    The\nauthors suggest that the erratic performance of their method could be due\
    \ to the\ndifference in the nature of the data in terms of sampling frequency\
    \ used, range of\nthe sensor and the varying type of movements. Another cross-dataset\
    \ approach for\nfall detection has been proposed in [439] where the authors use\
    \ a combination of a\nCNN and Long Short Term Memory network to extract features\
    \ followed by a K-\nNearest Neighbor classifer to detect falls as well as identify\
    \ the subjects within four\nfall datasets, DFNAPAS [440], SisFall, UniMiB-SHAR\
    \ [441] and ASLH [442]. The\nnetwork is trained using the DFNAPAS dataset, before\
    \ training the network however,\ndata augmentation is carried out for the fall\
    \ class. Their best results are achieved\nfor a value of K = 3 and they achieve\
    \ good results for all experiments. They observe\nthat using a deep learning architecture\
    \ for feature extraction purposes along with a\nmachine learning classifier performs\
    \ better than a using a fully connected layer at the\nclassification stage.\n\
    Post fall intelligence is an important research area in the field of fall detection\n\
    as it can be useful in determining various post fall injuries [443] and serve\
    \ as an\n85\nintelligence parameter [444] for doctors. Jung et al. in [445] also\
    \ target detection\nof pre-impact falls for wearable airbag deployment. Their\
    \ method involves the ap-\nplication of a threshold on determined features from\
    \ accelerometer and gyroscope\nmeasurement measurements. The thresholds are then\
    \ applied to a dataset collected\nby them and also on the SisFall dataset. The\
    \ threshold is determined by performing\na grid search on the extracted features\
    \ from their dataset to maximize specificity and\nsensitivity. They do note that\
    \ some activties like sitting down quickly on a chair or a\nmattress triggered\
    \ false positives. Moreover, when applied to SisFall, their methods\nperformance\
    \ is not as high as achieved by methods based on ML/DL. Koo et. al.\n[446] present\
    \ experiments for post fall detection from a combination of self collected\ndata\
    \ and the SisFall dataset. They conduct tests using sliding windows as well as\
    \ dis-\ncrete windows from these signals and compute statistical features from\
    \ them. After\nfeature extraction, two different classifiers, the artificial neural\
    \ network and support\nvector machine are tested with the computed features as\
    \ well as raw sensor values.\nThey find that both ANN and SVM are suitable for\
    \ use in post fall detection sce-\nnarios. Another approach looking at the different\
    \ phases of a fall has been presented\nin [447] where Hsieh et. al. use accelerometer\
    \ sensor data to differentiate between\nfive phases of a fall, pre-fall, free-fall,\
    \ impact, resting and recovery and the initial\nand end static phases. To do this,\
    \ they compute various time domain and statistical\nfeatures and test five classifiers,\
    \ SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision\nTrees and Adaptive Boosting\
    \ (AdaBoost). For their experimental setup, the best\nresults were achieved using\
    \ the K-NN classifier. In Musci et al. [448], the authors\npropose a RNN based\
    \ method to differentiate between falls, pre-impact falls (state\nwhere a person\
    \ is in a dangerous state of transition which may result in a falls) and\nnormal\
    \ activities. Their motivation for including preimpact falls is to enable timely\n\
    deployment of a fall protection system. First, they label data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset\nto form three classes. They then extract windows of duration 1.28 seconds\
    \ with an\noverlap of 50% from the sensor signals and pass them on to their network\
    \ which\nconsists of two fully connected layers and two-layer LSTM layers. Moreover,\
    \ due to\nan imbalanced training set, they define a new balancing loss function.\
    \ Their method\nresults in fall detection good results for the three classes considered.\
    \ A CNN-LSTM\napproach has been proposed in [449] by Yu et al. for detection of\
    \ pre-impact fall and\nfalls in the SisFall dataset. They provide a comparison\
    \ of standalone CNN, LSTM\nand a combined CNN-LSTM architecture for this task\
    \ and also implement them on\na Jetson Nano. They define a pre-impact fall as\
    \ the time interval where a subject\ntransitions from a controlled state to a\
    \ state which may lead to a fall. First, they\nlabel data in the SisFall dataset\
    \ as described in [448] to form a three class problem.\nThey achieved their best\
    \ results for their CNN+LSTM model having four CNN layers\nfollowed by two LSTM\
    \ layers and a fully connected layer for classification. Their ap-\nproach highlights\
    \ the combined capability of CNN-LSTM for feature extraction. An\naspect of fall\
    \ intelligence is direction, in [450] Lee et al. use the velocity vector from\n\
    the acceleration sensor in a smartphone for fall detection with direction and\
    \ then\nlater on in [451], they use the standard deviation of the accemerometer\
    \ and gyro-\nscope sensor measurements from a smart phone to determine falls and\
    \ fall direction.\nThey perform a small experiment and are able to differentiate\
    \ between left, right,\n86\nfront and backward falls. More work on fall detection\
    \ with direction was performed\nby the authors in [452] who use an accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope combination along\nwith a kalman filter for tilt estimation. Fall\
    \ detection is then performed using an\nSVM classifier. Falls with direction detection\
    \ has been attempted in [453, 454] by\nthe same authors. They collect accelerometer\
    \ data from various subjects and extract\nthree features from the recordings for\
    \ each axis, the mean, standard deviation and\nprincipal components (using Principal\
    \ Component Analysis). These are then passed\non to a SVM classifier to differentiate\
    \ between a forward, backward, left and right\nfall and ADLs.\nWhile direction\
    \ aware fall detection is an important determination in terms of post\nfall intelligence,\
    \ fall detection with severity is necessary since it could help provide\nindications\
    \ to falls with immediate recovery or otherwise, as falls without immediate\n\
    recovery would be more detrimental to health than a fall with immediate recovery\
    \ as\nhas been suggested in [455]. In [456] the authors attempt to classify between\
    \ different\nfalls (direction: forward, backward, right, left and intensity: hard,\
    \ soft [fall on knees\nfirst, then on floor]) and five different ADLs using accelerometer\
    \ data. They collected\ndata for their experiments using a triaxial accelerometer\
    \ mounted on the chest. Fea-\nture extraction consists of first concatenating\
    \ acceleration values in each axis and\nthen using a Debauchies-2 level-3 wavelet\
    \ which are then sent to the classification\nstage. In the classification stage\
    \ five different classifiers, an ANN, a Radial Basis\nFunction (RBF) Network,\
    \ Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) and\nLinear Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (LDA) are used through a voting machine to determine\nfalls. A voting machine\
    \ (VM) involves multiple classifiers giving a vote towards any of\nthe multiple\
    \ classes and the sum of the vote is compared against a vote threshold to\ndetermine\
    \ the event that has taken place. In their work, the authors train individual\n\
    VMs for all the activity and fall types in their dataset by structuring them all\
    \ in par-\nallel and adding a comparator function at the end of the pipeline.\
    \ Moreover, a K-NN\nmulticlass classifier also feeds in to the comparator and\
    \ is trained while training of\nthe other classifier, it is provided the true\
    \ value of the activity being input to the\nclassification stage. The authors\
    \ show that their dataset works very well. A valuable\ninsight about their work\
    \ is the ensembling mechanism the authors have employed to\ndetermine fall directions.\
    \ In [457], Hussain et al. propose a fall detection system that\ncan first determine\
    \ falls and then the type of fall using data from the SisFall dataset.\nThey accomplish\
    \ this in a hierarchical setup where their system first considers fall\ndetection\
    \ as a binary problem, whether a fall has taken place or not, and if a fall\n\
    has been detected, it classifies between the various falls in the dataset. Their\
    \ system\nis designed to work with 10 second non-overlapping windows of accelerometer\
    \ and\ngyroscope signals. Data from each record is first low pass filtered before\
    \ two different\ntypes of feature sets, consisting of various time domain and\
    \ statistical features, are\ncomputed on the data. This is then followed by the\
    \ machine learning stage where\nthree different classifiers are tested, K-NN,\
    \ SVM and RFC. In the fall detection stage,\nstatistical features are computed\
    \ from ADL and fall signals and sent to the three clas-\nsifiers for the preliminary\
    \ binary classification. After a fall has been determined to\nhave happened, numerous\
    \ other statistical and time domain features are then com-\nputed on the data\
    \ before being sent to the next stage to determine the type of fall\n87\nactivity\
    \ taking place. In their experiments, the authors find that K-NN is most effec-\n\
    tive in differentiating between falls and ADLs where as RFC performs the best\
    \ when\nthe different fall activities need to be determined. This work highlights\
    \ the usefulness\nof a hierarchical approach towards non-binary fall detection.\
    \ One proposed method\nto perform combined activity recognition and fall detection\
    \ has been presented in\n[458]. In this, Li et. al. use multi-modal sensor fusion\
    \ and a Bi-LSTM classification\nnetwork to differentiate between five activities\
    \ of daily living and a fall. The sensors\nthey use are an inertial sensor placed\
    \ on the wrist, waist and ankle as well as a radar\nsensor. After pre-processing\
    \ both the inertial measurement and radar signals, various\nstatistical and moment\
    \ computations were performed to be used as features. These\nwere passed on to\
    \ the multilayer Bi-LSTM network after feature selection to deter-\nmine the output\
    \ class. One thing to note is that both both [458] and [421] consider\nfall as\
    \ a single category rather than considering falls as a detailed problem (direction\n\
    and/or severity) in itself. More recent work by We et al. [459] also considers\
    \ ac-\ntivity recognition and fall detection together. They use inertial measurement\
    \ sensor\ndata from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset [460] and the SmartFall\
    \ dataset [433].\nThe MobiAct dataset contains data from four falls and nine activities\
    \ of daily living\nwhereas the SmartFall dataset has non-fall and fall recordings.\
    \ In their experimenta-\ntion, they compare the performance of different machine\
    \ learning models and several\ndeep learning models, including a CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM\
    \ combination and Gated\nRecurrent Units. The machine learning models are trained\
    \ by computing time and\nfrequency domain features whereas the deep learning models\
    \ are trained using raw\nsensor data. They find that the GRU designed by them\
    \ consisting of two GRU units\nfollowed by a softmax classification layer is the\
    \ best performing model. Another deep\nlearning approach utilizing sequential\
    \ modeling for a fall detection system that also\nconsiders ADLs has been presented\
    \ by Seng¨ul et al. [461]. They collect their own\ndata for two types of falls\
    \ and four activities of daily living. After data augmentation\non the minority\
    \ classes, they use a Bi-LSTM for classification. Le et al. [462] propose\na non-binary\
    \ fall detection scheme utilizing a collection of time, frequency frequency\n\
    domain features in addition to the three Hjorth parameters of activity, mobility\
    \ and\ncomplexity. They use data from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset and the\
    \ UP-Fall\ndataset. They are able to achieve good results on both datasets using\
    \ all three feature\ntypes with a random forest classifier.\nThe use of attention\
    \ based models has also been finding increasing usage in fall\ndetection research.\
    \ Yhdego [463] use an attention model to perform binary fall de-\ntection. The\
    \ fall dataset is collected by them and after windowing, the authors use\ntime2vec\
    \ positional encoding on the data. Their network consists of three attention\n\
    blocks each consisting of multiheaded self attention followed by normalization\
    \ and a\nfully connected network. After the attention blocks follow two fully\
    \ connected layers.\nThey find that their network incorporating attention performs\
    \ well in differentiating\nbetween fall and non-fall samples. Another interesting\
    \ approach using attention is\npresented by Liu et al. [464]. Inorder to apply\
    \ attention on both temporal (step wise)\nand spatial (channel wise) aspects of\
    \ the signals, a gated scheme is suggested. A fully\nconnected layer is used to\
    \ determine the embeddings before positional information is\nadded to the data.\
    \ Positional encoding is only used for stepwise attention as channel\n88\nwise\
    \ positions are not useful. Self attention is performed in the step-wise part\
    \ of the\nnetwork and is carried out for the individual channels in a pairwise\
    \ fashion across all\ntime steps while the channel wise attention is performed\
    \ across the different channels\nacross all time-steps. The outputs of these two\
    \ units are combined through a fully\nconnected network which weighs them before\
    \ concatenation and classification.\n2.7\nFall detection Datasets\nThere are several\
    \ datasets published for use in algorithm development for fall detec-\ntion as\
    \ has been noted in [438]. Of these, for this case study, we choose two datasets,\n\
    these are the SisFall and the K-Fall dataset. The SisFall [417] dataset is chosen\
    \ as\nit contains recordings of elderly people which are most at risk from injury\
    \ due to\nfalls and therefore should provide a good representation of activities\
    \ of the elderly. It\nshould be noted that its one of the most used dataset for\
    \ fall detection purposes [438].\nThe other dataset used is the K-Fall [465] dataset.\
    \ It was released on the pattern of\nthe SisFall dataset and includes more activities\
    \ compared to SisFall. A summary of\nthe datasets is presented in the next section.\n\
    2.7.1\nSisFall Dataset\nThe SisFall dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ recordings of 19 types of\nactivities of daily living and falls. Two accelerometers\
    \ and one gyroscope were placed\non the waist and used for making the measurements.\
    \ This location was chosen so as\nto ensure that all body movements while performing\
    \ the activities/falls were captured\nby the sensory system. Furthermore, the\
    \ data recordings involved 23 young people\nbetween the ages of 19-30 years old\
    \ and 15 elderly people between the ages of 60-75\nyears. The dataset contains\
    \ annotated sensor measurements of each of these ADLs\nand falls recorded as well\
    \ as video recordings of sample experiments. There are four\nmain types of falls\
    \ present, six of them are forward falls , three backward falls, four\nlateral\
    \ falls and two vertical falls. The types of falls performed were directed through\n\
    a survey taken from elderly people living independently as well as the ones living\n\
    in retirement homes and include scenarios of slipping and tripping. Moreover,\
    \ they\nare preceded by various types of ADLs being performed to make the recordings\
    \ as\nclose to a real world scenario as possible. The ADLs recorded were approved\
    \ by\nmedical personnel and were chosen so as to be similar to falls. The ADLs\
    \ include\nhigh mobility activities such as walking up/down stairs, jogging as\
    \ well as activities\nwhich can be confused with falls such as quickly sitting\
    \ in a chair, bending at the\nknee and stumble while walking etc. In total, there\
    \ were 2706 ADL recordings and\n1798 fall recordings. The SisFall data is utilized\
    \ in this study as it has been the\nthe dataset of choice for several previous\
    \ research approaches addressing the subject\nof fall detection [466, 467, 468,\
    \ 436, 469] and also because the volunteer makeup\nconsists of both men and women,\
    \ young adults and the elderly. The ADLs and Falls\nin the SisFall dataset have\
    \ been presented in Table 32 with a brief description of the\nactivities and falls\
    \ provided as well.\n89\nTable 32. ADL and Falls present in the SisFall dataset.\n\

    \ the SisFall dataset and contains 15\nfall types and 21 ADLs. The falls in K-Fall\
    \ are the same as those in SisFall. However,\nin the case of ADLs, they remove\
    \ the activity of sitting in and getting out of a car\nand combine some of the\
    \ activities while adding static activities of sitting on a chair,\nsitting on\
    \ a sofa and lying down.\nA total of 2729 ADL recordings and 2346 fall\nrecordings\
    \ are present in the dataset. This dataset is included in the study to test\n\
    cross-dataset fall detection. The details of the K-Fall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table\n33.\n2.8\nExperiments\nThis section discusses the experiments conducted\

    \ and severity. The second, third and\nfour experiments involved the inclusion\
    \ of activities of daily living classification in\naddition to the fall classes\
    \ considered in the first experiment. Moreover, experiment\nfour presents results\
    \ for a cross-dataset fall detection scenario.\n2.8.1\nFall Detection with Severity\
    \ and Direction consideration\nThis section describes the work on fall detection\
    \ considering severity and direction\nwhile only considering sensor data for falls.\
    \ The experiment has been performed as\ntwo tasks, one for determining falls considering\
    \ direction only and the other while\nconsidering both direction as well as severity.\n\
    2.8.1.1\nData Labeling\nTo perform fall detection that is direction and severity\
    \ aware, we only considered fall\n91\ndata from the SisFall dataset. As can be\
    \ seen from Table 32, most of the falls in\nthe dataset have been labelled as\
    \ either being in the forward, backward or lateral\ndirection.\nHowever, two of\
    \ the falls (F06 and F07) are not labeled in terms of\ndirection. For the considerations\
    \ of this research work, these were assigned the labels\nof Forward and Lateral\
    \ respectively using the videos of sample trials provided by the\ndataset authors.\n\
    Concerning fall severity, while the original labels from the dataset contained\
    \ in-\nformation for most falls for direction, the approach followed by Gibson\
    \ et al. [456]\nwas used to determine the severity of falls. According to the\
    \ practice followed by\nthem, all falls where in some support was used to soften\
    \ the impact of the fall were\nconsidered as soft falls whereas all falls where\
    \ the subject fell directly were classified\nas hard falls. This resulted in six\
    \ classes for fall types with hard and soft for ima-\npact and forward, backward\
    \ and lateral for direction. These are Forward Soft Falls\n(FSF), Forward Hard\
    \ Falls (FHF), Backward Soft Falls (BSF), Backward Hard Falls\n(BHF), Lateral\
    \ Soft Falls (LSF) and Lateral Hard Falls (LHF). These labels have\nbeen summarized\
    \ in Table 34.\nTable 34. Labeling used for Fall only classification for the SisFall\

    \ Direction and Severity.\n2.8.1.2\nMethodology\nThe methodology used for this\
    \ experiment follows a typ-\nical machine learning pipeline as shown in Figure\
    \ 17. First, we pre-process the data\nwhich involves extraction of sensor segments\
    \ representing falls. This is followed by\nfeature extraction that aims to extract\
    \ useful representations from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor data. Lastly,\
    \ feature selection is carried out where we aim to\nreduce the number of features\
    \ used in the last stage that is classification.\nData Pre-processing\nRecordings\
    \ in the SisFall dataset vary in length between 12 and 100 seconds. The\ntrial\
    \ recordings for falls in the SisFall dataset consist of subjects performing various\n\
    activities before experiencing the fall. For a sound feature extraction process,\
    \ we\nextract equal duration segments of sensor readings from these trials that\
    \ represent\nthe fall taking place along with some part of the pre-fall activity\
    \ being performed.\nTo do this, for each record we first calculate the acceleration\
    \ magnitude (also called\nthe Signal Magnitude Vector (SMV) ) [430] for all sensor\
    \ value samples within a trial\nrecording. The SMV can be calculated as given\
    \ in Eq.1.\nSMVj =\nq\f\fAxj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAyj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAzj\n\f\f2\n(1)\n\
    93\nwhere SMVj represents the SMV value for a sample j in a given trial. The SMV\n\
    is calculated for all samples and the sample location for the SMV peak value is\n\
    determined within the trial. This is then used as the midpoint for extracting\
    \ a 2.5\nsecond segment from the trial. A segment length of 2.5 seconds was chosen\
    \ as it was\nvisually found to capture all the falls as well as some part of the\
    \ pre-fall activity being\nperformed. Using this scheme, segments were extracted\
    \ for all the fall trials in the\ndataset.\nThere are a total of 1798 fall samples\
    \ in the dataset, after the labeling used, there\nwere a total of 838 samples\
    \ for the forward fall category, 360 samples for the backward\nfall category and\
    \ 600 samples for the lateral fall category. Sample waveforms for the\nthree directions\
    \ of falls and three severity levels have been shown in Appendix A.\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is used to convert inputs in to more useful representations.\
    \ In\nthis experiment, we take cue from the work of [420, 470] who use various\
    \ time and\nfrequency domain features successfully for fall detection and recognition\
    \ of activities\nof daily living. Table 35 lists the features computed for each\
    \ extracted segment. Each\nof these features have been computed for every axis\
    \ of the considered accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor measurements.\nTable 35.\

    \ Range\nFor a set of numerical values X ordered in arranged ascending order,\
    \ the ith percentile\nis defined as the number n below which i percent of the\
    \ total numbers of X fall below\nit. Therefore, the 25th Percentile (also called\
    \ the First Quartile) is the number in X\nbelow which exactly 25% of the values\
    \ fall. Similarly, 75th Percentile (also called\nthe Third Quartile) is the number\
    \ in X below which exactly 75% of the values fall.\nAnother important quantity\
    \ concerning percentiles is the Interquartile Range (IQ\n94\nRange), also called\
    \ the Midspread. The IQ Range is the difference between the 75th\nPercentiles\
    \ and the 25th Percentiles.\nDelta\nThe Delta represents the difference between\
    \ the minimum and maximum\nvalue of a set of numeric values X.\nKurtosis\nIt’s\
    \ a metric for how much a distribution’s tails diverge from that of\na normal\
    \ distribution. A large Kurtosis values indicates to larger extremity of the\n\
    divergences which can be thought of as outliers. The Kurtosis for a set of numerical\n\
    values X can be calculated as given in Eq. 2.\nKurtosis(X) =\n1\nNσ4\nN\nX\ni=1\n\
    (xi − µ)4\n(2)\nMean\nFor a set of values X, the arithmetic mean or the average\
    \ returns the\ncenter value of X. Mathematically it is given in Eq. 3.\nMean(X)\
    \ =\nPN\ni=1 xi\nN\n(3)\nMedian\nFor a set of values X, the median indicates to\
    \ the central tendency of\nX. It divides a set of values in to two equal parts.\
    \ For a set X of size N arranged in\nascending order, the median can be calculated\
    \ as in Eq. 4.\nMedian(X) = X[N + 1\n2\n]\n(4)\nMaximum\nFor a set of values X,\
    \ the maximum value represents the largest\nvalue in the set X.\nMinimum\nFor\
    \ a set of values X, the minimum value represents the smallest\nvalue in the set\
    \ X.\nSkewness\nThe Skewness measures the lack of symmetry in the probability\
    \ dis-\ntribution of data around its mean. It is calculated as in Eq. 5.\nSkewness(X)\
    \ =\n1\nNσ3\nN\nX\ni=1\n(xi − µ)3\n(5)\nStandard Deviation and Variance\nThe Standard\
    \ Deviation measures the\nvariation of a set of numerical values around its mean.\
    \ For a set of numerical values\nX, the standard deviation can be calculated as\
    \ in Eq. 6.\n95\nStd(X) =\nsPN\ni=1(xi − µ)2\nN\n(6)\nwhere µ is the Mean of X.\
    \ The Variance of X is the square of the Standard\nDeviation.\nPower Spectral\
    \ Density\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) is an indication\nto the power content\
    \ of a signal with respect to its frequency. It therefore helps to\nunderstand\
    \ the distribution of power in the signal for the different frequencies that\n\
    comprise it. The PSD has been computed using the Welch method [471]. Once the\n\
    PSD has been computed, the mean, median and Root Mean Squared (RMS) values\nof\
    \ the PSD are computed.\nPower Spectral Entropy\nThe Power Spectral Entropy (PSE)\
    \ is a measure of\nthe entropy in the power spectrum of a signal and indicates\
    \ to the complexity present\ntherein. It is computed as an entropy calculation\
    \ on the normalized PSD estimate.\nSimilar to the PSD computation, the Welch method\
    \ was used to estimate the PSD\nbefore PSE calculations were performed.\nThe aforementioned\
    \ quantities were computed for all windowed samples of the fall\nrecordings. In\
    \ total, this resulted in 96 features being computed for each segment.\nBefore\
    \ these features are passed on to the next stage, normalization was performed\n\
    feature wise for each sensor.\nFeature Selection\nFeature selection is an important\
    \ step in the machine learning pipeline. It not only\nhelps to reduce the feature\
    \ set size used in an application which helps computationally\nbut may also result\
    \ in performance improvement as observed by [472]. Feature se-\nlection is performed\
    \ using Random Forest Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE)\n[473] which involves\
    \ determining the importance of features by eliminating features\niteratively\
    \ and looking at classifier performance. It starts by developing a model us-\n\
    ing all the available features within the dataset, in every iteration, the feature\
    \ that\nhas the ’least importance/contribution’ is discarded and a new model is\
    \ fitted with\nthe remaining features. This process is carried out until a pre-decided\
    \ number of\nfeatures remain. Since in this work, our goal is to reduce the number\
    \ of features\nfrom the original count, we perform manual tests by establishing\
    \ a baseline for the\nperformance of our models. The baseline is formed by using\
    \ all features for each\nof our classification tasks and using the highest weighted\
    \ F1-score achieved as the\nperformance goal cut-off for the reduction of features.\
    \ This step will ensure that we\natleast get the same performance as the original\
    \ feature set.\nClassification\nClassification refers to the usage of a classification\
    \ algorithm, also called a classifier\n96\nto determine the output ’label’ or\
    \ category given a set of input values called features.\nIn the current setting,\
    \ the classification problem is a supervised one wherein the\nclassifier is provided\
    \ inputs and their corresponding output labels which allow it\nto learn the relationship\
    \ between the input and the output.\nOnce this mapping\nhas been sufficiently\
    \ learned (a process called training) the trained classifier can\nbe provided\
    \ unlabeled inputs for it to predict an output label value or class. The\nefficacy\
    \ of the classifier in predicting the correct output is measured through various\n\
    metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc. This experiment consists\
    \ of\ntwo classification experiments being performed, one is the direction only\
    \ experiment\nwhere the classifiers used are trained to distinguish between the\
    \ three direction of falls\ngiven the input feature set and another experiment\
    \ where the classifiers are trained\nto determine fall directions and severity\
    \ together.\nFour different classifiers were tested to perform these tasks, these\
    \ are the Random\nForest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and\
    \ Extreme Gradient\nBoost (XGBoost). All of the classifiers were trained using\
    \ five fold cross validation\nwith a stratified split and a parameter search being\
    \ performed for tuning purposes.\nSupport Vector Machines\nSupport Vector Machine\
    \ is a supervised learning\nalgorithm that, in its simplest form tries to fit\
    \ a line in between data samples of two\ndifferent classes to separate them. The\
    \ criteria used by the SVM to fit this line is\nthe maximization of the distance\
    \ between the line and the (data) points closest to it.\nThis concept of using\
    \ a line to separate two dimensional data can be extended to two\ndimensional\
    \ planes being used for separating three-dimensional data and hyperplanes\nfor\
    \ higher dimensional data. SVMs are quite flexible in that they can not only be\
    \ used\nto work with linearly separable data but also with data that is not linearly\
    \ separable.\nThis is achieved using Kernel functions which map the nonlinearly\
    \ distributed data\nin to a higher dimensional space to make it linearly separable\
    \ (as much as possible).\nThere are several kernel functions available to be used\
    \ for this purpose such as the\nhyperbolic tangent, radial basis, sigmoid, polynomial\
    \ etc. Optimizing the SVM re-\nquires the tuning of the cost parameter C, a small\
    \ value of C indicates an underfit\nwhereas a very large value of C indicates\
    \ an overfit.\nEven though, the current experiment considers using SVMs for a\
    \ classification\ntaks, it should also be mentioned that SVM’s are not limited\
    \ to application towards\nclassification problems and they have also been used\
    \ for regression applications too.\nDecision Tree\nDecision Trees are one of the\
    \ most widely used classification\nalgorithms due to their interpretability. The\
    \ aim of the algorithm is to come up with\nas simple a solution as possible while\
    \ successively dividing the data in to simpler and\nsimpler classification tasks\
    \ based on the values of the features. For a classification\nproblem, given a\
    \ set of input features of the training set, decision trees use the values\nof\
    \ the features to divide or split the dataset in to more simpler sub problems.\
    \ The\naim being to get the largest information gain when choosing the feature/s\
    \ for the\nsplit. Each split point in a decision tree is called a node and each\
    \ split is called a\nbranch. Branches from a given node represent all the possible\
    \ outcomes from that\n97\nnode and may contain subsequent decision nodes as well\
    \ which are called child nodes.\nEach branch ends at a node called the leaf node\
    \ where data points are assigned a\nclass label.\nDepending on the number of input\
    \ features and the output classes, decision trees\ncan be built to classify the\
    \ dataset in a ’complete’ manner due to its iterative parti-\ntioning scheme.\
    \ However, this is undesirable since that would lead to overfitting of the\nmodel\
    \ and also because such trees would lead to a complicated model, which is not\n\
    desirable since that would impact interpretability. The process of removing branches\n\
    and replacing them by leaf nodes is called pruning. Pruning aims to increase the\n\
    models generalizations capabilities and increase robustness. Two paramters which\n\
    are used for this purpose are tree depth limits the number of child nodes present\
    \ in\nevery branch and the number of features used at each split.\nRandom Forest\
    \ Classifier\nRandom forest is a bagging approach towards de-\ncision trees where\
    \ instead of deciding on where to split for each node, for each tree\na random\
    \ subset of features is used and the feature/threshold to split the data is\n\
    determined within that subset of features to separate the data in the best manner\n\
    possible. This process is repeated multiple times which results in various trees\
    \ pro-\nducing possibly different predictions. The predictions from each tree\
    \ are combined\nto form an ensemble either through majority voting or by averaging.\
    \ The imple-\nmentation of Random Forests used in this work uses the averaging\
    \ approach. There\nare several parameters that are important in the tuning of\
    \ Random Forests are the\nnumber of trees created before the averaging process\
    \ starts, the number of levels in\neach tree and more.\nExtreme Gradient Boost\n\
    Extreme Gradient Boost is another ensemble based\ntree algorithm, however compared\
    \ to the RFC, XGBoost uses boosting instead of\nbagging. In boosting, the input\
    \ samples are uniformly weighted and first a ’weak’\nlearner (classifier) is created\
    \ for a given task that doesnt perform well but is sufficient\nin the sense that\
    \ it is better than random guessing. In subsequent iterations of the\nlearner,\
    \ input samples which werent classified correctly by the learner are reweighted\n\
    by assigning larger weights to them while the weights for correctly classified\
    \ inputs\nis reduced. This step is repeated for a number of times with different\
    \ weak learners\nbeing trained.\nThe decision of the weak learners are combined\
    \ through majority\nvoting to determine the output class. Parameters used to tune\
    \ XGBoost are the\nmaximum depth allowed in each tree, the weight settings etc.\n\
    2.8.1.3\nResults\nAs mentioned previously, two separate experiments were conducted,\
    \ first was to dif-\nferentiate between fall directions only and the other to\
    \ differentiate between fall\ndirection as well as severity. The results from\
    \ those experiments are presented here.\nThe metrics considered for judging model\
    \ quality is the F1-score. The F1-score is the\nharmonic mean of the precision\
    \ and recall and is given as in Eq. 7.\n98\nF1 Score = 2 ∗ (Precision ∗ Recall)\n\
    Precision + Recall\n(7)\nwhere Precision is the ratio of the True positive samples\
    \ divided by the sum of the\nTrue positive and False positive samples as given\
    \ in Eq. 8. It is also called positive\npredictive value as it indicates to the\
    \ capability of the classifier to identify correctly\nthe samples of a given class.\n\
    Precision =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Positive\n(8)\nand recall indicates\
    \ to the models capability to identify the samples of a given\nclass over the\
    \ whole dataset. It is also called the sensitivity and is the ratio of the\nTrue\
    \ positives to the sum of the True positives and False Negatives as shown in Eq.\n\
    9.\nRecall =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Negative\n(9)\nWe report on\
    \ the F1-scores for each class when discussing classification perfor-\nmance and\
    \ deciding on the best classifier. Moreover, for the best classifier identified\n\
    the precision and recall have also been provided.\nFall direction\nIn this experiment,\
    \ fall segments labeled for direction only were used as input to the\nclassifiers.\
    \ To establish a baseline to be used as a reference in the feature selection\n\
    process, all computed features (96 in total) were passed to the four classifiers.\
    \ The\nbest performing model was found to be the SVM with a weighted F1-score\
    \ of 90.4%.\nFeature selection was then performed keeping in view baseline performance\
    \ of the\nSVM classifier so as to retain or improve this performance baseline\
    \ when choosing a\ngiven number of ’top’ features. Following this rule, feature\
    \ selection resulted in 90\nfeatures. The results are given in Table 36. It can\
    \ be observed from the table that\nthe SVM has outperformed the other algorithms\
    \ in detecting forward and lateral falls\nwhereas it achieves a slightly lower\
    \ F1-score for the backward fall class. Overall the\nSVM has shown to be better\
    \ at discriminating falls with direction.\nTable 36. Fall F1-scores (Fall direction\

    \ experiment, fall segments from the dataset were labeled for direction and\n\
    severity based on the labeling shown in Table 34 and passed to each of the classifiers\n\
    after feature selection. Like before, to establish a baseline, all computed features\
    \ (96\nin total) were passed to the four classifiers. The best weighted F1-score\
    \ of 78.44% was\nachieved by the SVM classifier. We used this value as the baseline\
    \ we aim to achieve\nafter feature selection. With this condition the number of\
    \ features were reduced to\n93. The performance achieved for each of the four\
    \ tested classifers is summarized in\nTable 37. It can be observed that the SVM\
    \ is the best performing classifier for all fall\ntypes bar FHF where the random\
    \ forest classifer achieves a slightly higher F1-score.\nThe highest F1-score\
    \ overall is achieved for the class BSF where as the lowest has\nbeen achieved\
    \ for LHF. When looking at fall direction, falls in the forward direction\ncan\
    \ be seen to be the hardest to identify followed by lateral falls. No such pattern\n\
    can be noted for soft/hard falls.\nTable 37. Fall F1-scores (Fall severity and\

    Discussion\nTo summarize the results from both experiments, we present the individual\
    \ F1-\nscores, Precision and Recall for the best performing classifier in each\
    \ case. These\nhave been presented in Table 38 and Table 39.\nTable 38. Best Results:\

    92.46\nIn both cases the best performing classifier was the SVM. This is inline\
    \ with\nthe findings of other research work as found from the literature review\
    \ [424, 429].\nA surprising outcome during this work was the unsatisfactory performance\
    \ of tree\nbased algorithms contrary to [420], we attribute this to the difference\
    \ in the data\nsegmentation scheme and also the fact that we follow different\
    \ labelling for the data\n100\nTable 39. Best Results: Fall direction and Severity\n\

    in terms of a direction and severity aware system. Moreover, the final weighted\
    \ F1-\nscores for the fall direction experiment was 92% and for the fall direction\
    \ and severity\nwas 79.53% which resulted in an improvement of just above 1% in\
    \ both cases with a\nsmall reduction in the number of features utilized, 90 and\
    \ 93 respectively compared to\n96 in the original feature set. Commenting on the\
    \ direction, the hardest to predict fall\nwas in the lateral direction and the\
    \ classifier incorrectly predicted forward falls and\nlateral falls in both the\
    \ scenarios tested. This highlights the difficulty in capturing\nthe difference\
    \ between these two fall directions using the features considered.\n2.8.2\nFall\
    \ Detection with Severity and Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using\
    \ Wavelet Pooling and K-NN\nThis section provides a framework for a fall and activity\
    \ recognition system. It aims\nto determine an appropriate sensor modality to\
    \ use and the window size to be used\nfor the task. The framework does this as\
    \ a problem of differentiating between various\nactivities of daily living as\
    \ well as various types of falls with regard to fall datection\nbeing direction\
    \ and severity aware. To do this, data from the SisFall dataset is used\nand after\
    \ suitable pre-processing and feature extraction, machine learning algorithms\n\
    are utilized to differentiate between different activities of daily living and\
    \ falls\n2.8.2.1\nData Labeling\nSince we aim to perform activity recognition\
    \ and fall detection with direction and\nseverity, the ADL labeling of the original\
    \ dataset has been modified. This labeling\nhas been shown in Table 40. As can\
    \ be observed from Table 40, the activities Walking\n(W), Jogging (J), Sitting\
    \ (S) and Standing (SB) have been considered for this work\nwhich are typical\
    \ activities in ADL detection problems. Each of these labels includes\ndata from\
    \ multiple original activities, for e.g. activities with original labels of walking\n\
    upstairs and downstairs, walking slowly and walking quickly have been considered\
    \ as\nwalking in this work. A similar scheme has been used for the other three\
    \ activity\nlabels as well. Some of the activities such as being on one’s back\
    \ change to lateral\nposition, wait a moment, and change to one’s back (D14),\
    \ getting in and out of the\ncar (D17), stumble while walking (D18), and gently\
    \ jumping without falling while\ntrying to reach a high object (D19) have not\
    \ been considered. The reason for this\nis that they have very few samples to\
    \ be considered as standalone activities (only\none type of sub-activity and also\
    \ because most of these are not considered in typical\n101\nADL detection scenarios).\
    \ For falls, the labeling same as that for the direction and\nseverity experiment\
    \ has been retained.\nTable 40. ADL Labels used for SisFall Recordings.\nActivity\

    \ work with individual parts being elab-\norated upon in the proceeding subsections.\
    \ As can be seen, the first stage consists of\ndata preprocessing, followed by\
    \ feature extraction and then evaluation or classifica-\ntion.\nData Preprocessing\n\
    Data preprocessing for this experiment was performed in a similar manner to section\n\
    2.8.1 for most recordings. The SMV was computed for the complete recording and\n\
    windowed segments of a fixed duration were extracted.\nWindowed segments are\n\
    extracted in this manner from all considered activities in the SisFall dataset\
    \ except\nthe activities of D01, D02, D03 and D04 which consist of a single trial\
    \ per subject of\nduration 100s. In such cases, continuous windowed segments of\
    \ duration n seconds\nare extracted from the recordings. It is also pertinent\
    \ to mention here that since\nboth accelerometers are placed at the same position,\
    \ we only consider one of the\naccelerometers along with the gyroscope readings\
    \ present in the recorded trials. To\ndetermine the value of n as well as the\
    \ appropriate sensor modality to use for the\nfinal system, experiments were performed\
    \ on the developed framework and the results\nhave been discussed in subsequent\
    \ sections.\nFeature extraction\nIn this experiment, feature extraction consists\

    Wavelets can be used for a variety of applications\nsuch as spectral analysis\
    \ where they are used to analye a signal in the time-frequency\ndomain, denoising,\
    \ compression and signal enhancement. A wavelet is a function of\nfinite duration\
    \ and has an average value of zero, an example of a mexican hat wavelet\nis shown\
    \ in Figure. 19. The width of the wavelet is called its scale and it is analogous\n\
    to frequency in an inverse manner. A large value of the scale (wider window) allows\n\
    for capturing of low frequency components of the signal whereas a small scale\
    \ value\ncaptures low frequency components.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0.2\n0.1\n\

    \ The detail component\nrepresents the high frequency component captured by the\
    \ wavelet whereas the ap-\nproximation component represents the low frequency\
    \ part. Since the wavelet has\nonly been convolved once with the signal, these\
    \ coefficients are said to be level 1\ncoefficients. At each level, resulting\
    \ coefficients are downsampled by half to result in\na lower resolution signal.\
    \ Subsequent approximation components can be convolved\nwith the wavelet to result\
    \ in approximation and detail components for the next level\nthus forming what\
    \ is called a wavelet decomposition tree.\nTo perform wavelet decomposition, in\
    \ this experiment, we make use of the Haar\nwavelet [476] shown in Figure. 20.\
    \ Level 4 haar wavelets were computed for each of\nthe extracted segments of the\
    \ signals.\nSpatial Pooling\nThe results from the decomposition provide a large\
    \ number\nof features which would pose a problem for use in the proceeding classification\
    \ stage.\nIn order to reduce the feature dimension size, Spatial Pyramid Pooling\
    \ [477] was\nused. Spatial Pyramid Pooling is an adaptive pooling method which\
    \ was developed\nto address the issue of fluctuating input sizes in CNNs for image-based\
    \ applications,\nand it entails converting varying-size convolutional feature\
    \ maps into fixed-length\nsummarizations. These summarizations, having uniform\
    \ length can then be passed\non to the fully connected parts of the CNN where\
    \ a fixed length input is necessary.\n104\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n\

    \ dividing the input in to pxp pieces\nwhile computing the size of each piece\
    \ automatically and performing any necessary\npadding. Once these pieces are created,\
    \ a pooling operation is typically performed\n(max pooling or average pooling\
    \ for e.g.) on each of these pieces to summarize the\ninput into an output of\
    \ fixed size pxp. This results in a fixed output length for any\nsize of the input.\
    \ In this experiment, 4-2-1 1D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used\non the detail\
    \ and approximation coefficients of the wavelet decomposition of activity\nand\
    \ fall data. This process has been shown in Figure 21. Each coefficient set was\n\
    divided in to four and two parts and then max pooling was used to determine the\n\
    maximum value in these divided parts and the coefficient set as a whole.\nThese\n\
    maximum values were then concatenated together to form the seven valued output\n\
    from that coefficient set. Furthermore, the results for each coefficient set within\
    \ each\naxis were also concatenated to form the feature vector for a sensor axis\
    \ measurement.\nThis operation was performed for each axis of accelerometer and\
    \ groscope sensor\ndata with the final feature vector of 210 values consisting\
    \ of the concatenations of\nthe individual vectors for each axis. It is hypothesized\
    \ that this way local as well as\nglobal information at each level of the wavelet\
    \ coefficients can be captured. For the\nwavelet decomposition, tests were performed\
    \ with level values of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and\nit was determined that level-4 produced\
    \ the best results.\nClassification\nA hierarchical classification approach is\
    \ employed to discriminate between the vari-\nous activities and falls considered\
    \ from the SisFall dataset. Hierarchical classification\ninvolves the division\
    \ of a complex taxonomic classification problem in to a set of\nsubsets that are\
    \ potentially easier to differentiate as the task becomes more localized.\nHierarchical\
    \ classifiers have been used in multiple different applications [478] where\n\
    they have been found to improve upon the performance of many flat classification\n\
    schemes. The classification framework used in this work combines hierarchical\
    \ clas-\nsification with a vote based system. The classification problem is divided\
    \ into three\nparts, each with its own classifier to indicate to the subclass\
    \ of the output. The clas-\n105\nMaxpooling Size = 4\nMaxpooling Size = 2\nMaxpooling\

    \ 1-D Spatial Pyramid Pooling.\nsifier in part one consists of differentiating\
    \ whether a given recording is a fall or one\nof the four considered ADLs. In\
    \ order to train this stage, the activities of Standing,\nWalking, Sitting and\
    \ Jogging along with all falls combined in to one class are passed\nto the classifier.\
    \ This dilutes the original ten-class problems in to a five-class sub\nproblem.\
    \ The output of this stage is the determination of whether a given recording\n\
    is either one of the four ADLs (Standing, Walking, Sitting or Jogging) or a fall.\
    \ If a\nrecording has been detected to be a fall, it is sent to the second and\
    \ third stages.\nThe second and third stages work in parallel on samples detected\
    \ as falls from\n106\nthe first stage in the form of a voting machine. These two\
    \ stages vote individually\non the direction and severity of the detected fall\
    \ samples. In order to train them,\nfall samples were relabeled to represent direction\
    \ and severity only and are fed to the\nclassifiers. For the direction, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a three-class\nproblem of determining fall directions\
    \ as being Forward, Backward or Lateral. For\nthe severity classifier, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a two-class problem\nof a fall being either Soft or\
    \ Hard. After a signal has passed through all necessary\nstages, the outputs of\
    \ the individual stages are combined to indicate to the activity\nor type of fall\
    \ being fed at the input.\nFour classifiers were tested for each part of the hierarchical\
    \ scheme, the classifiers\nconsidered were K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector\
    \ Machines, Random Forests\nand eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Parameter tuning was\
    \ performed using gradient\nsearch for each classifier over a range of values\
    \ for each parameter.\nK-Nearest Neighbor\nCompared to the SVM which attempts\
    \ to create a deci-\nsion boundary between classes on a global level, the K-NN\
    \ algorithm operates locally.\nStarting from a data point, the 1 Nearest Neigbhor\
    \ algorithm will assign each new\nsample the class of its neighbor. However, using\
    \ a single neighborhood point to assign\nnew classes may lead to erroneous classes\
    \ being assigned. Therefore, typically mul-\ntiple neighboring points are used\
    \ to determine the label for a given point. In K-NN,\n’K’ represents the number\
    \ of points used in the neighborhood to assign labels to data\nsamples. Each considered\
    \ sample is assigned the majority label within a neighbor-\nhood of K points around\
    \ it. In this manner, the K-NN algorithm is successively able\nto create a decision\
    \ boundary separating the data in to the different output classes.\n2.8.2.3\n\
    Results\nThree experiments were performed in this section. The first was to choose\
    \ the best\nclassifier to use, once that was determined. experiments were conducted\
    \ to determine\nthe observation window size and different combination of sensor\
    \ modalities. We used\nthe weighted F1-score as our training metric due to the\
    \ imbalance in the samples\nof the different classes in the data. Moreover, for\
    \ evaluation purposes, we report on\nthe individual F1-scores for each output\
    \ class and provide discussions as necessary.\nFurthermore, for the best performing\
    \ results, the Precision and Recall and Specificity\nwere also specified. Specificity\
    \ can be calculated as given in Eq. 10. It is also called\nthe True Negative Rate\
    \ and indicates to a classifiers capability to correctly detect\nsamples which\
    \ don’t belong to a given class. These metrics have been computed on\na one versus\
    \ all basis.\nSpecificity =\nTrue Negative\nTrue Negative + False Positive\n(10)\n\
    The data after the feature extraction stage was split in to a train/test partition\n\
    based on a 75/25 ratio with a parameter grid being searched through to obtain\n\
    107\ntuning parameters for maximizing the weighted F1-score while using five-fold\
    \ cross\nvalidation.\nClassifier Selection\nThis test was conducted to determine\
    \ the best classifier to use for the proceeding\nexperiments of observation window\
    \ selection and sensor modality selection. Here,\nexperiments were performed for\
    \ the considered window durations for each activity\nand the classifier which\
    \ provided the best performance overall was chosen. The mean\nF1-scores for each\
    \ output class for each classifier are shown in Figure 22. It can be\nobserved\
    \ that in general K-NN and SVM perform better compared to the ensemble\nmodels,\
    \ the RFC and XGBoost. However, since the K-NN slightly outperforms the\nSVM in\
    \ eight of the ten considered classes, we choose K-NN as the classifier for this\n\
    framework.\nBHF\nBSF\nFHF\nFSF\nJ\nLHF\nLSF\nS\nSB\nW\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\

    \ Window Duration\nAn important consideration in working with activity recognition\
    \ systems is to de-\ntermine the appropriate observation window size for the analysis\
    \ of sensor signals\nto accomplish the ADL recognition/fall detection task. The\
    \ size of the observation\nwindow is important as a smaller observation window\
    \ increases the response time of\nthe activity recognition/fall detection system\
    \ and it can also impact the time taken\nin the computation of features. In order\
    \ to find the best observation window size,\nwe perform experiments using five\
    \ values, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 seconds. The classification\nresults in terms of the\
    \ F1-score are presented in Table 41. For each case, samples\nof duration equal\
    \ to half of the observation window were extracted around the peak\nvalue of the\
    \ SMV. From the table, it can be observed that an observation window\n108\nof\
    \ size 3 seconds produces the best results for six out of the ten output classes.\
    \ It\nonly produces poorer results for the classes BHF, BSF and S, SB where window\
    \ sizes\nof 2 seconds, 6 seconds and 4 seconds respectively perform better than\
    \ the 3 second\nwindowing case. Upon further investigation of this phenomenon\
    \ using the result of\nother classifiers, it was observed that the activities\
    \ of (BHF and BHF) were best rec-\nognized by all the classifiers with a window\
    \ size of 2 seconds (for the case of K-NN,\nthere is a small difference between\
    \ the 2 second and 6 second case), for the other two\nactivities of S and SB too\
    \ the F1-score was obtained for the 4 second duration (for\nthe activity S, the\
    \ difference in performance over windows larger than 4 seconds is\nvery small).\
    \ This could be attributed to the feature aggregation process in the max\npooling\
    \ operation in the different spatial segments.\nTable 41. Performance for different\

    Sensor Modality\nThe second experiment in designing the proposed system is the\
    \ determination of\nthe best sensor modality to use.\nUsing a single sensor would\
    \ result in less data,\nfaster processing and reduced hardware costs compared\
    \ to the multisensor approach\ncombining accelerometer and gyroscope. To do this,\
    \ the classification framework was\ntested with 3 second windowed segments of\
    \ the combined acceleromter and gyroscope\ndata as well as data of the accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope sensors individually. The\nresults of this experiment are presented\
    \ in Table 42. It can be observed that using\na combination of both accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope data together produces the best\nresults for eight of the ten\
    \ output classes. An accelerometer-only system produces\nbetter results for the\
    \ detection of activity SB and the fall FHF. The outcome of this\nexperiment agrees\
    \ with previous work for fall detection by Waheed et. al. [436] on\nthe SisFall\
    \ dataset.\n2.8.2.4\nDiscussion\nTable 43 reports on the best results obtained\

    \ 43, the best recognized ADLs are W and J whereas the best rec-\nognized fall\
    \ is BSF. The worst performing class in ADLs is SB whereas the worst\nperforming\
    \ fall is LHF. Upon further inspection of the cause of the bad performance\nwith\
    \ LHF, looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that LHF was most\ncommonly\
    \ confused with FSF which resulted in a reduction of the classification per-\n\
    formance for this class. On the other hand, in the case of FSF (the second worse\n\
    performing class), looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that FSF was\n\
    confused with LSF and FHF. Furthermore, the specificity values indicate that there\n\
    has been very little mis-identification for each of the classes. When talking\
    \ about\nthe activity S, it was observed that samples from this activity were\
    \ confused with\nthe activity W which resulted in the sub-par performance of the\
    \ classifier for its\nrecognition.\n110\n2.8.3\nFall Detection with Severity and\
    \ Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using CNN-XGBoost\nThis section presents\
    \ a scheme for performing fall detection considering fall direction\nand severity\
    \ as well as activity recognition. Inertial sensor data taken from the SisFall\n\
    dataset is used to develop the methodology. Data pre-processing is first carried\
    \ out\nin terms of windowing and relabeling. Then, data augmentation is carried\
    \ out for\nclasses which do not have a sufficient number of samples. Lastly, feature\
    \ extraction is\nperformed along with classification. This work considers fall\
    \ and activity recognition\nas a holistic problem, in that different types of\
    \ falls and activities are considered\nthereby producing a more ’complete’ recognition\
    \ system for use in cyber-physical\nsystems. Moreover, towards this end, a CNN-XGBoost\
    \ combination is proposed.\n2.8.3.1\nMethodology\nThe proposed scheme follows\
    \ a typical deep learning so-\nlution framework. First, inertial sensor data from\
    \ the IMU sensors contained within\nthe SisFall dataset is pre-processed to extract\
    \ windowed segments, then data aug-\nmentation is performed for minority classes,\
    \ followed by feature extraction and then\nclassification. This has been illustrated\
    \ in Figure 23 and a discussion is provided for\neach of the steps in the proceeding\
    \ sections.\nData Pre-processing\nBefore the IMU sensor recordings can be used\
    \ for ADL and fall detection, raw sensor\nmeasurements need to be suitably processed.\
    \ In this experiment, data pre-processing\nconsists of two steps, the first is\
    \ the extraction of uniform sized windows as was\nperformed in the previous section\
    \ from the IMU recordings and the next is data\naugmentation. Since windowing\
    \ of the signals has already been discussed previously,\nonly data augmentation\
    \ is discussed here.\nData Augmentation\nThe use of deep learning methods require\
    \ a suitable\namount of data to be present for them to learn the data pattern\
    \ sufficiently well. Un-\nfortunately, due to the nature of the problem considered,\
    \ the relabeled data from the\nSisFall dataset contains a reduced amount of data\
    \ for some of the classes, especially\nfall classes and also for the ADL of Standing.\
    \ In order to alleviate this shortcom-\ning, data augmentation was employed to\
    \ increase the number of samples from these\nclasses. Three augmentations were\
    \ performed for each of the extracted recordings\nfor the classes SB, FHF, FSF,\
    \ BHF, BSF, LHFand LSF. These were the addition of\nnoise, scaling and resampling\
    \ after inerpolation [439]. For augmentation with noise,\nwhite gaussian noise\
    \ was added to the extracted windows of the considered classes.\nThe noise was\
    \ generated using a standard deviation equal to 0.01. The addition of\nthe noise\
    \ simulates measurement noise during recording which might be encountered\nwhen\
    \ IMU based fall detection systems are employed. For scale based augmentation,\n\
    the original extracted window was multiplied by a random number from the uniform\n\
    distribution between 0.8 and 1.2 thereby scaling it between 80% and 120% of its\
    \ orig-\ninal form. By doing so, changes in amplitude over the same type of activity/fall\
    \ are\nincorporated. This could indicate to a change in fixation (loosening etc)\
    \ of the sensing\n111\nPeak SMV Detection\nWindowing\nCNN\nXGBoost Classifier\n\

    \ different physique and subsequent fall intensity response.\nLastly, in order\
    \ to incorporate sampling inconsistencies, the windows are first upsam-\npled\
    \ and then downsampled. This was done by a scale of ten. With this strategy,\n\
    each from original window were produced three additional samples. An illustration\n\
    for the results of the augmentation process for an X-axis accelerometer measurement\n\
    for a lateral fall has been shown in Figure 24.\nFeature extraction\nThe aim of\
    \ feature extraction for a classification problem is to produce a representa-\n\
    tion of the input that can be better used to indicate to the output class. In\
    \ this regard,\nresearch in the area of fall detection with inertial sensors has\
    \ made use of different\ntypes of hand crafted features such as statistical, time\
    \ and frequency domain as well\nas wavelet transforms [479, 480, 481, 482]. Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNNs\nor Covnets) are a set of neural networks developed following\
    \ the visual cortex within\nthe brain [483]. CNNs perform operations on inputs\
    \ by introducing convolutions of\n112\nFigure 24.\nIllustration of data augmentation.\n\
    (X component of Accelerometer,\nLateral Fall)\nseveral filters with learnable\
    \ weights to gauge the importance of each datapoint in\nthe input. These layers\
    \ containing the filters and to which the input is provided are\ncalled convolutional\
    \ layers. Through these learnable weights, CNNs are able to cap-\nture temporal\
    \ and spatial dependencies of the input. Moreover, using the same filters\nfor\
    \ different inputs reduces the number of parameters as the weights are reused.\
    \ This\nallows CNNs to develop a deeper understanding of the provided input compared\
    \ to\ntypical multilayer perceptron models. CNNs have revolutionized the field\
    \ of computer\nvision where they have been used for a variety of tasks such as\
    \ classification, object\ndetection, segmentation and object counting [484, 485]\
    \ and they have also successfully\nbeen used for applications within the speech\
    \ and other time series signal application\ndomain [486, 487, 488]. In this experiment,\
    \ rather than using hand crafted features\n113\nas in the previous experiments,\
    \ a CNN has been used to perform feature extraction\nin order to take advantage\
    \ of the spatial and temporal dependency capturing capa-\nbilities of CNNs. CNNs\
    \ are usually comprised of several convolutional (Conv) layers.\nWithin a multilayer\
    \ CNN, the earlier Conv layers capture low level features from the\ninput with\
    \ more complex features being computed by the successive layers. Also,\nCNNs may\
    \ employ pooling layers between convolutional layers so as to reduce the\nsize\
    \ of the input passed on to successive layers and therefore reduce computation.\n\
    The proposed network along with the XGBoost classification stage is illustrated\

    \ classification stage.\nAs seen from the figure, the network consists of four\
    \ Conv layers of 64 filters\neach.\nThese layers have filters of size 3x1 and\
    \ are used to extract features from\nraw inertial sensor measurements. Each Conv\
    \ layer is followed by a Relu activation\nfunction which applies a non-linearity\
    \ to the output of the Conv layers. To condense\nthe output of the first three\
    \ Conv layers, a pooling layer is utilized. Instead of max\npooling, average pooling\
    \ is used in this network. Max pooling picks out the largest\nvalue of the patch\
    \ of data being observed currently, in contrast, average pooling uses\nthe average\
    \ of the data being observed. Average pooling has been successfully used in\n\
    114\nplace of max pooling in a variety of scenarios [489, 490]. Normalization\
    \ is performed\nusing a batch normalization layer for each Conv layer. The output\
    \ of the last Conv\nlayer are feature maps derived from the input raw inertial\
    \ sensor measurements from\nboth the accelerometer and the gyroscope.\nClassification\n\
    Classification is carried out by using a eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) clas-\n\
    sifier. The output from the CNN is first flattened and then provided as an input\
    \ to\nthe XGBoost stage. The parameters of the XGBoost classifier are tuned through\
    \ a\nparameter search over a range of values. We make use of an XGBoost classifier\
    \ due\nto its suitability for a large dimensional input which results from the\
    \ flattened CNN\noutput.\n2.8.3.2\nResults\nIn order to use the proposed CNN for\
    \ feature extraction, it must first be trained\naccordingly. In order to train\
    \ the network, a fully connected layer with a softmax\noutput was added as the\
    \ final stage to serve as the intermediate temporary output\ndeterminant stage.\
    \ The windowed data from the SisFall dataset was divided in to\nthree sets, train,\
    \ validation and test in a stratified manner. A learning rate of 0.01\nwas used\
    \ for the network with a batch size of 20 and the stochastic gradient descent\n\
    was used as the optimizer. Moreover, the metric chosen was the average of the\
    \ recall\nscores of all classes together, also called as the unweighted average\
    \ recall (UAR).\nThe recall is considered as one wants the system correctly classify\
    \ as many positive\nsamples for every class as possible. The final network was\
    \ determined using early\nstopping. The unweighted average recall (UAR) can be\
    \ computed as,\nUAR =\nk\nX\nn=0\n\x10\nTPn\nTPn+FNn\n\x11\nk\n(11)\nwhere k stands\
    \ for number of classes and TPn stands for the number of True\nPositive samples\
    \ in the nth class and FNn stands for number False Negative samples\nin the nth\
    \ class. Therefore, the average of the individual recall scores from all classes\n\
    was aimed to be maximized.\nData from the training set was provided to the CNN\
    \ network after performing data\naugmentation on the minority classes, during\
    \ training, the validation set was used\nto observe performance of the network\
    \ and determine the best performing instance.\nOnce training was finished, the\
    \ last fully connected classification layer was removed\nand replaced by an XGBoost\
    \ classification stage. To train the XGBoost stage, the\nweights of the final\
    \ best performing CNN model were loaded in to CNN layers of\nthe network and input\
    \ samples were then passed through them as before. Using the\noutput of the CNN\
    \ stage as an input for the XGBoost, a search was then carried\nout to determine\
    \ the optimal parameter values. After training of the XGBoost stage,\nthe completely\
    \ trained CNN-XGBoost model was tested using the test set.\nTwo\n115\nsets of\
    \ tests were performed, one while considering all ADLs as a single class versus\n\
    individual falls and the other considering common individual ADLs and individual\n\
    falls.\nOne ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all ADLs present in the\
    \ SisFall dataset were combined in to one\nclass to build a generic ADL versus\
    \ fall system. The results are presented in Table 44.\nIt can be observed from\
    \ the table that the ADL class has been detected with perfect\nrecall score. Among\
    \ the falls, the worst performance was observed for LHF with the\nbest performance\
    \ for FHF.\nTable 44. One ADL vs. Individual Falls.\nActivity/ Fall\nPrecision\n\

    \ From Table 45,\nwhen looking at the recall achieved for the individual activities,\
    \ it can be observed\nthat the best recognized activities are W and J with each\
    \ achieving a recall of around\n97%. The worst performance in terms of ADLs was\
    \ achieved for the activity SB for\nwhich a recall of 83.78% was attained. Considering\
    \ the case of falls, out of the six\nfalls, the worst recall score of 75% was\
    \ achieved for BHF and LHF whereas the best\nrecall score was of 95.83% was achieved\
    \ for BSF and LSF. The fall class FSF was also\n116\nnot identified well, achieving\
    \ a recall score of 77.08%. Furthermore, as observed from\nthe table, a high value\
    \ of specificity was obtained for all ADLs and falls indicating\nto correct determination\
    \ of negative samples for each class as well. Investigating the\nperformance of\
    \ the network from the confusion matrix, it was observed that the worst\nperforming\
    \ activity SB was equally confused as S and W, this can be attributed to\nthe\
    \ fact that the SB activity includes slight bending which could lead to confusion\
    \ for\nthe classifier. For the worst performing falls, it was observed that BHF\
    \ was confused\nwith LHF and LSF whereas LHF was confused with FHF and FSF. The\
    \ confusion\nbetween the falls is apparent from plots shown in Appendix A where\
    \ BHF has very\nsimilar accelerometer signal values to these classes.\n2.8.3.3\n\
    Discussion\nInorder to better understand the performance of the network for the\
    \ various fall\ndetection types from Tables 44 and 45, the performance of the\
    \ network for fall severity\nhas been illustrated in Figure 26. It can be observed\
    \ that soft falls are better detected\ncompared to hard falls with UARs for the\
    \ individual ADL and fall experiment being\n79.63% for hard falls and that for\
    \ soft falls is 89.58%. For the one ADL and individual\nfall experiment, the difference\
    \ is less stark, being 85.18% for hard falls and 88.88%\nfor soft falls.\n60\n\

    network\nThis section presents a discussion on fall detection with severity and\
    \ direction along\nwith ADL recognition on the SisFall and the K-Fall datasets.\
    \ Two experiments were\nconducted in this regard, one with all ADLs as one class\
    \ versus the six fall types\nconsidered and another for individual ADLs and falls.\n\
    2.8.4.1\nData Labeling\nSince this experiment also uses the K-Fall dataset, the\
    \ labeling scheme for K-Fall\nis shown in Table 48. The labeling for the SisFall\
    \ dataset was retained the same\nfor the individual ADL and fall experiment.\n\
    However, for the one ADL and fall\nexperiment, all activities were labeled as\
    \ a single class ADL.\n2.8.4.2\nMethodology\nThe methodology consists of the two\
    \ steps of data preprocessing and classifi-\ncation. Data preprocessing has been\
    \ performed in the same manner as in section\n2.8.3.1. Therefore, this section\
    \ focuses on the ConvLSTM network used. The net-\nwork used in this work is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 28. It consists of four layers, the first\nof these is the ConvLSTM\
    \ layer. The ConvLSTM layer combines the properties of\nsequential learning associated\
    \ with LSTMs with the feature extraction capabilities\nof convolutional neural\
    \ networks and they have found successful use in the human\nactivity recognition/fall\
    \ detection domain [491, 492]. By replacing the simple matrix\nmultiplication\
    \ within LSTM cells by a convolutional operation, the ConvLSTM can\ncapture spatio-temporal\
    \ dependencies as opposed to the temporal only qualities of-\nfered by LSTMs.\
    \ Such spatial information is useful for the problem of fall detection\nwhere\
    \ not only the sequence contained within the recordings is important but also\n\
    the spatial information is also important to determine things like direction for\
    \ e.g.\nThe ConvLSTM layer is followed by a Self-Attention layer to incorporate\
    \ attention\n119\nTable 48. Labeling for K-Fall Dataset\nActivity Code\nAssigned\

    mechanism. Through the attention layer, important parts in the signal which can\n\
    help to determine the output class correctly are identified. For the current work,\
    \ a\nglobal attention mechanism which looks at the complete sequence is used.\
    \ After the\nattention layer follow two fully connected layers, one with a relu\
    \ activation function\nand the other with a softmax function to determine the\
    \ output class.\n2.8.4.3\nResults\nTwo experiments were performed in total on\
    \ the two datasets considered. The\nexperiments consisted of a fall vs ADL scenario\
    \ and another scenario in which ADLs\nwere conisdered individually to provide\
    \ a combined fall and ADL recognition system.\nThe results for each of the experiments\
    \ have been presented in this section. The\nnetwork was trained using an Adam\
    \ optimizer for 40 epochs with early stopping\nbeing used to retain the best performing\
    \ model before running it on the test set.\nAlso, during training, the network\
    \ was tasked to maximize the average recall of all\nclasses combined to ensure\
    \ that positive samples of each class were prioritized for\ncorrect detection,\
    \ however, in addition to recall, the precision, specificity and F1-\nscore have\
    \ also been reported in the results presented for the sake of completeness.\n\
    One ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all the ADLs were considered\
    \ a single class while the categories for\nfalls were retained as per individual\
    \ directions and severity levels. Table 49 presents\nthe results for this experiment\
    \ with the SisFall dataset for which an average recall of\n90.02% was achieved.\
    \ It can be observed that the network is able to determine ADLs\nvery well achieving\

    \ Considering the\nperformance of falls, the best performing fall classes were\
    \ BSF and LSF for which a\nrecall of 96% was achieved. The worst performing fall\
    \ class in this case was FSF with\na recall of 85%.\nIndividual ADL vs Individual\
    \ Falls\nIn this experiment, individual ADLs were considered as separate classes\
    \ in addition\nto the six fall classes mentioned before. This exercise was carried\
    \ out to assess the\ndesigned systems performance as a combined ADL recognition\
    \ and fall detection\nsystem. The result for the SisFall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table 51. The average\nrecall achieved for this experiment using the SisFall\
    \ dataset is 91.49%.\nConsidering fall performance, it can be observed from Table\
    \ 51 that the class\nBSF is the best recognized fall, having a recall of 94.74%\
    \ with the fall LHF being\nthe worst recognized one with a recall of 73.68%. The\
    \ best recognized ADL is the\nclass W with a near perfect recall of 99.06%. The\

    \ dataset is\nSB with a recall of 97.5% with the worst being the class J.\n2.8.4.4\n\
    Discussion\nWhen comparing the performance of ADLs and falls overall for both\
    \ experiments,\nit can be observed that ADL recognition performance was much better\
    \ than the\nperformance for fall detection. For both experiments conducted, when\
    \ comparing the\nperformance of the network across datasets, the network performs\
    \ better on the K-Fall\ndataset compared to the SisFall dataset. This could be\
    \ attributed to the difference\nin the volunteer make up of the participants as\
    \ K-Fall mostly had young people\nvolunteering to perform falls whereas SisFall\
    \ contains a wide variety of age groups\nand gender make up in its volunteers.\
    \ To gather further insights in to the performance\nof the network in terms of\
    \ fall detection for the two experiments conducted across both\ndatasets, Figure\
    \ 29 illustrates the networks performance for falls for both datasets\nand experiments.\
    \ An average recall of 88.37% was achieved for the SisFall dataset\nand 91.49%\
    \ for the K-Fall dataset for the one ADL vs individual falls experiment\nand 88.57%\
    \ and 91.33% respectively for the individual ADL and individual falls\nexperiment.\
    \ It can be observed that the classes LSF, FHF and BSF were recognized\nvery well,\
    \ each achieving a recall of nearly 90% or higher. The class FHF was also\ndetected\
    \ sufficiently well, achieving an average recall of more than 86% across all\n\
    experiments. For SisFall, the least performing class was LHF and for K-Fall it\
    \ was\nBHF.\nFigure 30 investigates the performance of the network when considering\
    \ different\nfall severity levels for all the experiments. It can be observed\
    \ that soft falls have\nbeen consistently better recognized compared to hard falls.\
    \ This difference is largest\n(6%) when individual ADLs are considered as separate\
    \ classes for both datasets. For\nthe experiment where ADLs are grouped in to\
    \ a single class, there is only a slight\n123\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n\

    99.87\n96.56\nonly detection system that considers the direction as well as the\
    \ severity of falls was\npresented. Inertial measurement sensor data from a publicly\
    \ available dataset was\nused to carry out this task. Following a typical machine\
    \ learning pipeline, the data\nwas first preprocessed by extracting equal duration\
    \ segments from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor signals based on the acceleration\
    \ magnitude. This is followed\nby the computation of various time and frequency\
    \ domain features for each of these\nsegments. The next step is feature selection\
    \ and classification which is performed by\nusing four different machine learning\
    \ algorithms popular in fall detection systems.\nFirst, a baseline performance\
    \ is established and then feature reduction is performed\naiming to maintain or\
    \ improve algorithm performance by elimination of redundant\nfeatures. It was\
    \ observed that the weighted F1-score improved slightly (by just over\n1%) for\
    \ both experiments.\nThe other three experiments considered activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection\nsimultaneously. For the second experiment, utilizing\
    \ inertial sensor data, a hierarchi-\ncal classification framework using wavelets\
    \ and adaptive pooling was presented. To\nachieve this, inertial sensor recordings\
    \ (accelerometer and gyroscope) from the Sis-\nFall dataset were utilized and\
    \ windowed segments were extracted from each recording.\nFollowing this, a level-4\
    \ haar wavelet was used to extract wavelet coefficients from\nthese windowed segments\
    \ and then 4-2-1 1-D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used to\n126\nsummarize the output\
    \ of the wavelet feature coefficients at each approximation and\ndetail level\
    \ before the max pooled coefficients were concatenated to form the final\nfeature\
    \ vector. A hierarchical classification scheme was then used consisting of three\n\
    classification stages, one for determining individual ADLs versus a generic fall\
    \ and the\nsecond and third for fall direction and severity respectively with\
    \ both voting together\nto determine the severity and direction of a fall. Towards\
    \ this end, experiments were\nconducted to determine the most appropriate size\
    \ of the observation window as well as\nsensing modality used. It was found that\
    \ for the proposed setup, a window duration\nof 3 seconds produced the best results\
    \ while using data from both the accelerometer\nand gyroscope. In the third experiment,\
    \ Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer\nand gyroscope) data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset is first windowed into non-overlapping\nsegments of duration 3 seconds.\
    \ After suitable data augmentation for the minority\nclasses, the windowed segments\
    \ are passed to a Convolutional Neural Network for\nfeature extraction. The CNN\
    \ is trained to maximize the unweighted average recall\nfor the validation partition.\
    \ Once the CNN is trained, an XGBoost last stage is used\nfor classification.\
    \ Experiments conducted on the test set achieve an unweighted aver-\nage recall\
    \ of 88% for both the one ADL versus individual falls and individual ADLs\nversus\
    \ fall experiments. In comparison with other techniques used for this task, the\n\
    proposed scheme produces sufficiently better results, thereby demonstrating the\
    \ effi-\ncacy of the proposed method. Lastly, a ConvLSTM network with attention\
    \ has been\nused for detection of falls considering fall direction and severity.\
    \ Using data from the\nSisFall and the K-Fall datasets, two experiments were conducted\
    \ on inertial sensor\ndata. The first considered falls versus ADLs and the other\
    \ combined ADL recognition\nand fall detection. Results for both experiments achieved\
    \ an average recall of more\nthan 90%. The results from the cross-dataset performance\
    \ indicate to the robustness\nof the designed methodology.\nTable 55 presents\
    \ the F-1 scores for the four experiments considering fall detection\nwith direction\
    \ and severity for the SisFall dataset. For experiment 1, only the fall\ndetection\
    \ with direction and severity part has been reported. A progression can be\nobserved\
    \ in the detection of falls wherein an increase of nearly 8.5% in the average\n\
    F1-score was achieved.\n127\nCHAPTER VI\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n1\nConclusion\n\
    This dissertation provided a coverage of the use of Internet of Things towards\
    \ the\ndevelopment of smart communities. While doing so, the main applications\
    \ of ML/DL\nalgorithms as well as optimization algorithms were discussed and mapped.\
    \ Further-\nemore, other technological components of the IoT such as sensing,\
    \ communication,\nsecurity and privacy were also talked about. Lastly, considering\
    \ the case of smart\nhealth, specifically fall detection, experimentation and\
    \ analysis was conducted and\nthe results presented.\nIn this regard, the usage\
    \ of inertial sensor data has been very popular as they do\nnot restrict a users\
    \ movement and are also easy to deploy compared to other methods.\nFour approaches\
    \ that considered fall detection with direction and severity were pre-\nsented.\
    \ In this regard, four experiments were conducted, first was the development\n\
    of a fall only detection system whereas the other three were for a combined ADL\
    \ and\nfall system. For the other three experiments, a hierarchical and two deep\
    \ learning\nbased approaches were tested. The designed methodologies were compared\
    \ to the\nstate of the art and were found to outperform them.\n2\nContribution\n\
    The Internet of Things has spearheaded tremendous change in society by allowing\
    \ for\ncapturing measurements in different facets of our daily lives. With such\
    \ a fundamental\nimpact being made, it is pertinent that researchers commit to\
    \ analyzing the current\npenetration that IoT possesses in city operation and\
    \ also providing impetuses for\nnew and novel application development. This work\
    \ aims to address these needs by\ndiscussing the use and role of the internet\
    \ of things in smart communities.\nThe\ncontribution of the work are as follows:\n\
    1. Provide a coverage of the IoT based smart city ecosystem in terms of the tech-\n\
    nologies utilized. Discussion has been provided about the sensors, communi-\n\
    cation technologies as well as the IoT architectures that enable IoT smart city\n\
    development. Finally a review of the security and privacy issues was also dis-\n\
    cussed.\n2. Present a study of the uses of ML and DL methods for different applications\
    \ of\nsmart cities in an IoT context. To this end, the type of architecture employed\n\
    and the data source type were also covered.\n128\n3. The use of optimization algorithms\
    \ in IoT smart cities has been provided. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is\
    \ the first comprehensive review of optimization\nalgorithms in IoT Smart Cities.\n\
    4. Considering the case of smart health, methodologies have been devised for the\n\
    novel case of fall detection with direction and severity detection. In this respect,\n\
    the performance time, frequency domain and statistical features on inertial\n\
    sensor data has been analyzed and presented.\n5. A combined activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection framework with fall di-\nrection and severity consideration\
    \ has been discussed.\nFour approaches in\nthis regard have been presented, one\
    \ utilizing time-frequency information us-\ning wavelets along with a hierarchical\
    \ classification scheme, third a Convolu-\ntional Neural Network-eXtreme Gradient\
    \ Boost combination and the last being\na ConvLSTM has been proposed. The proposed\
    \ approaches has been shown to\noutperform the state of the art in the field.\n\
    3\nFuture Work\nThe IoT is revolutionizing development of smart city applications.\
    \ There are several\nopportunities. Some of these are listed below:\n• IoT Systems\
    \ for Smart Cities\n– A major research area is in the security and privacy of\
    \ IoT in smart cities in\nterms of encryption techniques, authentication protocols,\
    \ data anonymiza-\ntion techniques and other methods to prevent unvalidated access\
    \ to the IoT\nnetwork. As mentioned before technologies such as blockchain could\
    \ help\nintroduce access tracking and control, secure device discovery, prevention\n\
    of spoofing, data loss while ensuring that end to end encryption is also\nused.\n\
    – Of the data transfer standards developed till now for IoT, many are not\ncompatible\
    \ with each other. Work needs to be carried out in this regard to\nenable intercommunication\
    \ of sensor nodes using different protocols while\nutilizing low power, which\
    \ is imperative for sensor nodes in the network.\n– Another area to work on, is\
    \ the development of efficient storage techniques\nand low power hardware which\
    \ can reduce operational costs. From a de-\nployment perspective, decentralized\
    \ systems have been proposed as the\nbest solutions to increase reliability of\
    \ the application. Techniques such as\nfederated learning allow for decentralized\
    \ DL system deployments.\n• AI/Combinatorial Optimization in IoT Smart Cities\n\
    – The development of data fusion techniques that can make the use of het-\nerogeneous\
    \ data sources easier, intelligent data reduction/feature selection\nmethods to\
    \ ensure that redundant or ’uninteresting’ data is not part of the\n129\nAI development\
    \ pipeline. This will help in a quicker turnaround time as\nwell as improved performance\
    \ of deployments. Current methods need to be\nused as well as new ones be researched\
    \ for making ML and DL algorithms\nmore explainable to suit the various applications\
    \ in a smart city.\n– Hybrid and novel optimization methodologies (for e.g. graywolf\
    \ optimiza-\ntion [493]) which combine characteristics of multiple heuristic schemes\n\
    could potentially outperform singular methodologies.\nThere have been\nseveral\
    \ works which combine multiple optimization techniques.\n– Reinforcement learning\
    \ (RL) has the potential to provide solutions to com-\nbinatorial optimization\
    \ problems as covered in [494]. The idea is to use\nmachine learning and reinforcement\
    \ learning to get rid of human created\nheurists which may lead to optimizations\
    \ towards local optimums. Agents\ncan be trained to search for these heuristics\
    \ to automate the process.\n• Smart Health: Fall detection\n– The addition of\
    \ additional sensor modalities apart from intertial sensor\nmeasurements might\
    \ help improve performance for the worst detected\nclasses from the experiments\
    \ conducted. Various authors have incorpo-\nrated medical or pressure sensors\
    \ in their fall detection systems.\nData\nfrom these sensors can be used together\
    \ as an input to a deep learning\nnetwork. This additional information gathered\
    \ for subjects while under-\ngoing a fall could also describe valuable health\
    \ parameters that can be used\nfor diagnosis or early detection of ailments which\
    \ might be the underlying\ncause of falls.\n– Another work opportunity in the\
    \ data science domain would be the as-\nsessment of this problem considering a\
    \ data centric approach, where, in\ncontrast to a model centric approach where\
    \ the focus is on developing the\nbest model, data centric focuses on working\
    \ with data to improve applica-\ntion performance using systematic procedures\
    \ for labeling, augmentation\netc. Such systematic procedures and qualitative\
    \ data analysis would aid\nin cross-dataset algorithm deployment as well.\n130\n\

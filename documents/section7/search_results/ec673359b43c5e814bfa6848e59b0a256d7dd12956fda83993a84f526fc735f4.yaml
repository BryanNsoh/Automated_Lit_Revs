  description: Homogeneous management zones (HMZs) delineation is important for the
    application of precision agriculture because farm management decisions are based
    on it. Diverse soil chemical characteristics are important for the HMZs delineation.
    However, summarizing several variables into homogeneous zoning while taking into
    account the spatial distribution pattern of soil chemical characteristics is a
    challenge. Addressing this challenge is important to produce HMZs oriented for
    practical use for the farmers. In this work, 17 soil chemical variables were jointly
    analyzed for HMZ delineation by using indicator kriging (IK) to interpolate a
    soil fertility index (SFI). Soil samples were taken from a 4.5 ha area in a quasi-regular
    grid at 0 - 0.20 m depths in November 2019 (66 samples) and May 2021 (40 samples).
    Soil P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Na, H, Mn, Fe, Zn, B, cation exchange capacity, aluminum
    saturation, total organic carbon, base saturation, and organic matter were analyzed.
    In May 2021 the coffee yield was sampled together with the soil. Applying the
    SFI and then interpolating it using IK were effective for summarizing soil chemical
    variables into binary HMZs, showing a zone with higher priority for fertilization
    (therefore, lower general soil fertility) and another zone with low priority for
    fertilization. The summarizing process of several variables into binary HMZ was
    validated by evaluating the boxplots of each variable in each HMZ. Also, higher
    soil fertility areas presented a higher average coffee yield. Results indicated
    that joint use of SFI and IK was adequate to delineate HMZs in terms of summarizing
    soil fertility and separating coffee yield average variability. Delineating management
    zones by using the SFI approach is flexible for relatively limited sampled studies
    (less than one hundred samples) where machine learning and geostatistical methods
    may fail for lack of data.

    1. Introduction According to Barros et al. [12], coffee is one of the most important
    crops for the Brazilian economy. According to the Specialty Coffee Association
    [63] definitions, specialty coffee “refers to the highest quality green coffee
    beans roasted to their greatest flavor potential by true craftspeople and then
    properly brewed to well-established SCAA developed standards.” These standards
    include scoring higher than 80 points on the quality scale and excellent or outstanding
    quality in fragrance, aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, uniformity, balance,
    clean cup, sweetness, and overall better taste [63]. Specialty coffee refers to
    a modern demand for exceptional quality coffee, both farmed and brewed to a significantly
    higher than average standard and is related to the farmers and the brewer in what
    is known as the third wave of coffee [3]. Spatial and temporal variation in soil
    properties and meteorological conditions may affect coffee growth, grain development,
    quality, and yield [5], [68], [26], [28], [70], [27], [11], [8], [7], [44], [6].
    To increase farmers'' profitability and environmental protection, management practices
    need to adapt to variable site conditions [29], [21], following the principles
    of Precision agriculture (PA) of considering its spatial variability [39]. A relevant
    topic on PA is the use of homogeneous management zones (HMZs), which are defined
    as sub-regions of a field and within which the effects on the crop of seasonal
    differences in weather, soil, management, etc. are expected to be uniform [56],
    [18]. HMZs delineation is important for the application of Precision Agriculture
    because farm management decisions are based on it to make decisions on where and
    how much to apply when scheduling fertilization strategies [67]. However, high
    heterogeneity between different soil chemical variables makes summarizing it into
    unique zones a challenge that involves agronomical, mathematical, and computational
    aspects [22]. Ignoring the heterogeneity may result in the under-application or
    over-application of fertilizers at specific sites [30], [16]. Most of the researches
    about HMZs focus on using ordinary kriging to interpolate variables to use them
    as input for clustering such as fuzzy k-means cluster analysis [33], [48], fuzzy
    c-means clustering algorithm [10], [46] or apply a dimensionality reduction tool
    over these interpolated maps as the principal components analysis (PCA) [53],
    [78], [41], [23], [48], spatially-weighting PCA [9], [32], or factorial kriging
    [18], [20], [19]. According to the geostatistical paradigm, any soil or crop attribute
    is considered a random regionalized variable that varies continuously and its
    variation can be described by a spatial covariance function [47]. The kriging-based
    technique can provide the best linear unbiased estimation for the soil properties
    at unsampled locations [38], [25]. However, the use of geostatistical methods
    as the ordinary kriging for interpolating maps is not enough to ensure the delineation
    of HMZs, since it requires summarizing several maps into a single one in a rational
    way in terms of agronomical and practical reasons, what is not always achievable
    by using pure computation methods like clustering [67], [66], [2] Synthesizing
    different chemical variables is a challenge because when adding high variability
    to a model, the interpretation of the model becomes more complex [36]. Addressing
    this challenge leads to a gain of knowledge and applicability of the HMZs maps
    because usually, HMZs have an arbitrary number of zones, decided by the agronomical
    expert together with the farmer [40]. Nevertheless, in PA it may be sensible to
    divide the field into a few practical management zones. To ensure spatial contiguity
    because of spatially continuous variation [52], [64], [22], a probability-based
    approach in a smoothed manner may be used to make the HMZs more useful and applicable
    in the field. In this context, the objective of this study was to propose a novel
    approach named soil fertility index (SFI) for summarizing several spatial variables
    in order to delineate binary homogeneous zones (HMZs). In the case study, we summarized
    17 chemical soil variables in a coffee crop from Southern Minas Gerais over two
    years. Finally, we analyze the relation between HMZs delineation and observed
    coffee yield samples over the last year. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Description
    of the study site and agronomic practices The field experiment was carried out
    at the municipality of Paraguaçu, southern Minas Gerais, Brazil, in a 4.5 ha area
    of coffee cultivation (Coffea arabica L.), cultivar Catucai Amarelo SL 134, transplanted
    in 2012, with spacing of 3.8 m between rows and 0.75 m between plants, totaling
    3500 plants ha−1. Uniform fertilization over the entire coffee plot was done directly
    on the soil in November 2019 and May 2021, by applying around 42, 10, and 42 kg.ha−1
    of N, P, K. The maximum altitude of this area is 894.3 m. The field boundaries
    and grid sampling point were delimited in the studied area using a GPS (Garmin
    GPSmap 62s). The soil of the area was classified as Oxisol according to the Brazilian
    soil classification system [62] and the local climate is characterized as mild,
    tropical high-altitude, with moderate temperatures, hot and rainy summer, classified
    as Cwa according to Köppen''s classification. Fig. 1 shows the study area and
    soil sampling distribution in November 2019 and May 2021 overlapping an image
    taken on April 11 2019 by an original non-interchangeable camera onboard an unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) model DJI Mavic 2 Pro, using an interface software “DJI Ground
    Station Pro”. The mosaic building software was the OpenDroneMap [51] with the
    flight at 40 m height. The image has a ground sample distance of 0.94 cm/pixel−1.

    1. UAV image of the study area with soil sampling points in November 2019 and
    May 2021. 2.2. Soil sampling and laboratory analyses A quasi-regular sampling
    grid was delimited in the studied area with points spaced by grid variable by
    20 m x 10 m, totaling 66 georeferenced sampling points in November 2019, and with
    points spaced by grid variable by 30 m × 10 m, totaling 40 georeferenced sampling
    points in May 2021. In May 2021 coffee yield was sampled together with soil in
    groups of 2 trees around the spatial position of soil samples; for this reason,
    the sampling grid changed. Silva et al. [67] explored how soil samplings for geostatistical
    studies in Brazil are low sampled, in most of the cases less than one hundred
    sample points are collected, even for areas larger than 100 meters. Soil samplings
    were performed by collecting subsamples under the crown projection in the layer
    of 0-20 cm, using a Dutch auger, in each plant composing the sampling point. These
    subsamples were homogenized to form a composite sample representative of the point
    in question and sent to the Laboratory of Soil Analysis. The following soil chemical
    attributes were evaluated: pH (CaCl2 extractor), availability of phosphorus (P)
    (Mehlich), availability of potassium (K) (Mehlich 1 extractor), availability of
    sodium (Na) (Mehlich 1 extractor), availability of iron (Fe) (Mehlich 1 extractor),
    availability of manganese (Mn) (Mehlich 1 extractor), availability of zinc (Zn)
    (Mehlich 1 extractor), availability of boron (B) (wet extractor), exchangeable
    calcium (Ca2+) (1 mol L−1 KCL extractor), exchangeable magnesium (Mg2+) (1 mol
    L−1 KCL extractor), sulfur (S) (phosphate extractor), aluminum saturation (m),
    hydrogen (H), cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (V), and organic
    matter (OM), following the methodology described by Alvarez et al. [4]. 2.3. Indicator
    kriging (IK) Indicator kriging (IK) is based on assigning a binary indicator of
    1 or 0 depending on whether the observation is greater or less than a threshold
    value. Also, IK is a non-parametric approach. Non-parametric geostatistics is
    based on no assumed parametric model of error distribution and makes the modeling
    of uncertainty a priority [35]. This uncertainty is modeled as a probability distribution
    of the variable of interest rather than an estimation error, as in kriging [65].
    For the IK approach, the experimental indicator semivariogram was estimated by
    Eq. (1): (1) where is the estimated semivariogram; and are the observed values
    of the indicator coding at location and ; is the number of observation pairs separated
    by distance h. The indicator semivariogram measures how often two values of Z
    separated by a vector h are on opposite sides of the threshold value . IK requires
    that the attribute values be modified according to a non-linear transformation,
    which is called indicator coding. Lloyd and Atkinson [45] cite that indicator
    kriging can also be calculated from cutoffs of a continuous variable. Statistical
    parameters and geostatistical analyses were performed for all variables, focusing
    on the spatial continuity and dependence of chemical soil properties. 2.4. The
    soil fertility index (SFI) For this work, using a new binary variable F for each
    soil variable observed value is proposed according to Eq. (2): (2) where F is
    the binary indicator of fertility status and Z is the observed values of each
    variable. Using a simple percentage index (Eq. (3)) to convert single indicator
    rules (from Eq. (2)) into the “fertilization needs” index (SFI), the higher this
    percentage is, the higher the number of variables are classified as “higher fertilization
    need”: (3) where is the binary indicator of fertilization needs for each soil
    variable observed value, N is the number of variables. The IK semivariogram will
    be set by applying an arbitrary threshold value ( ) for the SFI. 2.5. Performance
    evaluation Prior to the application of IK algorithms, the SFI observed values
    were checked by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test to verify whether they were
    normally distributed [42]. The evaluation of the performance of IK application
    was performed based on the mean error (ME), mean squared error (MSE), kriged reduced
    mean error (KRME), and kriged reduced mean squared error (KRMSE) generated by
    the cross-validation procedure. The ME (Eq. (4)), MSE (Eq. (5)), KRME (Eq. (6)),
    and KRMSE (Eq. (7)) of the IK estimates were calculated accordingly: (4) (5) (6)
    (7) where is the observed value at location i, is the predicted value at location
    i, N is the number of pairs of observed and predicted values, and s is the standard
    deviation of the observed values. The mean error and kriged reduced mean error
    values near zero indicates a better model prediction performance [66]. As a practical
    rule, the MSE should be less than the variance of the sample values and KRMSE
    should be in the range 1 ± (2 )/N [1]. The spatial dependence ratio was calculated
    as the proportion (percentage) of the nugget effect in relation to the sill (Eq.
    (8)), which, according to [17], can be classified as: (a) strong spatial dependence,
    < 25%; (b) moderate spatial dependence, 25 to 75%; and (c) weak spatial dependence,
    > 75%. (8) where is the nugget effect and is the sill. The nugget effect ( ) is
    a parameter of the semivariogram that shows the non-explained variability, which
    may occur due to measurement errors or non-detected variation by the sampling
    scale. The structural component (C) corresponds to the difference between the
    sill and the nugget effect and represents the spatially structured semivariance
    [17]. The nugget effect was expressed in relation to the sill to simplify the
    comparison of the spatial dependence degree (DD) of the studied variables. 2.6.
    Methodology overview and validation of the HMZ Fig. 2 presents an overview of
    the methodology presented in previous sections. This is a general methodology,
    applicable for different datasets and summarizing needs. A validation strategy
    for applications in coffee crops is presented here. Download : Download high-res

    for summarizing several soil chemical variables and producing binary HMZs. Boxplots
    of the soil chemical variable samples in each HMZ obtained by IK were generated
    to evaluate each variable individually. It could indicate the ability of the methodology
    to summarize and generalize several soil chemical variables without losing local
    information, crucial for the actual application of fertilizers. A boxplot of coffee
    yield in each HMZ in May 2021 was generated to assess the ability of the methodology
    to significantly separate higher from lower yields following the soil fertility.
    Also, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess the significance of
    coffee yield differences in each HMZ. 2.7. Open-source software for research All
    statistical and modeling procedures were performed with the R software [58] using
    the following packages: data.table [24], devtools [77], ggplot2 [76], gstat [55],
    and tidyverse [75]. 3. Results 3.1. Plot characterization The basic statistical
    parameters of all the analyzed variables are presented in Table 1. The higher
    the CV, the more heterogeneous the data set. Soil pH (extracted using CaCl2),
    OM, TOC, CEC, Fe, and H had medium variability, with a coefficient of variation
    (CV) between 10% and 30%. All other soil chemical variables present high variability,
    with a coefficient of variation (CV) higher than 30%. pH values showed a trend
    in soil acidity, presenting an average pH of 4.55. The results referring to the
    variables pH, Ca, and Mg are similar to those reported by Santos et al. [61].
    The result of the variables P, K, CEC, m and OM is similar to that found in [69].

    However, the correlation matrix did not provide a clear interpretation regarding
    soil nutrients concerning yield suggesting the relationships may be non-linear

    all soil chemical variables, the study area can be considered suitable for receiving
    different and site-specific management practices as long the soil samples show
    different chemical behaviors in different spatial positions of the coffee crop.
    As there are heterogeneous variables that generate variability in crop yields,
    the most used techniques in data analysis for developing HMZs are the geomathematical
    and geostatistical models [13]. The 2021 frost caused damage to crops, and one
    of the factors is the low level of K, which is one of the main drivers of frost
    resistance [71], [34]. 3.2. Conversion of soil chemical variables into SFI The
    soil chemical variables were transformed into probability indicators following

    step, the SFI (Eq. (3)) was calculated. Mean, variance, coefficient of variation,
    minimum value, maximum value, K-S value, skewness, and kurtosis of SFI were obtained
    (Table 4) to verify the existence of a central trend and to determine the dispersion
    of the index values. According to [14], these standard statistical parameters
    are useful in evaluating the magnitude of the data dispersion around a central
    tendency value. Based on the values presented in Table 3, the SFI is distributed
    normally, as indicated by the proximity to zero for the skewness and kurtosis
    coefficients [66]. Also, K-S values are inside the range of its critical-values
    (α = 0.34). Data normality does not constitute a requisite in geostatistics [54]
    but it has been noticed empirically as an important property for improving semivariogram
    structuring [14]. According to the preliminary exploratory analysis, it was assumed
    that distributions were symmetric enough and long-tailed. It was also assumed
    a non-occurrence of proportional effect, enabling the development of well-defined
    semivariograms. Table 4. Descriptive statistics for SFI under a coffee crop. Statistical

    kriging (IK) The geostatistical analysis of SFI for interpolation was performed
    by fitting the theoretical semivariogram model to the experimental semivariogram.
    The IK interpolation is based on this model. The main variables of this analysis
    are the nugget effect ( ) and the structural component (C). The range (A) of the
    experimental semivariogram can determine the spatial dependence limit; thus, samples
    that show distances between them higher than the value of the range have random
    distributions and are independent of each other, with no restrictions for the
    use of classic statistics [54]. Anisotropic semivariograms of SFI were simultaneously
    calculated for four directions with 45° (not shown) angular increments and ± 22.5°
    angular tolerance. No sign of relevant anisotropy was found in the observations.
    A relevant anisotropy sign could be found when the sill, range, and nugget are
    different in different directions. The spherical model was best adjusted to the
    experimental semivariogram. Fig. 3 presents the experimental omnidirectional semivariogram
    (points) and the spherical model fitted (curve). Table 5 shows the parameters
    for the theoretical semivariogram model. Here, a DD of almost 48% and 51% were
    achieved in November 2019 and May 2021 respectively, showing that the SFI presented
    moderate spatial dependence. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download

    dependency index from [17]. The range of the semivariogram is the maximum distance
    of the correlated measurements. It can be a sufficient criterion for the selection
    of sampling design in mapping soil properties [73], [15]. In both years, the best
    semivariogram model was found with the same range, confirming the spatial dependency
    with values under a sampling interval lower than 50 m (Table 5). Fig. 4 presents
    the kriged map created based on a semivariogram analysis of SFI. Fig. 4a;c shows
    the estimation of SFI spatial distribution across the coffee crop. In a binary
    approach, two zones can be produced to separate the field into a higher priority
    for agronomical interventions and a lower priority. The HMZs map (Fig. 4b;d) was
    developed by considering pixels with SFI < 0.5 as an area with higher priority
    for fertilization, otherwise, the pixels were considered as an area with lower
    priority for fertilization. Download : Download high-res image (494KB) Download

    and KRMSE were estimated and presented in Table 6. The error terms ME, and KRME
    were close to zero and KRMSE were close to one. It indicates the IK modeling presents
    good results. Table 6. Cross-validation results for IK. Evaluation metric ME MSE

    error; MSE – mean square error; KRME – kriged reduced mean error; KRMSE – kriged
    reduced mean square error; IK – indicator kriging. The remarkable continuity and
    smoothness with increasing distance between samples is of importance. Together
    with the persistence of the range (A) of the semivariogram in both years, this
    shows that HMZs delineation was effective and the main future improvement will
    be sample densification with distances between samples smaller than A. Summing
    up, the maps of IK graphically realize the fusion of the 17 soil chemical variables
    into a single indicator, providing a partition of the field into binary zones
    with a higher fertilization need (SFI < 50%) and a lower need (SFI > 50%). However,
    in order to interpret the variations shown in the previous maps (Fig. 4) in terms
    of actual soil characteristics, which could have an impact on agronomic management,
    a direct comparison between HMZs based on the soil sampling of the shallow 0–0.20-m
    depth was necessary. 3.4. Validation of the HMZs Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show the boxplot
    of each soil chemical variable in each HMZ in November 2019 and May 2021 respectively.
    The soils from both HMZs had coherent soil chemical behaviors. Soils on low priority
    for fertilization zones presented higher values of macronutrients and micronutrients,
    and lower values of H and m. Soils on higher priority for fertilization zones
    effectively presented lower nutrient concentrations and higher values of H and
    m. These coherent results demonstrate that summarizing information by using the
    SFI preserved the spatial information from the soil samples and avoided arbitrary
    choices about the number of HMZs. Incorporating information improves automatization
    and promotes a more focused participation of the farmers in the final decisions
    instead of modeling decisions, making the process less subjective [49]. Download

    ± 1.93 kg.2 trees−1. According to the ANOVA analysis (Table 7), no significant
    difference can be inferred from the coffee yield when comparing the different
    HMZs. The reason is soil fertility cannot explain all the coffee yield variation
    since weather extreme events in Southeast Brazil negatively impacted and devastated
    crops in mid-2021. Table 7. ANOVA (single factor) analysis grouping the coffee

    information into precision agriculture In the present article, the methodology
    is focused on converting the relevant variables on soil fertility based on agronomical
    knowledge. The results of the present methodology (Fig. 2) showed a good summarizing
    ability, which produced HMZs that separated several soil chemical variables into
    two zones and the information was well preserved as shown by the boxplots (Fig.
    5, Fig. 6). This separability between HMZs can be seen in the boxplots, as the
    boxplot in the high-priority fertilization zone shows lower values for the soil
    chemical variables, i.e. these are the zones that concentrate the lowest fertility.
    Different soil variables can indicate different aspects of soil fertility. According
    to [60], pH is an indicator of the biological-physical-chemical condition of the
    soil. An excessively acidic soil (pH very low) or excessively alkaline soil (pH
    very high) is less favorable for agriculture because there will be less oxygen,
    less organic matter, less water retention and infiltration, and more toxic ions.
    High soil acidity can generate high levels of Al3+ and Ca while Mg deficiency
    in the plant, affects the full development of plants and the achievement of high
    yields since the low pH reduces the availability of some nutrients and increases
    the toxic effect of aluminum on plants [74]. The macronutrients Ca and Al are
    constituents of the minerals and organic matter of the substrate where the plant
    develops and are also found dissolved in the soil solution [60]. On the other
    hand, the values of m are the percentage of soluble aluminum in relation to the
    exchangeable base (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) and aluminum content in the soil CEC. Therefore,
    it determines the alitic or aluminaic characteristics of the soil. V represents
    the percentage of CEC occupied by bases (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+) about the exchange
    capacity determined at pH 7. At pH 7 soils were considered 100% base-saturated
    and had zero base saturation at pH 4. Soils with V equal to or greater than 50%
    are denominated eutrophic soils (tending to present higher fertility). Soil with
    base saturation values less than 50% are denominated dystrophic soils (tending
    to present lower fertility). Base saturation (V) can indicate the amount of cations,
    such as Ca, Mg, and K, and identify if the soil is acidic at a level that is harmful
    to the crop. The calculation of Al saturation (m) is considered the most correct
    form to evaluate Al toxicity in the soil. The soil OM contributes to an increase
    in soil CEC which can serve to retain and increase the reserve of soil cations
    and improve soil structure physics and soil water relations. Soils with higher
    OM content are associated with increased population and diversity of microorganisms
    [50]. It is important to underline that the coffee yield showed a numerical difference
    (although not statistically significant) on the different HMZs. The coffee yield
    is an independent variable in the present methodology, different from the methods
    based on PCA and clustering. Here, the indicators are based on individual cutoffs
    and agronomic knowledge, and the variables used in the modeling are not necessarily
    chosen based on their correlation with coffee yield. This methodology can be particularly
    useful in situations where resources are scarce for large samples, and agronomic
    knowledge can be used to compensate for the smaller number of samples. 4.2. Applicability
    of HMZs from SFI and IK By identifying fields where the relationship between soil
    and yields is fundamentally different from others, unique management areas could
    be delineated. Usually, HMZs are delineated from a single variable, such as altitude
    [40] or soil apparent electrical conductivity [56], [64]. However, multivariate
    approaches for delineating HMZs are needed for a more general and comprehensive
    application of PA [52], [49], [22]. Also, making the HMZ a brief spatial summary
    of several characteristics from the field is a challenge because both spatial
    and intrinsic heterogeneity make the HMZs too general for real applications [22].
    Reduce the scope of the HMZs into a group of variables like the soil fertility,
    or weather drivers, yield factor, etc, could make multivariate approaches easier
    to understand in the field and more appropriate for the practical use by the farmers
    in the field. In the multivariate approach, the most commonly used methodologies
    are the joint use of dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and clustering
    techniques such as c-means or k-means. When applying a PCA, the research objective
    usually is to find the key loading factors to explain a main independent factor.
    For example, in [56] soil properties and nutrient concentrations were compared
    with apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) using principal components (PC)-stepwise
    regression and ANOVA. The dimensionality reduction in this case means using fewer
    variables to explain another one with regression modeling. In a second moment,
    clustering is applied to group the principal components into groups (the HMZs).
    Our results suggest that the binary HMZs are well suited for use in precision
    agriculture where the assessment of within-field variation is assumed as a basis
    for variable-rate application (VRT) of agronomic inputs. For farming by HMZs to
    be effective, there should be a strong and persistent relationship between the
    HMZs, delineated with soil and crop properties, and the spatial patterns in yield
    over time. The area of most intensive effort within PA has been the site-specific
    management of nutrients (SSNM) guided for HMZs, generally via variable rate technology
    (VRT). This concept of site-specific management is intuitively appealing [57],
    however, its adoption has been slower than expected because it involves social,
    agronomic, economic, and technological changes [59]. A smoothed zoning as presented
    here, without fragmented spatial distribution, is highly desirable, because usually
    high accuracy classifications and clustering methods produce unrealistic maps
    for site-specific management, with isolated pixels and corners which are ignored
    in real applications. Also, a smoothed zoning doesn''t need to be redesigned by
    hand at the end of modeling, just needs a threshold to separate different zones.
    A binary approach was adopted, but to produce more zones, the maps of IK (Fig.
    4a;c) of the SFI index can be split into more than one cutoff value, producing
    more than two zones. In this work, two years of data were used separately from
    coffee plots under uniform management. For this reason, in practice, HMZs obtained
    from May 2021 would be actually used in a PA strategy. 4.3. Temporal instability
    of HMZs and nutrient mobility on soil The temporal stability of the HMZs is another
    important issue in site-specific agriculture, which might require the extension
    of the current methodology for new experiments with the same sampling design over
    different periods. The instability of spatial variability is due to the mobility
    of soil nutrients, which are transferred from year to year, and nutrient transport
    rates depend on local conditions [43], [72]. The most mobile nutrients are usually
    phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and nitrogen (N) [72]. For example, [43] found
    that P transport rates were heterogeneous due to local topographic and chemical
    variations in the soil. Checking the plot characterization shown in Table 1, it
    is clear the relevant difference of the chemical soil variables along the time.
    The mobility of P can be detected by the decreasing of CV from 95.66% to 55.12%,
    while for S the CV increased from 51.48% to 99.23%, and Ca, Na, K, and V had a
    CV difference between 2019 and 2021 around 15-20%. On the other hand, OM, m, and
    TOC are highly sensible to tillage and fertilization (using single rate application
    for this case). In Table 1 it is shown that the CV for m increased from 63.03%
    to 99.43%, for OM the CV decreased from 38% to 12.21%, and for TOC from 22% to
    11.77%. Consequently, the HMZs can change from year to year. Knowing the mobility
    of nutrients in the soil is intrinsic to the dynamics of the soil-water-plant
    interface [72] makes the PA paradigm even more important, as it demonstrates the
    need for periodic mapping, and consequently the possibility of rethinking the
    recommendations made and changing strategies, as well as detecting more complex
    problems that will require further studies. 4.4. Current limitations and future
    research Several questions remain to be answered before farmers adopt a site-specific
    approach for orchard management, such as: Are patterns of yield variation stable
    enough from year to year, to be predictable? Do yield patterns of variation match
    homogeneous zones? Are there economic and environmental benefits for targeted
    management? Several authors have shown the inconsistency over time of spatial
    variability patterns of important crop and soil properties such as yield, protein
    content, and plant available N [56], [49], [22], [2]. A common finding is that
    temporal variability is generally much higher than spatial variability and the
    definition of stable low- and high-yielding potential zones is very uncertain
    [14], [54], [67], [59], [72]. In this context, a stable configuration of HMZs
    is highly desirable but not always achievable. The combined analysis of MN, SSC,
    and VR results confirms the recommendation of the field partition into two classes.
    However, other scenarios and combinations can be tested. Gavioli et al. [31] assessed
    the field partition into 2, 3, and 4 HMZs using a PCA-based method and found the
    split into 2 zones obtained smoother boundaries with the best multidimensional
    variance reduction. Córdoba et al. [22] and Peralta and Costa [56] also considered
    two classes HMZs as the best choice because is a easier field operations choice.
    Future research might focus on new experiments with the same sampling design along
    different periods, looking for more evidence about the robustness of the methodology
    to ensure the assurance of the farmers in its application. Farmers can focus on
    managing the variation within coffee complete cycle (around 1 year), and a better
    strategy might be to combine the use of HMZs with crop-based in-season remote
    sensing. The latter information could be incorporated efficiently into a decision
    support system software aimed at supporting farmers in their agricultural management.
    Also, in future research this methodology will be compared with others, for example
    with those based on PCA and clustering. 5. Conclusions In this work, a simple
    percentage index was proposed for summarizing several soil chemical variables
    into a single index and then interpolating it by using IK to produce binary HMZ
    for PA purposes. On more practical grounds, we found that the joint use of SFI
    and IK was especially useful when the available data were limited and smoothed
    HMZs were easier to communicate to the farmers. In light of the experimental results,
    it is important to underline that the main objective of the paper was to propose
    a methodology to summarize different soil chemical variables in order to produce
    a partition of the field into HMZs characterized by similarities in soil chemical
    properties. The challenge that was faced was to prove that using a simple indicator
    approach can produce HMZs preserving the main soil chemical characteristics. Also,
    indirectly it was possible to separate the coffee yield in the different HMZs.
    From this perspective, the results were quite positive and promising. The concluding
    remarks from this study are: 1. SFI was able to summarize several soil chemical
    variables into a single index; 2. The IK technique was efficient in delineating
    binary management zones in Oxisols under coffee cultivation by interpolating the
    soil fertility index; 3. Boxplots of each soil chemical variable showed coherent
    behaviors into each HMZ, demonstrating that no agronomical information were lost
    after summarizing data using SFI; 4. Boxplot of coffee yield in each HMZ showed
    the soil fertility deficit drove a decrease on coffee yield. 5. This methodology
    can be particularly useful in situations where resources are scarce for large
    samples, and agronomic knowledge can be used to compensate for the smaller number
    of samples. CRediT authorship contribution statement César de Oliveira Ferreira

  description: Close-range remote sensing techniques employing multispectral sensors
    on unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer both advantages and drawbacks in comparison
    to traditional remote sensing using satellite-mounted sensors. Close-range remote
    sensing techniques have been increasingly used in the field of precision agriculture.
    Planning the flight, including optimal flight altitudes, can enhance both geometric
    and temporal resolution, facilitating on-demand flights and the selection of the
    most suitable time of day for various applications. However, the main drawbacks
    stem from the lower quality of the sensors being used compared to satellites.
    Close-range sensors can capture spectral responses of plants from multiple viewpoints,
    mitigating satellite remote sensing challenges, such as atmospheric interference,
    while intensifying issues such as bidirectional reflectance distribution function
    (BRDF) effects due to diverse observation angles and morphological variances associated
    with flight altitude. This paper introduces a methodology for achieving high-quality
    vegetation indices under varied observation conditions, enhancing reflectance
    by selectively utilizing well-geometry vegetation pixels, while considering factors
    such as hotspot, occultation, and BRDF effects. A non-parametric ANOVA analysis
    demonstrates significant statistical differences between the proposed methodology
    and the commercial photogrammetric software AgiSoft Metashape, in a case study
    of a vineyard in Fuente-Alamo (Albacete, Spain). The BRDF model is expected to
    substantially improve vegetation index calculations in comparison to the methodologies
    used in satellite remote sensing and those used in close-range remote sensing.

    Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Close-range remote sensing techniques employing
    multispectral sensors on unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer both advantages
    and drawbacks in comparison to traditional remote sensing using satellite-mounted
    sensors. Close-range remote sensing techniques have been increasingly used in
    the field of precision agriculture. Planning the flight, including optimal flight
    altitudes, can enhance both geometric and temporal resolution, facilitating on-demand
    flights and the selection of the most suitable time of day for various applications.
    However, the main drawbacks stem from the lower quality of the sensors being used
    compared to satellites. Close-range sensors can capture spectral responses of
    plants from multiple viewpoints, mitigating satellite remote sensing challenges,
    such as atmospheric interference, while intensifying issues such as bidirectional
    reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects due to diverse observation angles
    and morphological variances associated with flight altitude. This paper introduces
    a methodology for achieving high-quality vegetation indices under varied observation
    conditions, enhancing reflectance by selectively utilizing well-geometry vegetation
    pixels, while considering factors such as hotspot, occultation, and BRDF effects.
    A non-parametric ANOVA analysis demonstrates significant statistical differences
    between the proposed methodology and the commercial photogrammetric software AgiSoft
    Metashape, in a case study of a vineyard in Fuente-Alamo (Albacete, Spain). The
    BRDF model is expected to substantially improve vegetation index calculations
    in comparison to the methodologies used in satellite remote sensing and those
    used in close-range remote sensing. Keywords: radiometric correction; bidirectional

    The use of multispectral technology on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for
    precision agriculture has experienced an exponential growth due to recent advances
    in sensor technology. These sensors have traditionally been mounted on satellite
    platforms and can be used for calculating vegetation indices, such as the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), for agricultural applications [1,2,3]. Nevertheless,
    UAVs offer a higher spatial resolution, temporal flexibility for image acquisition,
    and reduced influence of atmosphere effects (with atmosphere profiles of no more
    than 120 m). However, directly shifting satellite-based remote sensing methodologies
    to UAVs can produce radiometric differences between equivalent satellite-derived
    products [4,5]. Mainly, this occurs due to the presence of shadows inside the
    crop and because the same part of the surface is observed with different relative
    geometries of the two elements involved: illumination to surface and surface to
    sensor. Specifically, low flight height, large FoV (field of view) sensors, and
    the overlapping of different scenes produce a diverse observation angle for each
    point on the surface, and the sun’s position varies significantly throughout the
    flight. Another typical variation that we can expect during the flight is lighting,
    which depends on the time of day and the latitude. Last but not least, in the
    orthorectification procedure, multiple pixels from different viewing geometries
    are averaged together, creating overlapping images. These properties result in
    the dynamism of the observed reflectance. BRDF describes the way the surface reflects
    light in different directions, based on the incident angle of the incoming light
    and the viewing angle of the sensor; it characterizes the variability in surface
    reflectance due to changing geometrical conditions. As a result of the surface
    BRDF, the observed reflectance of a location will change based on the position
    of the sensor. This complicates the process of deriving reflectance values from
    remote sensing data and can affect the generation of vegetation indices when compared
    to satellite remote sensing. An example of this is found in the application of
    machine learning techniques to UAV-based remote sensing data processing [6,7,8,9,10].
    These techniques demand multispectral or even hyperspectral bands, which require
    a high radiometric quality. On the other hand, by being able to apply close-range
    photogrammetry techniques, an approximation of the plant envelope in 3D can be
    obtained, which makes it possible to determine occultations and discriminate which
    parts of a plant are observed in each image, with an accurate relative observation
    geometry with respect to both the sun and the sensor, minimizing the possible
    presence of shadows, which alter radiometry. By analysing the differences in multispectral
    geomatic produced by UAVs, we can determine the following: Photogrammetric techniques
    pay special attention to the geometric quality of the final product [11], relegating
    radiometric quality. Therefore, reflectance orthomosaics, as derived from geomatic
    products frequently used to generate vegetation indices, can incorporate radiometric
    errors. GSD with centimetre resolution introduces BRDF effects due to the position
    of the sensor and changes in illumination angles during the flight. The pixel
    size of most satellite images exceeds one metre and is usually several orders
    of magnitude coarser in resolution compared to that of a UAV image. Specifically,
    the pixel of a remote sensing product from public space missions has a spatial
    resolution of several meters (Sentinel-2A/2B has a 10 m–60 m spatial resolution
    in both the visible and the NIR bands, while Landsat-8/9 imagery has both a 15
    m panchromatic and a 30 m multi-spectral spatial resolution), and the collected
    data are the aggregation of the plant canopy and soil. In contrast, UAVs can achieve
    spatial resolutions even higher than 0.05 m. The high spatial resolution, together
    with the large number of points of view from which the canopy is acquired when
    using UAVs, leads us to consider the convenience of choosing image pixels from
    the plant that are better aligned with a geometry of choice (e.g., a satellite
    sensor or a consistent geometry for temporal studies), involving making decisions
    such as: Only using data from the canopy (not from the ground or trunk/branch)
    using spatial and radiometric criteria, discriminated by height from the DSM with
    DTM as a reference [12], and approximating NDVI using the classical method [13].
    Ignoring parts of the crop that are hidden in an image due to the geometry of
    the crop (obtained from a DSM generated as a satellite photogrammetric product)
    and image orientation. Avoiding image areas that may be affected by the hotspot
    effect [14] and correcting the images by using the directional property of reflectance.
    Only using image pixels acquired from a favourable geometry or optimal perspective
    with respect to the canopy and the sun position, discriminated using the image
    orientation and the sun position at the time of image acquisition. The BRDF effect
    is a classic issue in remote sensing and its correction has given rise to different
    modelling proposals that are not usually included in the standard process for
    generating products prepared for ARD analysis (analysis ready data) due to its
    practical difficulty [15]. The hotspot effect is also a classic drawback in remote
    sensing and its correction is included in some BRDF models. A hotspot is a circular
    bright area within the image that is produced due to a direct alignment between
    the sun, the camera, and the position on the ground [14]. In other words, it is
    placed at the projected solar position, opposite the specular reflection position.
    The probability of a hotspot effect is also increased in UAV flights due to the
    wide angle of view of the optics and the interest in flying over plant covers
    at times when the sun is higher over the horizon because of shadow reduction and
    an increase in photosynthetic activity. Moreover, the effect of shady areas on
    the canopy is also corrected in some BRDF models. There are BRDF models that can
    be applied to near-range remote sensing from UAVs, so called Kernel-driven models,
    such as the empirical Walthall model and the non-linear RPV model [16], which
    improve ARD products by correcting the reflectance in each band. In the last two
    years, several articles have been published addressing the BRDF effect from UAV
    imagery [17,18]. However, they do not rigorously consider the mathematical model
    of photogrammetry, the concealment effects based on the knowledge of the canopy
    geometry through the DSM, the elimination of areas in the images affected by the
    hotspot effect, and the consideration of optimal perspectives for removing the
    leaf pixels in which the vegetation cover is not directly exposed by the sun.
    Given the relevance of these issues, this study focuses on addressing a radiometric
    improvement of multispectral data captured through UAV platforms. In this context,
    this paper presents a comparative analysis of the red (R), green (G), blue (B),
    red edge (RE), and near infrared (NIR) reflectance bands, as well as the NDVI
    index, obtained through two different approaches: Utilizing the conventional photogrammetric
    computer tool AgiSoft Metashape. Implementing a novel methodology that addresses
    the aforementioned problems. - Introducing corrections for the BDRF effect per
    ortho-image by precisely computing the external orientation of the images and
    the relative orientation of the object to the acquisition point and to the sun.
    - Using the information derived from individual ortho-images rather than geomatic
    products obtained through photogrammetric processes, while eliminating the radiometric
    distortion that these processes may incorporate. - Determining the optimal pixel
    values from the best ortho-image considering factors such as lighting, possible
    occultations, and the relative position within the image. This paper employs a
    comparative analysis of variance (ANOVA) in order to evaluate the differences
    and advantages provided by the proposed methodology in comparison to conventional
    methods for the acquisition and processing of radiometric data. ANOVA is a robust
    statistical methodology to assess variances in datasets, discern the disparities
    between group means, and explore the sources of variability [19]. This technique
    quantifies the variation within and between groups to infer whether observed differences
    are attributable to random chance or systematic effects. Many articles on the
    use of ANOVA analysis in agronomy can be found in the literature [20,21,22,23].
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Setup The field experiment was conducted
    in a commercial vineyard located in Fuente-Alamo, Albacete, Spain (38.43043300
    N, 1.28012600 W; elevation 820 m above sea level) during the 2020 growing season
    (Figure 1). The climate is defined as typical Mediterranean semiarid [24], with
    hot and dry summers and daily maximum summer temperatures close to 40 °C, mainly
    in July and August. The trial was carried out in a 0.6-hectare subplot of a 6.5-hectare
    commercial vineyard. The soil was sandy loam (with more than 55% sand), with a
    variable depth of up to 90 cm. The soil had 1.2% organic matter, 47.7% active
    CaCO3, an electrical conductivity of 0.4 dS/m, a pH of 8.9, and a bulk density
    of 1.2 g/cm3. The vineyard rows were oriented north–south. The inter-row was regularly
    tilled and the soil under the vine rows was kept weed-free through the use of
    herbicides. Figure 1. Study area: vineyard located in Fuente Alamo (Albacete,
    Spain). 2.2. Data Acquisition The photogrammetric sensor used is a MicaSense RedEdge®
    camera (MicaSense Inc., Seattle, WA, USA [25]). It is one of the most efficient
    low-cost multispectral sensors onboard a UAV. It is formed of five dedicated sensors
    with a narrow-band filters for detecting data, respectively, in the B, G, R, RE,
    and NIR wavelengths. It has a global shutter to avoid problems in data processing
    regarding dark current and UAV movements during the flight [26]. The camera specifications
    are detailed in Table 1, where FWHM is the full width at half maximum. The MicaSense
    RedEdge camera works with the downwelling light sensor (DLS), using the same spectral
    bands, which are cosine-corrected light sensors that help improve the radiometric
    quality of the image data by providing a direct way of measuring reflectance without
    using a reference target. Light sensors are the most effective at correcting for
    global changes in lighting conditions. Table 1. Technical specifications of the
    MicaSense RedEdge sensor (MicaSense Inc., Seattle, WA, USA). The resolution of
    the photogrammetric sensor was 1280 × 960, with a pixel size of 3.75 × 3.75 µm.
    The focal length was fixed at 5.5 mm. The total coverage area was 0.14 km2. The
    sensor was mounted on a quadcopter Carabo S3 (Icom3D, Asturias, Spain) (Figure
    2). The flight planning was performed by using UAV-GeoFlip Geomatic Flight Planning
    software [27]. The flight was planned and executed to establish a minimum forward
    overlap of 60% and a minimum side overlap of 20%, with a GSD of 5.09 cm/pix for
    the DSM (digital surface model). The flight was performed near solar noon (between
    11:00 and 12:00 solar time) to reduce the grapevine shadow on the images, with
    an altitude of 80 m to reach the required GSD. A total of 8 GCPs (ground control
    points) were located (Figure 3) to be easily detected from the UAV images and
    topographically measured via GNSS-RTK for georeferencing. The locations and georeferenced
    errors are indicated in Table 2. In addition, 4 reflectance panels were placed
    in the study field, and they were captured at the beginning and at the end of
    the flight for radiometric calibration purposes. The flight was performed during
    clear sky conditions. Finally, a total of 2685 images were acquired (537 images
    per band) by the MicaSense RedEdge® camera. Figure 2. UAV used in this study (Carabo
    S3). Figure 3. Ground control points (GCPs) located in the case study. Table 2.
    Locations and geo-referencing errors of the GCPs. 2.3. Reference Commercial Multispectral
    Software (AgiSoft Metashape) A standard photogrammetric pipeline was used to process
    the multispectral UAV imagery, applying camera calibration, image orientation
    and a dense point cloud extraction process. The AgiSoft Metashape software package
    (AgiSoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia [11]) was used for that purpose. As an alignment
    parameter, a limit of 4000 tie points was used. Moreover, 8 GCP measurements were
    utilized for recovering the camera’s interior parameters and correcting for any
    block deformation or systematic error to be able to absolutely geo-reference and
    geometrically calibrate the images. The geo-referencing RMSE of the GCPs was 1.04
    cm. The overall reprojection error was 0.44 pixels, based on the bundle-adjustment
    error assessment report. The tie point projection errors were considered to eliminate
    poor-quality points. Moreover, a noise filter was applied during the point cloud
    generation to improve the quality of the ortho-mosaic. An aggressive filtering
    was used to preserve as much detail as possible over the canopy structure. Finally,
    the DSM and the ortho-mosaic were created by ortho-rectifying the image pixels
    with a 6 cm GSD. In order to simulate the radiant attenuation for vignetting correction,
    a distance to the surface model was performed per pixel. Moreover, the DTM resolution
    was 20.3 cm/pix (DSM GSD fitting to the ground) and the compound coordinate reference
    system was ETRS89/UTM zone 30N (EPSG 25830, 5782). Orthometric heights refer to
    the tide gauge in Alicante. Reflectance ortho-mosaics were computed using the
    internal calibration of AgiSoft Metashape software, with the calibration panel
    pictures and the DLS [28]. 2.4. BRDF Correction The proposed procedure aims to
    calculate the best possible reflectance value per band. A classical property to
    consider when disturbing image radiometry is the bidirectional reflectance from
    the ground surface (BRDF). The most prominent issue in aerial images occurs at
    high solar elevation, where the hotspot can occur. The Walthall model [29] describes
    the directional reflectance of visible and NIR radiation as a function of zenith
    and azimuth view angles and solar azimuth angle for several canopies and bare
    soil surfaces. The access to the directional domain allows normalizing the anisotropy
    or incorporating the directional signature as a source of additional information.
    The Walthall model [29] is a simple linear empirical model, working under clear
    sky conditions. It uses a three-term parametrization (p0, p1, p2), following Equation
    (1): 𝑅 𝑊  ( 𝜃 𝑣 ,𝜙;𝜆)= 𝑝 0 (𝜆) 𝜃 2 𝑣 + 𝑝 1 (𝜆) 𝜃 𝑣 cos𝜙+ 𝑝 2 (𝜆) (1) where RW
    is the observed surface reflectance in each band, W, measured by the camera after
    calibration with standard panels and the downwelling light sensor (DLS) under
    𝜃 𝑣 as an observation zenith angle, with a relative azimuth angle 𝜙 , and wavelength
    𝜆 ; p0, p1 and p2 are constants; 𝑝 0 (𝜆) 𝜃 2 𝑣 and 𝑝 1 (𝜆) 𝜃 𝑣 cos𝜙 are terms
    that have to be eliminated so that there is no BRDF effect; 𝑝 2 (𝜆) is reflectance
    at nadir view and illumination. The rigorous photogrammetric model provided allows
    the ability to compute for each pixel the angles of the equation, and p0, p1,
    and p2 can be estimated by least squares adjustment. The 𝜃 2 𝑣 term describes
    the concave shape of the BRDF associated with the gap effect. The term 𝜃 𝑣 cos𝜙
    term provides a linear dependency between reflectance and the 𝜃 𝑣 angle, describing
    the BRDF anisotropy and the increase in reflectance due to backscatter. This second
    term, therefore, basically collects the back-shadow effect. The Walthall model
    is one of the most robust models at different scales on a wide variety of surfaces
    [30]. However, this model does not reproduce the reciprocity principle. The steps
    to apply the proposed methodology are described below (Figure 4). Figure 4. Proposed
    methodology, which includes BRDF correction. The final outcome of this methodology
    provides crop-optimised reflectivities using all pixels of all images, but these
    results are not satisfactory for the different criteria considered. From these
    corrected reflectivities, any index could be calculated, with NDVI being the index
    computed for this paper because it is one of the most widely used in precision
    agriculture applications. 2.4.1. Pre-Processing First, a photogrammetry project
    in QGIS should be created, and the data imported. Pre-processing inputs are automatically
    obtained with a reference software from structure from motion (SfM), AgiSoft Metashape
    Professional Edition photogrammetry software (already explained in Section 2.3).
    With this step, the entire mathematical model is already set up. It consists of
    creating the database, assigning the CRS (coordinate reference system), importing
    the markers.xml file from the project (which includes camera calibration and image
    orientations), and importing the path to the project’s raw images. Later on, the
    EXIF information of the raw images is obtained. It includes the acquisition time
    to calculate the sun data (i.e., solar angles) and parameters for the reflectance
    conversion model, according to the MicaSense manual. After that, the DSM and DTM
    are produced with AgiSoft Metashape Professional Edition photogrammetry software
    (already explained in Section 2.3). Plant angles, heights, and hidden parts are
    automatically defined. This step allows us to compute the image footprints on
    the DSM to get the framework for the orthoimages. 2.4.2. Radiometric Processing
    For each image, the sun position (zenith and azimuth) and hotspots are computed,
    following the methodology published by [14]. The instant of observation is considered
    as a variable that comes from the EXIF. The hotspot effect is produced due to
    a direct alignment between the sun, the camera, and the position on the ground;
    that is, the point on the ground opposite the sun in relation to the camera. The
    hotspot produces a change of brightness in this point of the image and its surroundings.
    These regions will be excluded in the last step, in which the reflectivity statistics
    by band and plant are calculated. Next, the digital numbers (DNs) are converted
    to reflectances. For this case, the mathematical model used can be found in MicaSense
    Image Processing Tutorials [31]. The software computes the radiometric corrections
    using the white reference panel and the irradiance sensor (DLS). Three different
    options have been contemplated: using only one or several measurements, with temporal
    interpolation, or with the closest value in time. This can be achieved by using
    camera calibration parameters (such as AgiSoft Metashape software), using only
    DLS information, or adopting a mixed solution that combines calibration parameters
    and DLS data (which is the one used for the current work). If the panel is used,
    the calibration process can be computed at the beginning of the flight or, if
    the panel is captured at the beginning and the end of the flight, the calibration
    process interpolates the correction for each image capture event. To obtain reflectance
    images, first, the conversion factors per band from the panel images are retrieved.
    For this, panel coordinates from GPS EXIF together with solar zenith and azimuths
    are computed. The conversion factors are retrieved (gain and offset) from the
    mean digital value of the panel, corrected for vignetting. However, if DLS information
    is employed, conversion factors are retrieved from the MicaSense model through
    solar position, horizontal irradiance, and direct or diffuse radiation data (depending
    on the sensor). In both pipelines, reflectance images are computed using the conversion
    factor, interpolating as a function of time. After this, the orthoimages are computed
    per band with a GSD similar to the DSM exported from Metashape. The hidden pixels
    calculated from the DSM are left without data because, in the projective ray in
    which they are included, there is another point from the DSM which is closer to
    the optical centre. Moreover, raster files are saved with distances and angles
    (zenith and azimuth) from each pixel projected on the plant to the projection
    centre of the camera position with centimetre accuracy. Lastly, NDVI ortho-images
    are generated per band. 2.4.3. Optimized Reflectances from the BRDF Correction
    Model and Derived NDVI For each plant, we start from the planimetric definition
    of the planting frame. Thereby, for each DSM pixel above the DTM at a height higher
    than the established threshold (0.2 m in this case), an algorithm is used to obtain
    the optimized reflectance per band. To achieve this, a sample of reflectances
    and auxiliary values for the BRDF model (azimuth and elevation of the sun and
    sensor) are computed. To obtain this sample, image pixels that do not meet at
    least one of the following filter criteria are eliminated: Is in a hotspot zone.
    Is hidden using the DSM. The normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI) in
    the orthoimage from the previous step is outside the chosen range (between 0.2
    and 1.0 in this case). Consequently, the vegetation is segmented by the NDVI filter
    calculated with 3-decimal places. The horizontal angle between the plant formed
    by the direction between the sun and the sensor is outside the established range
    (from −90 to 90 degrees in this case). With these samples, the BRDF model is adjusted
    to obtain corrected reflectances. The reflectance per plant is computed using
    a multi-view statistical analysis. It involves an iterative least squares (LS)
    solution with an observation removal process, guided by a threshold in the residuals.
    Moreover, the adjusted reflectance solution is considered valid based on the standard
    deviation using a generalized method of moments (GMM) and statistical limits.
    The reflectance of those plants with insufficient information is avoided. The
    NDVI is obtained from the optimized reflectances. 2.5. Statistical Analysis In
    this study, two datasets obtained using different methodologies are available.
    On the one hand, we have the reflectance data obtained by applying the BRDF correction,
    as explained in the previous sections, and the reflectance data provided by the
    commercial software Metashape. For simplicity, we will refer to these methods
    as M_BRDF and Metashape, respectively. The NDVI values, calculated from the R
    and NIR bands, are available for both methods. In order to identify statistically
    significant differences between the M_BRDF and Metashape methodologies, an ANOVA,
    or analysis of variance test, was used. Figure 5 shows schematically the workflow
    carried out for the ANOVA analysis, which we explain in detail below. Figure 5.
    Statistical analysis workflow. In a nutshell, ANOVA splits the total variance
    in the data into two components: variance between groups and variance within groups.
    The ratio of these variances is used to calculate an F-statistic, which, when
    compared to a critical value, helps to determine the statistical significance
    of group differences. The null hypothesis establishes that there is no significant
    difference between the group means. If the p-value is less than the critical value
    (usually 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and it can be concluded that there
    is a significant difference between the means [32,33]. Predominantly, ANOVA can
    be applied following three different approaches: one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA,
    and factorial ANOVA. The one-way ANOVA methodology finds its utility when there
    exists a sole categorical independent variable, while two-way ANOVA extends its
    purview to encompass the dynamics of two independent variables. The third approach
    is achieved through factorial ANOVA, which permits the meticulous scrutiny of
    multiple independent variables and their mutual interactions. On the other hand,
    ANOVA can be approached from both parametric and non-parametric perspectives.
    Parametric ANOVA assumes that the data follow a normal distribution and that the
    variances between groups are approximately equal (i.e., homoscedasticity). If
    the data deviate from these assumptions, non-parametric ANOVA can be used. A normality
    test, such as the Shapiro–Wilk test, will determine which type of ANOVA is required.
    In addition, a prior analytical and graphical study of the data is often helpful
    for understanding the nature of the data. The parametric approach uses the F-statistic
    to assess the presence of significant variance differences between groups, while
    the Mann–Whitney U test serves for assessing the presence of statistically significant
    differences between two independent groups in those cases where the data deviate
    from the assumptions of normal distribution and equality of variances. This non-parametric
    test involves ranking the data, calculating separate U statistics for each group,
    and determining the minimum U statistic as the critical value. Thus, through hypothesis
    testing, the Mann–Whitney U test evaluates whether this test statistic significantly
    differs from what would be expected by chance [34,35]. Various non-parametric
    tests can be used to statistically compare more than two independent data sets.
    Taking into account the nature of our data, the most appropriate non-parametric
    test is the Kruskal–Wallis H test. It is actually an extension of the Mann–Whitney
    U test, which is used to compare two independent groups. The Kruskal–Wallis H
    test is particularly useful when the data do not meet the assumptions of parametric
    tests [36,37]. However, it is common to encounter outliers when applying this
    type of statistical test. To this end, an additional check based on the Yuen t-test
    can be applied to the reflectance and NDVI data, since this test is more robust
    against the presence of outliers [38,39]. The drawback of ANOVA is that although
    the results obtained show that there are significant differences between groups,
    the test itself does not specify which groups exhibit these differences. In this
    sense, post hoc tests, such as the Bonferroni test, help to identify pairwise
    differences among groups, providing a more detailed and actionable understanding
    of the data [40]. Therefore, it is advisable to perform the post hoc analysis
    when the ANOVA results are significant. 3. Experimental Results As stated in the
    statistical analysis subsection, it is necessary to study the data beforehand,
    as the ANOVA to be applied will depend on the nature of the data. 3.1. Reflectance
    Analysis per Band and NDVI Three assumptions must be met in order to use a parametric
    ANOVA; that is, independence of de data, assumption of normality, and homogeneity
    of variance (i.e., homoscedasticity). The independence condition is fulfilled,
    since the methodologies used to obtain the reflectance are independent. Therefore,
    a normality test must be applied to the data, which will determine whether a parametric
    or non-parametric ANOVA should be used since it is a critical condition of the
    ANOVA test. However, it is useful to carry out a prior graphical and analytical
    study of the main statistics of the data. Table 3 shows the main statistics, taking
    into account the reflectances obtained for each of the bands (R, red; G, green;
    B, blue; RE, red edge; NIR, near infrared), according to the method used. Figure
    6 shows the histogram for each band, separated by method. The theoretical normal
    distribution is also included with the histogram plot. On the other hand, Table
    4. shows the statistics for the NDVI values calculated for both methods, while
    Figure 7 shows their histogram, including the theoretical normal distribution.

    The preliminary analysis of the data, particularly the histograms, shows evidence
    of non-normality, especially in the reflectance (Figure 6) and NDVI values obtained
    by applying the M_BRDF correction (Figure 7). Although at first sight, the data
    obtained using Metashape software seem to fit the normal distribution better,
    it is interesting to note that they tend to be more homogeneous than those obtained
    using the M_BRDF correction (Figure 6a vs. Figure 6b). This homogeneity is related
    to the methodology used in Metashape itself, which will be discussed later, in
    Section 4. On the other hand, the data obtained via M_BRDF, especially the NDVI,
    provide more adjusted reflectance values and a greater diversity and range due
    to the complex corrections taken into account in the methodology. Thus, it is
    also clear that the data obtained using the two methods are statistically different,
    as shown by their means and standard deviations (Table 3 and Table 4). This intuitive
    conclusion will be confirmed by the application of the ANOVA test. After the preliminary
    graphical analysis, we apply the Shapiro–Wilk normality test to the data. Table
    5 shows the results for the W statistic and the p-value obtained. In addition,
    Figure 8 shows the graphical QQ plots for visual inspection. Further details of
    the results of the normality tests applied per method and band are given in Table
    A1, together with the corresponding QQ plots in Figure A1 in Appendix A. Figure
    8. QQ Plots: (a) M_BRDF reflectances; (b) M_BRDF NDVI; (c) Metashape reflectances;
    (d) Metashape NDVI. Table 5. Shapiro–Wilk normality test results. The p-values
    obtained are all less than 0.05, so the null hypothesis is rejected, confirming
    that the data deviate from the normal distribution (Table 5). The same conclusion
    can be reached by looking closely at the QQ plots (Figure 8). Since the results
    show clear evidence that the data deviate from the normal distribution, a non-parametric
    ANOVA test should be applied. Once it is confirmed that the assumption of normality
    of the data is not met, the non-parametric statistical tests described in Section
    2.5 are applied to perform the ANOVA analysis (i.e., the Mann–Whitney U test,
    the Kruskal–Wallis H test, and the Yuen t-test). The results obtained for these
    tests are shown in Table 6. Table 6. Non-parametric ANOVA statistical tests. Since
    the p-values obtained for the U-test are less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is
    rejected, so we can state that there are significant differences between the means
    of the groups compared, i.e., between the reflectance and NDVI data obtained via
    the M_BRDF and Metashape methods (Table 6). This difference between the groups
    can be clearly seen in Figure 9, where the box plots for reflectance and NDVI
    are shown. Furthermore, the same conclusion can be reached by analysing the p-values
    obtained via the H-test for the same datasets, since they are lower than the critical
    value of 0.05, thus rejecting the null hypothesis. Figure 9. Box plot graph comparing
    methodologies: (a) reflectance data; (b) NDVI data. It is interesting to note,
    however, that the H-test shows that there are also significant differences when
    comparing reflectance data by spectral band. Again, these differences can be clearly
    seen in Figure 10, where the box plot is shown, taking into account the spectral
    bands for both methods. Figure 10. Box plot graph comparing the reflectance data
    per band for each method. Finally, since the non-parametric ANOVA results obtained
    are significant, a Bonferroni post hoc test was applied in order to determine
    which specific bands differed significantly. The results show p-values equal to
    0 for all possible band combinations, confirming that each of the bands is significantly
    different for both methodologies. Further details are given in Table A2 in Appendix
    A. It should be noted that the non-parametric ANOVA analysis for this study was
    carried out using a proprietary script programmed in Python. Both the study data
    and the code are published on GitHub [41]. 3.2. Spectral Band and NDVI Differences
    The non-parametric ANOVA established a statistically significant distinction between
    the M_BRDF and Metashape methods. In this section, we undertake a comprehensive
    examination of the disparities in reflectance and normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI), with a specific emphasis on their absolute magnitudes, irrespective
    of the sign of the differences. Our analysis combines both analytical and graphical
    approaches. Table 7 provides essential statistical metrics characterizing the
    absolute differences in reflectance, with consideration given to the spectral
    bands. Additionally, the absolute NDVI differences originating from both datasets
    are detailed. Furthermore, Figure 11 visually depicts the distribution of absolute
    differences for reflectance and the NDVI, enabling a nuanced understanding of
    the extent of variation, decoupled from directional influence. Figure 11. Histogram
    of difference between Metashape and M_BRDF data: (a) reflectance band data; (b)
    NDVI data. Table 7. Reflectance band and NDVI absolute differences for each method.
    The analytical and graphical data analyses unambiguously demonstrate remarkable
    differences in the reflectance data derived from the two methodologies. Notably,
    these differences are most pronounced within the R-band, where a substantial proportion,
    approximately 75%, of the dataset exhibit absolute differences of up to 0.125.
    However, the most substantial discrepancies emerge in the computation of the NDVI,
    with an average absolute difference approaching 0.3—a significantly high value
    in the context of this index. Furthermore, about 75% of the data show absolute
    differences of about 0.38, underlining the magnitude of the differences observed
    in the NDVI calculations. Spatial Analysis of the Differences The distribution
    of the differences between the reflectances derived from the commercial software
    AgiSoft Metashape (ρMETA) and from the proposed methodology (ρBRDF) are represented
    in Figure 12. The colours signify the value of these differences. The red band
    shows the largest difference between methodologies among all bands, while considerable
    differences can be found in the green, blue, and red edge bands as well. The NIR
    band is the least affected by the proposed methodology. Figure 12. Spatial distribution
    of the absolute value of the differences between reflectances derived from the
    proposed methodology (ρBRDF) and from the commercial software AgiSoft Metashape
    (ρMETA) per band (R = red, G = green, B = blue, RE = red edge and NIR = near infrared).
    As expected, the reflectance differences between the two methods used, especially
    for the red band, have a clear effect on the values calculated for NDVI, as can
    be seen in Figure 13. Figure 13. Spatial distribution of the absolute differences
    in NDVI values, obtained from the reflectances derived from the proposed methodology
    (ρBRDF) and the commercial software AgiSoft Metashape (ρMETA). 4. Discussion The
    increase in spatial resolution in remote sensing imagery, particularly in the
    case of UAV data, can lead to higher variance in observed reflectance values.
    This is attributed to the BRDF effect, which becomes more pronounced due to the
    greater variability in sun-surface-view geometry at higher spatial resolutions
    [8], specifically, this involves being able to see soil, sunlit, and shaded canopy
    elements individually. One of the contributing factors to this inconsistency is
    because the UAV views at a wider range of observation angles compared to the satellite.
    The orientation and angle of the leaves can significantly affect the reflectance
    values observed from different viewing angles and the sun’s position, leading
    to increased variability in the imagery. In addition, topographic effects have
    also been identified as a potential source of inconsistency in M_BRDF models.
    The topography of the study area can lead to variations in reflectance values
    based on the slope, aspect, and shadowing effects caused by the landscape and
    plant morphology. The proposed methodological workflow provides a set of images
    with reflectances per band, according to the sensor manufacturer’s criteria, but
    taking into account hotspots, areas affected by shadows and BRDF effects. Furthermore,
    after the non-parametric ANOVA analysis, we can state that the reflectance products
    obtained using our M_BRDF correction model show statistically significant differences
    compared to common approaches. In this case, the reflectance values were provided
    by AgiSoft Metashape software. The Kruskal–Wallis H-test shows significant differences
    between the two methods across each spectral band (Table 6), as also observed
    in the Bonferroni post hoc analysis (Table A2, Appendix A). These differences
    can also be clearly seen in the box plot in Figure 10. In addition, a detailed
    analysis of the magnitude of the differences between the reflectance data for
    the spectral bands considered in both methods shows that although the differences
    in the NIR band are not as large as those in the others, there are high value
    differences in the R band in particular, but there are also significant differences
    in the B, G and RE bands (Table 7). Given that the average difference in NDVI
    between the two methods is around 0.3, and that 75% of the data reach values up
    to 0.38 (Table 7), we can state that the NDVI is greatly affected by the M_BRDF
    correction when we compare both methodologies, since it is the R band, together
    with the NIR band, that is used to calculate this spectral index. The proposed
    methodology involves the exclusive selection of the plant reflectance, with the
    removal of shadows and soil. As a result, the proposed methodology demonstrates
    superior homogeneity and more consistent values compared to Metashape for use
    in plant-only analysis. Metashape’s results include values that even hover around
    0.2, which do not align with a healthy crop, as indicated in this study. The histogram
    shown in Figure 7 indicates that the NDVI values obtained from the reflectance
    data provided by Metashape tend to be homogeneous compared to those obtained using
    the M_BRDF correction model. This is due to the Metashape workflow, especially
    in orthomosaic acquisition, which uses colour normalization algorithms that incorporate
    geometry, altering the final reflectance values per band. On the other hand, it
    has to be taken into account that our methodology includes complex, high-level
    corrections that obtain reflectance values in a wider range, as can be clearly
    observed when comparing the histograms of reflectance values per band between
    the two methodologies (Figure 6a vs. Figure 6b). It is clear, therefore, that
    the proposed methodology, including the M_BRDF correction model, provides more
    consistent values temporally, and therefore, values for the NDVI that are more
    in line with our object of interest, the plant. Finally, it is worth noting that
    there is an increase in the disparity of reflectance between both methodologies
    in the western area of the crop. The affected vines in this area are situated
    in a small valley (Figure 14), where terrain roughness and the presence of surrounding
    shadows significantly contribute to the enhancement of the BRDF effect, which,
    in turn, results in a noticeable influence on the recorded reflectance. The intrinsic
    relationship between topography and BRDF has been previously documented in the
    literature [42,43,44,45,46,47]. In this context, the western slope stands as an
    illustrative case of how the interaction between terrain morphology and environmental
    conditions can modulate the behaviour of the BRDF and, consequently, the reflectance
    in the study area. These findings underscore the importance of considering terrain
    roughness and topography when analysing and modelling BRDF behaviour in applications
    related to UAV-based remote sensing. Figure 14. Spatial distribution of the absolute
    values of the NDVI differences between both methods, integrating the topography
    through the DTM. 5. Conclusions The need for quantitative, lightweight remote
    sensing applications using UAVs has been growing in environmental measurement
    and monitoring applications. In this study, a comprehensive processing workflow
    was developed for radiometric imaging that utilizes the MicaSense multispectral
    sensor onboard a UAV. The goal was to accurately and quantitatively assess agricultural
    fields, making the approach suitable for a wide range of agricultural monitoring
    applications, including crop health assessment, nutrient management, irrigation
    scheduling, and pest/disease detection. Our results affirm the need to consider
    BRDF effects in understanding and mitigating brightness variations in UAV images
    caused by illumination and sensor geometries. Indeed, the fine-spatial scale characteristic
    of UAV imagery exacerbates the BRDF effect, necessitating its consideration in
    image processing and analysis. Past research has proposed the use of the Walthall
    BRDF model to address solar-viewing geometry variation. However, in more complex
    environments, such as those with varying topography and plant leaf angles, additional
    factors should be taken into account to accurately resolve solar-surface-viewing
    geometry variation [8]. UAV-captured high-precision information helps agronomists
    evaluate the response of the plant (only the plant) to different factors. It is
    known that the spectral response in the plant is dependent on the pigments that
    the plant contains. These pigments are also affected by the biotic and abiotic
    factors that affect the plants in their environment. Thus, evaluating vegetation
    indices at the leaf level represents a total improvement in the evaluation of
    plant status that can only be achieved with high-precision geomatic products such
    as those obtained with the use of drones. However, the response at leaf level
    to stress caused by biotic and abiotic factors is not too high, and any error
    in the measurement should be avoided. With the proposed methodology, we contribute
    to the decrease in error in the retrieval of plant-based indices. The proposed
    methodology provides a better estimation of plant-only reflectances, translating
    into the consequent improvement in derived indices such as NDVI. This results
    in more accurate analysis-ready data for mapping and monitoring environmental
    changes in agronomical contexts. It does not produce an increase in field work.
    Current computer technology facilitates the application of the methodology in
    a very simple way and with reasonable processing times, using a computer program
    developed with open-source tools. Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.H.-L.

    PDF 1 Introduction Food security is a crucial global problem affecting billions
    of people worldwide. Food security is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organisation
    of the United Nations (FAO) as “when all people, at all times, have physical,
    social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their
    dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (Cudjoe et
    al. 2021). Despite tremendous improvements in recent decades, food security remains
    a key concern, especially in developing nations and among vulnerable people (Keesstra
    et al. 2016). The world’s population continues to rise, placing enormous strain
    on agricultural systems to produce enough food to feed everyone effectively. Weather
    patterns that are erratic, severe occurrences, and changing climatic circumstances
    significantly influence agricultural production, resulting in crop failures, lower
    yields, and food shortages (Nathan and Joel Uche 2023; Oseni and Masarirambi 2011).
    Soil erosion, deforestation, and degradation of arable land endanger agricultural
    production and restrict cultivable land availability. Water shortage in many locations
    impedes irrigation and farming practices, resulting in water stress and lower
    crop yields. Much of the world’s food supply is lost or squandered at different
    points throughout the supply chain, from production to consumption, aggravating
    food poverty (Khanna, 2018). Sustainable agriculture is an important strategy
    for addressing global food security concerns while minimizing negative environmental
    consequences. Sustainable agriculture seeks to increase production, protect natural
    resources, promote ecological balance, and assure farmers’ economic viability
    (Herzberg et al. 2022). It entails putting practices that promote long-term food
    production in place while neither depleting resources nor damaging the environment
    (Abubakar 2021). The AIoT has emerged as a disruptive technology with enormous
    promise to revolutionise the agriculture industry in recent years. The AIoT is
    a network of networked devices with sensors, software, and data analytics capabilities
    that gather and share data via the Internet. AIoT may be used in agriculture to
    monitor and manage different elements of farming, such as crop health, irrigation,
    pest control, and animal management (Saad et al. 2023). Furthermore, recision
    farming is made possible by AIoT-enabled sensors and data analytics, which allow
    farmers to monitor and optimise inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides,
    resulting in higher efficiency and decreased resource waste (Giuffrida et al.
    2022). Weather forecasting and monitoring powered by AIoT assist farmers in adapting
    to changing weather patterns, mitigating risks, and making educated crop management
    choices. AIoT enables farmers to monitor their crops and animals from afar remotely,
    increasing output and minimising the requirement for personal presence (Kemmoe
    et al. 2022). AIoT applications in the food supply chain increase traceability,
    minimize food loss, and improve overall supply chain efficiency. AIoT technologies
    improve efficiency and solve problems in agriculture and food supply systems.
    Food security and sustainable agriculture need precision farming, smart irrigation,
    livestock monitoring, supply chain traceability, climate resilience, data-driven
    decision-making, and sustainable resource management (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022).
    The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015
    to address worldwide social, economic, and environmental challenges. These 17
    global objectives provide a comprehensive framework for promoting sustainable
    development and improving people’s well-being. They cover various issues such
    as poverty eradication, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water,
    sanitation, affordable energy, decent work, industry, innovation, climate action,
    life below water, life on land, peace and justice, and strong institutions (Kalu
    et al. 2021). The SDGs emphasize collaboration among governments, businesses,
    civil society, and individuals to achieve sustainable development. By 2030, the
    SDGs aim to end poverty, hunger, inequality, access to quality education and healthcare,
    promote sustainable economic growth, combat climate change, and protect biodiversity
    (Erin and Bamigboye 2022). Implementing the SDGs requires political commitment,
    adequate resources, and effective policies. Governments play a crucial role in
    setting national priorities, aligning policies with the SDGs, and mobilizing financial
    resources. Businesses are encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, invest in
    innovation, and contribute to the achievement of the goals (Khan et al. 2022).
    In conclusion, the SDGs represent a global roadmap for creating a more sustainable
    and equitable future for all, addressing the root causes of poverty, inequality,
    and environmental degradation. Achieving the SDGs requires collective efforts
    and a shared commitment to leaving no one behind. The study’s research goal is
    to look at the role of AIoT in promoting sustainable agriculture and tackling
    food security issues. The research will examine the possible advantages and drawbacks
    of AIoT applications in agriculture, such as crop management, water conservation,
    animal monitoring, and supply chain management. The study will thoroughly examine
    current literature, case studies, and real-world deployments of AIoT solutions
    in agriculture. It will concentrate on the influence of AIoT on agricultural production,
    resource efficiency, and climate change resistance. In addition, the research
    will look at the problems and hurdles to AIoT adoption in agriculture, policy
    implications, and future trends. Overall, this study aims to improve knowledge
    of how AIoT may play an important role in promoting sustainable agriculture and
    maintaining food security in a fast-changing world. The study seeks to give significant
    insights for policymakers, academics, and stakeholders to make informed choices
    and build strategies for sustainable agricultural growth by highlighting the prospects
    and difficulties of AIoT adoption in agriculture. This chapter is arranged into
    nine different sections. In Sect. 2, the related works are discussed in detail.
    The research on AIoT applications in sustainable agriculture is presented in detail
    in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides a discussion on AIoT in food supply chain management.
    Section 5 provides the challenges and barriers. Section 6 discusses the policy
    and regulatory considerations. Section 7 provides the Case Studies and real-world
    implementations as well as future trends and innovations are provided in Sect.
    8. Finally, Sect. 9 concludes the study. 2 Literature Review Climate change, water
    shortages, and the need for effective resource management are just a few of the
    many obstacles that agriculture must overcome to ensure the world''s food supply.
    The AIoT has emerged as a potent tool to overcome these obstacles and improve
    agriculture’s long-term viability (Praveen et al. 2021). AIoT systems use sensors,
    data analytics, and real-time connectivity to monitor and optimize agricultural
    operations for higher yields, lower resource waste, and safer food supplies (Nwankwoala
    and Okujagu 2021). This section examines current AIoT technologies for sustainable
    agriculture and food security. Using sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature,
    nutrient levels, and crop health is at the heart of precision farming, a prominent
    use in agriculture. More informed choices about watering, fertilizing, and controlling
    pests may be made by farmers thanks to this information (Sohel et al. 2022). With
    real-time data from weather stations and soil moisture sensors, AIoT-enabled smart
    irrigation systems can fine-tune watering schedules to meet the precise needs
    of individual crops. These methods help farmers save water and irrigate their
    crops more efficiently, especially in arid areas (Farooq et al. 2022). AIoT devices
    with sensors and GPS may track cattle and monitor their well-being and habits.
    Better livestock management and greater food production result from using livestock
    monitoring tools that assist farmers in identifying health problems early, optimizing
    feeding patterns and enhancing breeding practices (Eze et al. 2022). Due to AIoT-based
    supply chain traceability systems, food goods may be tracked and monitored in
    real-time through the supply chain. These methods improve visibility and tracking,
    safeguarding against food fraud and keeping consumers secure (Farooq et al. 2022;
    Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Weather patterns, temperature, and humidity data are
    gathered via AIoT-based weather stations and environmental sensors, which are
    then used for climate monitoring and prediction (Al-otaibi 2022). This information
    is utilized to foresee the effects of climate change and harsh weather on crops,
    allowing farmers to make necessary preparations in advance. To keep tabs on pest
    populations in farms, AIoT systems have integrated pest monitoring sensors and
    data analytics. As stated by (Zhao et al. 2022), pests may be managed more sustainably
    and with less reliance on chemical pesticides if their presence is identified
    sufficiently soon. Automated and optimized nutrition and water management is achieved
    via integrating AIoT technology into aquaponics and hydroponics systems. These
    methods allow for year-round farming, reduce water use, and boost the long-term
    viability of fish and vegetable harvests (Yoon 2020). Data on crop health and
    stress may be gathered in real-time via remote sensing technologies like satellites
    and drones fitted with AIoT sensors. This data aids farmers in making early diagnoses
    of disease and nutritional deficits, which leads to more focused treatments and
    fewer crop failures (Abdullahi et al. 2022). AIoT technologies use automated traps,
    drones, and AI for smart pest control (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). This allows for
    precise monitoring and managing of pest populations without harming the ecosystem.
    Indicators of soil health, such as pH, nutrient content, and organic matter, are
    tracked using AIoT sensors and devices. Producing crops sustainably and effectively
    requires this information to implement precision agricultural practices and enhance
    soil fertility (Mishra and Pandya 2021). As a result of optimizing resource utilization,
    increasing productivity, and raising the efficiency of food supply chains, AIoT
    technologies have the potential to revolutionize agriculture and solve food security
    concerns. Current AIoT solutions show how important technology is to attaining
    sustainable agriculture and meeting the needs of a rising global population. 3
    AIoT Applications in Sustainable Agriculture Global food security depends on agriculture,
    yet climate change, water shortages, and resource management pose concerns. The
    AIoT can solve these problems and improve agriculture’s sustainability. AIoT systems
    monitor and optimize agricultural processes using sensors, data analytics, and
    real-time connectivity, improving productivity, resource efficiency, and food
    security (Dibia and Nwaigwe 2017; Herzberg et al. 2022). For precision farming,
    AIoT sensors capture soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and crop health
    data. This data may help farmers optimize irrigation, fertilization, and insect
    management for better resource utilization and crop yields. Smart irrigation systems
    optimize watering schedules based on crop water needs using real-time data from
    weather stations and soil moisture sensors (Ambayea et al. 2022). Livestock monitoring
    systems enhance livestock management and food production by detecting health concerns
    early, optimizing feeding patterns, and improving breeding practices. Supply chain
    traceability systems reduce food fraud and ensure food safety by tracking and
    monitoring food goods in real-time (Oberlack et al. 2021). Farmers can modify
    their practices and safeguard their from bad weather using AIoT-based weather
    stations and environmental sensors. Data analytics and integrated pest monitoring
    devices reduce the demand for chemical pesticides and promote eco-friendly pest
    control (Awofeso and Odeyemi 2021). Aquaponics and hydroponics systems automate
    and optimise nutrition and water management, allowing year-round growing, decreased
    water use, and sustainable fish and vegetable production. Farmers need remote
    sensing for crop health and stress to identify illnesses and nutrient shortages
    early and cure them for maximum development and output (Norton 2016). Farmers
    may plan planting, irrigation, and pest management using weather forecasts and
    predictive analytics. Smart farming and precision agriculture improve crop quality,
    food safety, efficiency, sustainability, data-driven decision-making, labour,
    and time (Ambayea et al. 2022; Voora et al. 2022). However, early investment expenditures,
    data privacy and security issues, and farmers’ technical knowledge are obstacles.
    Smart farming may be vital to global food security and environmental sustainability
    as technology advances. Thus, components of precision agriculture are illustrated
    in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 The components of precision agriculture (Herzberg et al. 2022)
    Full size image 3.1 Smart Irrigation and Water Management Smart irrigation is
    a cutting-edge technique for managing water in agriculture. It allows farmers
    to save water without sacrificing yield. Smart irrigation systems reduce water
    waste while supplying water reliably to crops depending on individual demands,
    local weather, and other data collected from various sensors and AIoT devices
    (Raghuvanshi et al. 2022). Agriculture uses a lot of water, so finding ways to
    save and reuse that water is essential. Smart irrigation systems determine when
    and how much water should be supplied to crops by monitoring soil moisture and
    evapotranspiration rates (Zhang, Xu et al. 2022b). Smart agricultural practices,
    such as drip irrigation and controlled watering systems, are increasingly used
    to reduce water waste from evaporation and runoff. This technology allows farmers
    to minimize labor by remotely controlling irrigation cycles and maintaining a
    steady water supply. Smart irrigation helps conserve water, grow crops with the
    same amount of water, save money, be more eco-friendly, and be less vulnerable
    to climate change (Neupane et al. 2022; Ning and Liu 2015). However, barriers
    to wider adoption exist, including the need for costly upfront investments, specialized
    knowledge, and consistent access to the Internet (Arubayi 2023). Finally, smart
    irrigation and water management provide a game-changing strategy for environmentally
    responsible farming by helping farmers reduce water waste, maximize crop output,
    and safeguard natural resources. Farmers can help ensure food security in the
    face of climate change by adopting smart irrigation practices like drip irrigation
    and automated watering systems (Merem et al. 2018). Smart irrigation in agriculture
    is predicted to play a crucial role in attaining sustainable water management
    and guaranteeing the resilience of agricultural systems as technology develops.
    3.2 Livestock Management and Health Monitoring Livestock management is an important
    part of contemporary agriculture since it ensures the health and production of
    livestock animals (Ali and Choi 2020). AIoT technology is helping to improve livestock
    management and health monitoring. Farmers may monitor their animals’ health, behaviour,
    and position in real-time by employing wearable sensors and tracking devices,
    allowing for early diagnosis of health concerns or irregularities (Okonofua et
    al. 2021). AIoT-enabled monitoring devices give significant data into cattle movement
    and behaviour, assisting farmers in managing grazing patterns and preventing straying.
    Behavioral monitoring may detect indicators of discomfort or changes in eating
    patterns, resulting in better animal welfare (Kochovski and Stankovski 2018).
    One of the most important advantages of AIoT in livestock management is illness
    diagnosis and prevention facilitated by AIoT. AIoT devices may notify farmers
    of any sickness or stress symptoms by monitoring vital signs and physiological
    factors, limiting disease transmission and significant economic losses (Khan and
    Ahmad 2022). Furthermore, AIoT-based data analytics may aid in identifying illness
    patterns and trends, hence contributing to the creation of effective disease preventive
    programmes. AIoT technology increases animal welfare, productivity, labour costs,
    resource management efficiency, illness control, and biosecurity. However, there
    are hurdles to using AIoT in livestock management, such as initial expenses for
    AIoT devices and infrastructure, dependable connection in remote locations, and
    data privacy and security issues (Abdullahi et al. 2022). Finally, AIoT technology
    has revolutionized livestock management and health monitoring in agriculture,
    allowing farmers to carefully monitor the health and behavior of their animals,
    resulting in enhanced animal welfare and production. AIoT-enabled early disease
    detection and prevention improve biosecurity measures and minimize illness-related
    economic losses (Mishra and Pandya 2021; Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). To ensure the
    well-being of animals and farmers, the AIoT integration in livestock management
    will be crucial as technology develops, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Livestock
    management and health monitoring (Darem et al. 2022) Full size image 4 AIoT in
    Food Supply Chain Management The AIoT has changed the logistics and supply chain
    management industries by enabling real-time monitoring and tracing of items in
    transit. Sensors and gadgets enabled by the are built into things, containers,
    and vehicles to track and record data such as location, temperature, and humidity
    (Praveen et al. 2021). This real-time information allows businesses to streamline
    their supply chains and reduce wasted time and money. Due to AIoT-enabled smart
    logistics, companies can improve inventory management, save operating costs, and
    boost customer satisfaction with on-time, precise delivery (Kamble et al. 2019).
    Perishable items’ quality and safety, including fresh fruit, medicines, and vaccinations,
    depend on effective cold chain management and food preservation (Zhong et al.
    2015). Cold chain management powered by the helps keep goods fresh and secure
    across the supply chain, which helps cut down on food waste and boosts food security.
    Assuring the quality and security of goods via sensors and monitoring is crucial.
    Sensors enabled by the can check food for pH, moisture, and pollutants to ensure
    it''s safe and up to standards (Nozari et al. 2022; Rehman Khan et al. 2022).
    The AIoT makes supply chain visibility, transparency, efficiency, cost savings,
    product quality and safety improvements, sustainability, and environmental impact
    possible (Ezenwa 2019). Data privacy and security, standardization and interoperability
    of AIoT systems, and dependable and continuous connection are just a few hurdles
    that need to be cleared before widespread adoption can occur in supply chain and
    food management (Bertin et al. 2022). AIoT-enabled smart logistics and supply
    chain monitoring, cold chain management, and quality and safety assurance are
    revolutionizing how organizations operate and ensuring that supply chain operations
    are efficient and sustainable (Zakeri et al. 2022). Companies can improve logistics,
    protect the freshness of perishable items, and guarantee their products’ safety
    by using real-time data and insights (Zhong et al. 2015). To keep up with the
    demands of the current business environment and ensure the delivery of high-quality
    goods to customers, supply chain management must increasingly use AIoT technologies,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 AIoT in food supply chain management (Zhong et
    al. 2015) Full size image 5 Challenges and Barriers The technological difficulty
    of establishing and maintaining AIoT systems is a major obstacle to their widespread
    use in agriculture. Integrating sensors, devices, and networking technologies
    may be difficult, particularly for small-scale farmers in rural places with little
    infrastructure (Lu 2018). AIoT applications demand real-time data transfer, which
    might be difficult in rural areas. Data security and privacy are crucial as AIoT
    devices create massive volumes of data. Farmers must secure their crop production,
    soil health, and market data against unauthorized access and cyberattacks (Abdullahi
    et al. 2022). Data encryption, access limits, and secure communication protocols
    protect farmers’ vital data. Small-scale farmers and underdeveloped areas may
    struggle to use AIoT technology due to their high upfront costs. AIoT devices,
    sensors, and connection solutions are costly, making it hard for resource-constrained
    farmers to use them (Zimba 2022). Technical support and maintenance may also strain
    finances. Lack of awareness and understanding of AIoT, limited access to technical
    competence, and cultural opposition to new technology may hinder small-scale farmers
    in developing nations. These areas may additionally struggle to embrace AIoT technologies
    due to language and digital literacy issues (Al Qartah 2020). 5.1 Solution and
    Mitigation Technical constraints, data security concerns, financial issues, and
    acceptance hurdles might prevent the broad adoption of AIoT in agriculture, especially
    in small farms and developing nations. Stakeholders, including governments, commercial
    enterprises, and non-profits, must work together to solve these problems (Hammi
    et al. 2022). By promoting accessible and user-friendly AIoT solutions, guaranteeing
    data security, giving financial incentives, and helping farmers with capacity
    development and training, the agricultural industry can maximize AIoT’s potential
    for sustainable and efficient farming (Ouechtati et al. 2021). Simplified and
    User-Friendly Solutions: Small-scale farmers may use AIoT solutions that are user-friendly
    and cost-effective. Plug-and-play AIoT devices and straightforward interfaces
    may help farmers set up and employ AIoT technology (Jayashankar et al. 2018).
    Public–Private Partnerships: Government agencies, private firms, and NGOs may
    work together to deliver AIoT solutions in poor countries. Joint projects may
    overcome financial and technical constraints and give farmers with training and
    assistance (Hammi et al. 2022). Data Security: Encryption and authentication help
    secure farmers’ data from cyberattacks. To protect data privacy, farmers must
    be educated about data security (Bertin et al. 2022). Subsidies and Incentives:
    Government subsidies or financial incentives for adopting AIoT technology might
    encourage small-scale farmers to invest in these solutions. Implementation costs
    may be reduced via cost-sharing and tax incentives. Training and capacity development
    may improve farmers’ digital literacy and technical abilities. Extension programmes
    and training may assist farmers in grasping AIoT devices (Hammi et al. 2022).
    6 Policy and Regulatory Considerations Agriculture might become more sustainable,
    efficient, and productive using AIoT technology. Through different programmes,
    governments worldwide have supported AIoT adoption. These include financial support,
    research and development funding, capacity building and training, regulatory frameworks,
    public–private partnerships, testbeds and demonstration farms, digital infrastructure
    development, data analytics, and decision support, market linkages and e-commerce
    platforms, and policy advocacy (Lu 2018). These projects have helped farmers use
    AIoT to solve agricultural problems, boost production, and adopt sustainable and
    efficient farming methods. International partnerships and standards are critical
    to developing and accepting AIoT-based food security solutions since governments,
    organisations, and stakeholders must work together to solve the agricultural and
    food sectors’ complex problems (Shahinzadeh et al. 2019). The widespread use of
    AIoT technology in agriculture has led to sustainable, efficient, and more productive
    farming. Governments worldwide have been actively pushing and supporting the adoption
    of AIoT due to its critical importance (Fang et al. 2012). Governments provide
    financial assistance, grants, and subsidies to encourage farmers and agricultural
    enterprises to invest in AIoT technology. These rebates reduce the out-of-pocket
    expense of implementing an AIoT system or device, making them more feasible for
    farms of all sizes. Government funding for research and development (R&D) programs
    that provide specialized AIoT solutions for agriculture, such as precision agriculture,
    remote sensing, and livestock monitoring, has led to the developing cutting-edge
    tools and methods (Zhang, Li et al. 2022a). Governments host training programs
    and seminars to improve farmers’ and agricultural employees’ familiarity with
    digital literacy and technical abilities. They set up legislative frameworks that
    make it easier for farmers to use AIoT. Governments create standards for AIoT
    devices and data privacy rules to guarantee the safety of AIoT solutions and protect
    farmers’ data. They work with businesses, universities, and NGOs to promote the
    use of AIoT in farming via public–private partnerships, resulting in increased
    opportunities for information exchange, access to cutting-edge technology, and
    the creation of industry-specific AIoT solutions (Kazmi and Sodangi 2022). Governments
    also invest in constructing and updating digital infrastructure, such as high-speed
    internet access and mobile networks, to guarantee uninterrupted data transfer
    and communication between farm AIoT devices. They provide data analytics and decision
    support systems that use information gathered from AIoT devices to advise farmers
    on improving their operations (Yin et al. 2022). Governments also develop e-commerce
    platforms that link farmers with customers or purchasers, improving market connections
    and maintaining produce quality and traceability throughout the supply chain.
    Governments advocate for policies that encourage the use of AIoT in farming, such
    as lowering taxes, fostering cross-institutional research partnerships, and lobbying
    for more lenient rules (Godager et al. 2021). The extensive use of AIoT technology
    in agriculture can be attributed to various factors, including financial incentives,
    R&D funding, capacity building, regulatory frameworks, public–private partnerships,
    and the growth of digital infrastructure (Yang et al. 2021). Sharing knowledge
    and best practices helps advance AIoT-based food security solutions. International
    cooperation and standards are essential for food security. Sharing knowledge,
    harmonizing standards, aggregating data, fostering research and development, aligning
    policies, pooling resources, and building capacities can help countries and organisations
    develop cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions for the global agriculture
    and food sectors (Kumar et al. 2020). These agreements allow data exchange and
    aggregation, improving AIoT-based food security solutions. Cross-border research
    and development projects bring together professionals from various nations to
    solve food security issues, resulting in cutting-edge technology and novel solutions
    (Yin et al. 2022). Funding and resource allocation, capacity development and training,
    scaling up successful projects, and addressing data privacy and security issues
    are all examples of ways in which policy alignment and collaboration may be fostered.
    Thus, AIoT-based food security solutions can only be fully realised via international
    cooperation and standardization. Sharing information, harmonizing standards, gathering
    data, promoting research and development, aligning policies, pooling resources,
    and creating skills may help governments and organizations handle global food
    security issues. These combined efforts will lead to sustainable and resilient
    food systems for everybody (Chilaka and Chilaka 2019). 7 Case Studies and Real-World
    Implementations The ability of AIoT solutions to tackle difficult problems and
    propel good change has been shown by their widespread adoption in some countries.
    AIoT technology may enhance productivity, sustainability, and resource management,
    as shown by the featured case studies in precision agriculture, fisheries management,
    and smart grids. Guidelines for future AIoT implementations may be derived from
    the lessons gained and best practices in interoperability, data security, user-centric
    design, and local context concerns (Yin et al. 2022). In order to create a more
    sustainable and interconnected society, AIoT solutions must continue to develop
    and cooperate. Many sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, transportation,
    and more, have been radically altered by AIoT development. This section looks
    at real-world deployments of AIoT technologies in various areas to draw up lessons
    and best practices (Yin et al. 2022). Some globally effective solutions are (Cliff
    et al. 2023; Godager et al. 2021). Accurate farming methods in the USA: Precision
    farming has become more popular in the United States. Farmers use the devices
    like soil sensors, weather stations, and drones to monitor their crops and ensure
    everything is running well. Farmers may improve their irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest management methods with real-time data from these sensors. Sustainable
    agriculture has benefited from increased agricultural yields and more effective
    use of available resources. Norwegian Smart Fishery Management: Norway has introduced
    -based solutions to encourage responsible fishing practices in its fisheries sector.
    AIoT technologies like GPS trackers and sensors are installed aboard fishing boats
    to keep tabs on catch rates, fish stocks, and environmental factors. By using
    this information, authorities can better enforce fishing limits, curb overfishing,
    and safeguard marine ecosystems, assuring the fishing industry''s continued success.
    South Korean smart grids: South Korea''s energy industry has made great efforts
    towards implementing technology. (AIoT) sensors are used in smart grids for real-time
    monitoring of energy usage, distribution optimisation, and problem detection.
    Improved grid efficiency in South Korea has resulted in lower energy costs and
    greater sustainability through lowering energy waste and increasing energy dependability.
    7.1 Best Practices and Real-World Lessons The practices and real-world lessons
    include (Janabi and Kurnaz 2023): Standardisation and Compatibility: Successful
    systems need standardized communication protocols and the ability to easily integrate
    new hardware and software. The easy sharing of data and compatibility across various
    AIoT components are made possible by establishing interoperability. Data Privacy
    and Protection: Sensitive data must be collected and sent securely in AIoT implementations.
    To defend against cyber risks and preserve user privacy, implementers should prioritize
    data encryption, user authentication, and data access restrictions. User-centered
    design: Users are the focus of good design. To increase user adoption and engagement,
    it is important to provide user-friendly interfaces, clear representations, and
    intuitive functionality. Flexibility and scalability: The data volume and the
    number of connected devices are expected to grow over time. Therefore, AIoT implementations
    must be flexible. As a result of its adaptability, new technologies, and future
    growth may be easily included. Consideration of the Local Context: Successful
    installations need adjustments for each unique situation. To provide successful
    solutions, it is essential to appreciate various geographical areas’ specific
    difficulties, cultural subtleties, and infrastructural limitations. Coordination
    and Cooperation: Governments, businesses, universities, and communities all have
    a stake in a successful rollout of the Partners may pool their knowledge, skills,
    and resources through collaboration to create long-lasting improvements. Control
    and Assessment: To determine how successful an AIoT solution is and where it may
    be enhanced, constant monitoring and assessment are required. Insights derived
    from data analysis support continual optimization and enable evidence-based decision-making.
    Instruction and Capacity Development: The knowledge and proficiency of end-users
    and implementers of AIoT technologies may be improved via training and capacity-building
    programs. Building people''s abilities is crucial to ensuring that the solutions
    have the desired effect. 8 Future Trends and Innovations The AIoT has advanced
    swiftly and is continuing to drive innovation. In the not-too-distant future,
    AIoT technologies will merge with AI and machine learning, resulting in unheard-of
    levels of efficiency and automation. The introduction of 5G technology and the
    development of edge computing will also usher in a new era of AIoT applications,
    particularly in the agricultural industry (Saad et al. 2023). Improvements in
    artificial intelligence, machine learning, 5G, and edge computing point to a bright
    future for AIoT in agriculture by fueling substantial gains in efficiency, sustainability,
    and production. 5G and edge computing will improve connection and data processing,
    and combining AI and machine learning with AIoT will allow for predictive analytics
    and autonomous systems. Precision farming, smart irrigation, remote monitoring,
    and evidence-based decision-making are just some ways the AIoT will revolutionise
    agriculture and strengthen the foundations of sustainable agriculture worldwide
    (Seyyedabbasi et al. 2023). The potential for innovation and beneficial influence
    on the agricultural business is limitless as these technologies continue to advance.
    The potential impact of 5G and edge computing on AIoT applications in agriculture
    and future trends and breakthroughs in AIoT are discussed. 8.1 Future Trends and
    Innovations in AIoT Increasing connectivity among AIoT devices will provide simple
    two-way communication and data sharing. Because of this enhanced connectedness,
    data analysis and decision-making will become more holistic and integrated. Artificial
    intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms will be included into AIoT
    devices, allowing them to analyse and anticipate trends and patterns in real-time
    data (Garg and Goyal 2020). As a result of this capacity, procedures and resource
    allocation may be optimised for greater efficacy. With edge computing, processing
    may be done closer to the data source, which speeds up processing and decreases
    latency. Edge intelligence-equipped AIoT devices will be able to do sophisticated
    tasks locally, cutting down on demand for cloud computing. The AIoT, AI, and ML
    will merge to generate fully autonomous systems. As a result, production will
    rise, human errors will decrease, and efficiency will improve. AIoT will revolutionize
    urban planning and infrastructure management, leading to the construction of smart
    cities with linked transportation, electricity, waste management, and more systems
    (Mousavi et al. 2021). 8.2 Integration of AIoT, AI, and Machine Learning AI and
    ML algorithms will analyze massive volumes of data the AIoT creates. This will
    allow for enhanced knowledge of agricultural procedures and more efficient use
    of available resources (Olan et al. 2022). Precision agriculture will become a
    reality in which farmers administer inputs like water and fertiliser with pinpoint
    accuracy using real-time data and analysis made possible by AI-driven AIoT apps.
    By taking this course of action, both yields and environmental impact may be improved.
    With AI, devices can anticipate when agricultural machinery and equipment need
    repair (Olan et al. 2022; Pan and Zhang 2021). 8.3 The Possible Effect of 5G and
    Edge Computing on Applications in Farming With the increased bandwidth and decreased
    latency that 5G networks provide, the AIoT can communicate with one another in
    near real-time. With the help of 5G and edge computing, farmers can keep an eye
    on their crops and animals without leaving their homes (Rathod et al. 2023). Data-intensive
    AIoT applications, such as high-resolution image and video analytics, will be
    supported by 5G’s fast data rates and the processing capabilities of edge computing,
    enhancing agricultural monitoring and analysis. AIoT-enabled irrigation systems
    with 5G connection and edge computing can optimize water consumption and save
    waste by adjusting the amount of water supplied depending on real-time data, soil
    moisture levels, and weather predictions (Varsha et al. 2021). 9 Conclusion This
    chapter examines the potential to revolutionize agricultural practices via data-driven
    decision-making and precision agriculture on the path to sustainable agriculture
    and food security. Agricultural output, resource effectiveness, and supply chain
    management benefit greatly from AIoT-enabled systems. AIoT improves agricultural
    operations by helping farmers and stakeholders make better choices based on real-time
    data and analytics. Due to the AIoT, farmers can track and manage their crops
    with pinpoint accuracy, improving efficiency, lessening environmental damage,
    and boosting agricultural yields. By allowing farmers to adjust water distribution
    in response to current weather and crop circumstances, smart irrigation systems
    improve water efficiency while decreasing water waste. Better illness diagnosis,
    health assessment, and livestock management contribute to happier, healthier animals.
    A well-oiled supply chain guarantees that food is safe to eat, cuts down on post-harvest
    losses, and speeds up the delivery of crops to consumers. AIoT plays a crucial
    role in developing sustainable agriculture and attaining global food security
    by using real-time data and analytics and closing the information gap between
    farmers, agribusinesses, and consumers. With the ongoing development of AIoT,
    AI, and 5G technologies, the future of AIoT in agriculture seems bright. Data
    security, privacy issues, high implementation costs, and accessibility for small-scale
    farmers in underdeveloped countries are only some of the obstacles that must be
    overcome. Understanding AIoT''s societal and economic effects on agriculture requires
    a study conducted by agronomists, environmentalists, and social scientists. Investing
    in AIoT-related research and development may lead to a future where agriculture
    is more sustainable, productive, and ecologically aware. References Abdullahi

    and Opportunities with Recent Advancements Chapter © 2021 Impact of Internet of
    Things in Agriculture Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Agriculture has long been
    the cornerstone of human civilization, providing sustenance, livelihoods, and
    economic prosperity to communities around the world. However, the global agricultural
    landscape is rapidly evolving, presenting both unprecedented challenges and exciting
    opportunities. As the world''s population continues to surge towards an estimated
    9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for food, fiber, and bioenergy is intensifying
    [1, 2]. This surge in demand, coupled with the increasingly volatile climate and
    resource constraints, necessitates a profound transformation in how we practice
    agriculture. The answer to this challenge lies in the convergence of cutting-edge
    technologies, notably Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), which collectively form the bedrock of what is now known as “Smart Agriculture”
    or “Precision Agriculture” [3,4,5,6,7,8]. Smart Agriculture represents a paradigm
    shift from traditional farming methods to a data-driven, interconnected, and intelligent
    approach to cultivation. It harnesses the power of AI, data analytics, automation,
    and IoT to optimize agricultural processes, conserve resources, enhance crop yields,
    and mitigate environmental impacts [8,9,10,11,12]. This chapter embarks on a journey
    into the realm of AI and smart technologies within the context of agriculture.
    It explores how these technologies are reshaping the agricultural landscape, from
    the vast fields of staple crops to the intricate networks of urban vertical farms.
    It examines the key applications of AI and smart technologies in precision farming,
    highlights real-world case studies of their implementation, and considers the
    implications for farmers, consumers, and the environment. In an age where information
    is a critical resource, the fusion of AI and agriculture represents a pivotal
    moment in human history. It offers the promise of feeding a burgeoning global
    population sustainably, reducing the ecological footprint of agriculture, and
    enhancing the resilience of food systems in the face of climate change. Yet, it
    also raises questions about data security, privacy, and equitable access to these
    transformative technologies. As we embark on this exploration of AI and smart
    technologies in agriculture, we must recognize that we are at the cusp of a new
    agricultural revolution. The seeds of innovation have been sown, and it is our
    responsibility to nurture this burgeoning field to ensure a greener, more abundant,
    and more technologically advanced future of agriculture [13,14,15]. “Precision
    agriculture is an approach to farm management that uses information technology
    (IT) to ensure that crop and soil receive exactly wat they need for optimum health
    and productivity. The goal of PA is to ensure profitability, sustainability and
    protection of the environment” (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Agriculture system Full size image
    “PA is also known as satellite agriculture as needed farming and site-specific
    crop management (SSCM). Modern farming has involved since the day of horse/bullock
    drawn plough. According to Taro Mieno, Assistant Professor, Department of agriculture
    and economics, university of Nebraska. Lincoln, dedicated research worker showed
    the impact of adopting precision technology on farms. Mieno’s research focuses
    specifically on how precision agriculture technologies impact profitability for
    farmers. PA recognizes the diversity of characteristics within a field through
    technology. Some examples of precision agriculture include drones, Global Positioning
    system (GPS) and irrigation technologies [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. The goal of
    precision agriculture is to learn new management practices to increase the profitability
    of agricultural production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop low-cost technologies,
    so that the farmers of developing countries may also be benefited by high level
    technologies. 2 Types of Precision Agriculture Precision AG’s editor Eric sfiligoy
    has prepared a list of the top 10 technologies that are shaping precision precision
    agriculture today. Most involve some level of robotics, navigation, sensors and
    variable rate dispensing (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Precision agricultural cycle Full size
    image 1. GPS/GNSS: Its hard to tell exactly where the state of precision agriculture
    today would be without GPS-literally. From virtually movement agriculture gained
    access to position locating satellites in the 1990’s, operators and manufactures
    have found out various ways to the tie into the tools to make managing field work
    much easier and accurate. In North America and Europe, grower can turn on the
    tractors and get to work almost immediately, says T.J.Schulte, marketing manager
    for trimble agriculture Division. Looking beyond these caopabilities, experts
    say that satellite technology is truly deserving of its “global” monitor. “No
    longer can we refer to all these system as GPS-that is not an accurate description
    when referring to new global Navigation Satellite system (GNSS) receiver technology
    today”. Instead, Grey Guyette adds GNSS covers all countries satellite con stellations
    including GPS, GLONASS and Galileo [21,22,23] (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 GPS Full size image
    2. Mobile Devices: After figuring out where PA stands on the planets, the next
    most important innovation these past 20 year would have to be the development
    of mobile devices. “Without the cell phone, we probably would still be sitting
    in barn a lot, waiting for someone to come to the barn and make things work”,
    Says Reifsteck. Today, cell phone has morphed into a whole host of useful mobile
    devices including smatphone and tablets. As of 2016, most precision agriculture
    manufactures that dabble in the mobile devices market have spent most of their
    time trying to expand the capabilities these products can offer to users. According
    to Dr. M. Barnes “if you cannot get your technical data to work for the farmers
    within first 20 min after he receives it, he is probably never going to use it”.
    Robotics: Robots are taking on making many tasks in agriculture these days, including
    planting greenhouse crops and pruning vineyards. In a different approach, the
    Fendt MARS (Mobile Agriculture Robot Swarms) project utilizers small corn seeding
    robots that are lightweight, energy efficient, highly agile, cloud controlled
    and operated from tablet app [24,25,26,27]. Irrigation: Innovations in precision
    agriculture technologies are growing even more crucial as growers face water scarcity
    due t drought, aquifer depletion and water allocations. Adoption with valley irrigation,
    products now allow growers to remotely monitor, and control nearly facet of their
    irrigation operations. The system save water. Timely, fuel and wear and tear on
    the vehicles. In the future, Compbell says producers will be integrating soil
    moisture monitoring, weather data and variable- rate irrigation (VRI) inti their
    system. Internet of Things: One of the newest buzzwords to hit precision over
    the past few of years is the “Internet of things” (IOT). Simply defined, it’s
    the concept of connecting any device with an on/off switch to the internet. This
    network of connected things could also include people with wearable devices. Most
    recently, a few ag startups and components suppliers (hardware, software etc.)
    are using LPWANs (Low Power wide Area Network) in place of or to augment cellular
    networks in wireless data transmission. These networks are designed to carry small
    amounts of data transmitted intermittently over long ranges” says Paul Welbig
    [28]. Sensors: In precision agriculture, wireless sensors are used to collect
    data on a variety of factors, including soil water availability, soil compaction,
    soil fertility, leaf temperature, leaf area index, plant water status, local climatic
    data, insect-disease-weed infestation, and more. The management of water uses
    some of the most cutting-edge and varied technology now available. The growing
    control of water consumption across the country, as well as the shortage of water,
    will continue to be the driving force for advancements in this field [29]. Variable
    Rate seeding: It might come as a surprise to learn that variable-rate application
    (VRA) seeding is included on this list, considering all of the new and interesting
    technology for precision agriculture that are included. There is not much of a
    difference between it and variable rate fertiliser, because VRA sowing depends
    on your capacity to put together precise data for the seed itself, which is the
    beginning of the agricultural process [30,31,32] (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Weather modelling
    Full size image When you go into the majority of the country''s agricultural retail
    establishments, there is a good possibility that you will find some form of weather
    tracker on display. There is perhaps no other variable that is both as significant
    and as unpredictably vital as the weather. However, assistance is on its way.
    “Over the past 25 years, you’ve gotten a lot of important technologies developed
    that would be even more valuable with quality weather modelling, but we are now
    at a point where assuring good crop yields is key to making certain the world
    has food solutions that works”, says Jeff Kaiser, Vice President, Iteris. As an
    illustration of this, consider the case of a potato planter in the Northern Plains
    who discovered that harvesting his crop at a particular temperature was essential
    to preserving the crop''s quality and consistency. “But by using clear Ag, this
    grower was able to take all their soil reading remotely and he was able to accomplish
    his harvest a lot more efficiently than even before” [33,34,35,36]. Nitrogen Modelling:
    The fertilizer have been used in forms of variable rate for decades, nitrogen
    modelling has become pronounced recently. “Our clientele has been using variable
    rate technologies for fertilizer applications Since the mid 1990s”, says Matt
    waits, CEO for SST software. “However, the complexity of the N-cycle and how it
    is in a constant state of fux has always made managing nitrogen difficult”. A
    recent partnership between SST software and agronomic technology Corp (ATC) resulted
    in the introduction of Adopt-N. Adopt-N was initially presented to the public
    in 2014, and according to Steve Sibulkin, Chief Executive Officer of ATC, it is
    rapidly becoming into an essential instrument for effectively regulating the utilization
    of nitrogen. The overwhelming majority of farmers desire an easy-to-implement
    solution that will allow them to handle these issues (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Controlled
    release micronutrient fertilizer for precision farming Full size image Standardization:
    Initial efforts to implement this began almost eight years ago with the founding
    of the agriculture industry electronic foundation. Equipment manufacturers’ components,
    mainly those that adhere to the ISOBUS standard, continue to make their way into
    official circulation. More than 170 businesses, associations, and other types
    of organisations are currently part of the group and are actively working together
    to ensure that the standards are effective. However, industry players who have
    to deal with equipment compatibility “ On the ground” continue to be unhappy,
    and third party tech specialists frequently have difficulty managing items from
    rival providers. It is a lot better than it was, but it is still a significant
    problem. There will come a day, ideally, when components will get to the point
    where they are pretty much plug-and-play. It’s interesting to know that Precision
    Agriculture sure drive system today have wireless sensors together data on soil
    availability, Compaction, infertility and other data [37,38,39]. 3 Precision Agriculture’s
    Role in the New Era of the Farm Land Sector. The new generation of Agriculture
    systems addresses climate change adaptation alongside investor’s usual goals of
    improving yield and reducing costs. Precision farming refers to the precise application
    of agricultural inputs with respect to soil, weather as well as to crop need in
    order to improve productivity, quality and profitability in agriculture. Hence,
    precision agriculture is about going the right thing, in the right place, in the
    right way at the right [40]. 3.1 Advantages of Precision Farming It did this by
    increasing agricultural productivity and halting soil deterioration on areas suitable
    for cultivation, which led to further agricultural advancement. It will result
    in a reduction in the excessive use of chemicals in agricultural production. Precision
    farming allows for more effective use of available water resources. Agricultural
    fields may be surveyed more easily with the use of GPS. Additionally, the yield
    as well as the features of the soil may be plotted. The dissemination of knowledge
    on agricultural methods, with the goals of improving crop quality and quantity
    while simultaneously lowering production costs. Through the optimization of agrochemical
    products, it lessens the threat to the environment, in particular with regard
    to the leaching of nitrates and the poisoning of groundwater. It enhances the
    possibilities for better resource management, which in turn helps to decrease
    the number of resources that are wasted. An undulated field may be subdivided
    into smaller plots according to the specific needs of the individual customers.
    3.2 Disadvantages of Precision Farming Farmers may be dissuaded from adopting
    this style of farming due to the high initial investment required. Techniques
    for precision farming are still in the process of being developed and require
    the advise of specialists before they can be put into practise. It is possible
    that it will take several years before sufficient data is collected to really
    deploy the system in its entirety. It is a very challenging endeavor, particularly
    the gathering of data and the interpretation of the results. 3.3 How Could India
    Benefit from Precision Farming? A decrease in the cost of production, an increase
    in productivity, and a more efficient use of natural resources may all be achieved
    in India through the development, refinement, and wider deployment of precision
    agricultural technology. It has the potential to completely transform the way
    farms are managed in modern India. As a result of improvements in profitability,
    productivity, sustainability, crop quality, environmental protection, on-farm
    quality of life, food safety, and rural economic growth. Application of site-specific
    irrigation in wheat grown in Punjab and Haryana, use of site-specific herbicides
    in cotton, and application of site-specific fertilizers in oil palm plantation
    in south India, as well as coffee and tea gardens in eastern India. India is able
    to significantly lower manufacturing costs, as well as lower production expenses,
    and lower the amount of chemicals that are loaded into the environment [41]. When
    there are limited amounts of water available, it can improve the efficiency of
    the irrigation system. In addition to this, it offers new instruments for the
    evaluation of multifunctional features, such as those that do not involve the
    market, and it expands job chances for those with specialized training in the
    agriculture industry. The farmer may utilize the prediction to prevent issues
    like as water stress, nutritional inadequacy, and pest and disease infestation.
    The state of greenhouses in agricultural areas may be monitored by it, which is
    an important function it plays. 4 Challenges in Adopting Precision Farming in
    India 1. The implementation of PA in India is still in the preliminary stages
    as a result of the country''s distinctive pattern of land ownership, its inadequate
    infrastructure, the reluctance of farmers to take risks, as well as the country''s
    social, economic, and demographic circumstances. 2. The majority of Indian agriculture
    is conducted on very tiny plots of land, which restricts the economic improvements
    that may be made with the precision farming equipment that is now available. 4.1
    The War Forward New windows of opportunity for the implementation of precision
    farming are opening up in India as a result of the rapid socioeconomic shifts
    that include economic growth, urbanization, and increased energy consumption.
    Instead of blindly adopting the advanced precision agriculture technologies adopted
    by developed countries, India should adopt technologies based on the need of socio-economic
    condition of the country (IAS express-2022). 5 How Precision Agriculture in India
    is Adopted According to Rashika Solomon (2020), the agriculture is backbone of
    India’s economy, which accounts for 18% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP)
    and hires about half of the countries workforce. More than 70% of rural families
    depend on agriculture for their livelihood. The implementation of forward-thinking
    agricultural practises such as precision agriculture is a viable option for accomplishing
    this objective. The PA is an integrated crop management system that monitors the
    agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing (RS), global positioning
    system (GPS), and geographical information system (GIS). Recording and mapping
    the variations in crop and soil parameters that are present within a field is
    done. Following this, management decisions are made based on the findings of ongoing
    assessments of the spatial variability within the given field. In India, it is
    referred to as the efficient use of agricultural inputs in order to achieve higher
    levels of crop output (Gunnamreddy, 2022). 6 Conclusion Technologies that enable
    precision agriculture are playing an increasingly important part in the production
    of food crops. PA, For example, a guiding system for tractors that uses GPS. The
    use of global positioning system (GPS) technology for mapping soil and yield as
    well as variable-rate input applications helps farmers collect information on
    the changing field condition so that production techniques may be adjusted. Soil
    mapping, a similar precision technique, provides farmers with additional data
    that they can really use. When creating soil maps, more soil samples are collected,
    and zones are used to depict the different soil types, nitrate levels, and pH
    acidity readings. GPS is used by farmers to plot yield maps and data on maps in
    synchronisation with one another. Nevertheless, soil maps have a lot of practical
    applications since they display properties of the ground that are likely to be
    consistent from year to year. Finally, variable rate input application technology
    (VRT) enables farmers to tailor the application of fertiliser, chemicals, and
    pesticides by making use of GPS data, which is often derived from yield and soil
    maps. The adoption of PA in India depends on the pressure of population which
    is growing rapidly and more than 65% are directly employed by agricultural system.
    Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to modernize conventional agricultural
    techniques and be ready for an impending technological revolution in order to
    build an environmentally friendly system for increasing crop yield. The implementation
    of forward-thinking agricultural practices such as precision agriculture is a
    viable option for accomplishing this objective. PA is an integrated crop management
    system that monitors the agricultural field at ground level using remote sensing
    (RS), global positioning systems (GPS), and geographic information systems (GIS).
    Recording and mapping the differences in crop or soil qualities that are present
    within a field is done. In India, it is known as the exact exploitation of agricultural
    inputs to discover improved crop output by utilizing precision agriculture. This
    is done in an effort to improve food security. References Anonymous: What is precision

  description: The agricultural sector plays an important role in contributing significantly
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries. On the other
    hand, agriculture is widely affected by major factors such as environmental changes,
    natural disasters, pesticide control, and soil and irrigation-related issues,
    which reduce crop yield. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and agriculture offers
    an opportunity to move into the next generation of Agriculture 4.0. The internet
    of things (IoT), remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, big data, cloud
    computing, thermal imaging, end-user apps and unmanned aerial vehicles offer a
    full-stack solution. IoT provides the ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices
    to the internet to collect, process and analyse a large amount of agriculture
    field data more quickly and synthesize them to make smart decisions using various
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study reviews the challenges
    and major issues in the IoT agriculture domain and explores its emergence with
    new technologies. It covers the existing literature and illustrates how IoT applicationbased
    precision agriculture solutions have contributed. A case study on weed detection
    for smart agriculture using the YOLOv5 model is presented, achieving high accuracy.
    Finally, various IoT agriculture use cases are discussed, along with current research
    issues and possible solutions for future IoT-based agriculture advancement.

    Keywords: vertical greenery systems (VGS); green wall; monitoring VGS; VGS maintenance;
    nature-based solution; VGS health 1. Introduction Vertical greenery systems (VGS)
    have gained popularity in recent decades as a nature-based solution and adaptation
    method for the adverse effects of urbanization and climate change [1]. In addition
    to their aesthetic benefits, VGS contribute to both indoor and outdoor environments
    by improving air quality [2,3,4], creating a milder microclimate [5,6], reducing
    energy consumption [6,7,8], and noise pollution [9,10]. Furthermore, VGS may enhance
    the psychological well-being of building residents or users [11,12]. However,
    covering buildings with VGS presents significant challenges. The installation,
    operation, and maintenance of VGS can be complex and costly [13]. Issues such
    as irrigation problems or plant damage may necessitate specialists’ expertise
    and the use of cranes, further escalating expenses [14]. Moreover, poorly maintained
    VGS can lead to dissatisfaction among residents and passersby and can increase
    fire risk [15], undermining the potential benefits of using VGS as an adaptive
    solution. Therefore, the continuous monitoring of VGS is crucial, especially since
    the plants are often difficult to access, and conditions may vary significantly
    along the VGS [16]. In situ sensors provide valuable continuous monitoring of
    VGS, but the spatial distribution of the vegetation status cannot be easily achieved
    [17]. The growing demand for efficient VGS monitoring methods to facilitate proper
    maintenance has arisen as VGS becomes more prevalent in urban areas, along with
    other green and blue infrastructures [18]. Currently, irrigation in commercial
    VGS is often determined through trial and error, and VGS health monitoring is
    primarily based on expert observations conducted periodically [19]. To address
    the complexities of large-scale VGS maintenance, information technologies (IT),
    the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced monitoring technologies may offer valuable
    assistance [20]. Adopting remote sensing and precision agriculture methods for
    VGS can greatly improve ongoing plant monitoring and aid in the early detection
    of plant stress. Early detection of changes in plant health is critical for successful
    agricultural growth [21]. Hyperspectral (HS) and thermal (TIR) imaging are well-established
    methods in agriculture and natural areas [22,23,24]. The interaction of objects
    with light at different wavelengths determines their spectral characteristics.
    For instance, plant pigments exhibit distinct features, such as chlorophyll absorption
    bands in the blue and red regions. Healthy plants generally have lower reflectance
    in the visible bands and higher reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands than
    plants under stress. HS imaging can identify subtle differences in vegetation
    that may not be visible to the human eye. This technique has been successfully
    applied to various crops, including estimating biochemical and biophysical properties;
    evaluating nutrient and stress status; classifying or detecting crop types, weeds,
    and diseases; and investigating soil characteristics [25,26]. Nevertheless, HS
    cameras are expensive, and analyzing tens to hundreds of bands in the visible
    and near-infrared regions can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.
    Therefore, vegetation indices (VIs) are commonly used to quantitatively and qualitatively
    highlight specific vegetation features, such as chlorophyll and water content,
    based on a combination of reflectance at two or more wavelengths in the electromagnetic
    spectrum [27]. TIR imaging is often employed to assess temperature differences
    indicating stress derived from diseases [28] or water deficits in crops [29].
    Furthermore, TIR imaging allows targeted interventions and optimization of irrigation
    strategies [30,31,32]. The increasing focus on vertical farming has spurred the
    advancement of IoT smart sensing technology. This includes a range of sensors
    implemented to track variables such as room temperature, light intensity, humidity
    levels, and soil nutrition [33]. Additionally, cable-driven robot prototypes have
    been developed to monitor and care for vegetation in hard-to-reach areas [14,34].
    Some studies have also demonstrated the application of image processing techniques
    to identify fruits [34], employ Machine Learning Algorithms for detecting tomato
    diseases [35], and support decisions on whether the plant can be harvested or
    not using a simple NDVI threshold [36]. Nonetheless, progress in monitoring outdoor
    VGS remains limited. Gunawardena and Steemers [20], conducted a study on the main
    maintenance challenges in outdoor VGS based on 12 European case studies. They
    found that real-time stress detection, and automated response mechanisms were
    not operational in any of the installations inspected, despite the evident need
    for such capabilities. While several studies have estimated the water requirement
    for VGS irrigation management [19,37,38], the utilization of remote sensing in
    VGS studies is limited. Pérez-Urrestarazu et al. [37] found that using a thermal
    camera could be valuable in determining substrate moisture to optimize VGS irrigation.
    Nevertheless, in VGS studies, thermal imaging was primarily performed to assess
    the wall and foliage skin temperatures [39,40], which could affect the outdoor
    and indoor microclimate [6]. While some studies have explored the use of hyperspectral
    imaging in green roofs [41,42], its application in VGS is still at a preliminary
    stage. Yuan et al. [43] monitored the water stress of an indoor green wall using
    the “triangle method”, which includes surface temperature and the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI). Helman et al. [17] used HS and TIR cameras for spatially
    continuous monitoring as part of an integrated system that examines the benefits
    of an indoor green wall. They utilized HS imaging to separate plant species through
    supervised classification and established correlations between the HS VIs and
    plants’ CO2 assimilation rate. They also demonstrated a negative correlation between
    TIR images and stomatal conductance. To the best of our knowledge, except for
    a few studies that monitored VGS skin temperature, remote sensing tools in VGS
    studies have been applied only to indoor environments, which are much more homogenous
    in terms of illumination and climate. Continual monitoring of VGS holds paramount
    importance for maintenance, encompassing vegetation health and the fine-tuning
    of irrigation and fertilization systems [20]. Automated monitoring can enhance
    performance and facilitate decisions in managing VGS. Detecting issues early in
    vegetated walls can avert irreversible situations necessitating extensive plant
    replacement. The primary objective of this study is to deploy ground-based remote
    sensing methods for the assessment of outdoor VGS health. While hyperspectral
    and thermal cameras offer advanced capabilities, our focus is on demonstrating
    the practical potential of these methods for monitoring VGS. This approach involves
    the establishment of a time series comprising RGB, HS, and TIR indices. Furthermore,
    we used unsupervised classification to detect stressed vegetation in early stages
    as a basis for a spatial decision support system for real-scale VGS. This study
    highlights the potential use of remote sensing in enhancing VGS monitoring. 2.
    Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The study was conducted on real-scale VGS
    as part of the BIU-VGS project at Bar Ilan University (32.067, 34.842) in Mediterranean
    climate Ramat Gan, the central region of Israel (Figure 1). The study site comprised
    three identical buildings in the southern campus, which replicated two east–west
    oriented street canyons. Each building consisted of five floors, with an overall
    height of 20 m. The canyons had concrete walls facing north and south. During
    the period from 3 to 18 November 2019, planters were installed on two parallel
    vertical walls in one of the canyons, covering approximately 450 m2 of vegetated
    area for each wall. Two VGS technologies were utilized—a green/living wall (GW)
    on the eastern shafts and a vertical forest (planter boxes attached to the wall)
    on the remaining walls and the western shafts. The GW was constructed using plastic
    modules containing a blended soil substrate for planting (40% peat, 40% coconut,
    and 20% perlite). The case study focused on the GWs located on two vertical concrete
    walls—one facing north (building 212) and the other facing south (building 213),
    as shown in Figure 1b. Each GW had dimensions of 11 m in height and 2.7 m in width,
    covered with plant species Viola hederacea (Figure 1c) and Hedera helix (Figure
    1d). Figure 1. The study site. (a) Location (yellow star) of the BIU-VGS project
    in the eastern Mediterranean. (b) Close-up of the study site. The location of
    the north and south-facing GWs, as well as air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity
    (RH) sensors (in red circles) are indicated. (c) GW species Viola hederacea. (d)
    GW species Hedera helix. (e) Weekly water accumulation of the six irrigation pipes
    at the north-facing (212) and south-facing GWs (213) and weekly mean air temperature
    (Ta) at the center of the canyon (dotted red line). The irrigation and fertilization
    of the GW were provided through an automated system based on scheduled programs
    planned by an irrigation expert. Each GW contained six irrigation lines, with
    drippers placed every 15 cm along the width of each line. Irrigation was applied
    at midnight either every one day (during summer) or every two days (during winter).
    Figure 1e presents the weekly average water accumulation during the study period.
    The quantities were adjusted based on seasonal variations and, in rare instances,
    an expert made decisions to decrease or increase water amounts based on direct
    observations made on-site. The average weekly quantities during May–October were
    1.18 m3 (north-facing GW) and 1.56 m3 (south-facing GW), while irrigation significantly
    decreased during November–December to weekly average quantities of 0.16 m3 (north-facing)
    and 0.23 m3 (south-facing). 2.2. Data Acquisition This study was conducted over
    8 months between May and December 2020. GWs were monitored every 1–3 weeks using
    HS and TIR cameras. The cameras were mounted on a 1.5 m height tripod and manually
    operated from a fixed point on the ground, approximately 15 m away from the GW
    (Figure 2a,b). All images were collected during midday (11:00 A.M.–2:00 P.M. LT)
    under clear sky conditions. Figure 2. Data acquisition at the study site. (a)
    Locations (rectangles) of the HS and TIR shooting of the north (blue) and south
    (orange) facing GWs. (b) The thermal camera on a tripod toward the north-facing

    the yellowing events that were studied for early detection of stress (see Section
    2.4) and COVID quarantines that affected mainly the collection of TIR data. The
    HS images were obtained using a Specim IQ® camera (Specim–Spectral Imaging, Oulu,
    Finland) with a spectral resolution of 7 nm and 204 bands across the wavelength
    range of 397–1003 nm. Each image from the Specim IQ® camera was a square of 512
    × 512 pixels with a field of view (FOV) of 31°, providing a spatial resolution
    of 3 cm/pixel at the GW. All images were normalized using a 99% barium sulfate
    white reference (provided with the camera). Due to the vertical alignment, large
    scale, and limited accessibility of the VGS, the camera operated in “custom” mode,
    where the white reference was recorded and saved to the camera before the actual
    VGS recordings. The white reference was placed at the lower area of each GW and
    recorded every 15 min. A FLIR A655sc (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA) camera
    was used for collecting TIR images. This camera is an uncooled microbolometer
    with 640 × 480 pixels, sensitive to radiation in the range of 7.5–14.0 µm. It
    is equipped with a lens with a FOV of 45° and provides a spatial resolution of
    4 cm/pixel at the GW. The camera has a noise equivalent temperature difference
    (NETD, i.e., thermal sensitivity) of less than 30 mK and a thermal accuracy of
    ±2 °C or ±2% of the reading. The temperature values acquired by the camera were
    adjusted using FLIR Research IR software (version 4.40.9.30) by setting the air
    temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and target distance. An emissivity of
    0.95 was used to correct all thermal images. Due to technical issues with the
    thermal camera during COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, intermittent gaps occurred
    in the TIR time series data. Ta and RH were measured at 30 min intervals using
    HMP 155 Vaisala sensors with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C for Ta and ±1% for RH. These
    measurements were stored in cloud-based storage. Sensors were placed in three
    locations: 10 m from the GWs in the middle of the street canyon and 1 m near each
    GW (see red circles in Figure 1b). The timing of the data collection during this
    study is presented in Figure 2c. 2.3. Image Processing Figure 3 illustrates the
    image processing stages. The pre-processing of HS and TIR images involved their
    projection to each other using ArcGIS Pro software (version 3.0) and the extraction
    of Regions of Interest (ROIs) of approximately 13.5 m2 using the raster clip tool.
    The two plant species in the GW were separated (classified) due to their different
    phenological cycles, canopy closure characteristics, and vegetative properties.
    We employed the spectral angle mapper (SAM) supervised classification in ENVI
    software (version 5.6.1) to create a species mask for each GW (Figure 4). An image
    with a full green cover and without visible stress symptoms was selected for this
    purpose (north-facing: 14 September; south-facing: 24 August). Later, this mask
    was utilized to separate species in the HS and TIR time series analysis. After
    these pre-processing stages, the image processing flow was carried out using Python.
    The HS images were normalized (as described in Section 2.3.1), and all images
    (HS and TIR) were resized based on the smallest pixel found in each orientation
    time series. Figure 3. Illustration of image processing stages. Figure 4. Masks
    based on SAM classification for plant separation (ROI in red; mask contour in
    magenta) were used in the HS (NDVI, left) and TIR ( ∆𝑇 , right) time series analysis
    (see Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2). (a) North-facing GW (14 September) and
    (b) south-facing GW (24 August). 2.3.1. Hyperspectral (HS) Image Processing In
    the HS images, the white reference was positioned at the lower part of the GW.
    To eliminate illumination differences along the GW, a pixel-based spectrum normalization
    (sometimes referred to as Norm-1) was performed as follows: 𝑅 ̂ 𝑝 𝑖 =𝑅 𝑝 𝑖 / ∑
    204 𝑗=1 𝑅 𝑝 𝑗 (1) where p is the pixel, and i and j are the bands. In the normalization
    process, each spectral band of a pixel is divided by the sum of all the pixel’s
    spectral bands, ensuring that the sum of all bands for a given pixel is equal
    to 1. This allows for relative comparisons and analysis of spectral information
    for the entire image, considering the proportion of each spectral band within
    a pixel. For each species, 12 vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated, as shown
    in Table 1. The VIs were organized into categories based on their sensitivity
    (pigment; leaf structure; water content) and their band’s range (VIS-RGB; VIS-HS;
    NIR + VIS; NIR). For further analysis, two separate branches were pursued. (a)
    In the first branch, a kernel technique was employed. For each VI image, the standard
    deviation (“STD kernel”) was computed within 10 × 10 pixels moving window. This
    process involved iterating over the entire image, extracting data from each window,
    and generating a time series of the average STD kernel values for all VIs separated
    into species. These time series were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs.
    (b) In the second branch, a time series of VIs was built. For noise reduction
    in each VI image, Gaussian Blurring (size of 5 × 5 pixels) was applied. This is
    a smoothing method that removes noise generated by Gaussian distribution [44].
    These time series presented the average value for each VI, separated into species,
    and were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later to examine the potential
    of early detection of vegetation stress in VGS (see Section 2.4). Table 1. Vegetation
    indices separated into categories according to the VIs sensitivity. 2.3.2. Thermal
    (TIR) Images Processing Water stress is known to be correlated with stomatal closure,
    resulting in reduced transpiration and elevated leaf temperatures above the ambient
    temperature [58,59]. The canopy-to-air temperature difference (∆T) is widely used
    as an indicator of plant health, heat stress tolerance, or drought stress in crops
    [60], and is calculated based on the TIR images as follows: ∆T = Tcanopy − Ta
    (2) where Tcanopy is the temperature of vegetation at each pixel and Ta is the
    air temperature measured in situ, 1 m from each GW. Generally, if a plant has
    sufficient water, ∆T ≤ 0, whereas under water stress, ∆T > 0. Gaussian Blurring
    (5 × 5 pixels) was applied to the ∆T images to reduce noise, similar to what was
    done for the VIs images. The time series of ∆T were separated into species and
    used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later for early detection of vegetation
    stress in VGS using TIR images. 2.4. Stress Detection 2.4.1. Yellowing Index and
    Ground Truth In mid-October 2020 (south-facing GW—213) and mid-November 2020 (north-facing
    GW—212), the Viola hederacea plants along the GWs began to turn yellow and eventually
    died (Figure 5). In contrast, the Hedera helix plants, which are known as less
    sensitive plants, remained green and survived throughout the study and beyond.
    This period coincided with COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Israel, and irrigation
    and fertilizer were not properly managed, likely contributing to vegetation degradation.
    The yellowing events caused significant damage to the GW, dissatisfaction among
    residents and passersby, and required extensive vegetation replacement using cranes.
    The time series of the Viola hederacea plants’ yellowing in both GWs are referred
    to as “yellowing events” in the study. Figure 5. Study area and yellowing events
    in the north (blue) and south-facing (orange) GWs. To investigate the usage of
    HS and TIR imaging for the early detection of stress events in the GWs, the yellowing
    areas in the time series were detected and delineated. A “yellowing index” for
    Viola hederacea was manually created to quantify the percentage of yellowing at
    each time step. This process involved visual observation of RGB and HS images,
    histogram investigation of yellow and green pixels, and examination of several
    RGB chlorophyll detection indices from the Sánchez-Sastre et al. [61] study (see
    Table A1 in Appendix A). The RGB r index (Table 1) was chosen to represent stressed
    vegetation. By setting a fixed threshold (based on histogram properties and visual
    inspection) of 0.3, the r index, hereafter referred to as the “yellowing index”,
    successfully captured yellow (r index value > 0.3) and green (r index value <
    0.3) pixels. The yellowing index was analyzed for 10 time steps (from 24 September
    to 21 December at the north-facing GW and from 4 September to 1 December at the
    south-facing GW). One image per GW, close to the end of the yellowing event at
    each GW (14 December at the north-facing GW and 24 November at the south-facing
    GW), was selected as the reference image (ground truth) for stressed (yellow)
    pixels. 2.4.2. Stress Detection in VIs and Thermal Index Images To investigate
    the feasibility of detecting stress events before the visual stage (yellowing)
    in VGS, we classified the HS VIs and ∆T thermal index images into stressed and
    green pixels. For each VI (Table 1) and thermal index image in the 10 yellowing
    index time steps, we used an unsupervised Otsu threshold [62] and Multi-Otsu [63]
    to divide each image into two or three groups based on the presence of yellow
    pixels. When minimal or no yellow pixels were detected in the image (yellowing
    index < 0.5%), the data was split into two groups. Conversely, when yellow pixels
    were already present in the image (the yellow index was greater than 0.5%), the
    data was divided into three groups to increase sensitivity and allow for early
    detection of pre-yellowed stressed pixels. Separating into two groups only allowed
    the differentiation of yellow pixels from other pixels but could not detect the
    variance (stressed, non-stressed) in the rest of the image. For each time step,
    we classified the pixels as green, stressed, and yellow (if present). 2.4.3. Stress
    Detection Performance Estimation To evaluate the performance of the classifiers
    for early stress detection, we compared the classified (predicted: under stress
    or green) pixels from each HS VIs and ∆T index time step to the reference image
    (ground truth: yellow or green) and created a confusion matrix. The matrix was
    divided into four classes (Figure 6): True positive (TP): yellow pixels that were
    correctly predicted as under stress. False positive (FP): green pixels that were
    falsely predicted as under stress. True negative (TN): green pixels that were
    correctly predicted as green. False negative (FN): yellow pixels that were falsely
    predicted as green. Figure 6. Illustrations of the confusion matrix structure
    as used in this study. (a) Process of the calculated area. (b) Confusion matrix
    for yellow (under stress) and green (healthy) pixels as recognized by the ground
    truth (actual) and the VIs and thermal indices (predicted). The metrics that were
    used to describe the classifiers’ success for early stress detection based on
    the confusion matrix were: accuracy, precision, false positive rate (false alarm),
    and F1 score. Recall was also calculated for the F1 score calculation. The metrics
    were calculated as follows: Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN) (3) Precision
    = TP/(TP + FP) (4) False positive rate (false alarm) = FP/(FP + TN) (5) Recall
    = TP/(TP + FN) (6) The F1 score, a single-value metric, combines precision and
    recall using the harmonic mean. It considers both false negatives and false positives,
    making it a useful metric for imbalanced data [64]. In this study, the F1 score
    was utilized to assess the classifier’s performance and ensure that the classification
    results were not merely due to random chance. 3. Results 3.1. Ongoing Monitoring
    of VGS Using HS and TIR Images The average value of VIs allowed us to assess the
    general status of vegetation in VGS using remote and non-destructive methods.
    Figure 7 shows the time series of average VIs values and STD kernel from May to
    December 2020 for the two species in each GW. In both GWs, the VIs initially showed
    stable or minor changes in average values for several months. However, as the
    yellow visual symptoms appeared on the plants, there were noticeable changes in
    vegetation dynamics, with some VIs showing a rise while others demonstrated a
    drop, as well as a rise in standard deviation and STD kernel, all synchronized
    with the yellowing event. Figure 7. Average VIs and standard deviation (shading)
    time series of Viola hederacea (purple) and Hedera helix (green). The green (Hedera
    helix) and purple (Viola hederacea) dotted lines represent the STD kernel with
    values in the secondary y-axis. (a) North-facing and (b) south-facing GWs. The
    vertical yellow shading and red triangles indicate the yellowing events on 18
    November in (a) and October 14 in (b). The dates (November–December) in (b) where
    the images were in shadow conditions are marked in black lines. The data in (b)
    of the Hedera helix on 1 November was dropped due to mixed shadowed and sunny
    conditions. See details of VIs in Table 1. For the north-facing GW (Figure 7a),
    the average NDVI and standard deviation were 0.84 and 0.017 (Viola hederacea),
    and 0.79 and 0.019 (Hedera helix), respectively, from the beginning of the monitoring
    until the yellowing event. Just before the yellowing event (14 October to 1 November),
    the averages increased even further, and the standard deviation decreased (0.87,
    0.009 for Viola hederacea; 0.83, 0.012 for Hedera helix). At the onset of the
    yellowing event (18 to 24 November), the averages decreased to 0.84 (−3.4% for
    Viola hederacea) and 0.81 (−2.4% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation
    increased to 0.049 (540% for Viola hederacea) and 0.044 (360% for Hedera helix)
    compared to the period just before the yellowing event. As the yellowing event
    progressed (1 to 21 December), the averages further decreased to 0.651 (−22% for
    Viola hederacea) and 0.759 (−6% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation
    increased to 0.154 (314% for Viola hederacea) and 0.077 (175% for Hedera helix),
    compared to the beginning of the yellowing event. Similarly, the REIP and OSAVI
    averages decreased, and the standard deviation increased at the beginning of the
    yellowing event and beyond. The water content indices, WBI and NW-2, exhibited
    periodic changes throughout the study, with more drastic average decreases and
    standard deviation increases (WBI: −5.7%, 270%; NW-2: −15.7%, 300%) in Viola hederacea
    at the beginning of the yellowing. Other VIs were either not stable (e.g., r,
    G, PRI, NPQI, RVI, and mSR705) or very stable (e.g., SIPI) throughout the seasons,
    but also showed a decrease in average value and a drastic increase in standard
    deviation at the beginning of the yellowing event. Both species experienced decreases
    in average VIs and increases in standard deviation, indicating degradation of
    the entire GW during the yellowing event. Nevertheless, the changes in average
    and standard deviation values were more significant for Viola hederacea, and it
    eventually turned yellow and died. As for the STD kernel, the increase for both
    species began even before the beginning of the yellowing event (around 21 October)
    and continued to rise until the end of the time series. Some indices (e.g., NDVI,
    G, and PRI) exhibited a more synchronized response with the vegetation condition
    than others (e.g., NPQI, NWI-2, and mSR705). At the south-facing GW (Figure 7b),
    the NDVI averages and standard deviation were 0.77 and 0.013 (Viola hederacea),
    and 0.81 and 0.017 (Hedera helix) respectively from the beginning of the monitoring
    until the yellowing event, and 0.765 and 0.031 (Viola hederacea), and 0.788 and
    0.032 (Hedera helix) just before the yellowing event (14 to 30 September). At
    the onset of the yellowing event (14 October), the average of both species dropped,
    and the standard deviation drastically increased by −12%, 387% (Viola hederacea),
    and −3.8%, 125% (Hedera helix) compared to the period just before the yellowing
    event. In this GW, the Viola hederacea yellowing event was much more intensive
    and was visually apparent from the beginning. Thus, the difference between the
    species is even more significant than in the north-facing GW. As the yellowing
    event progressed (21 October to 1 December), the averages continued to decrease
    to 0.578 (−14% for Viola hederacea) and 0.738 (−2.6% for Hedera helix). Several
    VIs (i.e., PRI, RVI, and mSR705) gradually decreased in both species throughout
    the monitoring period, which may indicate a gradual degradation in the entire
    GW vitality over the year. However, during the yellowing event, all VIs values
    sharply changed in average and standard deviation only for the Viola hederacea,
    which turned yellow, while Hedera helix changes were much more moderate. As for
    the STD kernel, the increase was more intense for Viola hederacea and started
    only at the beginning of the yellowing event (14 October) and continued to rise
    until the end of the time series. Like the north-facing GW, the STD kernels of
    the indices showed variable synchronization with the vegetation condition. However,
    unlike the north-facing GW, the STD kernel did not increase before the yellowing
    event. During the study period, the north-facing GW remained entirely shaded,
    while the south-facing GW was fully exposed to sunlight during midday. Due to
    seasonal changes in the sun’s position, the south-facing GW (213) was entirely
    shaded in the last two images (24 November and 1 December), and partially shaded
    at the bottom of the GW (mainly at the Hedera helix areas) in the third image
    from the end (1 November). The shading conditions affected several pigment VIs
    in the last (2–3) images in the time series (Figure 7b). For example, PRI and
    NPQI sharply decreased during the yellowing event but started to increase on 1
    November, even though the yellowing event continued. Due to the mixed sun-shadow
    conditions in the 1 November image, noisy values were observed in PRI, NPQI, WBI,
    and NW-2 in the Hedera helix dataset. Therefore, we excluded this time step from
    the time series. The complete time series data, including the excluded time step,
    can be found in Figure A1 in Appendix A. Figure 8 presents the average ∆T of the
    two species for each GW. Data from the thermal camera is missing from 24 September
    until 21 October and on 23 June (north-facing GW) due to a technical problem (see
    Section 2.2). From the ∆T time series, it is evident that the north-facing GW
    (212) did not exhibit drastic changes in ∆T, except toward the end of the time
    series when ∆T began to rise as the GW yellowing progressed. This rise was observed
    in both species, although Hedera helix did not undergo yellowing. Conversely,
    at the south-facing GW, the ∆T index exhibited a consistent rise and was even
    slightly higher for the Hedera helix. Following the commencement of the yellowing
    event, ∆T in Viola hederacea continued to increase and surpassed that of Hedera
    helix. Data was unavailable before and after the commencement of the yellowing
    event, introducing uncertainty for this period. The consistent rise in ∆T was
    also observed in various HS VIs (see Figure 7b) and likely resulted from the gradual
    degradation of the entire GW. Eventually, this degradation led to the yellowing
    of Viola hederacea, whereas Hedera helix did not exhibit visual yellowing. The
    lowest ∆T in both GWs was recorded in the initial image (21 May), captured during
    a heatwave that transpired between 14–22 May 2020. During this period, the air
    temperature was elevated (Ta = 38 °C), and relative humidity was low (RH = 19.6%).
    In well-watered, unstressed vegetation, elevated air temperature, and reduced
    RH enhanced plant transpiration and resulted in decreased Tcanopy compared to
    air temperature (López et al., 2022 [65]). Figure 8. Time series of Viola hederacea
    (purple), and Hedera helix (green) average ∆T index in the (a) north-facing (212)
    and (b) south-facing (213) GWs. The vertical yellow shading and red triangle indicate
    the beginning of the yellowing events in each GW. The dotted lines are an interpolation
    of the missing data. 3.2. Early Detection of Stress Events Figure 9 illustrates
    the use of the r index as the “ground truth” for desiccated vegetation. The RGB
    and the r index images are depicted for both GWs. The yellowing index [%] is computed
    based on the r > 0.3 threshold. Figure 9. Yellowing index [%] for each GW based
    on the r index (r > 0.3). (a) North-facing GW and (b) south-facing GW. Images
    are presented for the date chosen as the reference image for early detection (14
    December at the north-facing GW and 24 November at the south-facing GW). The last
    column in the south-facing GW (b) yellowing index (1 December) is lower than the
    image before (24 November), due to vegetation regrowth in part of the yellowed
    area. Following the binary classification of stressed/green pixels for each VI
    based on the Otsu threshold, each image was compared to the reference image at
    four time steps before the first yellowing was visually apparent. In total, 48
    confusion matrices were computed (12 VIs × 4 time steps). Figure 10 shows a summary
    of the outcomes of the confusion matrices across the four VI categories outlined
    in Table 1 (RGB and HS pigment, leaf structure, and water content). At the north-facing
    GW (Figure 10a), 17 days before the onset of the yellowing event, metrics (accuracy,
    precision, and F1 score) displayed the highest values within the leaf structure
    and water content groups, both of which were derived from NIR wavelengths. In
    contrast, lower values were observed in the pigment groups (RGB and HS). Discrepancies
    in metrics among the classifiers became evident 35 days before the initial yellowing,
    occurring two months prior to the date of the ground-truth image, referenced for
    stressed vegetation (14 December). In the case of the south-facing GW (Figure
    10b), distinguishing between classifiers proved more challenging, with the range
    between 14–20 days before the initial yellowing event appearing to be the inflection
    point, also approximately two months prior to the ground-truth image on 24 November.
    In this context, the HS pigment and leaf structure groups yielded the highest
    performance. Figure 10. Maximum accuracy, precision, false alarm, and F1 score
    for each VIs group at the (a) north-facing and (b) south-facing GW. Each metric
    is colored based on the minimum value (white), median (gray), and maximum value
    (black). Table 2 outlines the highest metric scores within each VIs category during
    the final time step (17 days: north-facing; 14 days: south-facing) before the
    initial yellowing became visually apparent. At the north-facing GW, the water
    content index NWI-2 emerged as the most effective predictor (based on the F1 score),
    followed by the WBI index and then the OSAVI index. NWI-2 accurately predicted
    85% of the yellowing area on 14 December as early as 1 November, with an accuracy
    of 0.91, precision of 0.84, false alarm rate of 0.06, and F1 score of 0.85. Similarly,
    NWI-2 anticipated 64% of the yellow pixels 35 days prior to the initial yellowing
    (approximately two months ahead of the reference yellowing image), achieving an
    accuracy of 0.85, precision of 0.82, false alarm rate of 0.06, and F1 score of
    0.72. Meanwhile, at the south-facing GW, NPQI proved to be the strongest classifier,
    followed by the mSR705 and PRI indices. NPQI successfully predicted 72% of the
    24 November yellow pixels as early as 30 September, boasting an accuracy of 0.87,
    precision of 0.73, false alarm rate of 0.08, and F1 score of 0.73. Table 2. Metrics
    for each group at the north (212) and south (213) facing GWs at the last time
    step before the visual yellowing (17 days at 212 and 14 days at 213). Our investigation
    also encompassed the ∆T thermal index for the early detection of stressed vegetation.
    At the north-facing GW, the performance of ∆T on November 1 trailed behind the
    water content and leaf structure groups but surpassed the pigment group (accuracy
    of 0.87, precision of 0.77, false alarm rate of 0.09, and F1 score of 0.78). Previous
    time step metrics were slightly superior to the leaf structure group but still
    lagged behind the water content group. For the south-facing GW, missing data hindered
    our assessment of the time steps (24 and 30 September) that closely preceded the
    initial visible yellowing. Metrics for the final time step (14 September, around
    two and a half months before the reference image) were slightly lower than those
    of the other VIs groups (accuracy of 0.79, precision of 0.6, false alarm rate
    of 0.1, and F1 score of 0.53). Figure 11 presents the time series of stress maps
    for both the north and south-facing GWs. In the north-facing GW, a small region
    within the ROI began to yellow on 18 November (Figure 11a). The yellowing, occurring
    in small portions a few meters above the ground, was nearly impossible to detect
    through visual investigation on site. This event’s origins can be traced back
    two weeks or more. On 14 September, thermal index imagery displayed cooler vegetation
    temperatures (denoted by darker hues) in certain areas, suggesting potential over-irrigation
    or drainage issues. By 1 November, these areas exhibited decreased water content
    (NWI-2). The initial yellowing transpired where vegetation temperatures were lower,
    indicating that the first affected regions suffered from excessive irrigation.
    Although irrigation was scaled back on 22 October (Figure 1e), the areas affected
    by over-irrigation failed to recover and were the first to exhibit yellowing.
    Figure 11. Time series of RGB images (left), the r index (middle left), the high-performance
    classifier (middle right), and ∆T calculated from the thermal image (right) for
    the (a) north-facing (212) and (b) south-facing (213) walls. The red frame is
    the ROI from which the time series of the VIs were extracted. At the south-facing
    GW (Figure 11b), owing to the absence of TIR image data (see Section 2.2), we
    were unable to pinpoint the cause of stress events. Nevertheless, stressed regions
    were successfully detected and visualized before the visible yellowing using VIs.
    The time series of PRI, NPQI, RVI, REIP, and mSR705 indices (Figure 7b) indicated
    a decline in plant vitality as early as August 2020. Thermal index images prior
    to the yellowing event (8 and 14 September) highlighted the warmest areas (represented
    by brighter tones) at the GW’s upper portion–these regions were the first to undergo
    yellowing on 14 October. 4. Discussion Economic feasibility and maintenance are
    among the limiting factors of VGS [66]. While the significant construction costs
    are usually foreseen during the planning phase, clients often find themselves
    surprised by the unforeseen service costs linked to maintenance. The expense of
    irrigation is recognized as a significant factor [67], and the consequences of
    both inadequate and excessive irrigation, coupled with various abiotic or biotic
    stressors, can lead to VGS failure and necessitate extensive plant replacements
    [68]. While recommendations such as employing more tolerated plants [69,70] or
    irrigating using non-potable water [71] may alleviate certain operational costs,
    continuous monitoring of VGS is essential [20]. Real-time monitoring can identify
    stress indicators or system irregularities (e.g., drainage issues), allowing for
    timely intervention and averting the need for extensive plant replacements before
    irreversible damage occurs. This integrated approach not only addresses economic
    considerations but also underscores the importance of proactive monitoring in
    sustaining the long-term functionality and vitality of VGS. In this study, we
    employed time series of hyperspectral (HS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imaging
    to illustrate practical approaches for the ongoing monitoring of green walls (GWs)
    (Figure 7 and Figure 8) and the early detection of stress events via unsupervised
    Otsu classification (Figure 10, Table 2). General statistics derived from vegetation
    indices (VIs) provided insights into the entire GW (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Additionally,
    mapping the VI images into stress maps (Figure 11) offered spatial information
    on vegetation and watering status—a highly valuable asset in VGS, given the constrained
    accessibility to plants and the substrate [72]. These insights provided information
    about the timing of stress and possible reasons, which could be associated with
    watering patterns (either lack or over-irrigation). Our analysis employed a semiautomated
    method, realized through Python code, for noninvasive continuous monitoring of
    GWs. Apart from the manual image capture process (Figure 2a,b), image projection,
    and pre-preparation of plant species masks, the entire image processing workflow
    (Figure 3) can be fully automated, providing valuable insights into VGS health.
    Notably, the manual aspects of this study carry some limitations. The image projection
    process could impact accuracy, and the consistent mask for species separation
    from a specific date might not precisely depict species boundaries in subsequent
    images due to vegetation growth. Nevertheless, vegetation growth remains restricted
    due to the small size of the GW modules. In the continuous monitoring of both
    GWs, the yellowing event of Viola hederacea manifested as a decrease/increase
    in VIs values, a rise in standard deviation, and significant change in STD kernel
    across all VIs (Figure 7). In the north-facing GW, yellowing initially affected
    small sections, leading to a moderate decrease/increase in average VIs and a substantial
    upsurge in standard deviation and STD kernel values (Figure 7a). Hedera helix
    exhibited milder changes, potentially indicating a degree of stress without yellowing.
    Conversely, at the south-facing GW, the averages of several VIs consistently decreased/increased
    for both species since the summer, preceding the yellowing event, signifying the
    gradual deterioration of GW vitality over time (Figure 7b). Certain VIs were less
    sensitive and more stable over time (e.g., NDVI, SIPI), nevertheless, they were
    precise in detecting the yellowing event. Increased vegetation variation is generally
    viewed as a marker of stress [73,74]. The pronounced escalation in standard deviation
    values across all VIs during the yellowing event, along with a rise in several
    VIs’ STD kernels even before the event’s onset, highlights plants’ varied responses
    to stress conditions. This gradual change during the yellowing event suggests
    that plants did not experience immediate yellowing but responded in a non-uniform
    manner. This indicates that these parameters can serve as stress detectors in
    VGS as well. Some VIs were notably sensitive to shadow conditions, as observed
    in the final three images at the south-facing GW (Figure 7b and Figure A1 in Appendix
    A). Mixed shadow-sun conditions on 1 November also affected water content VIs,
    while several NIR-based VIs (such as RVI, NDVI, and SIPI) demonstrated lesser
    sensitivity to illumination changes, revealing the VIs’ trends. When devising
    a monitoring system utilizing image processing techniques in an outdoor environment,
    accounting for illumination variation along the VGS is crucial due to the vertical
    arrangement of the VGS and the intricate nature of the outdoor urban setting [75].
    Although we employed pixel-based spectrum normalization to address illumination
    variation in the vertical direction (Section 2.3.1), we did not account for shadowed
    areas. Our findings emphasize that normalized NIR-based VIs, such as NDVI, maintain
    consistent patterns even under varying lighting conditions while still providing
    information regarding plant conditions. Based on these observations, we propose
    that such VIs could serve as valuable tools to mitigate the effects of diverse
    illumination and uphold reliable vegetation monitoring in nonuniformed illumination
    areas. Further exploration into shadow treatment in VGS and in other urban settings
    is warranted. The time series of the ∆T index derived from TIR images provided
    supplementary insights into the plants’ water usage across the GWs (Figure 8).
    In the north-facing GW, a significant rise in the ∆T index was not observed until
    substantial sections of Viola hederacea along the GW displayed yellowing. Notably,
    the detection based on the ∆T time series lagged behind the HS VIs, where an increase
    was noted for both species only two weeks after the initiation of the yellowing
    event. This escalation in ∆T in the north-facing GW aligned with a sudden reduction
    in irrigation since 24 November (Figure 1e). Conversely, in the south-facing GW,
    ∆T increased progressively and remained elevated since the summer (August), extending
    through the yellowing event for both species. This pattern mirrored the HS VIs
    time series, indicating a gradual decline in the entire GW’s vitality over time
    (Figure 7b). The VIs and ∆T index time series from both GWs reveal that while
    plant species’ index values may differ, the trends throughout the study were similar,
    suggesting stress across the entire GWs. Nonetheless, the plants’ response to
    stress varied: one species (Viola hederacea) turned yellow and ultimately perished,
    while the other (Hedera helix) remained green and survived. This distinction in
    species’ stress response was mirrored in the ongoing VI monitoring, with more
    pronounced changes observed in the affected species, particularly reflected in
    heightened variation (i.e., standard deviation and STD kernel). Given that a GW
    often contains multiple vegetation species along the wall, species separation
    might be necessary when designing a remote sensing image-based monitoring system
    for more precise and comprehensive monitoring. Nevertheless, monitoring without
    separation can still offer insights into the GW’s overall vitality and generate
    stress maps for spatial issue detection. Early detection of stressed vegetation
    along the GWs was also explored in this study using RGB and HS VIs, as well as
    the ∆T thermal index, followed by Otsu unsupervised classification (Figure 10
    and Table 2). Plant yellowing is a symptom of a spectrum of problems, such as
    watering issues, temperature stress, lack of sunlight, insufficient nutrition,
    over-fertilization, disease, and pests. Although the precise cause of vegetation
    yellowing was not systematically diagnosed in this study, we presented initial
    findings highlighting the early detection of vegetation yellowing. The assembled
    data, including HS and TIR images, irrigation patterns, and environmental conditions,
    yields promising outcomes for the early detection of issues in VGS. These results
    offer an initial step toward gaining valuable insights into the causes of stress.
    While stress detection techniques in agriculture have progressed with the advent
    of machine learning and deep learning, our preference was to employ more straightforward
    approaches using image thresholding. Thresholding methods continue to be applied
    in stress detection and segmentation process in recent agricultural studies [76,77,78].
    Complex models demand extensive training datasets, particularly in our study’s
    context, where amassing substantial datasets of stress-affected pixels is undesirable
    in VGS. Additionally, the adoption of a simpler method establishes a baseline
    for future research in stress detection within VGS and presents an opportunity
    for further exploration as a practical tool. As anticipated, the HS VIs outperformed
    the RGB VIs, yielding superior outcomes for the early detection of stressed areas.
    Performance varied among the VIs groups and GW orientations (north/south). In
    the north-facing GW, the water content and leaf structure VIs exhibited the most
    reliable predictive capability, while in the south-facing GW, the HS pigment and
    leaf structure indices demonstrated superior performance in predicting stressed
    areas. Thus, we recommend using multiple sets of VIs for comprehensive plant parameter
    monitoring in image-based monitoring. Notably, the leaf structure VIs group demonstrated
    high performance in both orientations. Results from the north-facing GW revealed
    that 85% of stressed areas could be detected 17 days before visible yellowing
    (42 days before the ground-truth image) with an accuracy of 0.91. In the south-facing
    GW, 72% of the stressed area was detectable 14 days before visible yellowing (approximately
    two months before the ground-truth image), with an accuracy of 0.87. While early
    detection using ∆T in the north-facing GW exhibited lower performance compared
    to the water content and leaf structure VIs, it outperformed the pigment VIs group.
    In the south-facing GW, the performance of ∆T (alongside other VIs) was relatively
    diminished, likely due to data gaps and the limited time steps tested. Nonetheless,
    the visualization of the thermal index within stress maps (Figure 11) facilitated
    the identification of potential causes for vegetation stress. HS vegetation indices
    were most effective in the early detection of stress; nevertheless, RGB vegetation
    indices, such as the r and G indices, are effective for real-time stress detection
    indicated by color changes. Unlike the costly HS camera used in this study, RGB
    VIs can readily detect pigment alterations through simple manual or automated
    thresholding processes (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Developing an alert system for
    VGS based on RGB camera technology is feasible and could serve as an ongoing control
    system for large-scale VGS operations. Note that in this study we employed narrow
    RGB channels extracted from the HS camera. This likely resulted in higher accuracy
    compared to the use of broader channels commonly found in low-cost RGB cameras.
    Visualizing the HS VIs and thermal index through images (Figure 11) in conjunction
    with the irrigation patterns (Figure 1e) allowed us to pinpoint the cause of the
    plants’ stress in the north-facing GW. It is plausible that the yellowing event
    commenced in over-irrigated regions that were suddenly subjected to reduced irrigation.
    In the south-facing GW, although early yellowing occurrences were successfully
    detected, discerning the exact cause of plant stress proved challenging. An analysis
    of multiple indices’ time series from the south-facing GW (Figure 7b), including
    the thermal index (Figure 8b), revealed that the gradual decline in vegetation
    vitality commenced during the summer (August 2020), a full two months prior to
    the initial visual appearance of yellowing. Continuous irrigation over several
    months (from May to October) without adjustments to account for higher temperatures
    during the heatwave (14–22 May) and the summer months (July–August) (Figure 1e)
    likely initiated early plant stress. Moreover, the reduction in irrigation levels
    during October possibly exacerbated plant stress, ultimately culminating in the
    emergence of the yellowing event two weeks later. Monitoring large-scale outdoor
    VGS with cameras is mainly a challenging task due to their vertical orientation
    limiting the accessibility needed for optimal camera position. To tackle the maintenance
    issues associated with vertical structures, robotics solutions like cable-driven
    and rail track robots have been developed [14,34,79]. Researchers have also explored
    various image-based monitoring approaches for vertical crops like greenhouse tomatoes,
    using multiple cameras positioned at different heights [80], as well as the use
    of mobile robots [81,82]. In the context of the ongoing monitoring of large-scale
    VGS health, it is essential to collect spatial data that enables the early detection
    of problems. Achieving this is challenging with the methods mentioned above. Additionally,
    outdoor VGS typically do not yield the same commercial profits as agricultural
    structures, necessitating the search for simpler and more practical monitoring
    solutions than those previously discussed. Implementing ground-based monitoring,
    as conducted in this study, by stationing cameras in a fixed position on the ground,
    offers a straightforward approach to continuous surveillance. Although the normalization
    of spectral data facilitated data analysis, it is important to acknowledge that
    the vertical orientation in real-scale VGS could potentially influence the results.
    Nonetheless, the findings from ongoing monitoring, the early detection of stressed
    vegetation, and the visualization of stress maps, as demonstrated in this study,
    indicate the feasibility of this method for the broad-scale monitoring of large-scale
    VGS at the single image (without mosaicking). Alternative solutions, such as utilizing
    multiple camera positions or employing adjustable mounts or tracks positioned
    in front of the VGS, should be considered to mitigate the vertical impact while
    preserving spatial distribution. While our study presented the benefits of using
    precision agriculture methodologies in VGS, here we address certain limitations.
    The manual monitoring of specific ROI using expensive equipment (HS and TIR cameras)
    in our study raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of continuously monitoring
    VGS. To optimize ongoing monitoring, it is crucial to explore alternative approaches,
    such as using more affordable sensors and implementing fully automated operations
    that can cover large-scale VGS. Additionally, shaded areas, common in VGS due
    to their vertical structure, need further study to find treatment solutions when
    employing image-based monitoring techniques. Technical issues with the TIR camera
    unveiled temporal gaps in the time series, hindering our ability to draw conclusive
    findings for the south-facing VGS. Furthermore, our study focused on the symptom
    of ‘yellowing’ without delving into the underlying causes of stress. Unexplored
    factors like nutrition, lighting conditions, and insect-related stresses may introduce
    complexities not addressed in our analysis. To address these limitations, future
    research should investigate the causes of stress in VGS, providing a more comprehensive
    understanding of the underlying phenomena. 5. Summary and Conclusions The goal
    of this study was to examine the applicability of ground-based remote sensing
    techniques to monitor outdoor VGS. Additionally, we showcased a semiautomated
    approach for the early detection of vegetation stress and the visualization of
    spatially related issues through time series representation. The main conclusions
    of our study are as follows: Consistent monitoring utilizing HS and TIR images
    can identify shifts in VGS health through index values, standard deviation, and
    STD kernel metrics. Both vegetation species experienced stress, yet only Viola
    hederacea exhibited yellowing and eventual demise. Our observations suggest that
    the Hedera helix is less vulnerable to changes in irrigation patterns and can
    recover more effectively following stress events. Species differentiation is pivotal
    for meticulous monitoring, accounting for each species’ unique characteristics
    and stress responses. Nevertheless, monitoring and visualizing the overall GW
    over time, without segregating individual species, can offer invaluable insights
    into the overall health of the GW and facilitate the identification of spatially
    linked issues. Given the complexity of urban settings and the vertical arrangement
    of vegetation, variations in illumination should be considered when implementing
    image-based VGS monitoring, and further investigation is needed. Early detection
    performance of stressed vegetation ranged from 14 to 35 days before visible yellowing,
    with an accuracy of 0.85 to 0.91. The insights gained from this study could be
    harnessed to formulate an automated spatial decision support system that fosters
    more efficient VGS operations. Additional investigations into stress detection
    methods and the adoption of low-cost cameras in outdoor VGS should be explored
    under different conditions and with various plant species. Author Contributions

    1. Introduction Land degradation (LD) exerts adverse effects on water quality
    and nutrient availability [1] for approximately 3.2 billion people and about 40%
    of agricultural land [2]. Combatting LD is a prominent benchmark for the United
    Nations Sustainable Development Goals (for 2030) [3]. The term “LD” is variably
    defined, with each interpretation highlighting distinct dimensions of reduced
    land quality [4]. The spread of LD significantly impacts human health and community
    welfare, specifically in developing countries [5,6,7]. The continual degradation
    of agricultural lands is expected to persist in the coming decades, driven by
    resource scarcity, and this pressure compels farmers to exploit cultivated land
    for their livelihoods [1,8]. Global efforts since 2010 have suggested innovative
    interventions to arrest LD and rehabilitate compromised land at the regional and
    global scales. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by 193 nations
    in September 2015, came into effect in January 2016, with projections to shape
    economic, social, and environmental policies by 2030 [4]; many potentially lessening
    LD. The United Nation’s SDGs set a clear objective to reduce desertification by
    2030, encompassing sustainable forest management, combating desertification, and
    safeguarding and promoting sustainable terrestrial ecosystems, as well as reversing
    LD and halting biodiversity loss [9]. Drylands in arid regions presently occupy
    41.3% of the global land area and are projected to grow by 11–23% by the century’s
    close [10]. Although predominantly located in developing countries, these lands
    have significantly expanded [11]. Given that both agricultural and degraded lands
    are influenced by natural and socioeconomic factors, with the interplay of land
    use and cover [10,11], the management of lands in arid and semiarid regions is
    paramount for global change research. Thus, studying such lands in arid and semiarid
    regions is one of the primary necessities of global change research. Implementing
    the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) [12] to monitor
    and evaluate LD and monitoring management program performance requires approved
    scientific and practical methods. A lack of adequate and coherent monitoring and
    evaluation in the past has been suggested as a main limitation in combatting desertification,
    and implementing efficient programs requires careful analysis, the presentation
    of a clear scientific concept of processes, and LD incentives [13]. Detailed landscape
    information from a study area is needed to avoid, mitigate, and control LD. This
    study aims to determine the soil and land quality of the southeastern Caspian
    Sea region using land quality models and methods and to investigate the relationship
    between LD and development using a geopedologic approach. Central to a geopedologic
    approach is an evaluation of LD and other geohazards [14]. A geopedologic approach
    integrates the disciplines of geomorphology (genesis of landforms) and pedology
    (genesis of soils) to understand the relationships between landforms and soils.
    This approach examines the influence of geologic and geo-morphic factors on soil
    development, classification, and distribution [14,15]. Most studies utilizing
    a geopedologic approach have been based solely on the characteristics of the topography
    and surface geometry of the earth, and there is not enough focus on flat and coastal
    lands and the process of degradation or development of such lands. The present
    study significantly contributes to existing research on LD and geohazard evaluation
    through the innovative application of a geopedologic approach. Unlike previous
    studies, which often focused on the characteristics of topography and surface
    geometry, this research specifically addresses flat and coastal lands, investigating
    the processes of degradation and development in these areas using inherent and
    dynamic soil properties. The given study area can be considered as a plain (less
    than 2% general slip), utilizing a geopedological approach can provide a comprehensive
    understanding of the intricate relationships between landforms and soils in the
    southeastern Caspian Sea region. This approach not only enhances our ability to
    assess land quality accurately but also contributes valuable insights for effective
    land management strategies. The study aligns with global initiatives, such as
    the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Convention to
    Combat Desertification (UNCCD), emphasizing the importance of addressing LD for
    sustainable development. Through this research, the authors seek to fill gaps
    in current knowledge, laying the groundwork for improved monitoring, evaluation,
    and management of LD in arid and semiarid regions [9]. The present study addresses
    the environmental concern of LD and its impact on soil and human health and well-being
    in the southeastern coastal areas of the Caspian Sea. Using a novel geopedologic
    method, the research comprehensively evaluates soil and land quality dynamics
    influenced by salts in an area susceptible to seawater fluctuations and in which
    these sea water fluctuations have brought about the creation of diverse landforms,
    as confirmed by the authors of the present study. Identifying six distinct landforms
    through PSD granulometric curves and DEM information was supposed to enhance accuracy
    of land quality classifications [14]. Soil quality assessment, using both the
    Integrated Quality Index (IQI) and the Nemoro Quality Index (NQI), emphasizes
    the roles of soluble salts in soil quality and LD dynamics [9,13]. On the plus
    side, the present study demonstrates the potential of geopedologic approach to
    assess soil and land quality dynamics in global scales, with implications for
    informing land managers and policymakers against LD and fostering sustainable
    land development. Contributing the advancement of geopedologic knowledge for future
    studies will improve land management practices among environmental issues. 2.
    Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The southeastern Caspian Sea region was
    selected as the study area given that it is driven by its unique characteristics
    and current LD challenges. This region is particularly susceptible to seawater
    level fluctuations and different coastal landforms, including lagoons, barriers,
    and coastal plains. Such distinct environmental attributes create a unique opportunity
    for geopedologic analysis because researchers can investigate the intricate relationship
    between LD and soil development in a complex coastal setting (Figure 1). Furthermore,
    the significance of the southeastern Caspian Sea region goes beyond its distinctive
    geologic and geomorphic features. The region plays a crucial function in the context
    of environmental challenges, due to its susceptibility to LD. Investigating the
    dynamics of land and soil quality in selected areas has broader implications for
    addressing similar issues in arid and semiarid regions worldwide. The extent of
    the study area is about 480 km2 (20 km × 24 km) located on the southeastern coast
    of the Caspian Sea (54°21′10″ E, 37°18′57″ N:53°54′58″ E, 37°18′57″ N) (Figure
    1b). At the time of this study (Summer 2019), the shoreline of the Caspian Sea
    in the study area was −27 m below mean sea level [15]. The study area’s mean annual
    temperature is 17.6 °C (hottest month: August, mean 27.8 °C and coldest month:
    January mean 7.7 °C), the mean annual precipitation is 250–550 mm (ap-proximately
    350 mm in the study area) [16]. The southeastern Caspian Sea coast has a semi-arid
    climate, with a mean annual precipitation of 250–550 mm (approximately 350 mm
    in the study area) [15,16,17]. Figure 1. (a) The setting of the study area and
    (b) sampling points. The coastal plain in the study area is affected by sediments
    from three major rivers (the Gorgan, Atrak, and Qarah Soo), which pass through
    aeolian materials susceptible to erosion. The gradients of these rivers flatten
    abruptly upon entering the plains, and the speed of the water flow decreases [15,16].
    The rivers contain large quantities of suspended material which are deposited
    upon entering the lagoons and marshy environments and are eventually deposited
    as layers with a particular size distribution (mainly silt) [17]. Depending on
    the intensity of inlet currents and the turbulent or stationery nature of the
    sedimentary environments, the deposition sequence and particle size distribution
    vary widely. Topography of coastal regions, ocean currents, waves, and rapid sea-level
    changes are key factors controlling coastal geomorphology [16]. The coastal features
    of the Caspian Sea coast indicate that the morphology before the present state
    has formed barriers, barrier flats, lagoons, lagoon relict, lagoonal deposits,
    and coastal plains. The separation of landform units in flat coastal areas without
    strong physiographic differences limits precise landform classification. Therefore,
    in addition to satellite imagery and information derived from digital elevation
    model (DEM) (Figure 2) analysis, granulometry information (i.e., PSD) has been
    used [18] to identify soils in sedimentary environments (Figure 3). Figure 2.

    (PSD) curves which are proxies of PSD analysis in each detected landform. 2.2.
    Landform Definitions Six previously defined landforms were used to assess soil
    quality [18,19,20]: Relict (adjective): Pertaining to surface landscape features,
    e.g., landforms, geomorphic surfaces, and paleosols that have never been buried
    and yet are predominantly products of past environments. Lagoonal deposit: Sediments
    transported and deposited by wind, currents, and storm wash over on the various
    types of sand, silt and clay in the relatively low-energy, brackish to saline,
    shallow waters of a lagoon. Lagoon [coast]: A shallow stretch of salty or brackish
    water, partly or completely separated from a sea or lake by an offshore reef,
    barrier island, sandbank, or spit. [Relict landform] A nearly level, filled trough
    or depression behind the longshore bar on a barrier beach and built by a receding
    pluvial or glacial lake. Compare—sewage lagoon. Barrier flat: A relatively flat,
    low-lying area, commonly including pools of water, separating the exposed or seaward
    edge of a barrier beach or barrier island from the lagoon behind it. An assemblage
    of both deflation flats left behind migrating dunes and/or storm wash over sediments;
    may be either barren or vegetated. Barrier: Something (such as a fence or natural
    obstacle) that prevents or blocks movement from one place to another or a physical
    object that blocks the way. Coastal plain: A low, generally broad, plain that
    has, as its margin, an oceanic shore and its strata are horizontal or gently sloping
    toward the water; generally represents a strip of recently pro-graded or emerged
    sea floor, e.g., the coastal plain of the southeastern U.S. which extends for
    3000 km from New Jersey to Texas [19,20]. Since, in the present study, coastal
    landforms have already been detected through internal soil properties rather than
    external soil geometry and soil external properties [18], it should be mentioned
    that understanding how each landform affects land and soil quality is essential
    for a comprehensive analysis. For example, typically, lagoons are shallow/coastal
    water bodies which are separated from the sea by barriers, or coral reefs. These
    water bodies can affect soil and land quality by affecting the water table, soil
    salinity, and deposited sediment. Soil quality may be affected by the periodic
    saltwater pro/retrogradation, influencing nutrient availability and biochemical
    properties. Barriers affect the quality of the soil due to the type of sediment
    and vegetation cover, influencing fertility and stability. Coastal plains can
    contribute to land and soil quality through depositional situations and the availability
    of water fluxes [19]. To determine soil/land quality indexes, various physicochemical
    measurements were performed using standard methods as follows: the assessment
    of pH and electrical conductivity (EC) in soil paste extracts [21], of calcium
    carbonate equivalents through calcimetry [22], and analysis of anions (CO32−,
    HCO3−, Cl− using titration and SO42− via the acetone method). Additionally, cations
    (Ca2+ and Mg2+ by calcimetry, and Na+ and K+ by flame photometry) [22], sand,
    silt, clay, and SP, were also analyzed using standard procedures (methods of soil
    analysis, physical methods) [23], and determination of soil organic carbon (SOM)
    [24]. As shown in Figure 1b, 140 sampling points were selected from 7 rows, with
    each row containing 20 points (because of the paludal situation, four points had
    been lost from the last row). The reason for selecting a gridded sampling pattern
    was to cover all soil physicochemical changes along the shoreline to 20 km toward
    the east. On the other hand, to investigate soil quality indexes in tiny coastal
    landforms, using these kind of sampling points allows more samples from each landform
    to be used. Figure 4 shows the pro/retrogradation of Caspian Sea water in the
    last 45 years (1975–2020) and the resulting changes in coastal landforms. As shown
    in Figure 2, from 1975 to 2000, seawater progradation is observed, which causes
    the formation of a lagoon, and a seawater retrogradation movement is detected
    from 2000 to 2020. According to Figure 2, most of the development and agricultural
    activities have occurred in the study area during the last five years (2015–2020),
    affecting the soil and land quality in this area. Figure 4. Pro/retrogradation
    of Caspian Sea water since 1975–2020 (Landsat, USGS). An Integrated Quality Index
    (IQI) and Nemoro Quality Index (NQI) are calculated using Equations (1) and (2)
    according to two different approaches: a total data set (TDS) encompassing all
    study data and a minimum data set (MDS). Per Equation (1), the Integrated Quality
    Index (IQI) is obtained from the sum of the product of the weight of each attribute
    and the score of that attribute [25]. IQI= ∑ i=1 n W i . N i (1) Variable Wi is
    the weight assigned to each soil property, Ni is the score given to each property,
    and n is the number of properties used [26,27]. In Equation (2), the Nemoro Quality
    Indicators (NQI) are obtained based on the minimum and average of each feature.
    NQI= P 2 ave. + P 2 min. 2 − − − − − − − − − − − √ × n−1 n (2) Variable Pave.
    is the average score assigned to the selected features in each soil sample, Pmin.
    is the minimum score among the selected features for each sample, and n is the
    number of desired features [3,28]. Each indicator was determined for each soil
    sample using two sets of characteristics affecting soil quality, including TDS
    and MDS. Four general indicators were thus evaluated for each soil sample: IQIMDS,
    IQITDS, NQIMDS, and NQITDS. Statistical analyses, including PCA, Eigenvalues,
    and general statistics, were performed using SPSS V26 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
    USA), and maps were prepared and extracted by ArcMap V10.6.1 (ESRI, Redlands,
    CA, USA). The geopedologic approach subdivided the study region into distinct
    smaller areas. This approach enables the categorization of soil and land qualities,
    providing a more nuanced understanding compared to treating the entire study area
    as a uniform plain. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Identification of Coastal Landforms
    These analyses identified six distinct coastal landforms, including: barriers,
    barrier flats, lagoons, lagoon relict, and lagoonal deposits, and coastal plains
    have been identified using spatial configurations of contour lines extracted from
    digital elevation model (DEM) and particle size distribution (PSD) data. Understanding
    and classifying these landforms provide essential insights into the geomorphologic
    features of the study area [18]. PCA analysis with cumulative eigenvalues (Table
    1) identified significant variations in soil physicochemical properties among
    identified coastal landforms. A PCA was used to select the effective physicochemical
    properties studied for all segregated landforms and the study area without landform
    segregations. The results indicate that PCA values with cumulative eigenvalues
    >1 best segregate the landforms: lagoon relict, 84.73%; lagoon deposit, 82.45%;
    present lagoon; 88.74%; barrier flat; 84.83%; barrier; 94.25% and coastal plain,
    75.54% (Table 1). The eigenvalue for the entire study area, without landform separation,
    was equal to 71.31% (Table 2). Table 1. Results of principal component analysis
    (PCA) in distinguished landforms. Bolded values are indicators which obtained
    weighted loading values within a 10% range of the highest weighted loading within
    each PCs. Table 2. Results of principal component analysis (PCA) in the total
    study area. Bolded values are indicators which obtained weighted loading values
    within a 10% range of the highest weighted loading within each PCs (no landforms
    segregation). Table 1 and Table 2, show PCA-derived landforms and total area (not
    segregated landforms), respectively, based on a 10% weight difference. For example,
    in Table 1, [lagoon relict, PC1 column], has a high value of 0.96 (10% of 0.96
    is 0.096). Thus, if 0.096 is subtracted from 0.96 (resulting in 0.864), only values
    > than 0.864 would identify PCA values with >10 percent differences [25] (some
    of the studied criteria have been noted in bold, underlined fonts). Table 3 and
    Table 4 show selected criteria resulting in an MDS complex (from the 21 criteria
    in the TDS). The MDS complex was identified [29] based on soil conditions from
    the study area and included a set of physical and chemical properties. Table 3.
    Communalities and weight coefficients for each of the variables in TDS and MDS
    sets (segregated landforms). Table 4. Communalities and weight coefficients for
    each of the variables in TDS and MDS sets (no segregated landforms). We investigated
    MDS complex values for each landform and the entire study area with no landform
    segregation. For example, in the PCA columns in Table 3 and Table 4, two values
    were selected: the highest observed value and the values with a difference of
    less than 10%. Table 3 and Table 4 are based on a 10% weight difference, commonalities,
    and weight coefficients for each variable in the TDS and MDS sets investigated
    for segregated and no-segregated landforms, respectively. PCA analysis was able
    to use unique characteristics from each coastal landform to identify that landform,
    resulting in a geopedologic process which will be helpful for future environmental
    studies and coastal areas management [25,30]. 3.2. Particle Size Distribution
    (PSD) Analysis PSD analysis and associated granulometric curves, were used to
    identify specific coastal landforms by emphasizing sedimentary conditions. There
    are three classes of granulometric curves [14] and each one illustrates a unique
    sedimentary depositional environment: (1) a “Logarithmic curve” is characteristic
    of a torrential flow or splay deposit; (2) a “Sigmoid curve” is characteristic
    of free sediment accumulation; and (3) a “Parabolic curve” is characteristic of
    an accumulation forced by an obstacle obstructing the flow. Considering the granulometric
    classes and the shape of the obtained granulometric graphs, the reconstruction
    of past sedimentary conditions and environments that cannot be detected with the
    help of remotely sensed documents has been approached. The particle size distribution
    (PSD) of sediments is one of the principal indicators for understanding the fate
    of sediments under different conditions [31]. Using particle size distribution
    data and the resulting graphs, the presence of lagoons, barriers, barrier flats,
    coastal plains, lagoonal deposits, and lagoon relicts in the study area have been
    detected (Figure 3). As Figure 3 shows, the particle size distribution curves
    for the study area display the landform granulometric forms. Figure 2 shows the
    six landform types identified in this study and Figure 4 shows the past progradation
    of seawater and lagoon formation; sediment redeposition during the Holocene and
    the reworking of loess deposits are drivers of sediment sources. These results
    are in agreement with those of Kakroodi et al. [15,16] who studied rapid sea-level
    changes along the Iranian Caspian coast and Ghassemi and Gerzanti (2019) who examined
    Caspian sediments and loess related to the Gorgan Plain of Turkmenistan. The majority
    of the volume of the loess in the present study area was deposited in the Pleistocene
    era [17]; Frechen et al. (2009) discovered that northern Iran’s loess deposits
    near the Turkmenistan border are composed of a large fraction (more than 80%)
    of various silt sizes and materials and smaller fractions of various sand sizes
    and clay particles [32]. The results obtained by Frechen et al. [32] corresponded
    well with the present study’s PSD analysis, which shows the high amounts of silt
    at different depths. In the studies conducted by Kakroodi et al. [15], it is observed
    that, from 1992 to 2012, there were fluctuations in the pro/retrogradation of
    seawater. Therefore, there has been a backward-facing trend in recent decades.
    In 2015, Kakroodi et al. reconstructed Late Pleistocene to Holocene Caspian Sea
    levels in their study using a multi-disciplinary approach and a 27.7 m long core
    from the southeastern corner of the Iranian Caspian Sea coast in the Gomishan
    Lagoon [16]. Based on losses from the study area, the results reported by researchers
    about their origin, and the geopedologic approach conducted [14], the landforms
    identified in this study can be detected through PSD analysis. Fluxes in energy
    and seawater fluctuations have affected depositional patterns, and the granulometric
    curve patterns and conditions of depositions can be tracked through PSD analysis
    of soil using geomorphic features as a confidence fingerprint. Overall, PSD analysis
    offers beneficial information about the history of sedimentary conditions, which
    can help in the reconstruction of past environments [14,15,16]. 3.3. Soil Quality
    Index Models (IQI and NQI) Soil quality evaluation using IQI and NQI models delineated
    different quality classes for the discriminated coastal landforms, and highlighted
    the effect of seawater fluctuations (pro/retrogradations) on land quality. On
    the other hand, calculating the soil quality indexes and delineating the morphogenic
    environments and landforms can clarify the effect and relationship of geopedology
    on LD/development. Salinization is one of the most important issues in coastal
    areas related to soil and LD. It occurs due to the movement and release of water-soluble
    salts in an area with little or no concentration of salts. It causes the accumulation
    of carbonates, sulfates, chlorides, sodium, calcium, and magnesium in surface
    soil. Salinization can also happen in sediments and pores of rocks, and there
    are two types: primary and secondary salinization [33]. Primary salinity develops
    due to the presence of geological materials such as salt rocks, the climate (low
    rainfall and high evapotranspiration), or due to topography (low altitude areas,
    closed depressions, areas close to the sea, and areas affected by seawater fluctuations,
    which also affects the groundwater aquifer). In contrast, secondary salinity is
    mainly due to mismanagement and human activity. Salt-affected soils are formed
    by the influence of ions in the liquid or solid phase, which changes the soil’s
    physical, chemical, and biological properties [14]. Salinity affects the physicochemical
    and biological properties of soil, like SOM, E.C., pH, SAR, cations, and anions;
    therefore, changes in these properties can be used as indicators of LD. Specifically,
    soilscapes information (for example, the landscape’s pedology) and characteristics,
    and the composition of soilscapes in landscapes, have been discussed to better
    understand the relationship between the causes, processes, and the best set of
    indicators (TDS or MDS sets) for mapping and monitoring LD [14]. The effects of
    landforms affected by seawater fluctuation and circumstances on LD and development
    have been investigated based on the fact that the influence of ions in soil can
    alter soil’s physicochemical and biological properties. On the other hand, a geopedologic
    approach considers both topography of soils and climate changes. As the study
    area has been affected by seawater fluctuation [15], these periodic and continual
    seawater pro/retrogradations laid sediments which brought about the formation
    and evolution of the landforms. Figure 5 shows that the identified land quality
    classes are indicated in the 0–20 cm depth maps extracted by the IQI and NQI models
    run using the TDS and MDS methods. It has been proved that, by considering the
    IQI and NQI models, soils that were exposed to the seawater have different amounts
    of ions and variable quantities of physicochemical and biological indicators;
    in other words, it has been clarified that, by considering all of the factors
    in determining soil quality, some indicators could affect the assessments. As
    some indicators that are categorized in the “More is better” branch, for example,
    SOM and K, in marine environments, these can incorrectly influence the assessment.
    Figure 5. Land quality classified maps of the study area by landform segregation
    (Separated) and no landforms segregation (Totally). An inland water body, known
    as a coastal lagoon, can be found across all continents, usually oriented parallel
    to the coast or shoreline and separated from the sea by a barrier. A coastal lagoon
    is connected to the sea by one or more inlets which can be restricted or may remain
    open, at least periodically. A lagoon’s shallow water depths seldom can exceed
    a few meters [34]. Based on the definition of coastal lagoons, these landscapes
    have special situations in the first few years after exposure to seawater due
    to the limited ranges of soil quality indicators and because of the limited leaching
    situations and exceptionally high evapotranspiration in arid and semiarid regions,
    which can be classified into the lowest quality classes. Due to the limitations
    of high levels of salinity and ions in these areas, any cultivation is impossible,
    and they are ranked as the most inferior quality class (class IV). However, in
    lands far from the coastline that have not been affected by seawater fluctuations
    for a long time, such as the lands in the southern and southwestern parts of the
    study area, which, over time, have been affected by rainfall, artificial drainage,
    and plowing and farming activities, soil quality is currently being improved.
    The maps obtained with both IQI models, using the TDS and MDS methods, show the
    enhancement in the quality of these lands, as can be seen in Figure 5. Figure
    2 shows the natural remediation in the lagoon deposit and coastal plain areas
    (Figure 2). According to the results in Table 3 and Table 4, it is clear that
    the main effects on indicators of soil and land quality are due to the effect
    of water-soluble salts, and the presence of water-soluble salts plays a tremendous
    role in the processes of LD and development. As shown in Figure 5, for maps derived
    using the IQI and NQI models ran with TDS and MDS methods, without landform separation,
    only two identified classes (III and IV) of land quality are identified and the
    coarseness of the maps limits their usefulness. 3.4. Features Weighting Values
    for the contribution of each property (communality), resulting from the factor
    analysis (F.A.) using a TDS and MDS approach, are presented in Table 3 and Table
    4. The effectiveness of each feature in the models depends on the weight assigned
    to that feature; higher weight characteristics in the TDS or MDS model correspond
    to a more significant effect on the model, and less impact is assigned to the
    lower weight characteristics [35]. The weight calculation results in TDS and the
    MDS models with parameters having the highest weights/effects. The standard scoring
    functions suggested by Qi et al. [25] have been used to determine the soil properties
    (see Table 5). The upper and lower limits of soil quality rating for IQI and NQI
    models in TDS and MDS were identified and classified into three categories: More
    is better, Less is better, and Optimal, see Table 5. Linear functions were used
    to score data from researchers in different areas [30]. Table 5. Scoring functions
    and its parameters for soil quality variables. 3.5. Soil Quality Rating Soil quality
    evaluation is essential for understanding its potential for land use planning,
    agricultural activities, and the overall health of the environment [30,33,36].
    According to the classifications (soil quality grades) in Table 6, the results
    indicate that the study area is classified into classes II, III, and IV using
    each evaluation method and model. In fact, no noticeable differences in the evaluation
    and classification of the study area have been observed, either as separate landforms
    or as an integrated study without landform separation using the Nemoro method
    in both TDS and MDS. However, using the IQI method, it was found that an investigation
    into the landforms in the study area affected the final maps with the addition
    of one more class, both for the TDS and MDS, in contrary to evaluating with no
    segregation. On the other hand, with the separation of landforms, it has been
    found that the accuracy of classification increased compared to the study method
    used for the region (no landforms segregation). In the study without landform
    segregation, the study area was classified into only two classes, III and IV,
    while using landforms segregation increased classification and added Class II
    land quality. This method eventually isolated three quality classes: II, III,
    and IV, for the study area (Figure 5). Table 6. Soil quality rating in IQI and
    NQI models in TDS and MDS [20]. Of the 21 study soil parameters examined in the
    TDS model, SOM, CaCO3, SP, E.C., pH, Silt, Clay, Na+, Ca2+, Cl−, HCO3−, SAR, Mn2+,
    and Cu2+ had the highest repetition in the selection of the MDS model. Low organic
    matter content is one of the most important limitations of soils in arid and semiarid
    regions and low soil organic matter reduces fertility and quality, such as nutrient
    cycle, plant root growth, gas flow intensity, aggregate stability, microorganism
    activity, etc. SOM is decisive in soil quality stability, crop production, and
    environmental quality [26]. The predominant mineral carbonate in soils in arid
    and semiarid regions is calcium carbonate. Surface horizons with less calcium
    carbonate can be removed by erosion thus exposing the lower horizons with more
    calcium carbonate. In the study area, most of the soil had calcium carbonate accumulation.
    The high level of lime and low leaching in arid and semiarid regions increased
    the pH. High pH (7.10–8.75) is the main factor limiting the absorption of micronutrients,
    which negatively affects soil quality [3]. Table 3 and Table 4 showed the relationship
    between pH and sodium and calcium based on the high impact of SAR in determining
    land quality indices in arid and semiarid regions. The results showed that sodium
    and calcium affected the selecting SAR directly. On the other hand, physical factors
    (e.g., S.P.) which were classified as “more is better” have direct relationships
    with the percentages of silt and clay that have been classified in the optimal
    category. Since the soils from the study area showed high EC values, and according
    to the results obtained in present study, severe impacts of sodium and chlorine
    on EC values are reported. The PC1 column in Table 2, and lagoon relict, lagoon
    deposit, barrier flat, and coastal plain in Table 3 and Table 4, showed that the
    items which included EC, Na+, and Cl− were frequently selected in the MDS model;
    through statistical analysis, such a conclusion can be derived to categorized
    both Na+, and Cl− as “less is better” category, like EC [25,28]. The high salinity
    of the investigated soils, and their effect on the degradation of soil/land quality
    classes, is mainly due to the high levels of sodium chloride in these soils and
    which originated from the high concentration of sodium chloride in Caspian Sea
    water. These results are also strong evidence of the marine nature and the high
    impact of sea water fluctuations in the region. Also, in this study, heavy metal
    elements such as iron, manganese, copper, and zinc were studied, and it was found
    that the effect of copper and manganese on determining the land quality indicators
    is higher than the other two elements. These results also confirm the marine origin
    of the landforms in the study area. In a study conducted [37] in Tunisia, scientists
    studied the effects of the absorption and mobility of the above-mentioned elements
    in silty clay peloids for medical uses due to the high concentration of them in
    seawater. It was clarified that, by incorporating a geopedological approach into
    LD and development studies, results which are much more accurate to the reality
    of the study area will be created. In addition, the geopedological approach will
    assess LD and development. According to the results, it has been found that the
    presence of soluble salts has the highest impact on the degradation and development
    of coastal lands. For example, lagoon areas with special conditions are the place
    in which salts accumulate in the soil, and the quality of land in the landforms
    is reduced. Still, drainage rehabilitation can help reconstitute these areas and
    land quality classes. On the other hand, agricultural activities, as seen in the
    study area’s south and southwestern parts, have caused these lands’ revitalization.
    3.6. Geopedologic Approach Incorporating a geopedologic approach helped focus
    our analysis on both topography and seawater fluctuations derived from climate
    changes. The unique relationships between SOM, CaCO3, SAR, SP, E.C., and pH provided
    a comprehensive approach towards assessing land quality, which could guide precision
    agriculture and enhance sustainable land management practices. The study’s classified
    maps, generated through IQI and NQI models, revealed distinctive land quality
    classes, with a considerable influence of soluble salts on the assessed criteria.
    Analysis of the effects of seawater pro/retrogradation on landforms, and the subsequently
    salinization of these landforms, underscored the importance of geopedologic methods
    in understanding LD and development in coastal areas [17,18,20]. 4. Conclusions
    Soil quality assessment using an IQI versus an NQI approach resulted in a much
    better classification of land quality. The geopedological approach significantly
    enhanced scientific judgments in land use planning by integrating the disciplines
    of geomorphology and pedology. Through a detailed analysis of the relationships
    between landforms and soils, this approach provided a more nuanced understanding
    of how geologic and geomorphic factors affect soil degradation, soil development,
    and soil distribution. In the study area, the geopedologic approach identified
    specific landforms and evaluated their physiochemical properties, contributing
    to a comprehensive assessment of soil and land quality. Moreover, the geopedologic
    approach applied in this study resulted in a clear land quality classification.
    Targeted soil properties such as electrical conductivity, organic matter, calcium
    carbonate, sodium absorption ratio, etc., afforded a more holistic perspective
    on the intricate factors influencing land quality. This approach will support
    land use planning, particularly in regions affected by unique environmental factors,
    such as seawater fluctuation in arid and semiarid areas. Lastly, by considering
    the region without the segregation of landforms, high-impact elements selected
    as an MDS may not be accurate enough for the whole region. But when several different
    landforms are distinguished in the region, the effect of each factor can be clearly
    discerned. The success of this approach in enhancing land quality assessment and
    contributing to sustainable land management is relevant in similar systems elsewhere.
    In conclusion, the present study highlights the effectiveness of the geopedologic
    approach, specifically in assessment of soil quality using the IQI model compared
    to the NQI model. This method significantly improved the land quality classification
    and demonstrated the synergy between geomorphology and pedology in enhancing scientific
    judgments for land use planning. The detailed analysis of the relationships between
    landforms and soils provided a nuanced understanding of how geologic and geomorphic
    factors influence soil degradation and soil development. The geopedologic approach,
    which applied in this study, resulted in a clear land quality classification by
    assessing specific soil properties. This comprehensive perspective on soil’s physico-chemical
    factors supports effective land use planning, particularly in regions with unique
    environmental characteristics such as seawater fluctuation in arid and semiarid
    areas. Additionally, the success of geopedologic approach in understanding the
    impact of different coastal landforms contributes to more accurate and sustainable
    land management practices, while also demonstrating its relevance to similar systems
    at both national and international scales. The study’s findings contribute to
    the existing theoretical framework by showcasing the practical applications of
    the geopedologic approach in real-world settings. Furthermore, the direction of
    future studies is emphasized, recognizing the need for ongoing research in this
    field to enhance our understanding of land quality dynamics and improve sustainable
    land management practices. This study suggests that future research should investigate
    the impact of different coastal landforms on soil and land quality by expanding
    the applicability of the geopedologic approach. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    In the ever-growing demand for agricultural production, the use of pesticides
    and the consequential health risks is an issue that remains in the spotlight.
    The biomonitoring of pesticides in biological matrices is a mandatory task to
    point out the adverse effects on those people that are particularly exposed (i.e.,
    occupational exposure) and to customize the use of pesticides for safer and more
    aware agricultural practices (i.e., precision agriculture). To overcome the bottleneck
    of costs and long sample treatments, we conceived a paper-based analytical device
    for the fast and smart detection of glyphosate in human urines, which is still
    the most widespread pesticide. Importantly, we demonstrate how to face the analytical
    interference given by uric acid to develop an electrochemical sensor for glyphosate
    detection using paper as a multifunctional material. To this purpose, a sample
    treatment was pointed out and integrated into a paper strip to decrease the level
    of uric acid in urines, finally delivering a ready-to-use device that combines
    lateral and vertical flow. The effective decrease of uric acid after the paper-integrated
    treatment is verified by direct oxidation in differential pulse voltammetry, whereas
    glyphosate detection can be carried out by enzyme inhibition assay in chronoamperometry.
    The system showed a limit of detection for glyphosate of 75 μg/L and a linear
    range of 100 - 700 μg/L. Additionally, the sustainability of the paper device
    was assessed and compared with reference chromatographic methods. Overall, this

    biosensorsUric acidHorseradish peroxidase inhibition Introduction Since the spread
    of pesticides in agricultural practices after the second half of the twentieth
    century, several studies have been carried out to understand their effects on
    the environment and living beings. Continuous exposure to contaminated agricultural
    products leads to the bioaccumulation of these chemicals in living organisms with
    harmful effects on human and animal health [1,2]. Among pesticides, glyphosate
    is the most ubiquitous herbicide and crop desiccant in the world [3], representing
    a main concern due to its toxicity, including its carcinogenic potential [4].
    The U.S. National Nutrition Examination Survey revealed that glyphosate is still
    the most used pesticide in the U.S.A., finding its presence in representative
    urine samples of the population [5]. In European countries, glyphosate has been
    found widespread in urine samples, particularly for people who are exposed to
    pesticides for occupational reasons [3]. Faniband et al. [6] studied the excretion
    of glyphosate in human urine upon oral administration to volunteers, observing
    that the concentration reaches the maximum levels (higher than 200 μg/L and 1000
    μg/L for women and men, respectively) within 2 h after the intake. These findings
    highlight that the analysis of glyphosate in human urine can promptly reveal that
    severe exposure has occurred, as in the case of occupational exposure. Early biomonitoring
    of glyphosate intake in urines is important to control health risks and for the
    management of glyphosate usage in agricultural practices, which could be customized
    using the approach of precision agriculture [7] to minimize adverse effects. In
    this framework, the use of conventional analytical methods, such as chromatography
    and mass spectrometry [8,9], allows for reliable but limited monitoring, due to
    the need for a well-equipped laboratory, skilled personnel, and time/reagent-consuming
    as well as expensive/time-consuming analytical procedures (e.g., urine pre-treatment).
    As demonstrated in many fields, electrochemical (bio)sensors represent a valid
    option to obtain more sustainable analytical strategies, based on fast and cost-effective
    screening responses that can be carried out before performing confirmatory techniques
    [10], [11], [12]. In the sensor field, paper-based analytical devices have been
    exploited for a variety of applications resulting in an innovative approach to
    face the complexity of real matrices and answer the call for sustainability [13],
    [14], [15]. Over the last 10 years, the principle of sustainability has been translated
    into the sector of analytical chemistry defining new criteria for assessing sustainable
    analytical approaches [16]. For instance, Green Analytical Chemistry [17] focuses
    on the green aspects, listing 12 principles including the simplification of sample
    pre-treatment, the amount of sample needed for the analysis, the choice of miniaturized
    sensing devices, the decrease of waste after the analysis and the use of toxic
    reagents. A few years later, White Analytical Chemistry [18] introduced additional
    aspects, namely the analytical efficiency (e.g., maximizing the number of detectable
    analytes, the range of applicability, and compatibility with various types of
    samples) as well as practical/economic aspects (e.g., cost-efficiency, time-efficiency,
    simplicity of the overall method as well as the minimal need for advanced equipment,
    infrastructure, and personnel qualifications in favor of portability and easiness
    of usage). It is challenging to design and develop new sensing strategies able
    to fulfill all these criteria, but paper can provide breakthrough solutions. In
    the view of sustainability and screening biomonitoring, the paper combines multiple
    properties capable of matching many requirements needed for developing green analytical
    tools [19]. Using paper typically provides devices with competitive analytical
    results and the advantage of being cost-affordable and disposable sensing platforms
    (e.g., by incineration) for screening monitoring [20]. Cellulose structure has
    intrinsic microfluidic properties useful to store the reagents, manage sample
    solutions by capillarity, and promote reactions in a confined space [19]. Such
    versatility has been presented by the group of C. S. Henry in a pioneering study
    in 2009, in which the paper microfluidics was employed for the first time to screen-printing
    electrochemical cells for the multiplex detection of glucose, lactate, and uric
    acid in human serum [21]. This device was conceived as an enzymatic biosensor,
    exploiting glucose oxidase, lactate oxidase, and uricase to catalyze the oxidation
    of the corresponding substrates and measure the enzymatic by-product H2O2 in chronoamperometry,
    using Prussian Blue as electrochemical mediator. For the measurement, a 5-μL drop
    of sample solution was dropped on the device, allowing capillarity forces to drive
    the sample toward the reaction areas, where the enzymes were previously loaded.
    This smart approach showed the suitability of the paper in designing ready-to-use
    microfluidics devices with promising analytical performances also in a complex
    biological matrix such as human serum. After this first example, numerous studies
    have been carried out for biological samples [15,22] as well as for environmental
    monitoring [14,23] also exploiting origami-like architectures [24]. Particularly,
    one of the most recent examples of paper-based devices was reported by Arduini
    et al. [25] for the detection of three classes of pesticides namely organophosphorus
    insecticides, phenoxy-acid herbicides, and triazine herbicides. In detail, paraoxon,
    2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and atrazine were determined in aqueous solutions
    obtaining linear ranges within 2–20 μg/L, 100–600 μg/L, and 10–100 μg/L, respectively.
    The detection principle was based on enzyme inhibition assays, by exploiting the
    inhibitory activity of these pesticides on specific enzymes, namely butyrylcholinesterase,
    alkaline phosphatase, and tyrosinase, respectively. Later, the same group reported
    a paper-based flower-like biosensor for the detection of pesticides from the aerosol
    phase [26]. In this case, butyrylcholinesterase, alkaline phosphatase, and hydrogen
    peroxidase (HRP) enzymes were used for inhibition assays to detect paraoxon, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
    acid, and glyphosate, with linear ranges within 2–20 μg/L, 50–400 μg/L, and 50–150
    μg/L, respectively. In the present work, we exploited the paper properties to
    develop a paper-based origami biosensing strategy for the analysis of glyphosate
    in human urine. Taking inspiration from the previous works, the electroanalytical
    sensing of glyphosate is here based on the inhibition of HRP enzyme activity using
    3,3´,5,5´-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate [26]. Considering the analytical
    interference due to the presence of uric acid in human urine, we designed an easy
    sample treatment to reduce the amount of this species in the sample by precipitation
    under acidic conditions. Notably, this sample treatment was integrated into a
    paper strip, configured to combine lateral flow and vertical flow microfluidics
    in a single architecture (Fig. 1). By exploiting the porosity of the paper, all
    the reagents were pre-loaded in specific areas of a paper platform, allowing for
    the sample treatment as well as for the enzymatic inhibition assay without the
    use of any additional reagents. To carry out glyphosate detection and to check
    the effective decrease of the uric acid level after treatment, two separate paper-based
    printed sensors have been integrated into the same platform. They were included
    to perform, respectively i) evaluation of residual uric acid in the sample by
    differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and ii) glyphosate detection through enzymatic
    inhibition assay by chronoamperometry. Our work demonstrates the possibility of
    integrating a sample treatment into a ready-to-use paper-based analytical device
    to finally obtain a smart and sustainable analytical approach for glyphosate detection
    to overcome uric acid interference. Being characterized by low-impact, sustainable
    materials (i.e., paper), nontoxic reagents, and minimal waste production, this
    integrated device is also respectful of the principles of the White Analytical
    Chemistry, as demonstrated by the application of the sustainability assessment.

    and application procedures are described in detail in paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6.
    Materials and methods Reagents and equipment HRP, TMB, glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl
    glycine, 99.2% w/w), uric acid, ammonium chloride, sodium chloride, disodium sulfate,
    urea, creatinine, and Nafion™ 117 containing solution was purchased from Sigma
    Aldrich. All solutions were prepared with MilliQ water (18 MΩ×cm resistivity).
    Britton-Robinson buffer (BRB) at a concentration of 0.2 M was prepared using H3PO4,
    H3BO3, and CH3COOH; to adjust its pH to 5, adequate amounts of NaOH (0.2 M) were
    added. Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at a concentration of 0.1 M and a pH of 7.0
    was prepared with a concentration of 0.1 M Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4, adding 0.05 M
    of KCl. Syringe filters (PTFE/∅13 mm/0.22 μm/Organic) were purchased from Biocomma.
    The office paper-based screen-printed electrodes (SPE) were supplied from SENSE4MED
    Company (Rome, Italy) and consisted of graphite working and counter electrodes
    and Ag/AgCl pseudo-reference electrode (S4M-OP02), with geometric working electrode
    surface area equal to 12.6 mm2. Further commercial carbon SPEs (DR.−110) were
    purchased from Dropsens-Metrohm (geometric working electrode surface area equal
    to 12.6 mm2). Paper pads and paper strips were wax-printed on filter paper (67
    g/m2, Cordenons, Italy), as previously described [14]. Commercial carbon black
    (CB, N220) of the industrial standard grade was obtained from Cabot Corporation.
    The solutions of synthetic urine with a well-defined chemical composition that
    can be changed to test the effect of different components on enzymatic inhibition
    were prepared according to the procedure reported in our previous works [27].
    A portable potentiostat, Sensit Smart (PalmSens, Netherlands) connected to a laptop
    was used to carry out the electrochemical measurements. All data were recorded
    with PSTrace5 software and elaborated using OriginPro 8.5. Electrochemical enzymatic
    assay preliminary tests The inhibition of HRP enzymatic activity was estimated
    via chronoamperometric analyses using SPE previously modified via drop-casting
    with 2 μL of 1 mg/mL CB dispersion. A drop of 20 µL of synthetic urine, was put
    in contact with the working electrode surface of the SPE-CB. A drop of 2 µL of
    25 U/mL HRP in PBS solution was added followed by an incubation time of 5 min
    to activate possible enzyme inhibition. Then, 20 µL of TMB solution diluted 1:5
    v/v with synthetic urine was added to the drop, followed by a second incubation
    time of 2 min, necessary to activate the enzymatic reaction. Finally, the product
    of the enzymatic reaction was detected via chronoamperometric analysis by polarizing
    the working electrode a −0.2 V vs. pseudo-Ag/AgCl for 100 s. In each case, the
    inhibition percentage (I%) was calculated with Eq. (1): (1) where I0 and Ii are
    the currents recorded from the HRP enzymatic assay using TMB as substrate in the
    absence and in the presence of glyphosate, respectively. Urine sample pre-treatment
    Real urine samples were provided from the Microbiology Laboratory of the “Casa
    di Cura Giovanni XXIII of Monastier” in Treviso(Italy). The samples (volume of
    5 mL), stored at −20 °C just after the sampling, were defrosted at 4 °C just before
    the analysis and brought to room temperature (20 °C). In the preliminary tests
    with real urine, the initial pH of each sample was measured using a pH electrode
    (HI1083B, Hanna Instruments™) and, depending on the value recorded, small aliquots
    of 1.0 M solution of either HCl or NaOH were added to reach pH 5.0 and pH 8.0,
    to induce UA precipitation. A minimum volume of either HCl or NaOH was added to
    avoid significant dilution. For samples brought to pH 8.0, NaCl was added to a
    final concentration of 0.5 M to further promote UA precipitation. After 5 min,
    all samples (pH 5.0 and 8.0) were filtered using a syringe filter (polytetrafluorethylene,
    pore size 0.45 µm). The filters were previously activated with methanol and washed
    with MilliQ H2O before treating urine samples. The pre-treated samples were stored
    at 4 °C until testing. It is worth noting that the same pre-treatment steps were
    applied also to synthetic urine samples, as described in Section 3.2. For all
    spiked samples, the addition of glyphosate or uric acid was performed before the
    pre-treatment. Voltammetric detection of uric acid level The level of uric acid
    in the samples after the treatment was monitored by direct oxidation using the
    DPV technique, in the potential region between −0.1 to +0.6 V vs. pseudo-Ag/AgCl,
    applying a potential step of 7 mV and a potential pulse of 40 mV with a time pulse
    of 100 ms and a scan rate of 0.015 Vs-1. For tests in these solutions, 40 µL of
    the sample were directly drop-cast on the SPE-CB to perform DPV analysis. For
    tests on the paper strip, 60 µL of samples were drop-cast on the sampling area,
    then the sample flowed through the treatment area, reaching the uric acid detection
    area where DPV analysis was carried out at SPE-CB. Paper-based platform design
    The origami-like paper platform, composed of three paper layers overlapped: the
    treatment strip, the detection strip, and the layer with the screen-printed sensors
    (Fig. 1). The treatment strip (about 6 cm-length) presents a microfluidic pathway
    (about 0.7 x 8.0 cm) defined by wax, where 20 µL of BRB at pH 5.0 are pre-loaded
    for providing the on-paper treatment area. The wax pattern was obtained by using
    a ColorQube 8580 Xerox printer. The treatment strip is overlapped on the detection
    strip to allow the sample to flow through the layers by a vertical flow, reaching
    the underlying layer where two SPE-CB sensors are placed. At the end of the detection
    strip, which presents another lateral microfluidic pathway (about 0.7 x 8.0 cm),
    two pads are provided, confined by the wax barrier to pre-load separately the
    HRP enzyme (2 µL of a 25 U/mL HRP in PBS solution) and the TMB substrate (20 µL
    of TMB solution diluted 1:5 v/v in PBS), and left to dry at room temperature before
    use. Finally, a reservoir area allows the dropping of 0.1 M PBS buffer when the
    enzyme inhibition assay takes place, to ensure the dissolution of the reagents
    from the cellulose matrix and their reactions. The sample undergoes a lateral
    flow, first along the treatment strip and then the detection strip, in addition
    to the vertical flow through the paper layers. Analytical protocol When 60 μL
    of the sample is drop-cast at the beginning of the treatment strip, it flows through
    the lateral microfluidic pathway along which the treatment occurs. In the treatment
    area, the pre-loaded BRB (pH 5.0) creates the acid conditions that induce uric
    acid precipitation, as described in Section 2.4. After the treatment area, the
    sample flows vertically through the layers, reaching the first SPE-CB to detect
    the residual uric acid amount by DPV. The treatment can be repeated with other
    treatment strips until the signal due to uric acid oxidation is decreased sufficiently
    (below 20 μA). In the meanwhile, the sample flows through the lateral microfluidic
    pathway along the detection strip, reaching the area for the enzyme inhibition
    assay. The assay is carried out by folding the pads previously loaded with the
    enzyme and the substrate. Before the assay, 10 μL of PBS (pH 7.4) is dropped in
    the reservoir area to facilitate the diffusion of the sample throughout the microfluidic
    pathway of the detection strip, to ensure the dissolution of the reagents, and
    the correction of the solution pH for the enzyme inhibition assay. Thus, the HRP-loaded
    pad is folded on the strip to expose the enzyme for 5 min to the sample solution.
    Then, the TMB-loaded pad is folded to overlap the HRP-loaded for a reaction time
    of 2 min. Finally, the chronoamperometric signal is recorded by applying a potential
    of - 0.2 V vs pseudo-Ag/AgCl for 100 s. The chronoamperometric response in the
    presence of glyphosate is used to calculate the inhibition percentage (I%) with
    respect to the I0 (current of the enzymatic activity in the absence of inhibitors),
    according to Eq. (1). Results and discussion HRP-based assays in urine environment
    The inhibition capability of glyphosate towards HRP was exploited by Caratelli
    et al. [26] to develop a paper origami device for detecting glyphosate among multiple
    pesticides in the aerosol phase. They pre-loaded HRP and its substrate (TMB) on
    separated paper areas of a paper-based device to carry out an enzyme inhibition
    chronoamperometric assay by just exposing the HRP-loaded paper pad to an aerosol
    containing glyphosate as the inhibitor. In the present work, we translated this
    detection principle to urine samples, addressing the issue in a biological matrix.
    Chronoamperometry was chosen as the readout method for the HRP-TMB assay instead
    of colorimetric ones to ensure high sensitivity and selectivity for a complex
    matrix, such as urines. The electroanalytical performance was boosted by using
    CB, which allows for carrying out the HRP-TMB assay at a potential of - 0.2 V
    vs pseudo-Ag/AgCl [26]. To test eventual interfering compounds in urines, we evaluated
    the response of HRP-based assays in the presence of some main components in urines,
    namely uric acid, urea, or creatinine, all tested in standard solutions at physiological
    urine concentrations. In addition, synthetic urine with a complete composition,
    including uric acid at a physiological concentration, was tested as a medium for
    the HRP-based assay. These experiments were performed by dropping 60 μL of solution
    on an SPE-CB and collecting chronoamperometric responses (see Section 2.2). By
    comparing the current values recorded in these conditions (Fig. 2a), we can observe
    that urea and creatine are not responsible for any significant changes in the
    assay response, while the presence of uric acid decreases the current by about
    60%. A similar result was observed when the enzymatic assay was carried out in
    the synthetic urine medium. These findings suggested that the HRP-based assay
    is significantly affected by the presence of uric acid in the solution. Indeed,
    a decrease in the HRP enzymatic activity was observed also in samples of real
    urine. These observations are consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated
    that uric acid can act as an enzymatic substrate for HRP [[28], [29]]. Download

    a) Current decrease obtained from chronoamperometric responses of HRP-based assay
    obtained after the addition of TMB substrate in a drop of solution (60 μL) containing
    creatinine (17.7 mM), or urea (412.5 mM), or uric acid (2.1 mM), or synthetic
    urine composition [27]. The current intensity is expressed as the difference (∆i)
    between the i0 of the HRP/TMB system in buffer solution and if recorded in the
    presence of the different compounds listed above. b)  Chronoamperometric responses
    of HRP-based assay for 60 μL-drop in the presence of TMB substrate and uric acid
    at various concentrations: 0, 0.50, 0.75, 1.5, 2.5, 4.0 mM. Measurements were
    carried out in triplicate at SPE-CB, E = −0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl pseudo reference electrode.
    To better understand how this species affects the HRP-based assay, synthetic urine
    samples containing various amounts of uric acid within the physiological range
    (between 1.2 and 4.4 mM [30]) were mixed with HRP and left in contact for 5 min.
    Then, TMB was added to the sample solution and the chronoamperometric analysis
    was recorded after an additional reaction time of 2 min. A current decrease of
    about 85–100% was obtained in the chronoamperometric signal for uric acid concentration
    higher than 1 mM (Fig. 2b). Knowing that the physiological concentration of uric
    acid in human urine is between 1.2 and 4.4 mM [30], it represents an issue that
    limits the application of the HRP-based enzyme inhibition assay for glyphosate
    detection in urine. Treating physiological levels of uric acid in urine samples
    To tackle the issue of uric acid analytical interference in HRP-based assays,
    we used the properties of the paper as the key functional material to decrease
    the concentration of this species in the sample, exploiting the precipitation
    phenomena occurring in both acid and alkaline environments. Uric acid, in fact,
    is a weak diprotic acid with pKa1 = 10.3 and pKa2 = 5.6, whose precipitation equilibria
    are strongly dependent on the pH, Na+concentration, and ionic strength of the
    solution. The solubility curves of uric acid and the relevant monosodium urate
    form follow a specific trend with pH [31]. At pH values close to 8, a high Na+
    concentration can increase uric acid supersaturation with respect to the monosodium
    urate form, promoting its precipitation. On the contrary, for pH values equal
    to or lower than 5, the uric acid concentration is limited by the low solubility,
    inducing precipitation from the supersaturated urate solutions [32]. Knowing this,
    a pre-treatment procedure based on pH-driven precipitation [33] was developed
    to reduce the uric acid physiological level in urine samples. The samples (both
    synthetic urine and real urine) were treated to reach either pH 5.0 or 8.0 to
    promote uric acid precipitation and then were filtered to remove the precipitate.
    Note that 0.5 M NaCl was added to samples at pH 8.0, as indicated in Section 2.3.
    The changes in uric acid levels of both synthetic and real urine samples were
    evaluated considering the current intensity of the oxidation peak (Ipa) of uric
    acid [34] before and after the pre-treatment step, studied via DPV (Fig. 3). The
    responses were consistent with a meaningful reduction of uric acid content (30–40%)
    when the sample pH was adjusted to either pH 5.0 or 8.0 and then filtered (Fig.
    3a, b, d, e, green curves). Although both the acid and alkaline conditions were
    suitable for reducing uric acid content in solution, the pre-treatment at pH 5.0
    resulted in a more effective decrease in real urine (45–50% with respect to the
    original signal), even more than in synthetic urine (30–40%), as observed from
    Fig. 3c and f. Thus, the acidic treatment followed by filtration was considered
    the optimal pre-treatment protocol to be applied in this study. The effective
    decrease of the uric acid level in both synthetic and real urine samples enables
    the decrease of the interference on the HRP enzymatic reaction, allowing for carrying
    out the enzymatic inhibition assay based on glyphosate detection, as shown in
    the next paragraph. Download : Download high-res image (424KB) Download : Download

    the Ipa” is the percentage variation between the uric acid current peak registered
    before and after the pretreatment. Note that the peak potential changes are due
    to the pH variation influence on the uric acid oxidation process. Paper-based
    origami platform for glyphosate detection in real urine Having verified the role
    of uric acid in HRP-based assays and pointed out a protocol for the pre-treatment
    for pH-filtration to decrease the level of interference in urine samples, we adapted
    this analytical protocol to the customized paper-based origami platform. This
    latter was specifically designed to integrate the pre-treatment of the samples
    as well as the detection step within a disposable, easy-to-use, sustainable, and
    cost-affordable paper strip, thanks to the paper microfluidic. To achieve this
    purpose, the platform was loaded with all the reagents simply via drop-casting,
    including BRB for pH treatment, and HRP and TMB for the enzymatic assay, resulting
    in a fast preparation protocol (Fig. 1). The first step in designing this platform
    has been focused on integrating the treatment pointed out in Paragraph 3.2 within
    the cellulose matrix. Herein, the pH-filtration step was achieved by pre-loading
    a solution at pH 5.0 in the treatment area (Fig. 1, treatment area), exploiting
    the intrinsic adsorption/filtering properties of the paper to carry out the filtration
    in the selected acidic conditions. In detail, 20 µL of 0.5 M of BRB at pH 5.0
    were simply drop-cast in the treatment area and left to dry. Thus, 60 µL of the
    real urine sample was dropped in the sampling area to flow through the treatment
    area, where it got into contact with the pre-loaded BRB. By dissolving the BRB
    salts, the acid conditions are restored in the cellulose matrix and the pH treatment
    occurs together with the filtration process, thanks to the intrinsic properties
    of the filter paper in which the treatment takes place. Thus, the Ipa resulted
    in a decrease of about 50%, in agreement with the decreased percentage obtained
    for the pH-filtering treatment carried out in the liquid phase. No significant
    changes in the precipitation efficiency were observed by loading different volumes
    of 0.5 M BRB (data not shown). If the uric acid level still results too high after
    the on-paper treatment, a second treatment strip can be added to the platform
    before running the detection strip. In this way, the on-paper treatment can be
    repeated 1–2 times to further reduce uric acid levels. We observed that when the
    response of uric acid is decreased to a current lower than 20 μA, the glyphosate
    quantification can be carried out without significant uric acid interference.
    For instance, the use of a second treatment strip was found to provide an additional
    decrease of uric acid of 25% (data not shown). The final platform was completed
    with a paper layer composed of two office paper screen-printed sensors, with the
    working electrodes modified with CB (SPE-CB). The paper strips can be combined
    as shown in Fig. 1. The biosensing platform is assembled by overlapping the filter
    paper strips onto the SPE-CBs. When the sample is dropped at the beginning of
    the treatment filter paper strip, it runs along the strip thanks to horizontal
    microfluidic, undergoing the treatment directly inside the cellulose matrix. After
    the treatment, the sample reaches the first SPE-CB by vertical flow to control
    that the residual uric acid level with DPV analysis is under the 20-μA threshold.
    Thus, the sample flows along the detection strip until it gets in contact with
    the HRP-TMB system, which is allowed to react by folding the pads previously loaded
    with the HRP and TMB, separately. The folding sequence includes first the HRP
    pad, to get the enzyme in contact with the sample and eventually react with glyphosate,
    then the TMB pad, to enable the enzymatic reaction. The enzymatic reaction can
    be monitored in chronoamperometry using the second SPE-CB, which is wet by vertical
    flow, allowing for the detection of glyphosate through the enzyme inhibition assay.
    Conveniently, the total time for the analysis, from the sample addition to the
    final readout, is about 10 min, considering the 5-minute contact time between
    HRP and the sample solution, the 2-minute incubation in the presence of TMB, and
    the 1.7 min for running the amperometric scan. The complete analytical protocol
    was tested on several real samples of human urine, spiked with known amounts of
    glyphosate up to 700 μg/L (4.14 µM). Fig. 4 shows the chronoamperometric responses
    corresponding to HRP-based detection and the calibration plot obtained considering
    the I% calculated for glyphosate inhibition according to Eq. (1). In this screening,
    the I0 value corresponds to the chronoamperometric current recorded for real urine
    samples without any glyphosate contaminations. Increasing concentration of glyphosate
    resulted in a progressive decrease of chronoamperometric currents due to the inhibition
    of HRP (see inset of Fig. 4). A linear correlation between the I% and glyphosate
    concentration was observed in the range from 100 to 700 μg/L (i.e., 0.59 – 4.14
    µM), corresponding to an inhibition percentage comprised between 10% and 50%,
    respectively. The LOD in real urine was calculated for I% = 10% resulting in a
    value of 75 μg/L, while for glyphosate concentrations ≥ 700 μg/L the signal reaches
    saturation, as shown in Fig. S1. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download

    b) Calibration plot of glyphosate in spiked real urine samples, the error bars
    were calculated from triplicate measurements. These outcomes suggest that the
    origami platform can be used to monitor glyphosate overcoming the interference
    from uric acid in real human urine samples and avoiding time-consuming sample
    pre-treatment steps. The results are summarized in Table 1. This screening provided
    successful results since the real and experimentally deduced glyphosate concentrations
    showed a good agreement. Table 1. Uric acid level and glyphosate (GLY) measured

    ± 1 745 ± 4 99.3 Sustainability assessment The sustainability of the here proposed
    analytical approach was assessed by interrogating the method with the criteria
    of the White Analytical Chemistry, introduced by Nowak et al. [18] and based on
    previous sustainability assessment methods [[17], [35]]. This assessment is an
    innovative tool that points out what are the most commonly recognizable key aspects
    to evaluate the sustainability of an analytical methodology. To apply this assessment,
    it is necessary to analyze a total of 12 principles, including the analytical
    performance (4 “red” principles), practical and economical aspects of the methodology
    (4 “blue” principles), and the environmental friendliness and safety aspects (4
    “green” principles, in agreement with the Green Analytical Chemistry [17]). The
    red, blue, and green principles together provide a degree of “whiteness”, analogously
    to the RGB color model, in which fully saturated red, blue, and green colors give
    a white color. The White Analytical Chemistry approach provides a simple algorithm
    to assign to each principle a score between 0 (not sustainable) and 100 (fully
    sustainable), and overall, quantify the degree of sustainability (the “whiteness”).
    Moreover, the algorithm, which is provided as an Excel file, enables the comparison
    among several analytical methods by their sustainability scores. The summary of
    each principle is reported in Tables S1 and S2 while the criteria here used for
    score assignments are reported in Table S3, together with the Excel file, in the
    Supplementary material, in which a description of each principle is also reported.
    To critically evaluate the aspects of our method, a reference method for glyphosate
    detection was taken into consideration in this assessment. The chosen reference
    method is based on high-pressure anion exchange chromatography coupled with mass
    spectrometry (HPAEC-MS/MS) for glyphosate detection in several samples from a
    cattle farm [36], including urines. This method was selected among others not
    only for its relevance to our comparison but also because it reports enough information
    for the score assignment of each sustainability principle. The results of the
    assessment are illustrated in Fig. 5, with total scores (whiteness) equal to 87.2
    and 58.3 for the paper origami platform and HPAEC-MS/MS, respectively. It can
    be observed that the whiteness of our proposed method is significantly higher
    than the reference method, thus demonstrating that our method more fully meets
    the sustainability criteria. Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Scores resulted from the application of the
    Whyte Analytical Chemistry assessment [18] for the method based on our paper origami
    platform (A) and a reference method for glyphosate detection, namely HPAEC-MS/MS
    (B). The scores for the red, green, and blue principles are illustrated in (C)
    with the resulting whiteness. In detail, the analysis of the red principles results
    in medium-to-high scores equal to 66.3 and 91.3 for the paper origami platform
    and HPAEC-MS/MS, respectively. Among red principles, the resistance to the presence
    of potential interferences was assigned with the maximum score for both the paper
    origami platform and HPAEC-MS/MS method since both addressed this issue: the former
    is customized to overcome the possible interferences observed in urine samples
    (i.e., uric acid), while the latter allows for analyzing urine samples without
    any interfering effects. However, the linear range, the precision, and the LOD
    of our method are less performant than the ones of HPAEC-MS/MS, suggesting that
    the here proposed paper origami platform is recommendable as a sustainable tool
    for early screening applications. The analysis of the green and blue principles
    further confirms the higher sustainability of our method. Indeed, the green aspects
    are clearly advantageous for the paper origami platform (scores equal to 97.5
    and 62.9 for the paper origami platform and HPAEC-MS/MS, respectively), especially
    regarding the energy consumption, since our sensing platform, involving the need
    for only a portable potentiostat and a laptop, consumes much lower energy with
    respect to the chromatography/spectrometry-based instrumentation. Moreover, it
    is noteworthy that the very low volumes of reagents (< 50 μL) and sample (60 μL)
    used for our method, as well as the minimal waste production (e.g., the paper
    strips can be disposed of by incineration, reducing the waste and biological risk),
    strongly improve the sustainability of this method with respect to HPAEC-MS/MS.
    Finally, the analysis of the blue principles resulted in scores equal to 97.9
    and 20.8 for the paper origami platform and HPAEC-MS/MS, respectively. The aspects
    that rule this category, namely cost-efficiency, time efficiency, general requirements
    (including advanced instruments, skills, and facilities), and operational simplicity
    (including portability, automation, and miniaturization) point out a score markedly
    in favor of our paper origami platform, which encloses the advantages of very
    low total costs (< 5 euros), fast analysis (about 10 min), no need for skilled
    personnel or advanced instruments or skills, easy application with low consumption
    of sample (only 60 μL of sample needed for the analysis, directly dropped on the
    paper platform), in a handheld device that can be applied for at-line in situ
    analysis. Overall, this assessment shows that the combination of paper properties
    and the analytical strategy here conceived has produced a sensing device with
    competitive performance in terms of several aspects of sustainability, particularly
    suitable for screening analysis of glyphosate in human urine. Conclusions In this
    study, we implemented the applicability of an HRP-based enzymatic inhibition strategy
    for glyphosate detection in a complex biological sample, namely human urine, as
    a key indicator for the presence of pesticide traces in the human body upon severe
    exposure to contaminated environments (e.g., occupational exposure). This strategy
    was combined with the decrease of uric acid level in human urine, which acts as
    the main interfering agent in our analytical methodology. To achieve this goal,
    we first developed an analytical pH-driven treatment capable of reducing the effect
    of this interfering species on HRP. Our studies highlight that uric acid in urine
    samples can be decreased by adjusting the pH of the solution either at acidic
    (i.e., pH 5.0) or alkaline (i.e., pH 8.0) values, coupled with a filtration step.
    Subsequently, we have integrated this treatment principle into a paper origami
    platform. By exploiting the properties of filter paper, we designed a device based
    on i) a treatment paper strip with a lateral flow microfluidic path, to drive
    the solution through the treatment area, where the required reagents are pre-loaded,
    and ii) a vertical microfluidic path to enable electrochemical analysis on CB-modified
    office paper SPEs, obtained by overlapping the treatment strip and the detection
    strip on the sensors. Having pre-loaded all the needed reagents on the paper strip,
    we showed that our platform can perform multiple analytical steps in a single
    ready-to-use device, namely: i) to apply the pH-based treatment and decrease the
    uric acid level, ii) to assess the efficiency of the treatment by checking the
    level of the residue uric acid, and iii) to carry out the HRP-based inhibition
    enzyme assay for glyphosate detection. Overall, our proposed paper origami platform
    represents an advanced analytical solution that merges the problem-solving strategy
    of an analytical issue (i.e., interference in the real matrix), the use of green
    materials and reagents, minimized volumes and waste (e.g., the paper device can
    be easily incinerated), user-friendly design and operability, and reduced costs
    and time of analysis. These properties match efficiently the sustainability criteria,
    as demonstrated by applying the principles of White Analytical Chemistry, in comparison
    with chromatography/spectrometry-based methods for the detection of glyphosate
    in urine, resulting in a suitable analytical tool for inexpensive, easy-to-use,
    prompt, and in situ screening of severe exposure to glyphosate. The promising
    results achieved by our paper origami platform in terms of green, operational,
    and economical aspects are the outcome of an analytical strategy successfully
    driven by a sustainable view, to which the scientific community must drive its
    attention and efforts. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    1. Introduction In today''s rapidly evolving world, the agriculture industry stands
    at the threshold of a revolutionary transformation. With the increasing demand
    for food production and the challenges posed by climate change, agricultural firms
    are exploring innovative technologies to revolutionize the way we protect our
    crops. Advanced technologies have emerged as a beacon of hope, offering promising
    solutions to mitigate risks and enhance plant protection in the agricultural sector.
    This paper delves into the exploration of cutting-edge technologies that are revolutionizing
    agriculture, focusing specifically on plant protection. By harnessing the power
    of advanced technologies, agricultural firms can not only safeguard their crops
    from pests, diseases, and environmental factors but also enhance productivity
    and optimize resource utilization. These technologies have the potential to reshape
    traditional agricultural practices, providing sustainable solutions for a rapidly
    growing global population. The advent of precision agriculture has paved the way
    for sophisticated techniques that enable farmers to monitor and manage their crops
    with unparalleled precision. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high-resolution
    imaging systems can capture detailed data about crop health, identifying areas
    of concern and enabling targeted interventions. This information allows farmers
    to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control,
    optimizing resource allocation and minimizing environmental impact. Furthermore,
    the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors in agricultural
    operations enables real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making. Soil
    moisture sensors, weather stations, and automated irrigation systems work in tandem
    to maintain optimal growing conditions and ensure efficient water usage. By leveraging
    this interconnected network of devices, farmers can detect anomalies, predict
    pest outbreaks, and take preventive measures, thereby reducing the reliance on
    chemical pesticides. Advancements in genetic engineering have also played a pivotal
    role in revolutionizing plant protection. Scientists have developed genetically
    modified crops with enhanced resistance to pests and diseases, reducing the need
    for chemical interventions. These bioengineered varieties not only offer higher
    yields but also contribute to sustainable farming practices by minimizing the
    environmental impact associated with traditional crop protection methods. In addition
    to these breakthrough technologies, machine learning and artificial intelligence
    have emerged as indispensable tools for analyzing vast amounts of agricultural
    data. By employing algorithms and predictive models, farmers can gain valuable
    insights into crop performance, disease patterns, and pest behavior. This information
    empowers them to implement proactive measures, optimize treatment strategies,
    and make accurate predictions, ultimately maximizing crop yields and profitability.
    As we explore the realm of advanced technologies for plant protection in agricultural
    firms, it is crucial to address the ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding
    their implementation. Striking a balance between innovation and responsible use
    of technology is vital to ensure sustainable agricultural practices and maintain
    consumer trust in the safety and quality of our food. Continue Reading References

  description: Neural network models play an important role in crop extraction based
    on remote sensing data. However, when dealing with high-dimensional remote sensing
    data, these models are susceptible to performance degradation. In order to address
    the challenges associated with multi-source Gaofen satellite data, a novel method
    is proposed for dimension reduction and crop classification. This method combines

    demonstrate that the fusion network, which extracts low-dimensional characteristics,
    offers advantages in classification accuracy. At the same time, the proposed model
    is compared with methods such as the decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support

    than the above methods, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed model
    was verified through experiments. Additionally, the model demonstrates a strong
    robustness when classifying based on new data. When extracting the crop area of
    the entire Yangling District, the errors for wheat and corn are only 9.6% and
    6.3%, respectively, and the extraction results accurately reflect the actual planting
    situation of crops.

    of agricultural distribution is a crucial prerequisite to the efficient management
    of crop planting in precision agriculture [1,2,3]. Traditional approaches to obtaining
    crop-planting structures primarily involve field investigations or manual segmentation,
    in conjunction with high-definition satellite imagery. However, the efficiency
    of these methods is exceedingly low. In the case of planting types with complex
    crop structures, extensive coverage, and significant temporal changes, they are
    prone to human error, and cannot fulfill real-time requirements. In contrast,
    the utilization of automatic crop recognition using machines has been demonstrated
    to be an efficient and cost-effective alternative [4]. It also represents a vital
    direction for the advancement of precision agriculture. Satellite remote sensing
    technology plays a crucial role in efficient land information acquisition. By
    employing appropriate backend data-processing techniques, it becomes possible
    to extract valuable agricultural information from satellite data [5,6,7,8,9].
    This enables efficient and real-time crop identification [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20].
    Among them, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) [21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]
    methods have been proven effective in extracting agricultural information from
    remote sensing data. These methods (ML and DL) utilize feature learning to achieve
    target classification, leading to improved information extraction results. They
    have become one of the main approaches to obtaining crop distribution information.
    In the field of remote sensing image data analysis, ML methods, such as the support
    vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) have demonstrated
    practicality in various applications. These methods have been successfully utilized
    for tasks such as corn-planting-area extraction [15], ground-object-type classification
    [16], and crop classification [20]. The application of ML methods in agricultural
    information extraction tasks using remote sensing data has proven to be feasible
    and efficient. Furthermore, compared to traditional ML methods, DL methods, particularly
    the convolutional neural network (CNN), exhibit a superior ability to learn complex
    features [29]. Hu et al. [30] introduced a DL method called hyperspectral image
    classification based on CNN (HICCNN), which demonstrated excellent feature-learning
    capabilities in object classification. In their study of crop classification based
    on the Sentinel-2 dataset, Seydi et al. [25] proposed a method that combined CNN
    and a dual-attention module. This approach successfully classified various crop
    types, such as alfalfa, broad bean, wheat, barley, and rape, and achieved excellent
    classification results. DL methods excel in performance by training model parameters
    with ample sample data. However, obtaining comprehensive and accurate ground truth
    distribution information can be challenging, especially in cases of complex crop-planting
    structures and scattered planting areas. This limitation results in a scarcity
    of training samples, hindering the classification ability of the model and, ultimately,
    impacting the accuracy of the crop-planting information extraction. To tackle
    this issue, one approach is to increase the amount of information available in
    the remote sensing data. By incorporating more dimensional information for training
    purposes, and fully utilizing the original remote sensing data, it becomes feasible
    to achieve a desirable classification accuracy with fewer samples [31,32]. Multi-temporal
    remote sensing images, acquired at different time points, capture temporal changes
    in crops, and provide valuable information in the time dimension [33,34,35,36].
    Zhang et al. [37] demonstrated the enhanced accuracy of crop identification through
    the utilization of multi-temporal data, in a study based on Sentinel-2 data. Furthermore,
    leveraging data from multiple satellite sources can offer additional remote sensing
    information from diverse angles and bands. Balancing the contradiction between
    the input data dimension and model performance degradation is crucial in achieving
    an optimal classification performance with limited samples. When dealing with
    high-dimensional data, the Hughes phenomenon [38] can arise if the input data
    have too many dimensions, thereby impacting the model’s performance. One effective
    approach to address this challenge is to utilize stacked autoencoder (SAE) networks,
    which excel in extracting low-dimensional characteristics [39,40,41,42]. The SAE
    network consists of multiple autoencoders, stacked and interconnected to extract
    low-dimensional features through an encoding and decoding process. Both SAE networks
    and the CNN operate on the principle of gradient-descent-based forward propagation,
    and error backward propagation. Therefore, combining the strengths of both approaches
    can result in a characteristic dimension reduction, and an improved classification
    performance. In this context, a model called the fused stacked autoencoder and
    convolutional neural network (FSACNN) is proposed, to facilitate the extraction
    of crop-planting areas. The FSACNN model can simultaneously perform data dimensionality
    reduction and classification tasks, leveraging the advantages of stacked autoencoders
    and the CNN. In this study, the experiments were conducted in Yangling District,
    known for its abundant resources for wheat and corn cultivation. As a national
    agricultural demonstration zone, Yangling provides comprehensive and easily accessible
    data on the distribution and area of various crops, which greatly facilitated
    the implementation of the experiments, and the analysis of the data. Satellite
    images from Gaofen-1, 2, and 6, covering the research area, were obtained. With
    the use of these remote sensing data, a multi-temporal dataset was constructed,
    including spectral, texture, and vegetation indices, which served as inputs for
    the fusion network. The proposed model, along with DT, RF, SVM, HICCNN, and the
    characteristic selection classification based on a convolutional neural network
    (CSCNN) models, was employed to classify crops in the study area. Additionally,
    the study verified the classification advantages of the low-dimensional characteristics
    extracted by the proposed network. 2. Materials 2.1. Study Area In this paper,
    the crop-planting area of Yangling Agricultural Demonstration Zone is extracted.
    Yangling is China’s first national agricultural high-tech industry demonstration
    zone, located in Shaanxi Province. The study area is depicted in Figure 1, where
    the red box represents the coverage range of a scene captured by the Gaofen-6
    satellite. Figure 1. Study area. The study area encompasses diverse land-cover
    types, encompassing crops, industrial crop plantations, residential houses, and
    greenhouses. The primary food crops cultivated are wheat and maize. For the purpose
    of this study, the land-cover types were classified into six categories: winter
    wheat, corn, other vegetation excluding winter wheat and corn (such as grassland
    and forest land), bare land, buildings (including urban and rural houses, and
    industrial plants), and greenhouses (including those covered with plastic mulch).
    2.2. Dataset Selection and Data Processing Due to cloud cover and rain, it is
    challenging for a single spectral satellite to obtain continuous and high-quality
    images. However, the use of multiple satellites can provide a wider range of information,
    through angle differences. Thus, for this study, multispectral images from Gaofen-1,
    Gaofen-2, and Gaofen-6 (GF-1, GF-2, and GF-6) were selected as the raw data. These
    satellites are optical remote sensing satellites that can capture images in the
    red, green, blue, near-infrared, and panchromatic bands [43,44]. The composite
    RGB (red, green, blue) image obtained by the three satellites is shown in Figure
    2. The area circled in red represents the study area. Figure 2. Composite RGB
    image. Based on the field investigation, it was observed that the color of the
    wheat crop gradually deepened as it entered the jointing and heading stage in
    April. This change made the crop characteristics more prominent, and facilitated
    the selection of the training samples in the satellite images. Consequently, the
    satellite images captured between April and June were carefully reviewed, and
    three cloud-free images were chosen as the multi-temporal data sources for the
    experiment. These images were acquired using the high-resolution cameras onboard
    the respective satellites, and their parameters [45] are presented in Table 1.
    Table 1. The data acquisition dates and basic information of the main crops in
    the experimental area. In the data acquisition process, each satellite provided
    a multispectral image with four bands (red, green, blue, and near-infrared), as
    well as a separate panchromatic image. Before further analysis, the acquired remote
    sensing data underwent pre-processing steps using ENVI software, to ensure the
    data were accurate and ready for subsequent analysis. Firstly, radiometric calibration,
    atmospheric correction, and orthographic correction were performed on the multispectral
    image of each temporal phase. Radiometric calibration is a crucial step in the
    processing of multispectral imagery. It involves converting the raw sensor measurements
    into physically meaningful units of radiance or reflectance. Following the radiometric
    calibration, atmospheric correction was applied, to account for the influence
    of the Earth’s atmosphere on the multispectral imagery. The orthographic correction
    aligned the image with a geographic coordinate system, ensuring spatial accuracy,
    and allowing for the precise measurement and analysis of features on the Earth’s
    surface. Then, the panchromatic images for each phase underwent radiometric correction,
    and orthophoto correction. For the radiometric calibration, the radiometric calibration
    tool in ENVI was utilized, to calibrate the panchromatic data to the atmospheric
    apparent reflectance. Subsequently, the radiometric calibrated data underwent
    orthophoto correction, using the “RPC Orthocorrection Workflow” tool in ENVI.
    Finally, the multispectral and panchromatic images were fused by Gram–Schmidt
    image fusion, to obtain the multispectral fusion image. The sampling rate of the
    pre-processed GF-1 and GF-6 images was 2 m, and the sampling rate of the GF-2
    image was 0.8 m. In order not to lose image information, the GF-1 and GF-6 data
    were resampled to 0.8 m, and accurately matched with the GF-2 image. In order
    to train a classification model, and accurately evaluate its classification accuracy,
    reliable ground truth data are necessary. However, due to the large size of the
    research area, obtaining complete ground truth data can be challenging. Therefore,
    sample data from two representative regions were selected for the model training.
    Through field investigations and the visual interpretation of high-resolution
    images, the distribution data of six land types were obtained. These land types
    included winter wheat, corn, other vegetation excluding winter wheat and corn
    (such as grassland and woodland), bare land, urban (including urban and rural
    houses, industrial plants, etc.), and greenhouse structures (made of plastic film
    or materials). Figure 3 displays the true distribution of these land types on
    the ground. Figure 3. Ground truth of the training sample area. To construct the
    input data for the crop classification model, it is important to include characteristic
    information. This can be achieved by utilizing processed multi-spectral data to
    derive spectral characteristics. Additionally, incorporating textural characteristics
    in remote sensing image classification can be valuable in addressing the issue
    of “foreign objects with the same spectrum” in optical remote sensing image interpretation.
    Among the satellite images acquired, the GF-2 panchromatic image stood out, due
    to its highest spatial resolution, at 0.8 m, and prominent textural characteristics.
    Therefore, textural characteristics were extracted based on the GF-2 panchromatic
    images. The grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method, initially proposed
    by Haralick [46], is widely employed in image textural characteristic extraction.
    In this study, a set of 14 s-order statistics defined by GLCM are utilized to
    represent the extracted textures. Considering the correlation between the texture
    quantities and the computational requirements for high-resolution images, eight
    commonly used GLCM texture measures, namely the mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast,
    dissimilarity, entropy, angle second-order matrix, and correlation [46], were
    selected as the GLCM texture characteristics for this research. The utilization
    of vegetation indices is highly effective in distinguishing between vegetation
    and non-vegetation areas, making this a promising approach to crop information
    extraction. By leveraging multispectral data, three specific vegetation indices
    can be calculated: the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), the ratio
    vegetation index (RVI), and the anthocyanin reflectance index 2 (ARI2). The NDVI
    is widely used to assess the growth status of vegetation [47]. On the other hand,
    the RVI serves as an indicator for measuring the vegetation growth and abundance
    [48]. The ARI2 is commonly utilized in vegetation health detection and crop yield
    analysis, among other applications. By combining the spectral characteristics,
    the GLCM textural characteristics, and the vegetation index characteristics, a
    29-dimensional multi-temporal dataset is formed. Each characteristic is assigned
    a corresponding identifier for subsequent analysis. Table 2 provides a comprehensive
    list of all the characteristics, and their respective identifiers. The formula
    for calculating the three vegetation indices is given below: 𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼=(𝑁𝐼𝑅−𝑅𝑒𝑑)/(𝑁𝐼𝑅+𝑅𝑒𝑑)
    (1) 𝑅𝑉𝐼=𝑁𝐼𝑅/𝑅𝑒𝑑 (2) 𝐴𝑅𝐼2=(2×𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛−𝐵𝑙𝑢𝑒−𝑅𝑒𝑑)/(2×𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛+𝐵𝑙𝑢𝑒+𝑅𝑒𝑑) (3) Table 2. All
    characteristics used in this paper. In Formula (1) to (3), NIR, Red, Green and
    Blue represent reflectance values of near-infrared band, red band, green band
    and blue band respectively. 3. Methodology In this study, a crop classification
    model is developed, with the objective of improving classification accuracy, utilizing
    multi-dimensional characteristics, consisting of multi-temporal spectral data,
    textural characteristics, and vegetation index information, as the input for DL
    algorithms. The aim is to take advantage of the diverse information sources, to
    enhance the classification accuracy. Moreover, the high dimensionality of the
    input characteristics can lead to the Hughes phenomenon, a practical challenge
    where increasing the dimensionality of the data may result in a reduced classification
    performance. To address this issue, the SAE network is integrated with a CNN architecture.
    This integration effectively reduces the dimensionality of the data, while preserving
    the relevant information, resulting in a crop classification model with the ability
    to handle higher-dimensional input data. 3.1. Extraction Process of Crop-Planting
    Area Figure 4 provides a flow chart illustrating the process of extracting the
    crop-planting areas. The first step involves preprocessing the satellite images
    obtained at each time phase. This preprocessing comprises radiometric calibration,
    atmospheric correction, orthographic correction, and image fusion. The registration
    and fusion are conducted simultaneously, to ensure accurate and merged images.
    Ground truth maps are created through field investigations and visual interpretation,
    using ENVI software. These ground truth maps serve as the reference for classification.
    Following this, the necessary classification characteristics are constructed as
    input data for the model. The final step involves training the model, using the
    constructed input data, and subsequently utilizing the trained model to classify
    crop-planting areas. Figure 4. Flow chart of the process of extracting the crop-planting
    area. 3.2. Data Dimensionality Reduction Method for Stacked Autoencoder Network
    In the proposed method, the SAE is utilized as a multi-layer structure, consisting
    of interconnected simple autoencoders [42]. Figure 5 illustrates the structure
    of a single-layer autoencoder, comprising an input layer, an intermediate hidden
    layer, and an output layer. Notably, the data dimension of the intermediate hidden
    layer is smaller than that of the input layer. The purpose of the autoencoder
    is to reconstruct the input signal to match the output, through the supervised
    training of the parameters [42]. By performing this reconstruction, the autoencoder
    achieves an effective dimensionality reduction in the data in the intermediate
    hidden layer. Figure 5. Structure of the autoencoder. The dimensionality reduction
    is achieved through the following process. In the autoencoder, the input data
    are 𝑥={ 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2 ,…, 𝑥 𝑛 } , the intermediate hidden layer output is ℎ={ ℎ 1
    , ℎ 2 ,…, ℎ 𝑚 } , and the autoencoder output is 𝑦={ 𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 ,…, 𝑦 𝑛 } . The
    encoding and decoding process is as follows: ℎ=𝑓( 𝑾 𝑦 𝑥+ 𝒃 𝑦 ) (4) 𝑦=𝑔( 𝑾 𝑧 ℎ+
    𝒃 𝑧 ) (5) Here, 𝑓(⋅) and 𝑔(⋅) are the activation functions of the encoding and
    decoding process, which are generally sigmoid functions; 𝑊 𝑦 are the weight matrices
    between the neurons in the input and middle layer; 𝑊 𝑧 are the weight matrices
    between the neurons in the output and middle layer; 𝒃 𝑦 is the bias between the
    neurons in the input and middle layer; and 𝒃 𝑧 is the bias between the neurons
    in the output and middle layer. The autoencoder continuously trains the parameters
    𝑊 𝑦 , 𝑊 𝑧 , 𝒃 𝑦 , and 𝒃 𝑧 by minimizing the loss function through the back propagation
    algorithm. The loss function is the mean-square error (MSE) between the output
    layer signals and the input layer signals. In this way, the autoencoder realizes
    the dimension reduction of the original input data, without reducing its ability
    for data information expression. The SAE network is constructed by stacking multiple
    layers of single autoencoders, as depicted in Figure 6. Each layer of the autoencoder
    is trained individually, and the output of the previous layer serves as the input
    for the subsequent layer. This allows the network to form a model with an enhanced
    capability for extracting low-dimensional characteristics, compared to a single-layer
    autoencoder. Figure 6. Structure of the stacked autoencoder. 3.3. The Fusion Network
    Model of Stacked Autoencoder and CNN Both the SAE and CNN networks share the fundamental
    principles of forward propagation and error backpropagation using gradient descent.
    This commonality in the training process provides a theoretical basis for network
    fusion. Taking advantage of the SAE network’s excellent data dimensionality reduction
    capability, and the CNN network’s classification advantages, an innovative network
    model that combines the SAE and CNN is constructed for the purpose of crop-planting
    area extraction. This model, known as the FSACNN, consists of four main parts:
    data input, data dimension reduction, characteristic extraction, and classification.
    The overall structure of the FSACNN method is presented in Figure 7. Before being
    fed into the fusion network, the SAE network is pre-trained. Subsequently, the
    data are inputted into the trained data dimension reduction component for dimensionality
    reduction, and the reduced-dimensional data are used as the input for the classification
    component. Simultaneously, the parameters of the data dimension reduction component
    are fine-tuned, by incorporating the classification results. This approach enables
    the organic integration of the two networks, resulting in an overall improved
    performance. Figure 7. Structure of the FSACNN. In the data dimensionality reduction
    part, the FSACNN method sequentially connects four autoencoders, to achieve dimensionality
    reduction in the multi-temporal remote sensing data. Once the dimension reduction
    is complete, the data can still be regarded as a sequence that maintains intra-class
    correlation. Therefore, one-dimensional convolution can be applied, to extract
    relevant characteristics from the data. This allows for effective feature extraction,
    and subsequent classification tasks. In the feature extraction part of the FSACNN
    method, a three-branch parallel structure is constructed, using one-dimensional
    convolution, to enable the extraction of characteristics from different perception
    fields [49]. Considering the high correlation between adjacent points in the sequence,
    the first branch employs two convolutional layers, consisting of 1 × 3 convolution
    kernels, to extract the features that capture the relationships between neighboring
    points in depth. The second branch utilizes a single convolutional layer, with
    a 1 × 5 convolution kernel, to extract sequence characteristics over a broader
    range. The third branch incorporates a convolution layer with a 1 × 1 convolution
    kernel. This operation can be seen as the entire sequence passing through a fully
    connected layer, resulting in the sequence obtaining a single-point characteristic
    representation. Once the sequence characteristics have been extracted, using the
    respective convolutional layers, batch normalization operations and the linear
    rectifier function (ReLU) are applied, to process the data. This helps to normalize
    and activate the extracted features, respectively. After the three-branch network
    structure, the Add operation is used, to accumulate the characteristic activation
    values extracted by the three branches and, finally, the probability results of
    all classes are obtained using the Soft-max classifier, to complete the classification.
    Meanwhile, the parameters of the dimension reduction part of the fusion model
    will be continuously optimized during the training process, to achieve a better
    data dimension reduction effect. 4. Experimental Results and Analysis Firstly,
    regions A and B were classified. At this point, the experiment was conducted under
    two conditions: the training data belonged to the classification area, and they
    did not belong to the classification area. Subsequently, the performance of the
    dimensionality-reduced characteristics, and their impact on the model classification
    accuracy, were analyzed. Finally, the main crop areas in the entire study area
    were extracted. The F1-score, overall classification accuracy (OA), and kappa
    coefficient (kappa) [50] were calculated, to evaluate the performance of the method.
    Among them, the F1-score was used as an evaluation index of a single category,
    and the OA and kappa were used as evaluation indicators for the overall classification.
    At the same time, the FSACNN method was compared with the DT, RF, SVM, HICCNN,
    and CSCNN methods. Among them, the CSCNN method used a correlation metric to automatically
    select the feature combination with the highest correlation to the sample label
    data. Then, these features were fed into the proposed CNN classification network
    for crop extraction. The parameter settings for the various methods were as follows.
    Decision trees: there was no maximum depth limitation, at least two samples were
    required for further node splitting, and the Gini coefficient was used for splitting.
    Random forests: construct random forests with 100 decision trees, consider the
    number of features equal to the square root of the total number of features when
    splitting nodes, and at least one sample was required in the leaf nodes. Support
    vector machines: the penalty strength was set to 1.0, the Gaussian radial basis
    function was used as the kernel function, and the reciprocal of the features was
    used as the gamma value. The loss function for the CSCNN, HICCNN, and FSACNN models
    was the cross-entropy function. The learning rate was set to 0.0001, and the training
    iterations were set to 300 times. 4.1. Condition 1: The Training Samples Belong
    to the Classification Area In this experiment, both the training and test data
    were selected from the same experimental area. The training data for region A
    consisted of a random sampled 10% of each type of sample, while the crop-planting
    areas in region A were classified accordingly. Similarly, the crop-planting areas
    in region B were classified in the same manner. The obtained performance data
    for the different methods are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Table 3 displays
    the classification accuracy of the various methods for region A, while Table 4
    shows the classification accuracy for region B. Upon examining the tables, it
    becomes evident that the FSACNN, HICCNN and CSCNN methods outperform traditional
    ML methods, in terms of the accuracy for ground object classification within the
    two experimental areas. The CSCNN method with feature selection operation performs
    slightly better than the HICCNN. Notably, the FSACNN method exhibits a superior
    performance compared to the HICCNN and CSCNN methods. Indeed, this suggests that
    utilizing feature dimensionality reduction networks for feature optimization yields
    better results than simple feature selection methods, based on the correlation
    analysis. These findings demonstrate that the FSACNN method, in particular, improves
    the accuracy of ground object classification in both region A and region B, compared
    with traditional ML methods. Table 3. Classification accuracy of each method for
    area A under condition 1. Table 4. Classification accuracy of each method for
    area B under condition 1. For region A, the OA and kappa coefficient of the FSACNN
    method reached 98.57% and 0.97, respectively, and the OA was increased by 7.95%,
    4.69%, 5.68%, 1.21%, and 1.10%, respectively, compared with the DT, RF, SVM, HICCNN,
    and CSCNN. Compared with the DT, RF, SVM, HICCNN, and CSCNN, the kappa coefficient
    increased by 0.14, 0.09, 0.10, 0.03, and 0.01, respectively. For region B, the
    OA and kappa coefficient of the FSACNN method reached 97.76% and 0.94, respectively,
    and the OA was 9.72%, 5.74%, 6.53%, 2.50%, and 1.88% higher than the DT, RF, SVM,
    HICCNN, and CSCNN. Compared with the DT, RF, SVM, HICCNN, and CSCNN, the kappa
    coefficient was increased by 0.19, 0.14, 0.15, 0.06, and 0.02, respectively. Figure
    8 and Figure 9, respectively, show the classification results for regions A and
    B, and the corresponding satellite imagery. Among the different methods, the classification
    results of the DT method (as shown in Figure 8a and Figure 9a) exhibit a noticeable
    “salt-and-pepper” phenomenon. This phenomenon can be attributed to the influence
    of “foreign matter with the same spectrum” between wheat, corn, and other vegetation
    types. As a result, the classification results for winter wheat and corn can become
    mixed with some other categories of vegetation. This issue leads to the blurring
    of boundaries between crop-planting areas and other types of vegetation, especially
    in plots that are adjacent to low-growing vegetation. Figure 8. Classification
    results for each method for area A under condition 1. (a) DT. (b) RF. (c) SVM.
    (d) HICCNN. (e) CSCNN. (f) FSACNN. (g) Satellite imagery. Figure 9. Classification
    results for each method for area B under condition 1. (a) DT. (b) RF. (c) SVM.
    (d) HICCNN. (e) CSCNN. (f) FSACNN. (g) Satellite imagery. It can be seen from
    Figure 8b,c and Figure 9b,c that the classification results for the SVM and RF
    are similar to those of the HICCNN, CSCNN and FSACNN. However, there is still
    a considerable amount of mixed classification between wheat and other vegetation.
    The classification results obtained through the FSACNN method (Figure 8f and Figure
    9f) demonstrate an overall reduction in salt-and-pepper noise. Additionally, the
    integrity of the distributed crop-planting area is good, and the extraction accuracy
    surpasses that of the HICCNN and CSCNN methods. This is because, compared with
    other methods, the FSACNN method utilizes its data dimensionality reduction ability
    to mitigate any negative impact that high-dimensional data may have on the model.
    Simultaneously, during the training process of the FSACNN method, the batch normalization
    operation is introduced, to standardize the input of each layer. This enables
    the network to continually adapt to new data distributions, and optimizes the
    training effect of the network. However, from an objective standpoint, it can
    be observed that the salt-and-pepper noise has not been entirely eliminated. Based
    on the classification results, although the proposed method exhibits a relatively
    reduced impact of salt-and-pepper noise compared to other methods, it is still
    slightly present. 4.2. Condition 2: The Training Samples Do Not Belong to the
    Classification Area In order to further analyze the adaptability of the FSACNN
    method to new data, experiments were conducted using training samples that did
    not belong to the classification area. Region A was chosen for analysis, due to
    the uniformity of each ground-cover type in that area, which facilitated the analysis
    of the classification results. The model was trained using training data from
    region B, and the crop-planting area in region A was classified accordingly. The
    results are presented in Table 5 and Figure 10. Upon examining Table 5 and Figure
    10 together, it becomes apparent that several methods experience a certain decline
    in prediction accuracy when predicting new data. Nonetheless, the FSACNN method
    still produced the most favorable results. The OA and kappa coefficients reached
    87.15% and 0.83, respectively, while the F1-scores for wheat and corn reached
    0.97 and 0.87, respectively. Figure 10. Classification results for each method
    under condition 2. (a) DT. (b) RF. (c) SVM. (d) HICCNN. (e) CSCNN. (f) FSACNN.
    (g) Satellite imagery. Table 5. Classification accuracy of each method for area
    B under condition 2. Compared to the FSACNN method, both the DT and RF classifiers
    exhibited a lower classification accuracy. This can be attributed to the unbalanced
    distribution of training samples for each type, and the significant differences
    in characteristics between regions A and B. Additionally, Figure 10c reveals that
    the SVM struggles to effectively distinguish between greenhouses and architectural
    structures. Furthermore, referencing Table 3 and Table 5, it can be observed that
    when classifying new data, the proposed method experienced a decrease of 11.42%
    in the overall OA, and a decrease of 0.15 in the kappa coefficient. On the other
    hand, the HICCNN and CSCNN experiencd a decrease of 18.36% and 14.21% in the OA,
    and a decrease of 0.23 and 0.18 in the kappa coefficient. Therefore, the FSACNN
    method exhibits a stronger adaptability to new data, compared to the HICCNN and
    CSCNN. When it comes to classifying new data, the CSCNN performs slightly better
    than the HICCNN. The aforementioned results demonstrate that the FSACNN method
    displays a high capability to differentiate various crops, vegetation, and other
    land-cover types. As a result, it offers a strong applicability in accurately
    extracting crop-planting areas from multi-temporal optical remote sensing data.
    4.3. Performance Analysis of Characteristic Dimensionality Reduction We randomly
    selected 10% of each class of samples from all the samples in region A plus region
    B as training data for the training and characteristic dimensionality reduction
    of the dimensionality reduction part of the fusion network. The dimensionality
    reduction process was carried out with a structure of 29-18-12-6. As a result,
    six-dimensional reduced features were obtained, denoted as Ft-30 to Ft-35. To
    evaluate the characteristics belonging to each class, including all the characteristics
    before and after dimensionality reduction (Ft-1 to Ft-35), the standard deviation
    was calculated. Additionally, the standard deviations of the characteristics across
    all classes were also calculated. Figure 11 plots the standard deviations of characteristics
    within the same category, and for all categories. Figure 11a–f shows the standard
    deviation of various characteristics belonging to wheat, corn, other vegetation,
    urban, bare ground, and greenhouses. Figure 11g shows the standard deviation for
    each characteristic in all six categories. It can be seen from this that the standard
    deviation of the characteristics after dimensionality reduction is the lowest
    in the same category. Meanwhile, for all categories, the standard deviation of
    the characteristics after dimensionality reduction is the highest. Therefore,
    it can be concluded that the reduced dimensionality characteristics have fused
    the expression capabilities of the original characteristics. Compared to the original
    characteristics, the reduced dimension characteristics provide the best uniformity
    for the same category, and provide the best comparison between different categories.
    Figure 11. Standard deviation of the various characteristics. (a) Wheat. (b) Corn.
    (c) Other vegetation. (d) Urban. (e) Bare ground. (f) Greenhouse. (g) All classes.
    The fusion model proposed in this paper was trained using the aforementioned training
    samples. The training was conducted under two scenarios: with characteristic dimensionality
    reduction, and without characteristic dimensionality reduction. Additionally,
    10% of all samples were randomly selected as a test set, to evaluate the classification
    accuracy. The results are presented in Figure 12. It can be observed that the
    model with characteristic dimensionality reduction exhibits an improved classification
    accuracy, compared to the model without dimensionality reduction. Specifically,
    the OA and kappa coefficient increase by 1 percentage point and 0.03, respectively.
    Hence, it can be concluded that performing dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional
    characteristics before classification helps to alleviate the degradation in the
    model performance caused by the Hughes phenomenon. Figure 12. Classification accuracy
    before and after characteristic dimensionality reduction. 4.4. Extraction of Crop
    Area in the Entire Region The model was trained using sample data from regions
    A and B. The area of the main crops was extracted from the entire study area.
    The planting distribution of wheat and corn in Yangling District is shown in Figure
    13a,b. It can be observed that wheat is primarily distributed in the northwest
    and northeast regions of Yangling District, as well as in the central area that
    spans from north to south. On the other hand, the distribution of corn shows a
    relatively uniform pattern. Figure 13. Distribution of the main crops in Yangling
    District. (a) Wheat. (b) Corn. According to publicly available data from the Shaanxi
    Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the planting areas of wheat and corn in Yangling
    District for the year 2021 have been obtained. Figure 14 illustrates a comparison
    between the government’s statistical data, and the planting areas extracted in
    this paper. The results indicate that there is a discrepancy between the extracted
    area and the official statistics. However, this discrepancy only accounts for
    9.6% and 6.3% of the total planting area, respectively. One possible explanation
    for this discrepancy could be the variations in planting conditions caused by
    the differences in the data collection time and the satellite imagery acquisition
    time. Additionally, it should be noted that some errors might exist in the statistical
    yearbook data. Hence, the extracted area could, to some extent, reflect the actual
    crop-planting situation. Figure 14. Planting area of the main crops. 5. Discussion
    In the classification experiments on the entire images of Region A and Region
    B, it can be observed that traditional ML classification methods often exhibit
    a lower accuracy due to significant class confusion in the classification results.
    This may be attributed to the relatively insufficient feature learning capabilities
    of traditional ML methods, compared to DL methods with complex network structures
    [51,52]. Another aspect worth discussing is the model’s adaptability in classifying
    new data, which is also an important criterion in evaluating the model. In experiments
    where the training samples do not belong to the classified regions, the proposed
    model demonstrates a higher adaptability, compared to other methods. This can
    be attributed to the strong feature learning capability of the CNN classification
    network employed in the proposed model. This part of the network leverages three
    branches, with different convolutional layers, to learn features more comprehensively.
    Moreover, the introduced batch normalization operation enables the network to
    continuously adapt to new data distributions. Therefore, this method could serve
    as a valuable reference for other ground-information extraction tasks. Although
    the effectiveness of this method has been well validated in the crop area extraction
    experiments in Yangling, further research is needed concerning the crop-area extraction
    on a larger scale. For larger-scale crop-area extraction tasks, the strategy for
    selecting training samples may need to be adjusted slightly. It is important to
    avoid the excessive concentration of samples during selection, to maintain their
    representativeness. Additionally, the extraction of crop areas on a larger scale
    is subject to constraints imposed by weather conditions, making it challenging
    to obtain cloud-free optical images for the entire region. Therefore, it is necessary
    to consider integrating optical and SAR images in future research, to mitigate
    the effects of weather. Furthermore, different types of ground cover should be
    taken into account in large-scale scenarios; for instance, when dealing with areas
    that include bodies of water, such as lakes, a mask operation could be performed
    prior to crop classification recognition. 6. Conclusions In this research paper,
    a novel approach called the FSACNN was proposed, specifically for the task of
    extracting the crop-planting areas from high-dimensional characteristic input
    classification patterns. The method combines data dimensionality reduction and
    classification techniques, to optimize the extraction results. The performance
    of the FSACNN was evaluated using a multi-temporal hyperspectral remote sensing
    dataset from the Yangling Agricultural Demonstration Zone, and it was compared
    with other methods. The results of the study indicate that the FSACNN method outperforms
    the compared methods, achieving a superior extraction effect for crop-planting
    areas. Moreover, the method demonstrates a strong robustness when predicting new
    data, which has implications for other tasks involving surface-information extraction.
    Comparisons with statistical data on crops in the Yangling District demonstrate
    that the extracted crop-planting areas reflect the actual planting situation,
    to a certain extent. It is worth mentioning that the data used in this study came
    exclusively from optical satellites. The next focus of the research will be how
    to apply the FSACNN method to other types of satellite data. Author Contributions

    Versions Notes Abstract The European Green Deal has set a concrete strategic plan
    to increase farm sustainability. At the same time, the current global challenges,
    due to climate change and fuels and commodity market crises, combined with the
    COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine, affect the need for quality
    food and necessitate the reduction of negative external effects of agricultural
    production, with fair remuneration for the farmers. In response, precision agriculture
    has great potential to contribute to sustainable development. Precision agriculture
    is a farming management system that provides a holistic approach to managing the
    spatial and temporal crop and soil variability within a field to improve the farm’s
    performance and sustainability. However, farmers are still hesitant to adopt it.
    On these premises, the study aims to evaluate the impacts of precision agriculture
    technologies on farm economic, agronomic, and environmental management by farmers
    adopting (or not) these technologies, using the case study method. In detail,
    the work focuses on the period 2014–2022 for two farms that cultivate durum wheat
    in central Italy. The results suggest that the implementation of precision technologies
    can guarantee economic and agri-environmental efficiency. The results could serve
    as a basis for developing a program to start training in farms as well as to suggest
    policy strategies. Keywords: precision agriculture; durum wheat; Italy; case study;
    economic impact; agri-environmental impact; sustainability; nitrogen efficiency;
    profitability 1. Introduction The transition towards a sustainable agricultural
    system is a priority to ensure the Sustainable Development Goals (in particular,
    SDGs 2.3 and 12.4) of the United Nations Agenda 2030, as well as the European
    Green Deal objectives. In particular, the European Commission has set a concrete
    strategic plan to reduce the use of chemicals and fertilizers, enhance biodiversity,
    and assist farmers in decision-making processes to increase farm sustainability.
    In addition, the current historical period and geopolitical framework lead to
    significant impacts on the agricultural sector. In particular, wheat production
    is currently affected by a significant stock depletion and price volatility. Starting
    with COVID-19 in 2020, the unexpected spread of the pandemic and the resulting
    lockdowns and closures around the globe led to an unavoidable critical situation
    related to the export restrictions and the changes to the purchasing behavior
    of wheat derivatives, such as flour [1]. These circumstances have put Europe and
    countries such as Italy in severe deficit conditions in terms of stocks, which
    also derives from the increased price volatility. Price volatility can be partially
    traced to uncertainty over the flow of supplies, depending principally on current
    production and existing stocks. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that
    global wheat ending stocks for the 2022/2023 marketing year will be around 267
    million metric tons. More than half of these stocks will be held by China, while
    EU, USA, and other major exporters account only for 20%. China’s wheat stocks
    increased by over 160% between 2012 and 2020. This was largely due to changes
    in China’s agricultural policy, which increased producer support prices, resulting
    in the accumulation of large government stockpiles [2]. By contrast, wheat stocks
    held by the rest of the world declined by 12% over same period. Moreover, the
    ongoing war in Ukraine has contributed to reduce the wheat production in the country,
    disrupting the markets worldwide. The Russia–Ukraine war has caused the highest
    increase, since 2008, in levels and volatility of prices in agricultural markets
    for wheat, creating an ongoing vulnerability for global food security [3,4,5,6].
    One difference between the two periods is the scale of the disruptions in staple
    food markets. While the period of initial pandemic lockdowns saw some isolated
    volatility, the Russia–Ukraine war is affecting all major food staples [7]. The
    relative tightness of global stocks suggests that price volatility will continue
    to remain high in respect to the past 10 years. Going forward, rebuilding inventories
    of wheat and other key global crops would help to reduce both prices and price
    volatility. By the same token, tight stocks mean that an unforeseen production
    shortfall in a major wheat producing region would likely send prices sharply higher
    again (as in 2010/11 and 2012/13) and result in increased price volatility. In
    addition, fertilizer prices are a determinant factor more now than at the beginning
    of the pandemic, where the situation was already compromised. Even if the prices
    were at extremely high levels before the war began, they are still continuously
    rising; nonetheless, Russia, an important fertilizer producer, is considering
    an export ban. Furthermore, the energy crisis due to the high prices for natural
    gas, an essential feedstock to produce nitrogen-based fertilizers such as urea
    and ammonia, is contributing to boost fertilizer prices as well [8]. Higher fertilizer
    prices could depress production, leading to less grain on the market in 2022 and
    putting further upward pressure on already-high food prices [9,10]. In this context,
    it is important to analyze the cereal sector with reference to wheat production,
    which remains a mainstay of nutrition both in Italy and worldwide. This is because
    it is essential to understand how to cope with the current crises, considering
    the market dynamics that are being determined such as the rise in fertilizer prices
    and the volatility of wheat prices, factors that would make the cultivation of
    wheat (and cereals in general) unprofitable. As a consequence of the global instability,
    the implementation of sustainable resilient strategies in agriculture is crucial.
    This entails the implementation of innovative agricultural practices that increase
    the productivity and income of farmers and, at the same time, can help to maintain
    ecosystems. Therefore, one of the actions to implement is reducing the quantity
    of inputs, in particular fertilizers, while maintaining production to protect
    both the environment and the income of farmers [11,12]. A key factor for sustainable
    agriculture is the introduction of digital technologies, which can help farm management
    through better-informed and timely decisions. These new technologies are known
    by the term Precision Agriculture Technologies (PATs), a farming management concept
    based on observing, measuring, and responding to inter and intra-field variability
    in crops [13]. According to an official report jointly published by ITU and FAO
    in 2020 [14], “digital agriculture has the potential to contribute to a more economically,
    environmentally, and socially sustainable agriculture, while meeting the agricultural
    goals of a country more effectively”. From the beginning of the 1990s, different
    authors have discussed the agri-environmental and economic effects derived from
    the application of PATs [11,15,16,17,18,19,20,21]. In detail, most papers deal
    with environmental sustainability. The environmental benefits of precision agriculture
    (PA) derive mainly from the optimization of the management of crop inputs, such
    as as seeds, fertilizers (especially the efficient use of nitrogen), pesticides,
    irrigation water, and diesel, which often results in a reduction in their consumption
    without a decrease in the yield. It is notable that some studies report that the
    quantity of inputs does not decrease, but their use is optimized to avoid waste
    and pollution [12,22]. In addition, it emerges that, from an environmental point
    of view, through PATs it is possible to improve the soil proprieties (sustainable
    nutrient management) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions [23,24,25]. Finally,
    the optimal management of weeds is underlined [26,27]. The research on precision
    agriculture applied to the cereal farming started later, in 1997. In this scenario,
    the increasing interest of academia in this topic is notable from Figure 1, with
    an exponential increase in the number of documents (articles and reviews) available
    per year. The highest-producing countries regarding PA adoption in cereal farming
    cultivation are the United States, China, and Australia, while Italy ranks just
    fifth. Figure 1. Number of available papers (articles and reviews) and the top
    10 countries producing papers about PA applications in cereal/wheat production
    (note: The papers considered for 2023 are published until March). Considering
    the growing population and the necessity of safe food, establishing methods to
    increase the yield of staple crops, such as wheat, without compromising the sustainable
    development of future generations, is a challenging task. The implementation of
    PATs, such as variable rate application systems, could improve productivity, providing
    support to both producers and consumers [28,29,30,31,32,33]. In the pool of available
    documents, only few studies assess the economic sustainability of PA application
    in the cereal sector [34,35,36,37]. The economic benefits involve a general reduction
    of production costs, especially due to the correct management of crop inputs (reduction
    of pesticides and nitrogen) and an increase in productivity of the farm. The major
    economic benefit is recorded in the decrease in labor costs and the cost saving
    of fuel. However, an increase in total costs due to the capital invested in technology
    is highlighted. However, adoption of PA tools is still far behind expectations,
    in part due to limitations in quantifying and demonstrating its economic and environmental
    benefits, insufficient detailed knowledge on technological functions, small farms
    managed by older farmers, and the deficiency of an incentive system [13,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46].
    On these premises, this paper evaluates the impacts of PATs on farm economic,
    agronomic, and environmental management by farmers adopting (or not) these technologies,
    using the case study method proposed by Yin (2009). This study is part of the
    activities of the Operational Group SMART AGRICULTURE TEAM financed by the Rural
    Development Program (RDP) Marche 2014/2020, sub-measure 16.1 (Appendix A, Figure
    A1). The objective of the project is to evaluate how PATs could support the optimization
    of nitrogen fertilizer management in durum wheat production. Contextually, the
    Operational Group aimed to evaluate the economic and environmental sustainability
    of cereal farms adopting or not adopting PATs. The work focuses on the period
    2014-2022 for two farms (A and B) that cultivate durum wheat in central Italy.
    Farm A has used PATs since 2018; farm B uses conventional agronomic management.
    Based on the objective of the Operation Group, this paper tries to answer the
    following research questions: How does the durum wheat profitability evolve if
    a farm adopts or does not adopt precision agriculture technologies? Could the
    application of precision agriculture technologies improve and make more efficient
    the nitrogen use within the context under investigation? The economic trend of
    durum wheat production is explored using a profitability ratio analysis. In addition,
    to understand what will happen to farm B if it decides to adopt the PATs package
    of farm A, a simulation was performed for the year 2022. From an agri-environmental
    perspective, fertilization management is one of the most relevant targets of the
    PA. In particular, the nitrogen (N) derived from fertilizers, when inefficiently
    used in crop production systems, can move from agricultural fields and contaminate
    surfaces and groundwater resources, as well as contribute to greenhouse gas emissions
    (GHG) [47]. Since the interaction between the N rate, soil, weather, and crop
    response is a complex system, the management of this nutrient is the key aspect
    that distinguishes PA from conventional management [48,49]. Thus, the N environmental
    and agronomic efficiency is measured in this paper with the estimation of the
    nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE) index. This paper is structured as follows:
    Section 2 describes materials and methods; Section 3 presents the results and
    discussion. Finally, Section 4 concludes. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study
    Area and Data Set This work focuses on the period 2014–2022 (9 years) for two
    farms (A and B) that cultivate durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. Durum Desf)
    in the Marche Region (central Italy) in rotation with maize (Zea mays L.) (Figure
    2). Figure 2. Marche region and experimental locations: A and B represent the
    position of farms A and B respectively. The climate of the study area is meso-Mediterranean
    based on the Walter and Leith Climate Class (Figure 3), which is characterized
    by a mean annual precipitation of about 768 mm and a mean annual temperature of
    17.2 °C with monthly means ranging from 9 °C in February to 29 °C in August. There
    is a potential for frost from February until March and a period with a high probability
    of drought from June to August. Figure 3. Walter and Lieth climate diagram of
    the study area (2000–2021 long-term series). The physical and chemical compositions
    of the soil for the compared farms are reported in Table 1. Table 1. Soil physical
    and chemical compositions for the experimental farms. The two farms are agronomically
    managed differently; farm A acquired the first PA package in 2018 and started
    to adopt it in 2019. This period is considered the years of “technical change”,
    in which farm A has fully implemented the use of the PAT package considered in
    the present study. In line with the subdivision made by Finco et al. [21], the
    PA package acquired by farm A includes: Guidance systems (driver assistance, machine
    guidance, controlled traffic farming) Recording technologies (soil mapping, soil
    moisture mapping, canopy mapping, yield mapping) Reacting technologies (variable-rate
    irrigation and weeding and variable rate application of seeds, fertilizers, and
    pesticides). In detail, farm A invested EUR 531,000 in PATs (Appendix A, Table
    A1). The investments in agricultural machinery equipped with PA technologies were
    financed for 40% of the total amount by joining Measure 4.1 (“Support for investments
    in farms”) of the PSR Marche 2014–2020. The use of this equipment is not limited
    to wheat cultivation; they are also used for the management of other cultivation,
    such as corn, on a surface that is four times larger than the one of farm B. In
    2018, based on estimated cash flows at the time, the expected payback period (PBP)
    for the entire technology package was 5 years. Despite this, given the peculiar
    market trend during the period 2020–2022, the PBP dropped to 3 years, and currently
    the entire investment is paid off. On the other hand, farm B used conventional
    agronomic management in all the years of this study. Figure 4 represents the experimental
    design of the case study. Figure 4. Experimental design. As already mentioned,
    this study is based on an Italian EIP-AGRI Operational Group Project called the
    Smart Agriculture Team (SAT), whose main goals have been the following: To ensure
    a correct management of nitrogenous inputs on durum wheat through precision agriculture
    technologies in order to reduce the environmental impact of cereal cropping systems
    To evaluate the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of investments
    in these technologies. Farm A was selected as a case study as it represents one
    of the few pioneering Italian farms that decided to adopt PATs. Likewise, farm
    B has been selected as a “control” case for not yet adopting PA technology after
    an in-depth analysis of all the Marche region farms associated with the largest
    trade association of Italian farmers. Thus, the three criteria on which farm B
    was examined were the following: The presence of a strong and real willingness
    to adopt the PA technologies investigated in this study The presence of a comparable
    size of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) devoted to cereal farming and of
    a minimum total farm size of 100 ha to be defined as a large farm according to
    FADN statistical standards Farm B is a more efficient farm than the average in
    terms of productivity and profitability even without the implementation of PA
    technologies. In this regard, as it can be seen from the data (Table 2) that farm
    B is capable of levels of profitability almost in line to the median operating
    profit per hectare (calculated net of European CAP supporting payments applied
    to the durum wheat production) obtained by farms larger than 100 ha and specialized
    in cereal farming in central Italy. Furthermore, farm A and farm B are both located
    in the top 25%—in terms of operating profit per hectare from durum wheat farming—cereal
    farms in central Italy. Table 2. Performance indicator comparison between FADN
    database and the two selected case studies. Index base value: central Italy. Farm
    A and farm B, while both producing durum wheat, are different from each other
    both structurally and from the point of view of the entrepreneurial and management
    logic that guides their strategic and operational choices. Farm A is a farm of
    about 400 ha, is cultivated using minimum tillage regime, and is almost entirely
    irrigated. Three quarters of the hectares are positioned in flat areas, and the
    rest are in hilly areas. Farm A’s mission is explicitly oriented towards technological
    innovation. About half of the farm UAA is used for the cultivation of cereals,
    including corn, while about a quarter of the UAA is used in the production of
    industrial legumes. It is important to note that farm A is integrated up-stream
    along the supply chain with an important Italian seed industry. Farm B is a farm
    of about 110 non-irrigated hectares cultivated using minimum tillage regime, located
    in hilly areas, and almost entirely occupied by cereal and forage crops. For contextualizing
    the two case studies in the territorial framework, a comparison between them and
    our elaboration on the FADN sample of cereal farming in central Italy was carried
    out using basic profitability indicators, i.e., productivity, average value (price),
    gross profit, operating profit (Table 2). The historical series analyzed in Table
    2 is divided into two periods according to the year of adoption of the PA by farm
    A in 2018. Based on Table 2: Productivity: For both periods considered (2014–2018
    and 2019–2022), the two case studies are both considerably more productive than
    the median value of productivity referred to in the sample of farms (greater than
    40 ha) producing durum wheat in central Italy. Nevertheless, in the period 2019–2022,
    that is, the period after the acquisition of the PA technology by farm A, both
    farms A and B slightly lost productivity compared to their levels in the previous
    period. Price of the durum wheat produced: in the period 2014–2018, farm A proves
    to possess a capacity to enhance production with a notable premium price compared
    to central Italy (+16%) and farm B (+20%). This difference in price is due to
    the fact that farm A markets its product as seed wheat, a niche market in respect
    to the mainstream production of semolina wheat. In the period 2019–2022, post-PA
    adoption by farm A, the world changed drastically due to the double crisis (pandemic
    and the war in Ukraine) which, as we know, has led to a shock on the commodity
    market. Therefore, the surge in profit margins per hectare experienced by both
    case studies is due to the short-term economic prospects. Profitability (2014–2018):
    in the period 2014–2018, the operating income generated by every hectare of durum
    wheat produced by farm A was 69% higher than that of central Italy and 70% higher
    than that of farm B. This evidence indicates a much greater cost efficiency experienced
    by farm A in its PA pre-adoption period with respect both to the median context
    and to farm B. On the other hand, during 2019–2022, both case studies show an
    operating income which increased considerably because of the supply shock within
    the European market. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the difference
    in competitiveness between the two case studies observed in the previous period
    disappeared, as indicated by the operating income settling on the same level for
    both the farms. The economic results obtained by farm A to produce durum wheat
    in the pre-adoption period (2014–2018) in comparison to that of the reference
    context are not surprising; in fact, from a managerial point of view, farm A is
    a farm characterized for being explicitly oriented towards efficiency and for
    having a very high propensity to innovate, which is an atypical attribute in the
    agricultural context investigated. As confirmed by the Smart AgriFood Observatory
    in 2021, the Italian UAA managed with precision agriculture techniques is around
    4%. Farm A relies on a managerial structure given by three managers—i.e., the
    managerial structure coincides with the farm ownership—plus three full-time workers
    (all three highly skilled agricultural technicians). One of the three managers
    is a young, specialized technician who has been responsible for the computerized
    and automated farm management since the acquisition of the PA technology in 2018.
    Despite being a larger and more profitable wheat producer compared to the median
    value of the sample of cereal farms in central Italy, farm B is characterized
    by a traditional management structure which does not employ full-time workers
    and where the management work and the work in the fields are both carried out
    directly by the entrepreneur and his family. Finally, focusing on nitrogen management,
    Table 3 lists all the practices applied by both farmers, acquired through the
    field notebooks. Table 3. Agronomic management practices of the farms. 2.2. Economic
    Analysis The economic analysis aims to explore farm profitability in adopting
    or not adopting PATs through indicators by comparing two case studies (farm A
    and B) based on Yin’s case study design [50]. This approach was chosen because
    the focus of the study is a contemporary phenomenon characterized by a small number
    of pioneers adopting PA. To carry out this study, a profitability analysis was
    performed employing financial ratios [51,52]. This analysis allows comparing the
    two cereal farms, A and B, placed in the same locality and similar in the UAA
    devoted to the production of durum wheat; in this way, the understanding of the
    discrepancies in the results, determined by a different management approach and
    in the propensity to adopt new technologies, can emerge [53]. We restate that
    farm A has invested in precision farming technology since 2018, while farm B has
    not (yet) invested in precision farming technology but operates under the conventional
    management system, and it is considered a possible “target farm” that could adopt
    PA. Thus, we designed our case study as follow: The profitability of durum wheat
    production performed by the PA-adopting case study (farm A) has been assessed
    by comparing how the profitability indicators evolve before and after the adoption
    period (2014–2018 vs. 2019–2022). Besides, the profitability of durum wheat production
    has been assessed comparing the economic indicators of the PA-adopting farm (farm
    A) to that of the non-adopting farm (farm B). By being limited to a specific crop,
    the analysis has been conducted using margin ratios (income statement analysis)
    as indicators of profitability but not return ration (balance sheet analysis),
    since this type of indicator would have required an analysis of the profitability
    of the farm business taken as a whole. Instead, this study focuses only on durum
    wheat profitability, meeting the objectives of the Operational Group SMART AGRICULTURE
    TEAM financed by the Rural Development Program (RDP) Marche 2014/2020, sub-measure
    16.1. It is also important to point out that this economic analysis was not constructed
    as an experimental field trial but as a comparative case study conducted within
    real farms operating on the real market. In fact, our goal is not to directly
    (experimentally) evaluate the effect of some PA device on the crop profitability;
    rather, the objective is to analyze basic crop profitability measures and indices
    during the period of the PA adoption process. In this regard, while supporting
    the necessity of carrying out experimental trials to verify the economic efficacy
    of adopting specific technologies to specific crops, we underline that also the
    economic effectiveness evaluation of technology adoption carried out in the “real
    farm” productive space can generate further elements of analysis useful in understanding
    the determinants of the adoption process. Our work falls into this second category
    of studies on technology adoption effectiveness. The measurement and ratios [52]
    utilized to perform the profitability analysis refer to durum wheat production,
    and are listed below: Productivity ○ T/ha Gross Profit (per hectare) ○ Revenues
    (RV) − Variable Costs (VC) Gross profit Margin ○ (RV − VC)/RV Operating profit
    (per hectare) ○ Gross Profit − (PA capital depreciation quota − land for rent
    quota − administrative and general expenses quota) Operating profit margin ○ Operating
    profit/RV All the data useful for this analysis were obtained by means of in-depth
    interviews of the agribusiness entrepreneurs of the two farms. 2.3. The Nitrogen
    Agronomic Efficiency Index (NAE) To measure the environmental and agronomic efficiency,
    the nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE) index was calculated by the following
    formula (Equation (1)): NAE= Yield harvested (kg/ha) Nitrogen provided to the
    crop (kg/ha) (1) The NAE is the ratio between the total yield harvested (kg/ha)
    and the nitrogen provided to crop (kg/ha). The higher the NAE value, the greater
    the nitrogen use efficiency for production purposes. At crop maturity, the yield
    data was collected with a combined harvester for the entire durum wheat production
    area. The yield data (t/ha) was calculated from measurements taken at the time
    of delivery to the consortium. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Economic Results
    In this paragraph, the main economic results will be presented. Table 4 shows
    the comparison between farm A and B from 2014 to 2022 in terms of productivity,
    cost efficiency of the production process, and profitability. Table 4. Economic
    analysis. (1) Productivity: Land productivity is a very complex indicator that
    depends on many variables involved. In our case study, the data show that the
    most productive farm is the one that does not adopt the PA: farm B. Moreover,
    what is noted is also a slight declining trend in productivity for both farms,
    and perhaps this evidence could be related to the change in atmospheric and climatic
    conditions in the medium term. However, this is a hypothesis that should be verified
    using statistically representative samples of cultivated areas. Then, focusing
    the attention on the post adoption period, we note that farm A shows an increase
    in productivity in the 2019–2020 period followed by a decrease in productivity
    in the period 2021–2022. Again, the owners/managers of farm A attribute these
    trends as essentially linked to environmental conditions and not directly linked
    to the use of PATs which, among other things, should not be a factor of productivity
    increase but of cost optimization for any given level of productivity. (2) Cost
    efficiency: Regardless of the use of the PATs, looking at the trend of variable
    costs and the variable costs ratio, it emerges that farm A is a farm structurally
    more efficient than farm B, while, in terms of PA cost effectiveness, until 2021,
    the variable costs ratio remains substantially constant. Therefore, no signs of
    PA adoption efficacy are observed. Things change in 2022. Indeed, the variable
    costs ratio between farm A and farm B falls from 0.83–0.87 (in trend) to 0.76.
    Although this is an observation of only one year, so not very meaningful if seen
    in isolation, it still allows us to make a hypothesis: with raw material prices
    at the levels of 2022, the cost optimization of the production process using PATs
    could become significant and relevant. Obviously, this hypothesis should be tested
    experimentally; nevertheless, our data indicate that the farm that adopts a PAT
    management shows resilience in terms of increase in the production cost per hectare,
    which is much greater than the case study that does not adopt PAT. (3) Gross profitability:
    Interesting information can emerge if observing the gross profit. First, in the
    pre-adoption period, farm A was shown to be capable of much higher profitability
    than the “control” case study (farm B). Since 2018, in conjunction with the investment
    in the PAT package, farm A apparently loses its profitability advantage with respect
    to farm B. Indeed, in the period 2021–2022, the gross profit ratio between the
    two case studies is reversed compared to previous years—the wheat produced by
    farm B becomes more profitable than that produced by farm A—and this is due to
    three underlying forces acting simultaneously: wheat selling price, productivity,
    and contingency of exceptional environmental conditions. Selling price: Since
    2018, the difference between the two case studies in terms of average revenue
    narrowed, until it disappeared in 2022. The exceptional increase in prices in
    the three-year period, 2020–2022, favored an upward squeezing of the price differentials,
    which was previously linked mainly to product quality. Productivity: Farm B remains
    a structurally more productive farm even in the post-adoption period of the PA
    package by farm A. The higher productivity of the durum wheat produced by farm
    B lies in the genetics of the seeds used. Farm A produces durum wheat for seed.
    The varieties used are generally less productive than semolina varieties, but
    they usually tend to have a higher market value even if, as we have seen in 2021–2022,
    the price of the two case studies flattens out on the same level due to the market
    shock. Environmental conditions: Although the use of PATs allows a greater timeliness
    of action in crop management, even without the use the technologies, farm B was
    able to manage the 2021 sowing period more effectively than farm A. The 2021 sowing
    was very difficult in the survey area due to exceptionally prolonged rain events.
    Farm A was unable to sow before December 2021 (two months of delay), and this
    strongly influenced the low productivity of the 2022 harvest, while farm B found
    useful windows for sowing in the right period, i.e., October 2021. (4) Operating
    profit: the fundamental information contained in the comparison between the two
    case studies, in terms of operating profit, is the incidence of the depreciation
    share of the PA capital invested by farm A in 2018. This factor, combined with
    the alignment of the prices of wheat sold starting from 2020 and the higher productivity
    of farm B, determines an inversion of the profitability of the two case studies
    in 2021–2022, when farm B becomes more profitable than farm A. The weight of the
    share of depreciation of the PA capital on the profitability per hectare of farm
    A also emerges from the joint comparison of the gross margin and the operating
    margin (Figure 5). In fact, the narrowing of the distance between the two indicators
    that can be seen when passing from the gross margin to the net margin is essentially
    due to the depreciation rate of the PA capital discounted by farm A. Figure 5.
    Variation of gross and operating margin for farms A and B in the considered period
    (2014–2022). In 2020–2022, the operating profit of farm A improved to levels far
    above pre-adoption conditions, and this is especially due to the market price
    trend (Figure 6). Figure 6. Durum wheat market prices trend 2014–2022 in central
    Italy. J: January; M: May; S: September (Source: Borsa Merci Bologna). In addition,
    farm adopting PATs creates advantages over traditional farming in terms of better
    management of resource efficiency. This aspect is particularly relevant for the
    use of N fertilizer. In fact, after COVID pandemic and for the Russia–Ukraine
    war, this input increased its price by 176% from January 2020 to December 2022
    (Figure 7). Figure 7. Urea 46% N market prices trend 2014–2022 in Italy. J: January;
    M: May; S: September (Source: Borsa Merci Mantova). In this scenario, PATs allowed
    farm A to optimize N distribution according to the specific necessity of the crop
    as shown in the following paragraph (NAE index). In this way the farm A works
    achieving both a better quality of production and minimizing the negative impacts
    on the environment. Finally, to understand what will happen to farm B if it decides
    to adopt the PATs package of farm A, a simulation was performed for the period
    2020–2022 (Table 5). A depreciation cost of the same PA capital acquired by farm
    A is considered with a variating depreciation rate according to the durum wheat
    farm UAA. Table 5. Simulation of PAT adoption for farm B for the period 2020–2022.
    It emerges that, if farm B had acquired the same PA package as farm A, the operating
    margin of farm B improves thanks to the new market conditions in the period 2020–2022
    despite the cost of PA capital. This evidence suggests that PA adoption by farm
    B could be feasible in economic terms thanks to a sufficiently profitable, productive,
    and extensive farm structure in which implementing the new technologies in this
    new market conditions (which, however, are constantly changing). Nevertheless,
    despite the favorable economic situation, farm B is currently not prone to technological
    change. The motivation could not be purely economic, but it could be linked to
    the characteristics of the owner. As the literature suggests [54,55,56], older
    farmers show a lower propensity to adopt as compared to their younger counterparts.
    Old farmers’ may be loath to changes and they may not see longer-term benefits
    perhaps because they lack training and their bond to conventional agricultural
    management [57]. Moreover, access to credit is certainly another possible constraint
    to adoption. 3.2. Agronomic Results Farm A supplied on average less nitrogen (−63%)
    than farm B for each year under analysis (Table 6). While evaluating the average
    yield, during the five growing seasons, it shows that farm B achieves 10 percent
    more than the farm A. Table 6. Total nitrogen provided, crop yield, and NAE per
    farm each year. The NAE index, which is an index designed to assess nitrogen fertilizer
    use efficiency, shows that farm A obtained a higher value (+0.47) than farm B
    (Table 6). After water, nitrogen fertilization management is the most important
    plant nutrient [58]. Nitrogen fertilization contributes significantly to crop
    development, chlorophyll accumulation [59,60,61,62], and nitrogen content [63].
    Mineral nitrogen contributes to better growth by giving the crop the nutrient
    when it needs it most, which results in higher production [59,64] and quality
    grain levels [65]. Farm B obtained a higher production level than farm A due to
    the higher nitrogen provided to the crop. Ref. [66], with 20 years of data on
    durum wheat production, shows that nitrogen is the key driver of the production.
    The authors have shown that increasing the nitrogen supplied to durum wheat allows
    a significant increase in yield. It is also true that as the dose increases, the
    yield of durum wheat does not increase proportionally. Ref. [67] showed that nitrogen
    doses above 150 kg N/ha do not increase yield but, on the contrary, result in
    a higher protein percentage. When the nitrogen is not absorbed by the crop, it
    can only have two fates, leaching [68] and denitrification [69], which have negative
    environmental impacts, without considering the economic damage suffered by the
    farmer and that such production inputs are less available and increasingly expensive.
    Given its consequences at the agronomic, economic, and environmental levels, the
    management of nitrogen fertilization has always been an important topic of scientific
    research [28]. Today, to optimize nitrogen fertilization at the farm level, precision
    farming has a strong impact on both the environment and the economy [63,70,71].
    Precision agriculture is agronomic management based on the spatial and temporal
    variability of agronomic components, such as the soil’s chemical and physical
    variability [49] and crop needs. Analyzing spatial and temporal variability, prescription
    maps [62] [72] can be generated that allows the nitrogen dose to be adjusted according
    to crop needs and therefore improve the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Several
    authors have reported that precision farming allows an increase in NUE. Ref. [73],
    in China, showed the yield and NUE results of precision agronomic management.
    The authors report an increase in yield and NUE compared to conventional agriculture
    of 10% and 51–97%, respectively. In Switzerland with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)
    [74], it was reported that precision nitrogen management improved the NUE by an
    average of 10%. Moreover, in Umbria, Italy, it was reported that the variable
    rate technology improved the NUE by 15% compared to the flat rate [75]. In accordance
    with all the previous works, an increase in the NUE was also achieved in our case
    study. Farm A, which uses the variable rate technology, obtained a higher NAE
    of 15% than farm B, which distributes nitrogen evenly. Farm A is more environmentally
    and profit-friendly than farm B. 4. Conclusions This study is based on a double
    case study in central Italy and explores durum wheat profitability and the optimization
    of the nitrogen fertilization as a function of the management of the production
    process through PA technologies for the period 2014–2022. Farm A acquired and
    implemented the PA package in 2018–2019, while farm B has not (yet) invested in
    PA technology but works under the conventional management system. Therefore, it
    can be considered a possible \"target\" farm that could adopt PA since it is a
    larger farm compared to the local farm average size. Moreover, the owner of farm
    B shows a high propensity to adopt these technologies and participated in this
    study precisely to have more points of reference for deciding on possible PA investments,
    especially in light of the growing cost of production inputs. Since the adoption
    of PA is still at a pioneering state in central Italy, our case study can represent
    a useful benchmark for both agricultural entrepreneurs and policymakers with respect
    to the economic effects of PA technology adoption applied to durum wheat production.
    In detail, from the economic analysis, it emerges that, in terms of gross profit,
    there are substantial differences between the two case studies. Farm A is characterized
    by a gross profit that is, on average, higher than farm B in the pre-crisis period
    2014–2020. Farm A’ s economic indicators have been affected by the PAT depreciation
    schedule coinciding with the technological change. Despite this, the economic
    efficiency of farm A improved to levels above pre-adoption conditions, thanks
    to the new market conditions in the period 2020–2022. In addition, farms adopting
    PATs optimize the use of inputs such as nitrogen fertilization according to crop
    needs; at the same time, it favors the farm management’s efficiency in terms of
    human resources. In the 2014–2021 period, our study did not show any clear savings
    in terms of wheat production costs that could be attributed to the use of the
    PA technology package by farm A. However, things changed in 2022. In fact, with
    the surge in the price of inputs, the index of variable costs of farm A increased
    by 29%, while that of farm B increased by 46% with respect to 2021. The hypothesis
    is that this 17% difference, corresponding to about EUR 60 per hectare, could
    be due to the use of PATs by farm A. Despite this possible savings in terms of
    variable costs, it is necessary to consider that: The depreciation share of the
    financial capital invested by farm A in the PA package was EUR 89.18 per hectare
    in 2022. The agricultural area on which this share of depreciation is calculated
    is four times higher than the agricultural area available to farm B. As mentioned
    by Schimmelpfennig [76], large farms may present economies of scale when adopting
    PATs because they have more hectares over which to spread investment costs. Moreover,
    large farms are also more likely to have the type of variability that makes PATs
    [77]. Thus, because of the depreciation share, farm B, while being able to save
    around EUR 60 per hectare in terms of variable costs under the exceptional market
    conditions of 2022, does not show a broad economic incentive to invest financial
    capital in PA, probably due to a lack of economies of scale, while farm A does.
    These findings confirm our previous analysis relating to the dimensional thresholds
    necessary to create an economic incentive for investment in PA by a specialized
    cereal farm in Italy which is at least 200 ha in a hilly area [78]. Nevertheless,
    the incentive in using PA technology could be present even for smaller farms in
    terms of payment of a rent for a PA-type management assistance at service, rather
    than in the purchase of technological capital. Regarding the willingness to adopt
    PA technologies for the cultivation of wheat, Hanson et al. [79] verified that,
    in North Dakota, wheat may have negative effects on PAT adoption due its lower
    cost of production with respect to other crops such as corn. This assertion is
    confirmed by our case study, given that corn is a fundamental crop within the
    farm A production structure while it is absent within the production structure
    of farm B. This study is not without limitations. The first limitation of this
    study is the fact of having compared the pioneering case study A with a single
    control farm (B) rather than with a pool of farms. There were two constraints
    which prevented the initial intention of comparing case study A with a sample
    of farms: The research project from which this article derives involved an agronomic
    experimentation in the case study farms, and it would have been beyond the possibilities
    of the project to develop this experimentation in more than two farms (farm A
    and B). Therefore, the first issue was to identify a “control” farm (case study
    B) available to host the agronomic experimentation for the participation in the
    comparative study. This farm should have been available to provide all its economic
    and accounting data. In this regard, it should also be clarified that farms in
    Italy in many cases do not keep detailed analytical accounting relating to long
    historical series in their archives. For this reason, even working with just one
    farm, it was not easy to reconstruct the analytical accounting data set necessary
    for carrying out this study [80]. On the other hand, there were no difficulties
    with farm A, since it keeps track of its own detailed analytical accounting using
    advanced management software (as Geofolia, Isagri). The second limitation consists
    in having only one farm (farm A) implementing a broad package of PATs and managed
    according to a logic that we can define as PA-oriented. However, this limitation
    could be explained by the fact that there is a lack of diffusion of these technologies,
    so it becomes rather impossible to work with broader samples, and it becomes necessary
    to develop research based on a few case studies. Therefore, according to this
    second limitation, it would be appropriate to create an infrastructure that allows
    researchers to be able to acquire reliable economic, financial, and agronomic
    data on which to perform analyses on the effects of PA technologies. In addition,
    being a pioneering technology in this area, few farms have purchased and adopted
    precision farming techniques because they would like to understand whether such
    technology provides an economic and environmental benefit. This aspect is closely
    linked to the objective of the present work. In conclusion, policymakers are advised
    to encourage the adoption of these technologies given that the current market
    conditions generate incentives to adopt, specifically, very high costs of input
    but very high prices of output [81]. Finally, both from an economic and an agronomic
    point of view, it is important to consider these aspects in order to appreciate
    all the advantages of this type of innovation that hinges on the automation of
    the production process. The farm deciding to adopt PATs must already possess both
    the characteristics and the philosophy of efficiency, since adopting promising
    and efficient technologies on obsolete or inefficient production systems—similar
    to what happens in the field of automation of manufacturing production processes—does
    not mean innovating but automating the pre-existing inefficient production processes.
    In addition, the adoption of PA technology requires training programs for farmers
    and farmworkers in order for them to acquire the right skills. In fact, the availability
    of training is a condition necessary for understanding and mastering the PA package
    characteristics, as well as for fully exploiting its potential in terms of efficiency
    and effectiveness. Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.F., D.B. and M.B.;

    Population growth means that more food must be produced to meet nutritional needs.

    Keywords: precision farming; Agriculture 4.0; water consumption; hydroponic systems;
    vertical farming; smart sensors 1. Introduction The future of food availability
    is very uncertain. In 2019, the land used for agricultural activities amounted
    to 4752 million ha, with one third being dedicated to temporary and permanent
    crops and the remaining portion to meadows and pastures. Between 2000 and 2019,
    the amount of arable land used mainly for irrigated crops doubled, while that
    for rainfed crops increased by only 2.6 percent. Over the same period, populations
    increased at higher rates, resulting in a 22% decrease in the land available per
    capita for crops and livestock farming activities. Indeed, according to the FAO,
    by 2050, agricultural activities will need to produce almost 50% more food than
    in 2012 [1]. This means that the exploitation of valuable resources, such as water
    and land, has never been so intense, pushing agricultural production to the limit.
    Against this backdrop, several important global policy frameworks have been developed
    in recent years, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris
    Agreement on climate change, the Addis Ababa Action on Financing for Development,
    the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030, and the Small Island
    Developing States Accelerated Modalities. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
    is a plan of action for people, the planet, and prosperity that includes 17 Sustainable
    Development Goals with 169 associated targets that are integrated and indivisible.
    Among the various goals that need to be achieved are food security, improved nutrition,
    and the promotion of sustainable agriculture [2]. The context becomes more complex
    when the effects of climate change are considered. Extreme weather events are
    becoming more frequent and more severe. Human activities are estimated to have
    caused global warming of about 1.0 °C compared to pre-industrial levels, with
    a likely range of 0.8 °C to 1.2 °C. Available data on expected climate risks indicate
    that opportunities for adaptation to many climate hazards will be limited if global
    warming exceeds 1.5 °C [3]. Indeed, for this scenario, it is expected that the
    risks affecting agriculture, energy, food, and water will overlap spatially and
    temporally, affecting increasing numbers of people and regions. For these reasons,
    it is essential to focus on minimizing water consumption, as the problem of drought
    is a growing problem in some geographical regions [3]. Predictions clearly show
    that, due to urbanization, there will be less land for agricultural practices,
    while population growth will lead to growth in the demand for food in order to
    meet the needs of the world’s population. In the literature, there are multiple
    testimonies confirming that the future challenge will be to produce more while
    consuming less, i.e., limiting the exploitation of natural resources and limiting
    waste. For example, soil-less crops that can grow vertically indoors close to
    urban centers have been developed as an effective solution to this challenge.
    In hydroponic systems, plants are grown out of the soil with their roots in the
    air, placed inside an inert substrate, or perpetually immersed in a nutrient solution
    [4] Several researchers have implemented systems with the aim of managing irrigation
    systems using IoT technologies and monitoring endogenous and exogenous crop factors,
    and machine learning algorithms were used to optimize the systems obtained [5,6,7].
    Furthermore, with the aim of safeguarding water, innovative systems have been
    studied that are also able to recover water from the environment or from other
    sources [8]. Therefore, taking all this into consideration, it would be interesting
    to understand how the agriculture sector is preparing for future challenges. A
    review of existing studies in the scientific literature will be helpful to better
    understand how five different strategies applied to different crops might be evaluated
    in a global environment where resources will be increasingly scarce. This preliminary
    work will form the basis for a future proposal of a framework for assessing the
    sustainability of agriculture strategies in a real case study. To prepare this
    article, a literature review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines.
    The PRISMA statement was first designed for systematic reviews analyzing health
    interventions. However, the approach and the checklist items are applicable for
    different purposes in various contexts [9]. This review was carried out to draw
    together the information currently in the literature addressing this question:
    in agriculture, can innovative strategies decrease water consumption compared
    to traditional agriculture? The Scopus database was used to identify papers that
    have investigated the link between water consumption and the main agriculture
    strategies, such as controlled-environment agriculture, hydroponic crops, and
    precision farming for field crops, in the last ten years. The methodology used
    for the systematic review is described in detail in Section 2. Then, Section 3
    qualitatively describes the sources’ characteristics, their geographical and temporal
    distribution, the main topics dealt with, and the results for water consumption
    and yield by crop category. The final section draws out the weaknesses of the
    literature and describes lines for future research based on the results obtained.
    2. Literature Review Methodology 2.1. Literature Identification For the literature
    analysis, we used the chosen methodology because it allows for clear and transparent
    systematic reviews. Using the PRISMA statement, we followed the checklist of 27
    items and drew up a flow diagram in four steps. The checklist included the essential
    items required to analyze the literature clearly. Moreover, by following this
    procedure, it is much easier to evaluate missing results [10,11]. Using the Scopus
    database in December 2022, 71 papers published in English in the last ten years
    (2012–2022) were retrieved. Among them, articles, conference papers, short surveys,
    book chapters, reviews, conference reviews, and books were selected using a particular
    search strategy based on a PICO-style approach: P, problem: identifies the problem
    and its characteristics; I, intervention: identifies possible solutions; C, comparison:
    reports current practices; O, outcomes: shows the relevant outcomes of the study
    carried out, focusing on the solution that worked best. This approach aimed to
    answer a precise question: in agriculture, can innovative strategies decrease
    water consumption compared to traditional agriculture? The starting point of the
    search strategy was the analysis of data on water consumption in traditional agriculture
    and controlled-environment agriculture. A computerized search was undertaken to
    look for keywords using the “title, abstract and keywords” function, which we
    believed would be a better way to investigate the possible relationship between
    water consumption and agriculture technologies. In the early stage of the research,
    the first two criteria for the selection of studies from Scopus were: TITLE-ABS-KEY
    (“Water consumption” OR “water recovery” OR drought AND “traditional agriculture”);
    TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Water consumption” OR “water recovery” OR drought AND “controlled
    environmental agriculture” OR “vertical farm*” OR “greenhouse”). Specific technologies
    were identified, and two different pillars were analyzed: soil-less cultivation
    and field cultivation. For soil-less cultivation, hydroponics, aeroponics, and
    aquaponics were analyzed. For field cultivation, we chose to further research
    topics related to precision agriculture. The Scopus search filters used in this
    second step were: TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Water consumption” OR “water recovery” OR drought
    AND hydroponic* OR aeroponic* OR aquaponic*); TITLE-ABS-KEY (“Water consumption”
    OR “water recovery” OR drought AND “precision agriculture” OR “precision farming”
    OR “smart agriculture” OR “Agriculture 4.0”). The strategy research adopted is
    represented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Flowchart for search strategy followed. We
    used the asterisk in the figure to indicate that Plurals and spelling variants
    are included in the search strategy. 2.2. Inclusion Criteria for Literature Screening
    At this stage, four selection criteria were applied as reported in Table 1. The
    first criterion was that papers were published between 2012 and 2022, as this
    was the period when interest in saving natural resources, such as water and land,
    began to grow. The second criterion limited the search to papers that were published
    in English only. Then, since the aim of this systematic review was to provide
    an accurate overview of engineering solutions, an inclusion criterion was applied
    though the filters of the Scopus database limiting the search to articles in the
    fields of engineering, chemical engineering, and energy. Finally, only publications
    in their final state were considered. Following this screening, it was possible
    to refine the search by selecting 161 papers. Described process and related results
    are represented in Figure 2. Figure 2. Flowchart for search strategy followed
    and screening stage. We used the asterisk in the figure to indicate that Plurals
    and spelling variants are included in the search strategy. Table 1. Inclusion
    criteria for screening using filters from Scopus and Excel. 2.3. Eligibility and
    Inclusion Stage The 161 articles selected through the previous screening phase
    were analyzed in detail by examining the abstracts, their main characteristics,
    and the journals in which they were published. This review focused on water consumption;
    therefore, studies that deviated from this topic were excluded. As a result, 97
    articles were removed. This left a total of 71 articles that matched all the inclusion
    criteria and were, therefore, included in this analysis. Figure 3 shows the PRISMA
    flowchart used in this systematic review. Figure 3. PRISMA flowchart for selection
    and data extraction. 3. Results and Discussions The first article of relevant
    interest that addressed the issue of water consumption in agriculture was authored
    in 2012 [12]. It was then necessary to wait until 2017 for other studies with
    a focus closely related to the topic of interest in this review. As shown in Figure
    4, starting from 2017, there was a major increase in terms of the number of published
    papers. This number maintained an approximately constant trend over the past three
    years (2020–2022). This shows that increasing attention is being paid to the global
    problems described earlier. Figure 4. Trend in the number of papers on water consumption
    in agriculture for the last ten years. We also analyzed the document types for
    the reviewed works. As shown in Table 2, of the 71 papers retrieved, 44 were articles,
    24 were conference papers, and 3 were reviews. Furthermore, 36 were open access,
    indicating the relevance of the issue and a tendency to desire to share research
    results. Table 2. Numbers of different document types for the retrieved papers.
    Since the issue dealt with in the present review is a global issue, the geographical
    distribution of the published papers was of great interest. The assessment was
    undertaken by considering the address of the corresponding author for each article,
    thus providing a clear idea of how different countries are tackling the current
    situation. As can be seen from the graph created using Excel shown in Figure 5,
    the issue is being dealt with worldwide, but Italy and the United States are the
    main countries where researchers have carried out work on water consumption in
    the agriculture sector. Figure 5. Global geographical distribution of published
    papers on water consumption in agriculture obtained by considering the addresses
    of corresponding authors. Another very interesting analysis that was performed
    concerned the frequency with which the main keywords in these papers occurred.
    The most common keywords of the selected papers were reported in Table 3. The
    most popular were “irrigation”, “agriculture”, “crops”, “hydroponics”, and “Internet
    of Things”. Table 3. The frequency with which keywords occurred. Using VOSviewer,
    it was possible to analyze the interconnections between the most prevalent keywords
    to obtain a clear understanding of the links between them and focus on the most
    relevant topics. The results of this analysis have shown in Figure 6. Figure 6.
    Relationships between the main keywords in the selected papers. Based on this
    preliminary assessment, five main topics on which to focus our future attention
    were identified among the articles reviewed: Topic one. Controlled-environment
    agriculture in greenhouses or vertical farming. In this topic, we also included
    solutions that used soil-less techniques, such as hydroponic systems, aeroponic
    systems, and aquaponic systems; Topic two. Smart agriculture using sensors that
    monitor plant exogenous factors, such as soil moisture or environment condition;
    Topic three. Smart agriculture using sensors that monitor plant endogenous factors,
    such as sap ion concentrations, to obtain a qualitative indication of water stress;
    Topic four. Smart systems for the prediction of water stress and management of
    irrigation systems; Topic five. Smart solutions for water-recycling systems. The
    subdivision of the papers, following the topics introduced, is given in the Table
    4. Table 4. Topic-based classification of the papers. 3.1. Detailed Description
    of Each Topic 3.1.1. Topic One: Controlled-Environment Agriculture Urbanization
    and increasing population growth are known to increase pressure on the exploitation
    of natural resources, especially those of interest to this study, land, and water.
    The projections are clear and state that, due to urbanization, there will be less
    land available for agricultural practices, while population increases will lead
    to growth in food demand to meet the needs of the world population. This means
    that the future challenge will be to produce more while consuming less; i.e.,
    limiting the exploitation of natural resources and limiting waste. For these reasons,
    soil-less crops growing vertically indoors close to urban centers have proved
    to be a powerful solution to this challenge [4]. According to this study, it is
    very important that these urban greenhouses are integrated as much as possible
    within the urban network in order to optimize energy supply, water consumption,
    and wastewater reuse, as well as, above all, to meet the demand for horticultural
    products in the urban center. The authors describe the Agrotopia project, a rooftop
    research greenhouse in Belgium. Agrotopia was built on the top of an agricultural
    auction market in an area that was abandoned a few years previously. This new
    building is an example of urban transformation and sustainable use of land and
    resources that respects the surrounding environment. The project therefore has
    the ambitious goal of studying, demonstrating, and communicating how these techniques
    can lead towards sustainable agricultural development. In terms of the research
    topic, this shows how important it is to thoroughly explore and optimize the process
    of growing crops in a controlled environment using soil-less techniques. In this
    regard, the authors of [13] deal with the issues related to the effect of climate
    change on agriculture by presenting specific solutions involving controlled-environment
    agriculture in greenhouses. Increasing water-use efficiency and protecting crops
    from adverse weather conditions, such as drought or extreme precipitation, are
    the most important priorities for adaptation. The authors of [15] predicted the
    performance of crops using an energy cascade model to optimize cultivation management
    in controlled-environment agriculture. The authors of [16], after assessing different
    solutions, including greenhouse cultivation, open-field cultivation, and vertical
    farming in buildings, stated that the most effective solution was represented
    by a plant factory design with no windows, completely artificial LED lighting,
    a photovoltaic system, and beer residue-derived fertilizer. The authors of [17]
    also analyzed different solutions involving indoor cultivation to assess how different
    resources can be used. In hydroponic systems, the plants are grown out of the
    soil with their roots in the air, inside an inert substrate, or perpetually immersed
    in a nutrient solution (in the last case, adequate root oxygenation must be ensured).
    In this way, the crops receive the essential elements for development through
    a nutrient solution directly applied to the roots of the plants using different
    operating techniques. This provides the plants with everything they need for their
    stage of growth and environmental conditions. As a result, the crops grow more
    healthily, with higher yields and less environmental impact on land use and water
    than traditional crops. Other advantages can also be noted from the point of view
    of the exploitation of chemicals, such as herbicides and pesticides; this is because,
    as this method operates in a closed and controlled environment, there is no need
    to use such chemicals. However, there are several variables that need to be controlled,
    both environmentally and in terms of the nutrient solution and light needed for
    the photosynthesis process. In most cases, lighting is provided by special LED
    lamps, and environmental conditions are kept ideal with HVAC systems. Therefore,
    the energy demand must be thoroughly analyzed since it exceeds that required by
    traditional farming. The authors of [21] proposed the development of an artificial
    intelligence system for the management of a hydroponic system. The goal was not
    only to automate the entire process but, if used on a large scale, it was intended
    to provide a framework for the analysis of data on hydroponic cultivation in comparison
    to traditional agriculture techniques. The authors of [31] implemented a fully
    automated hydroponic solution using closed-loop control over variables endogenous
    to the plants, such as humidity, light intensity, turbidity, pH, and flow of nutrient
    solution. In this way, fully automated control was achieved. The system was advantageous
    in terms of cost, product quality, and work safety, as the principles of Industry
    4.0 were integrated in these advanced agricultural practices. With the same aim,
    automated hydroponic systems have been set up. These used IoT technologies to
    ensure the conditions required for proper crop development [33,34]. An application
    of a hydroponic system is reported below in Figure 7. Figure 7. Hydroponic system.
    In addition to hydroponics, through which crops are grown using inert substrates,
    the authors of [20] studied an experimental aquaponic system in which the development
    of a soil-less crop was combined with fish farming. Leveraging such symbioses
    can minimize water consumption and reduce emissions. This experimental system
    was in an isolated room. The logical flow allowed the water from the fish-rearing
    area to pass through a mechanical filtration station that ensured the removal
    of most of the suspended solids discharged from the system. From here, the water
    passed to the plant-growing area. In this way, the crops received the elements
    they needed for growth and, at the same time, acted as a filter cleaning the water,
    which returned to the fish-rearing area through a closed system. To date, few
    studies have explored the advantages and disadvantages of such a solution; indeed,
    the results of [20] show how important it is to effectively evaluate the instrumentation
    and machinery that are used to achieve effective water and energy savings. An
    example of the interaction between irrigation savings and cultivation is shown
    by an acquaponic system in Figure 8. Figure 8. Aquaponic system. The authors of
    [30] carried out a lifecycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impact
    caused by hydroponic and aquaponic crops in Europe. Fresh fruits and vegetables
    in European markets usually come from many sources, with a high proportion being
    exported products. The environmental impacts of these products typically result
    from the resources used for production and long-distance transportation in air-conditioned
    trucks. Considering Germany and the Netherlands as northern European countries
    and Italy and Spain as southern European countries, the authors suggested that,
    by effectively studying the setup for and the various sources of water and energy
    supply, local fruit and vegetables production in urban areas can be a sustainable
    solution. However, in the northern European region, there is higher energy demand
    related to maintaining environmental conditions inside greenhouses and supplying
    lighting, while in southern regions, the main issue is related to higher water
    consumption. 3.1.2. Topic Two: Smart Sensors to Monitor Plant Exogenous Factors
    Achieving sustainable agriculture means reducing not only the use of natural resources
    but also food waste from processing and transport. For waste originating from
    transport, the quantity can be reduced by concentrating vertical farming within
    urban centers, as this would lead to decreases in distance and transport time.
    To reduce waste from production, however, it is important to satisfy plants’ needs
    in terms of nutrients, water supply, environmental parameters, the amount of light
    required for the photosynthesis process, etc. To achieve this, monitoring of the
    variables involved is essential. To maintain the nutrient solution elements at
    the optimal levels, it is often necessary to change the pH and electrical conductivity.
    However, as a result of this, there is a risk of losing sensitivity regarding
    the salts’ level of absorption. To balance this, researchers have developed a
    model that aims to estimate the ion concentration within a solution using a machine
    learning approach, making it possible to correct ion interference effects that
    lead to the misreporting of results obtained from sensors. Thus, excessive absorption
    of salts into plants can be avoided [23]. A mini-hydroponic system was designed
    that can be used at the household level and can meet the household demand for
    fresh products. It relies on closed-loop control to monitor variables endogenous
    to the plants that are essential for their development and to minimize water consumption
    [32]. The need to automate agricultural operations is not only related to greenhouse
    crops but also field crops. Furthermore, in this case, the aim is to improve crop
    yields and reduce waste, water consumption, and the resulting environmental impacts
    overall, while, at the same time, improving food safety and the safety of operators.
    The authors of [36] set up an IoT-based system to manage an irrigation system
    and provide water to crops only when they needed it. The designed control was
    a closed-loop system and was based on data monitored by IoT sensors in the field
    that evaluated soil moisture and temperature. Furthermore, the authors of [5,6,7]
    evaluated systems that were aimed at managing irrigation systems by exploiting
    IoT technologies and machine learning algorithms. In the case of crops that are
    spread over several hectares, such as orchards, it is very difficult to monitor
    the variables that would allow the water supply to be optimized to meet the needs
    of the crop. The challenge lies in the choice of both the type of sensor and the
    type of variable to monitor, but it is also important to assess the quality of
    the information obtained. In general, a widely used approach in the literature
    is to use soil moisture sensors. However, it has been shown that the control obtained
    with this method can be inaccurate because plant needs can vary with the same
    soil moisture content due to other factors, such as the evaporation rate and the
    water status of plants. This problem is particularly acute when the crop area
    is very large. Thus, the authors of [38], in order to optimize the water management
    for an orchard, proposed a system for estimating plant and soil water content
    using scattered soil moisture sensors, low-frequency remote sensing data, and
    meteorological information. The authors of [47], in their research, tested the
    effectiveness of a dielectric humidity sensor using infrared thermal imaging techniques.
    The authors explained that the use of such sensors could increase the sustainability
    of microgreen crops, and the increase in efficiency may be greater for crops with
    a longer growth cycle or higher water consumption. An application of a smart irrigation
    system is presented below in Figure 9. Figure 9. Smart controller monitoring plant
    exogenous factors. 3.1.3. Topic Three: Smart Sensors to Monitor Plant Endogenous
    Factors In the literature, as can be seen from the number of papers dealing with
    the first two topics, much attention has been paid to the management of water
    systems by controlling factors intrinsic to the conditions surrounding the cultivation,
    such as environmental and soil conditions. If only extrinsic factors are monitored
    and controlled, there is a risk of the system responding too slowly to the needs
    of the crops or of inaccurate water management. This is because plants’ water
    requirements also depend on intrinsic factors, such as a plant’s stage of development,
    evapotranspiration rate, and water status. The authors of [51] proposed a system
    for assessing plant health by evaluating the impedance of the stem using special
    sensors. In their study, the authors were able to simultaneously measure the impedance
    of four tobacco plants and analyze the relationship between the measured impedance
    and the external environmental conditions obtained by measuring air humidity,
    soil moisture, temperature, and ambient light levels. The results are very interesting
    for future studies and indicate a link between the calculated impedance variation
    and the diurnal cycle. For the same reason, in [48,49,50], an organic electrochemical
    transistor inserted into the stems of the plants themselves was introduced for
    the continuous monitoring of changes in the ionic composition of plant sap in
    real time. Plant sap is a liquid transported in plants’ vasculature, the content
    of which is highly variable depending on the environmental conditions, which strongly
    influence plants’ physiological state. The transistor was applied to study abiotic
    stresses in a controlled environment on several species, including tomato, kiwi,
    and soybean. In tomato crops, it was able to detect water stress within the first
    30 h of its onset. In the field, it was connected to a Wi-Fi network capable of
    transmitting the signal to an app. Therefore, this sensor was able to detect the
    onset of water stress and could potentially send a signal to either the farmer
    or to the operating machines indicating that it is time to irrigate, thus significantly
    reducing the wastewater and increasing sustainability. Specifically, the ionic
    sap measurement took place every 10 to 15 min and, based on the data measured,
    it was possible to determine if the plant was suffering from water stress and
    what the plant needed, whether it was water, calcium, potassium, or any other
    nutrient, providing clear advantages not only economically but also environmentally.
    Such information cannot be obtained from soil testing because probes inserted
    in fields only reveal water shortages that affect soil and not plants, risking
    irrigation being undertaken at inappropriate times. Experiments carried out first
    in a protected environment (in a greenhouse) and then later in an open field during
    the summer months showed that, on average, savings of 36% for water and 20% for
    fertilizer were obtained during the campaign. This system can be applied in any
    type of cultivation and does not require any specific preparation for its use.
    3.1.4. Topic Four: Smart Systems to Predict Drought Stress Considering that the
    aim is to make agriculture practices as sustainable as possible, it is very important
    to consider model systems or instrumentation that would allow us to understand
    how plants behave vis-à-vis water stress and how much it affects yield and product
    quality. Therefore, being able to model such behavior means being able to predict
    plant conditions under water stress, which in turn provides an intelligent framework
    with which to efficiently manage irrigation systems. The authors of [53] investigated
    which state-of-the-art methodologies are aimed at predicting water stress for
    different crops. In this study, models were classified according to their basic
    setup, i.e., soil-based drought models, drought models based on hydroponic aqueous
    culture, and agar-based drought models. The authors of [29] studied the effects
    of seawater on the wellbeing of crops and whether they were salt-sensitive or
    salt-tolerant. These effects were compared with those from a common NaCl solution,
    and it was found that the seawater resulted in lower stress, especially for salt-sensitive
    species. The authors of [56] addressed the issue of drought in the Mediterranean
    region. They demonstrated the effectiveness of a scheme for predicting drought
    stress and managing irrigation systems with several cotton crops in a central
    region of Greece. The scheme combined data from different sources, such as historical
    rainfall, data from sensors that measure soil water content, data extrapolated
    from very-high-resolution satellite images, and data on intrinsic plant variables,
    such as the evapotranspiration rate and normalized difference vegetation index.
    Another promising system for assessing drought stress in crops was proposed in
    [57]. The authors tested a system that uses IoT sensors and a machine learning
    algorithm to assess drought stress through pictures obtained with a camera. The
    results of these tests showed that the system achieved 74% accuracy in assessing
    drought stress for soybean and corn crops. Furthermore, the authors of [41] developed
    an efficient solution that combines information from the environment, crops, and
    soil with a machine learning algorithm that allows control to be increasingly
    refined. In hydroponics, the supply of elements such as nitrogen, potassium, and
    phosphorus is essential for proper plant development. In field crops, these elements
    occur naturally in the soil, but the often-aggressive farming practices used mean
    that soils are becoming increasingly deficient in these elements. However, incorrectly
    managed fertigation processes can lead to various problems for the environment
    and crops, such as eutrophication and groundwater contamination. To avoid such
    problems, it is advisable to use automatic fertigation systems, such as control-based
    and time-based systems. Considering this, the authors of [59] stated that control-based
    systems are preferable, as they allow for lower environmental impact and water
    consumption. 3.1.5. Topic Five: Smart Solutions for Water-Recycling Systems With
    the aim of safeguarding water, innovative systems have been studied that are also
    able to recover water from the environment or from other sources. According to
    [8], it is possible to recover water using innovative dehumidification technologies,
    such as liquid desiccants. In controlled-environment agriculture, the energy used
    for cooling, heating, and dehumidification can lead to both higher costs for electricity
    and a significant carbon footprint if the grid energy comes from fossil fuels.
    Experimental results confirmed that vacuum membrane distillation using PVDF hollow
    fibers was effective in desalting calcium chloride and magnesium chloride to obtain
    concentrated solute and fresh water that could be used in controlled-environment
    agriculture. Therefore, employing this water-recycling system, the water footprint
    for the same vegetables can be reduced by 98–99%. The authors of [65] carried
    out a demonstration of the feasibility of the fertilizer-drawn forward-osmosis
    process at the laboratory and pilot scales, showing that it was possible to ensure
    a nutrient solution suitable for hydroponics systems via osmotic dilution of synthetic
    wastewater effluent using a commercial hydroponic nutrient solution and draw solution.
    Therefore, with this system, it is possible to valorize wastewater as a sustainable
    water resource. The authors of [66] assessed the application of biogas slurry
    as an energy-efficient withdrawal solution for an osmotic dilution forward process,
    making it possible to extract water from wastewater with traces of metal pollutants
    for later use as a solution for hydroponic crops. Considering that the issue of
    water reuse is becoming increasingly important, it is necessary to not only intensify
    existing methods for surface and groundwater treatment but also to develop freshwater
    desalination technologies. The authors of [67] developed an energy-efficient technology
    for desalinating seawater and obtaining clean, fresh water through its forced
    evaporation with subsequent moisture condensation, thus providing an efficient
    operating unit that can be used independently, for example, for water supply for
    hydroponic crops. As is well-known, in hydroponic greenhouses, it is very important
    to maintain suitable indoor environmental conditions to maximize the development
    of crops. The authors of [74], in a greenhouse in Poland for lettuce crops, designed
    a system to recover water from exhaust air. This water-recovery system exploits
    condensation in a crossflow heat exchanger operating within an air-conditioning
    system that maintains the required air parameters. Experimentally, it was found
    that the effectiveness of the system was very high due to the specific parameters
    of the indoor air with which the lettuce was grown and the need for constant air
    exchange inside the greenhouse. The efficiency rose to 100% during the winter
    months, while it was very low during the summer months. In each case, it succeeded
    in satisfying 67.1% of the crop water requirements. Since the availability of
    water is very low in Poland, to cover the entirety of the crop water requirements,
    another solution has been developed with the same hydroponic greenhouse as the
    previous work that allows for the collection of rainwater from the roof surface,
    thus combining two solutions [69]. In the latter study, the authors carried out
    an analysis using the recorded rainfall in Poland from the last 20 years and hourly
    meteorological data recorded between 2012 and 2019. Based on the analysis of long-term
    water-recovery systems, rainwater was presented as a less stable source of water
    than water recovered from exhausted air. Despite this, the rainwater-recovery
    system achieved an interesting efficiency level during the summer months of 38.94%.
    After proper sizing of the tanks and a careful economic analysis, a solution was
    proposed that could cover 90.4% of the water demand. Considering the same topic,
    the authors of [70] investigated the potential of concentrated fertilizers for
    water recovery through forward osmosis. In their study, they determined the thermodynamic
    limits of fertilizer osmosis resulting from osmotic equilibrium, the operational
    limits resulting from the need to maintain proper flux levels, and the limits
    resulting from non-ideal transport dynamics with the aim of determining the amount
    of water that can be recovered for hydroponic crops. The authors showed how important
    elements for the development of crops, including nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus,
    could be recovered with this process from a municipal wastewater feed source.
    The results of these experiments showed that it was possible to cover 32% to 99%
    of the water demand for the reported hydroponic crops. Water sanitization processes
    may be chemical or physical, such as filtration, the application of radiation,
    or heat exchange processes. In heat exchange processes, in order to obtain an
    adequate level of sanitization, the required temperature is sometimes high and
    the timelines difficult to meet. For this reason, the authors of [71], in the
    context of water source recovery, developed a system for the sanitization of water
    that can be used with hydroponic crops at lower temperatures and with shorter
    times than traditional sanitation treatment. This was achieved through the simultaneous
    application of heat and solar UV radiation. The system studied involved the combination
    of an evacuated-tube solar collector and a flat-plate solar collector. This made
    it possible to eliminate the pathogens that may develop during agricultural practices
    and can be a problem for both food safety and water consumption. The authors of
    [73] aimed to combine the benefits of hydroponics with the benefits of the circular
    economy in water management in a pilot plant. In this experiment carried out in
    Germany, municipal water was recovered and used as a source to supply lettuce
    growing in a hydroponic greenhouse. The water collected in this district came
    from domestic sources and was, therefore, suitable for use in hydroponic systems.
    First, in this pilot plant, the municipal water was treated at a basic level to
    discharge the organic compounds using aerobic (activated sludge process) and anaerobic
    (expanded granular sludge bed reactor) processes. At this point, the water still
    contained contaminants and pathogens that posed food safety problems. Ozone was
    used to eliminate pathogens because it is a molecule with high oxidizing power,
    while an oxidative process was used to eliminate micro-contaminants (biologically
    activated carbon filtration). Once sanitized through these treatments, the water
    was ready to be used. As can be seen, most water-recovery systems feed hydroponic
    systems that are well-suited for this operation. Indeed, in wastewater, the elements
    that would normally be added if drinking water were to be used are already present.
    Therefore, the quantities of these elements are adjusted, pathogens and heavy
    metals are removed, and a sustainable source of water is obtained. Another concept
    that is very interesting for agriculture applications is that of recovering the
    water from HVAC systems employed to maintain the proper conditions. 3.2. Detailed
    Results for Each Crop To further investigate the issue of water consumption and
    to study the link between the technologies developed to date and the reference
    crops, two benchmarks were set: crop yield and water consumption. These benchmarks
    were calculated in terms of the area used (expressed in hectares) and the time
    (using daily and annual data). This was because the data from the papers pertaining
    to the water consumption and yield of the corresponding crops were not all the
    same dimensions; thus, the aim of this analysis was to standardize them so that
    an initial qualitative comparison could be undertaken. As Figure 10 shows, the
    greatest numbers of articles focused on crops such as lettuce and tomatoes, which
    accounted for 30% and 16% of the total, respectively. Another 7% of articles focused
    on fruits, such as apple, cherry, strawberry, and pomegranate. The remainder analyzed
    different types of crops, as can be seen in Table 5. This is why detailed data
    on the water consumption and yields for lettuce, tomato, fruits, and other crops
    are given below. Figure 10. Distribution of papers in relation to the different
    crops treated. Table 5. Numbers of articles dealing with specific crops. To assess
    the amount of water required to meet the needs of a given crop, it is necessary
    to consider the entire process. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the water
    requirements for irrigation before planting in drylands; the water requirements
    for flooding irrigation, such as rice cultivation; the water requirements for
    the crop grown when considering evapotranspiration; and the water requirements
    for special aims, such as cooling, heating, dehumidification, or preventing frost
    [36]. 3.2.1. Results for Water Consumption and Yield for Lettuce According to
    the FAO, lettuce is one of the most widely cultivated crops in the world. As Figure
    11 shows, its overall production has increased over the years to close to 28 million
    tons [1]. It is an annual plant that is native to the Mediterranean region and
    grown in temperate and subtropical areas. It belongs to the daisy family Asteraceae
    and is most often grown as a leaf vegetable. This crop is suitable for both open-field
    and greenhouse cultivation. It can grow in late autumn and early spring because
    it is very resistant to extremely hot and cold conditions. The harvest period
    under optimal conditions is after about 70–80 days [75]. Several morphotypes of
    lettuce are grown in production operations, but the most common are the romaine
    lettuce, leafy lettuce, headed crispy lettuce, and oily lettuce morphotypes. The
    morphotypes and varieties of lettuce grown depend on both market strategies and
    commercial requirements [76]. Figure 11. Global production of lettuce in the last
    20 years expressed in megatons. Source: FAO. 2022. FAOSTAT. Several experiments
    have been conducted on lettuce crops. Table 6 shows the results of the research
    that led to the quantification of the impact of the technologies used. Crop water
    requirements were estimated using remote sensors and fuzzy logic with the aim
    of optimizing the efficiency of the irrigation system to save water [36]. The
    variables input into the control were related to the environment in which the
    crop was grown. They were soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature, wind speed,
    soil permeability, rainfall, vegetation, and air pollution. For the fuzzy logic,
    the control outputs were the reference and water-stress evapotranspiration, the
    water pump conditions, the duration of water pump operation, the volume of water
    required for agricultural land, the irrigation efficiency, and the water losses.
    Three different modes of operation were assessed: in the first and second modes,
    the average daily and hourly data were considered. In the third case, the effects
    of air pollution, soil moisture, vegetation, and the rate of water infiltration
    were not assessed. The result, in this case, was that the second method was most
    accurate for determining water consumption and provided water savings of 70%.
    With the model, assuming irrigation once a day, the average water was calculated,
    and it was equal to 48,960 L/day. Considering that the farm area was 15 ha, the
    water requirement per ha was equal to 3264 L/ha. According to the authors, this
    fuzzy system can be used for any crop type [36]. Table 6. Detailed description
    of lettuce yield and water requirements. An aquaponic system was designed for
    growing a particular fish species and lettuce; employing a useful area for crop
    growth of 50 m, the expected yearly production of lettuce was four tons. Regarding
    water consumption, the annual water consumption was 1070 m3, including that necessary
    for the proper operation of the machinery within the system and for the healthy
    and adequate growth of both the animal and plant species treated. Carrying forward
    our analysis comparing various solutions using one hectare of area as a reference,
    once the useful surface area of action is known, the specific water consumption
    and specific yield can be calculated to be equal to 586.4 L/ha day and 11 kg/year
    ha, respectively [20]. Researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of cultivation
    inside a 1.5 × 1.5 × 2.1 m greenbox. This system was assembled using commercial
    grow tents, lighting elements, environmental monitoring and control modules, a
    ventilation system, and a nutrient solution delivery system. The crops inside
    this greenbox were compared with crops inside an experimental greenhouse. The
    water consumption and yield data for 12 annual harvests are outlined in Table
    7. It was found that both the greenbox and the greenhouse offered the desired
    environmental conditions for growing lettuce, but the greenbox may have had some
    advantages in operational terms since greenhouses are often situated in urban
    areas and require high investments due to the more expensive land and procedures
    for planning and setting them up. Indeed, it is possible to adapt greenboxes to
    any vacant urban space with a minimum of adjustment [27]. Table 7. Detailed description
    of tomato yield and water requirements. As a result of this analysis, the hydroponic
    solution was found to be the most sustainable solution in terms of water consumption
    for lettuce cultivation, resulting in consumption of 19.16 m3/ha. Remote sensing
    with fuzzy logic control was also a potentially suitable solution with 1191.36
    m3/ha. A very interesting data point came from the comparison of the hydroponic
    greenhouse and hydroponic greenbox. In this case, the hydroponic greenhouse was
    more sustainable under the same operating conditions. 3.2.2. Results for Water
    Consumption and Yield for Tomato As shown by FAO data, tomato is one of the most
    important crops, with world production close to 190 megatons and a harvest area
    of 5.3 million hectares [1]. Data about tomato production, depending on the annual
    tons produced and the extension of cultivated land, were reported, respectively,
    in Figure 12 and Figure 13. Tomatoes are a fast-growing crop with a vegetation
    period of between 90 and 150 days. Temperature and humidity play key roles in
    optimizing yields. In fact, tomato is a very frost-sensitive crop, but it grows
    well in mild, dry climates [1]. These data, combined with the characteristics
    of the crop, are the basis for the great attention paid to it; indeed, as can
    be seen from Table 5, several studies in the literature focus on tomatoes. Figure
    12. Global production of tomato in the last 20 years expressed in megatons. Source:
    FAO. 2022. FAOSTAT. Figure 13. Area harvested for tomato in the last 20 years
    expressed in million ha. Source: FAO. 2022. FAOSTAT. Following this trend, several
    studies in the literature focus on tomatoes as a crop. One study investigated
    a hydroponic system for growing tomatoes—in particular, the F1 hybrid tomato Suhyana—but
    did not provide accurate data regarding water consumption and yield [21]. Several
    other researchers [24,30,47,48,49,70] have performed tomato studies but did not
    quantify their results in terms of water consumption and yield. The authors of
    [26] carried out a scenario analysis utilizing a geographical information system
    to assess the effects of seasonality, growth method, and production area size
    on the overall quality of the energy–water–food node. In this study, four companies
    operating in the territory of Qatar were considered. These companies differed
    in their technologies and extension areas, but all grew tomatoes in hydroponic
    greenhouses. It was found that taking advantage of hydroponic greenhouses results
    in water savings and higher yields compared to field crops but also higher energy
    consumption, as it is necessary to power the various systems needed to operate
    the greenhouse, such as HVAC systems and a reverse osmosis plant if it used to
    obtain fresh water from wastewater. As can be seen from the table, this analysis
    highlighted how the size of the farm area also has an impact on the overall energy
    and water consumption, which was evident when comparing 40 ha with 1.65 ha. The
    values that emerge from this analysis show that hydroponics is a sustainable solution
    for growing tomatoes in both small and medium/large greenhouses. For this case,
    the water requirements per hectare were quantified and amounted to 3.35 m3/ha.
    3.2.3. Results for Water Consumption and Yield for Fruits Table 8 shows the water
    consumption and yield data for various orchards. For example, the authors of [36]
    implemented a control system based on fuzzy logic in the field, providing interesting
    data on apples and cherries. Table 8. Detailed description of fruit yields and
    water requirements. 3.2.4. Results for Water Consumption and Yield for Other Crops
    In this section, we report the most significant results for crops other than those
    mentioned above. The authors of [45] reported results in terms of water consumption
    for a solution based on the use of sensors for data acquisition, a platform for
    analyzing the big data acquired, a wireless actuator system, renewable energy
    sources to meet the energy needs of the various components used, a storage unit,
    a control unit, and a cluster controller. As can be seen from Table 9, using this
    system, considering 5 days of sampling and an area of 25 square meters, water
    savings of 71% were achieved. Table 9. Detailed description of yields and water
    consumption for other crops. The authors of [45] studied the impacts of different
    irrigation and fertilization strategies applied to a wheat crop in an LCA study.
    This study provided data on the extent of the land used for production and on
    water consumption, which are summarized in Table 9. The different strategies analyzed
    involved the combination of irrigation and rainfall and different concentrations
    of fertilizing elements. The values given in the table relate to 100% irrigation,
    regardless of fertilization process. The effectiveness of an irrigation control
    system for gynura procubens in an urban area in Malaysia was investigated in another
    studied. It was compared to traditional agricultural practices. Using IoT sensors
    to monitor soil moisture, environment temperature, and humidity, along with a
    fuzzy control system, water consumption decreased by 16.93%, while the growth
    rate increased by a maximum of 76.64% [18]. In the previous section, the findings
    from [47] were reported. Here, we can mention that the control-based system using
    a dielectric humidity sensor achieved a 30% reduction in water consumption and
    an 11.5% increase in yield compared to the gravimetric method. The authors of
    [16] compared different solutions involving plant-factory, greenhouse, and open-field
    cultivation for cai xin and xian cai. Finally, further interesting data in terms
    of yield and water consumption were found in a study on potato cultivation [55],
    which is the most commonly irrigated crop in Sweden. The crops involved in this
    last analysis differed from case to case. It is interesting to note that hydroponics
    again proved to be the solution with high water-saving potential. Fuzzy logic
    is widely used for remote sensing and water resource management and shows promising
    results. However, it was not possible to undertake a quantitative comparison as
    these data refer to different crops. 4. Conclusions and Future Research Agriculture
    is a key sector of national and global economy and, therefore, it is essential
    to adopt innovative solutions that maximize its profitability. Furthermore, climate
    change and population growth are forcing us to try to take measures to mitigate
    their negative effects in order to be able to feed the whole population. In this
    paper, we discussed technological developments that aim to optimize water consumption
    or water-use efficiency. However, farmers’ perceptions of these new technologies
    need to be analyzed and studied. One of the main problems is that farmers find
    it difficult to implement precision farming technologies. The main reasons for
    this are often related to farmers’ lack of awareness of the issues within the
    sector, such as financial limitations, technological difficulties, and communication
    difficulties, since Wi-Fi-type networks are often not available in the field.
    This is why it is important for governments to promote information campaigns so
    that farmers are made aware of the issues and are informed about the benefits
    they can gain from the application of Agriculture 4.0 technologies [77]. In the
    future, therefore, such solutions must be more user-friendly, cheaper, and more
    robust. In addition, the energy aspect must be considered and optimized to ensure
    that the devices used consume less energy, thus increasing their life expectancy
    and reducing faults [78]. The adoption of Agriculture 4.0 techniques in developing
    countries is more complex as there are several issues that must be considered:
    The availability of an adequate data transmission network that would allow the
    various devices to communicate with each other via the Internet; The availability
    of sensors; The availability of equipment and devices that can operate in the
    Agriculture 4.0 environment; The availability of experts in innovative technologies.
    However, farmers in developing countries face several challenges, such as a weak
    socioeconomic environment and rising cultivation costs. Thus, to address these
    issues and encourage the spread of advanced agricultural practices, it is important
    to adopt several strategies at the local, national, and global levels [79]. Indeed,
    there will have to be a great deal of support from the governments of developing
    countries at the small-farm level to ensure increased production and improved
    efficiency in the use of land and water resources. It is, therefore, clear that
    the dissemination of these solutions in developing countries will be more complex,
    but there is evidence in the literature that small steps are beginning to be taken
    [80,81,82,83,84,85]. The review provided some interesting insights into what the
    next challenges in agriculture will be and how the research community is preparing
    to meet them. The different technologies implemented were clarified, giving a
    quick idea of how broad the field of agricultural research is today. The trend
    that emerged was that of producing more while consuming less and, above all, limiting
    any kind of waste as resources become increasingly scarce. Increasing emphasis
    is being placed on precision agriculture, both in the field and in the greenhouse,
    using a combination of different technological solutions, such as advanced controls
    based on information from different sources. Each resource that is used, such
    as sensors, satellites, weather stations, time series, etc., corresponds to a
    different type of information. The review showed that the most frequently used
    sources of information are the monitoring conditions outside the plant, which
    are mostly based on the assessment of soil conditions and the environment in which
    the plant grows. In contrast, the use of dedicated instruments to measure the
    health status of crops by monitoring intrinsic parameters, such as a sap analysis,
    is less common. Studies based on the control of exogenous factors showed that
    it is certainly important to monitor and control environment conditions. However,
    those that also studied endogenous factors emphasized that the needs of the crop
    can be more accurately identified and assessed in this way. A tip for future studies
    is to integrate these sources as much as possible. By combining these resources,
    it is possible to implement control systems that consider different types of information
    and allow irrigation systems to be managed based on the evaluation of their different
    aspects. In addition, it was found that hydroponic vertical farming has a lower
    impact on water and soil consumption, but the energy aspect must be evaluated,
    as it plays a predominant role in the operation of all the systems involved. There
    are several shortcomings in the current literature. In fact, studies have focused
    on a small scale and not on a large scale. The studies also lack useful data that
    could be used to quantify the positive effects of the technology and, at the same
    time, facilitate the comparison of existing technologies. In this review, results
    in terms of water consumption per hectare and yield per hectare for different
    technologies were quantified. Consequently, a suggestion that may help future
    research is to quantify these data to obtain quantitative feedback on the technologies
    used. The link between agricultural practices and wastewater treatment must also
    be improved. Research must improve these technologies and ensure a circular economy
    for water utilization, as the literature review showed that this is a potential
    aspect of achieving water savings. All the technologies analyzed have the potential
    to improve the sustainability of the agriculture sector by optimizing the use
    of the resources used while also increasing their profitability. Saving water
    is an issue that must be addressed worldwide since the exploitation of this resource
    has reached worrying highs. The positive effects of the technologies summarized
    in this paper are clear on a global scale. However, it is necessary to assess
    the long-term effects of water management systems on regional hydrological cycles.
    Indeed, there are not enough detailed analyses in the literature to assess whether,
    at a regional level, the water savings achieved at the level of one crop translate
    into real savings when considering the whole groundwater or river basin [86].
    It is certainly clear that everything depends on the source of the water supply
    used to support the growing crops. A technology that aims to optimize the use
    of water resources can have an impact on the balance of the water cycle either
    by reducing water abstraction through better management or by increasing abstraction
    by maximizing the efficiency of the irrigation system. In this regard, there are
    important gaps in the literature that need to be filled. Future research should
    explore the link between the hydrological cycle and crop management in order to
    obtain a framework for assessing the water balance on a broad time scale and maximize
    the sustainability of agricultural practices not only locally but also regionally
    and nationally [87,88]. From the technologies analyzed, the low prevalence of
    digital twins for farms emerged. Therefore, a suggestion for future research is
    to implement digital twins for the modeling of water collection and distribution
    networks for irrigation purposes. This would help to ensure the correct supply
    of water and nutrients to crops, minimizing the consumption of resources and increasing
    the efficiency and sustainability of water use. The models developed can be tested
    and validated in the field to establish the link between the simulation models
    and intelligent IoT systems in the field. Digital twins, information sources,
    and machine learning algorithms may be the key to the development of autonomous
    robotic solutions enabling advanced mechanization and management of water resources
    based on the models developed both in the field and in greenhouses or vertical
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, L.P., F.S. and G.V.; methodology,

  description: Hyperspectral imagery plays a vital role in precision agriculture,
    forestry, environment, and geological applications. Over the past decade, extensive
    research has been carried out in the field of hyperspectral remote sensing. First
    introduced by the Italian Space Agency ASI in 2019, space-borne PRISMA hyperspectral
    imagery (PHSI) is taking the hyperspectral remote sensing research community into
    the next era due to its unprecedented spectral resolution of ≤12 nm. Given these
    abundant free data and high spatial resolution, it is crucial to provide remote
    sensing researchers with information about the critical attributes of PRISMA imagery,
    making it the most viable solution for various land and water applications. Hence,
    in the present study, a SWOT analysis was performed for PHSI using recent case
    studies to exploit the potential of PHSI for different remote sensing applications,
    such as snow, soil, water, natural gas, and vegetation. From this analysis, it
    was found that the higher reflectance spectra of PHSI, which have comprehensive
    coverage, have greater potential to extract vegetation biophysical parameters
    compared to other applications. Though the possible use of these data was demonstrated
    in a few other applications, such as the identification of methane gases and soil
    mineral mapping, the data may not be suitable for continuous monitoring due to
    their limited acquisition, long revisiting times, noisy bands, atmospheric interferences,
    and computationally heavy processing, particularly when executing machine learning
    models. The potential applications of PHSI include large-scale and efficient mapping,
    transferring technology, and fusion with other remote sensing data, whereas the
    lifetime of satellites and the need for interdisciplinary personnel pose challenges.
    Furthermore, some strategies to overcome the aforementioned weaknesses and threats
    are described in our conclusions.

    Hyperspectral imagery plays a vital role in precision agriculture, forestry, environment,
    and geological applications. Over the past decade, extensive research has been
    carried out in the field of hyperspectral remote sensing. First introduced by
    the Italian Space Agency ASI in 2019, space-borne PRISMA hyperspectral imagery
    (PHSI) is taking the hyperspectral remote sensing research community into the

    free data and high spatial resolution, it is crucial to provide remote sensing
    researchers with information about the critical attributes of PRISMA imagery,

    in the present study, a SWOT analysis was performed for PHSI using recent case

    was found that the higher reflectance spectra of PHSI, which have comprehensive

    transferring technology, and fusion with other remote sensing data, whereas the
    lifetime of satellites and the need for interdisciplinary personnel pose challenges.
    Furthermore, some strategies to overcome the aforementioned weaknesses and threats
    are described in our conclusions. Keywords: Italian Space Agency; hyperspectral
    imagery; potential assessment; PRISMA; SWOT 1. Introduction PRecursore IperSpettrale
    della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), a satellite of the Italian Space Agency,
    carries a hyperspectral sensor that captures a continuum of spectral bands in
    the range of 400–2500 nm with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The widths of spectral
    sampling intervals are ≤12 nm. This sensor counts 173 bands within 920–2500 nm
    in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) portion and 66 bands within 400–1010 nm in the
    visible near-infrared (VNIR) portion of the light spectrum. A panchromatic camera
    on PRISMA provides a single band in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm at a 5
    m spatial resolution [1,2]. PRISMA hyperspectral imagery (PHSI) has been used
    for applications such as forest fuel mapping [1]; forest discrimination [2]; burned
    area mapping [3]; prediction of methane emissions [4]; agricultural applications
    [5]; the study of geochemical investigations for parameters of soil moisture,
    soil organic matter, and soil organic carbon [6]; the study of water quality [7];
    and geological applications [8,9]. The ‘Sviluppo di Prodotti Iperspettrali Prototipali
    Evoluti’ project funded by the Italian Space Agency is developing procedures to
    map fire presence and fire severity, the extent of fire fuel, urban growth, urban
    areas, industrial areas, volcanic areas and volcanic parameters, and vegetation.
    PRISMA proved to be a valuable instrument for the determination of the residual
    fire severity in an investigated area (ASI|Agenzia Spaziale Italiana). Thus, the
    PRISMA satellite has wide applicability [10]. Bibliometric information collected
    from the literature was augmented using VOS-viewer software (Figure 1) to identify
    PRISMA applications, techniques, and processing methods. Such maps outline the
    relationships between existing publications based on the relationships between
    journals, institutions, types of problems, and the frequency of topic reoccurrences.
    Reoccurrences of keywords in the reviewed articles are mapped in Figure 1. The
    links that attach the nodes in Figure 1 indicate connections between them; the
    shorter the distance between them, the stronger the relationship. Scientometrics
    is the field of study that concerns itself with measuring and analyzing scholarly
    literature. A scientometric analysis of the augmented clusters shown in Figure
    1 indicates that the “PRISMA” keyword had the most repetitions (repeated 11 times),
    followed by Sentinel-2 with five occurrences, which indicated articles on multispectral
    and hyperspectral data fusion. As shown in Figure 1, the other predominant sensors
    next to PRISMA are HYPSIRI [11] and AVIRIS [11], which are hyperspectral spectrometers.
    Before the launch of PRISMA, AVIRIS datasets were employed in which these terms
    reoccurred, and some researchers connected these data with future sensor HYPSIRI.
    Application domains such as nitrogen content prediction, classification, and agriculture
    were repeated, which indicates crucial applications for which the sensor is frequently
    used. Terms such as “classification”, “regression”, and “dimension reduction”
    were also used in the PRISMA papers. Dimensional reduction is necessary to reduce
    the computation load and the time required for computation. The guided image filtering
    term shown in Figure 1 is an effective noise reduction technique used for hyperspectral
    data. Figure 1. Knowledge mapping (2018–2022): scientometric analysis using VOS-viewer
    software. The color bar at the bottom right corner denotes the year of the publication.
    This scientometric analysis considered publications from 2018 to 2022 because
    the PRISMA satellite launched in 2018. Figure 2 is based on the results of the
    scientometric analysis depicted in Figure 1. This analysis is used in various
    earth observation inventory applications (Figure 1). Riyaaz et al. [1] reported
    the automatic procedure developed for fuel types in forest fires and concluded
    that PHSI provides an overall accuracy of around 85%. Their procedure can map
    fuel types in any part of Europe, and thus assist researchers/policymakers/fire
    managers in studying fire potential, behavior, emissions, management, effects,
    and land surface temperature. Sander et al. [11], in their survey, reported that
    PRISMA data products provide opportunities to further explore linkages between
    ecosystem properties and fires on both regional and global scales. Figure 2. Applications
    of PRISMA Hyperspectral Imagery. In a study conducted to map burned areas [3]
    using PHSI and Sentinel-2—a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites—sensors
    data demonstrated that the combined use of optical and hyperspectral datasets
    enabled the detection of burned areas in a complex background with an overall
    accuracy of 98%. Lazzeri et al. [12] conducted multitemporal mapping of post-fire
    land cover using PRISMA, Sentinel-2, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Portugal
    and Italy. It was demonstrated that due to the ability to capture imagery in a
    broader wavelength range, the hyperspectral sensors on UAVs are more beneficial
    than PRISMA or Sentinel-2. Due to its ability to detect and classify nonphotosynthetic
    vegetation [13], PRISMA was found to be suitable for studying crop residues; however,
    senescent vegetation had not yet been harvested, and crop residues were not well
    distinguished. The study added that PRISMA is not designed to quantify cellulose
    abundance or to evaluate differences among species. Bohn et al. [14] used PHSI
    to estimate glacier ice surface properties, such as crystal size, algae concentration,
    and liquid water content. Niroumand-Jadidi et al. [7] compared the results of
    PRISMA and Sentinel-2 in a study of water quality and reported that an atmospheric
    correction algorithm developed for PRISMA did not improve the results of either
    method. Bresciani et al. [15] compared hyperspectral data from PRISMA and the
    Earth-sensing imaging spectrometer (DESIS) used by the German Space Agency (DLR)
    for aquatic applications. They reported that more data for training and validating
    would improve the results for both technologies. Kokal et al. [16] compared PRISMA
    with LANDSAT-9 in land cover classification using a support vector machine classifier
    and obtained overall accuracies of 89.33% for LANDSAT-9 and 92.33% for PRISMA.
    As LANDSAT-9 has a spectral resolution of 20–180 nm and PRISMA has a spectral
    resolution of ≤12 nm, it was concluded that the higher spectral resolution of
    PRISMA accounted for its slightly better results. From the literature search of
    PRISMA research, it was identified that, in a few studies, strengths and weaknesses
    were explicitly discussed, while threats and opportunities were overlooked. Meanwhile,
    other studies may be useful for explaining threats and opportunities, while ignoring
    other parameters. Many studies have explicitly reported the working potential
    of PRISMA for their applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive
    study quantitatively consolidates this information via a SWOT strategy to bring
    out the potential of PRISMA images. This comprehensive study is essential for
    researchers working on a hyperspectral remote sensing cluster to understand the
    importance of these newly launched data and their range of applications. The SWOT
    analysis is the process of evaluating the interrelations between external and
    internal factors of a system to extract strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
    and threats; it is a mixed evaluation (subjective–objective) [17,18,19]. Combining
    these analysis strategies will provide a comprehensive update and a detailed assessment
    of the situation. Strengths and weaknesses are internal elements connected to
    the objectives and performance of satellite data [19]. At the same time, opportunities
    and threats are external elements that consider features facilitating the establishment
    of businesses and hindering achievable goals, respectively [20]. In this study,
    a SWOT analysis was conducted for PHSI and further strengthened by examining the
    internal and external factors reported in the various case studies. The objectives
    of this study are as follows: (i) bibliometric analysis of publications on PHSI
    focusing on applications; (ii) SWOT analysis with case studies from the literature,
    which includes the technical defects of this imagery. SWOT analysis has remained
    one of the best ways to assess the potential of any system, and there is no research
    available that contains a SWOT analysis of PHSI. We believe this comprehensive
    study with a SWOT analysis would help the remote sensing community to better understand
    the potential of PHSI. 2. Materials 2.1. PRISMA Hyperspectral Products PRISMA
    products are divided and subdivided according to their utility. Level 0 provides
    raw data in binary files, including instrument and satellite ancillary data (e.g.,
    cloud cover percentage). Level 1 consists of radiometrically and geometrically
    calibrated hypercubes and panchromatic radiance images in the higher atmosphere.
    Level 2 consists of four sub-levels: L2A, L2B, L2C, and L2D. Images of geolocated
    on-ground radiance (L2B), geolocated reflectance (L2C), and geolocated and geocoded
    on-ground reflectance images (L2D) are provided [2,21]. Land cover mapping and
    cloud masking are available in the Level 1 product. This includes atmospheric
    constituents such as aerosols, thin cloud optical thickness, and water vapor.
    Details of PRISMA products are provided in the PRISMA specifications document.
    Levels 1 and 2 are generated on demand and released in hierarchical data format
    (release 5, HDF5). Level 2 products can be georeferenced with or without ground
    control points (GCP), according to user preference and GCP availability [2,21].
    In June 2019, following the launch of the PRISMA satellite, hyperspectral data
    were released for public use. Since hyperspectral imagery is useful for various
    applications, it has become a particular interest of remote sensing researchers
    to exploit the fullest potential of these data. Hence, since 2019, these data
    have been employed in various applications, as shown in Figure 2. Environment
    for Visualizing Images (ENVI) is a software application used to process and analyze
    geospatial imagery. ENVI recently released an add-on ENVI-PRISMA toolkit that
    can ease the processing of PRISMA hyperspectral imagery (PHSI). Additionally,
    ImaACor software was developed for atmospherically correcting both multispectral
    and hyperspectral imagery. The evaluation of this software using PRISMA data has
    proven it to be a value-added software that researchers can use to process PRISMA
    L1 data and conduct atmospheric corrections independently. The preprocessing steps
    of the PRISMA imagery commonly applied for all the applications include (1) georeferencing;
    (2) correction of georeferencing; (3) removal of noisy lines and bands, since
    more than 20% of bands are affected; (4) conversion from radiance to reflectance
    for L1 and L2B PRISMA products; (5) Masking of pixels that are unnecessary to
    the study using PRISMA L1 land cover map. 2.2. Assessment of PRISMA This section
    explains SWOT components in detail, which were obtained using the assessment of
    PRISMA hyperspectral data. Strengths PRISMA offers global coverage [1], with a
    spectral resolution of 12 nm, spectral bands of >230 nm, and a spatial resolution
    of 30 m [22,23]. PRISMA provides more information about the Earth’s surface than
    the planned hyperspectral sensor HYPSIRI [11] (which is due to be launched in
    2024) and the earlier hyperspectral sensor AVIRIS [11]. The VIS-SWIR channels
    of PRISMA have a high spectral resolution that can be integrated with a panchromatic
    camera [24,25]. PRISMA has a higher potential than Sentinel-2 for mapping the
    quality parameters of water [7]. PRISMA’s SWIR channel offers a higher separability
    than the SWIR channel on Sentinel-2 [2,12]. In the 2000–2200 nm range, the Earth’s
    nonphotosynthetic vegetation cover can be examined using PRISMA [13,26,27]. Reflectance
    spectra (400–2500 nm) can indicate ng fuel types [15], water aquatic systems [26],
    the classification of different types of agricultural land cover [5], and forest
    cover [2], as well as provide an improved distinction between coniferous and broadleaved
    trees [2,28]. The discrimination between two and five forest categories by 40%
    and 102%, respectively, is improved by PRISMA [2]. The PRISMA sensor combines
    a hyperspectral sensor with a medium-resolution panchromatic camera [21]. PRISMA
    is available in three products: L0, L1, and L2 (please refer to Section 2) [1,21].
    A hyperspectral image simulator (HSIS) is included in the PRISMA system so that
    the performance of L1 and L2 PRISMA processors can be evaluated [29]. PRISMA HDF5
    images can be opened with the EnMap Toolbox. PRISMA proved to be a valuable instrument
    for the determination of the residual fire severity in the investigated area [30].
    PRISMA’s spectral resolution and its large number of channels, ranging from visible
    to short-wave infrared “SWIR”, enables a better estimation of the abundance of
    major atmospheric constituents, and an efficient removal of atmospheric effects
    on the acquired images [31]. PRISMA matches well with the MODTRAN simulation [32]
    of high atmospheric conditions. PRISMA top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances of Level
    1 (L1) products are consistent with the values expected to be observed over water
    targets [26]. The standard products L1 and L2 are suitable for the retrieval of
    biophysical parameters [32]. The product Level 2D is reported to be effective
    for the mapping of burned areas [3]. PRISMA data can be used for the quantitative
    analysis of CH4 plumes [4]. PRISMA represents a unique orbiting source of hyperspectral
    data to investigate and analyze geophysical/geological phenomena [8]. PRISMA data
    can assist with soil organic content applications [6,33], as well as detecting
    and identifying natural and anthropogenic disasters in vegetation, which makes
    them useful in post-disaster management [33]. Weaknesses ✓ Lack of phenological
    data [6]; ✓ Atmospheric correction is not developed for aquatic applications [7];
    ✓ PRISMA data were only tested at the parcel scale, which is not sufficient for
    distinguishing between non-agricultural vegetation and crop leftovers [23,34];
    ✓ The PRISMA sensor cannot scan at the required angles because there is no scanning
    mechanism onboard [24]; ✓ As vegetation cover is dynamic and fast-changing, timely
    image acquisitions strongly influence the performance of the PRISMA application.
    The temporal resolution of PRISMA is an issue [12]; ✓ A contiguous spectral response
    might not detect aliasing between adjacent but different materials. If there is
    a time lag between scene acquisitions, varying atmospheric and illumination conditions
    might have a considerable impact on the acquired image [2]; ✓ More than 20 bands
    will contain greater than 50% noise [1]; ✓ Irregular noisy bands broaden temporal
    resolution [1]; ✓ Selected bands can have irregular noise values [28]; ✓ The spatial
    resolution of PRISMA data is insufficient for precision farming applications [5].
    Opportunities: ✓ Future algorithms for the routine mapping of vegetation traits
    from operational spaceborne sensors will be defined [23]; ✓ The PRISMA-based retrievals
    agree well with those of Sentinel-2 (high consistency in top-of-atmosphere radiance),
    mainly the total suspended matter (TSM) maps [7]; ✓ The Coeff (a univariate quadratic
    function of wavelength), computed from average PRISMA spectra per land parcel,
    is a significant index for obtaining accurate results with the object-based classification
    of crops’ single parcels. The main advantage of object-based classification over
    per-pixel classification is faster computation [13]; ✓ PRISMA’s mission aims to
    demonstrate in-orbit qualification of a state-of-the-art hyperspectral imager,
    validate end-to-end data processing, and enable environmental monitoring and risk
    prevention [24]; ✓ The combined hyperspectral and panchromatic products enable
    the recognition of geometric features that provide detailed information about
    the chemical composition of substances on the Earth’s surface [31]; ✓ Unmanned
    aerial vehicles equipped with UAV platforms and a hyperspectral sensor, and used
    with PRISMA, can enable the acquisition of ground truth. The PRISMA image can
    be co-registered with a Sentinel-2 image [12]; ✓ PRISMA has better discrimination
    and a more complex nomenclature system than Sentinel-2; the two can be combined
    to study the physiochemical and geometric features of a target, contributing to
    forest analysis, precision agriculture, water quality assessment, and climate
    change research [2]; ✓ Automatic procedures can be applied to develop fuel maps
    of any part of Europe [1]; ✓ Procedures developed for PRISMA will be used globally
    [28]; ✓ Ongoing research will improve PRISMA images [5]; ✓ PRISMA data might be
    fused with data from a panchromatic camera or with satellite data from Landsat
    and ASTER (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection) [35]; ✓ The standard
    nearest-neighbor method proved to be the most robust on the PRISMA scene [27].
    Threats: ✓ Lack of reference data for model training leads to a decrease in PRISMA
    accuracy [23]; ✓ The one-day time gap between PRISMA and Sentinel-2 leads to differences
    in their atmospheric corrections [7]; ✓ PRISMA is not designed to quantify cellulose
    abundance or to evaluate species differences [13]; ✓ Hyperspectral images should
    be used with caution when evaluating burned areas after wildfires because of the
    elapsed time from event to image acquisition [12]; ✓ The presence of many shadow
    areas, where tall and short trees are mixed, can alter the results of separability
    analysis [2]; ✓ Unlike Sentinel-2 data, PRISMA images cannot be downloaded in
    a cloud platform [1]; ✓ Irregular noisy bands can lead to inaccuracies in PRISMA
    images [1]; ✓ The number of noisy bands, the georeferencing, and the levels of
    data are not yet standardized in PRISMA [28]; ✓ As the data and parameters that
    can be retrieved from PRISMA are often fed into physical models, it is crucial
    to ensure an extremely accurate radiometric accuracy during the mission lifetime.
    The COVID-19 pandemic affected the data measurement plan. Further analyses are
    necessary to confirm the results obtained using PRISMA extreme viewing geometries,
    including new land cover targets for the spring/summer period when agricultural
    soil is not plowed [32]; ✓ PRISMA-Sentinel-2 data fusion procedures are being
    tested to search for the best-performing procedure in the PRISMA-Sentinel-2 framework.
    Sentinel-2 and PRISMA images acquired with very low time differences might not
    be available [36]. 2.3. SWOT Matrix Table 1 shows a strength, weaknesses, opportunities,
    and threats (SWOT) matrix created for PHSI. This matrix depicts the positives
    and negatives of the internal and external factors of a system and determines
    the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of PHSI. Table 1. SWOT Matrix.
    2.4. Discussion The strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of PRISMA
    are discussed below. Strengths A major strength of PRISMA hyperspectral imagery
    is its accuracy in detecting wildfire fuel types [37,38]. It is possible to detect
    all the available fuel types in the area of interest due to PRISMA’s high number
    of spectral bands and support of machine learning approaches [1,39,40]. Only vegetation
    in broad categories, such as shrublands, grasslands, broadleaf forests, and coniferous
    forests, can be detected using multispectral data [41,42,43,44]. LiDAR can detect
    hyperspectral data, but there is a lack of LiDAR sensors nationwide [45,46,47,48].
    At present, actively operating spaceborne hyperspectral sensors include PRISMA,
    DESIS—a dynamic line rating Earth-sensing imaging spectrometer platform of the
    International Space Station that is attached to a multiple-user system for Earth
    sensing (MUSES) [15,30]—and the recently launched EnMAP [30] (the hyperspectral
    satellite of the German Aerospace Centre). Few comparative studies have been performed
    that compare the data among these sensors. In one example, a study on crop classifications
    using PRISMA and DESIS concluded that PRISMA yielded substantially higher classification
    accuracies because of its higher signal-to-noise ratio [49]. PRISMA is one of
    the satellites that have global coverage. The algorithm developed for one region
    can be implemented in other parts of the world to extract wildfire fuel types.
    Many other hyperspectral sensors have limited coverage, such as the Airborne Imaging
    Spectrometer (AIS) [50], Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) [51], Airborne Imaging
    Spectrometer for different Applications (AISA) [52], Airborne Reflective Emissive
    Spectrometer (ARES) [53], Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) [54], Airborne Visible/Near-Infrared
    Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) [55], Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment
    (HYDICE) [56], Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DA-IS-7915) [57], Hyperspectral
    Mapper (HyMap) [58], Operational Modular Imaging Spectrometer (OMIS) [59], and
    Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) [60]. Algorithms
    for vegetation indicators [61], water quality [62], fire severity mapping [12],
    forest fire front mapping, volcanic parameters estimation [63], urban mapping
    [64], fuel mapping [65], and material detection were developed under the framework
    of “Sviluppo di Prodotti Iperspettrali Prototipali Evoluti”, which is funded by
    the Italian Space Agency [64]. Each algorithm provides input for one specific
    region on Earth. Additionally, a recent study on analyzing marine mucilage [66],
    sugarcane leaf area index [67], wildfire detection [68], and cyanobacterial estimation
    [69] using PRISMA was published. Aside from its applicability in many fields,
    automation is necessary for continuous monitoring in any application and is particularly
    essential for disaster management [1], which is possible with PRISMA due to its
    global availability. A strength of PRISMA is its panchromatic camera. This camera
    provides panchromatic sharpening, a technique that combines the high-resolution
    detail from a panchromatic band with the low-resolution color information of other
    bands, usually only visible bands. Panchromatic images reduce the spatial resolution
    to 5 m. For instance, Maria et al. [25] detected plastic litter using PRISMA panchromatic
    image resolution. Weaknesses PRISMA is an on-demand technology, and the acquisition
    of data for a specific date is not easy due to the high traffic of requests. Easy
    and automatic access to data is essential for the management of disasters, such
    as wildfires, earthquakes, etc. Moreover, an analysis cannot be performed for
    the complete desired region due to the limited availability of data in the archive.
    Figure 3 shows the PRISMA images available for Italy. PRISMA also requires cloud
    environments such as DIAS (Data and Information Access Services), provided for
    the Sentinel family, to automatically download images [70]. Figure 3. PRISMA images
    available for Italy. The revisiting time of the PRISMA satellite is ~16 days,
    which is another constraint on data gathering. The PRISMA-Second Generation satellite,
    which is due to be launched in 2024, will make PRISMA more accessible. The processing
    of PRISMA data is time-consuming due to a large number of bands (239). Processing
    data using machine learning techniques takes more time than processing data with
    a multispectral [3], synthetic aperture radar (SAR) [24]. Data from the dynamic
    line rating (DLR) Earth-sensing imaging spectrometer (DESIS) are captured only
    in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) regions [49]. To automate data processing
    for a complete region, high computation power is required. Virtual machines, such
    as the EarthConsole G-BOX [71] provided by European Space Agency (ESA), can be
    accessed to process this hyperspectral imagery. Hyperspectral data have unstable,
    noisy bands in the hypercube. PRISMA data have dead/noisy lines on some of the
    bands in the hypercube, as illustrated in Figure 4. A procedure for removing the
    dead and noisy lines using linear/nonlinear interpolation is described in [1].
    According to the literature, most of the applications apply some machine/deep
    learning techniques to predict the required parameters using PRISMA. Data regarding
    the desired region of interest are required to train artificial intelligence techniques.
    However, data are often scarce, which is a major weakness of data processing [72].
    Figure 4. Noisy lines on PHSI. Opportunities PRISMA hyperspectral data are available
    from any part of Earth and can be accessed by anyone from anywhere upon registration.
    Open access algorithms developed for various applications can be used when needed.
    Once an algorithm/procedure is developed, it can be transferred among institutions
    and research centers. Technology transfer has become easier since PRISMA data
    became globally available. In some cases, image fusion with remote sensing data,
    such as multispectral, radar, and LiDAR data, can help to extract the desired
    results. For example, LiDAR data can help to determine whether forest vegetation
    is prone to catching fire [73,74]. Nicola et al. [36] fused PRISMA data with Sentinel-2
    data to enhance the spatial resolution to 10 m. Anis et al. [75] developed a soil
    fertility map of northern Morocco by fusing PRISMA and GIS data. Challenges Hyperspectral
    data processing is an interdisciplinary field, and personnel who process these
    data need to be familiar with their applications and with machine/deep learning.
    Artificial intelligence techniques are essential for the processing of hyperspectral
    data. Procedures developed for the PRISMA satellite will be useful over the lifetime
    of the satellite (5–7 years) if there is no degradation in the sensor. However,
    the Italian Space Agency has announced the launch of PRISMA-SG, which could extend
    the use of procedures developed for PRISMA. Future Scope for PRISMA Although the
    applicability of PRISMA has been demonstrated for almost all land and ocean applications,
    it is yet to be tested for applications regarding oil spills, defense, soil pollution,
    and climate change. Furthermore, a few recent studies highlighted that using deep
    learning approaches and composite kernels significantly enhances the classification
    accuracy of hyperspectral data products after fusing them with LiDAR data [76,77].
    Hence, PRISMA hyperspectral imagery and LiDAR data fusion, using extinction profiles
    and quantum machine learning [77] or a deep convolutional neural network [78],
    have excellent future scope in classification applications. 3. Conclusions Hyperspectral
    imagery plays a vital role in precision agriculture, forestry, environment, and
    geological applications. In the present study, SWOT analysis was performed for
    PHSI, using recent case studies in which the potential of PHSI was exploited for
    different remote sensing applications, such as mineral mapping, snow mapping,
    wildfire fuel mapping, crop monitoring, forest management, non-photosynthetic
    vegetation mapping, the identification of methane gases, quantum-based studies,
    wildfire detection, marine plastic litter detection, post-fire land cover, aquatic
    management, soil fertility mapping, water pollution management, soil properties
    study, and cyanobacterial biomass estimation. The significant strength parameters
    of PHSI have enhanced reflectance spectra and improved spatial resolution, therefore
    making PHSI more suitable for studying vegetation biophysical parameters compared
    to other applications. The major weakness of PRISMA is the very high computational
    time required to process a huge amount of data using complex machine learning
    models. Furthermore, PRISMA data have limited availability, and atmospheric interference
    results in noisy bands that require computationally intensive processes. The significant
    advantage of PRISMA data is the technology transfer and fusion with other remotely
    sensed images, such as optical remote sensing data, LiDAR, and SAR, which make
    these data applicable for a wide range of applications and able to obtain reliable
    results without atmospheric interferences. Data acquisition is mainly hindered
    by the lifetime of PRISMA, and data processing is made challenging due to the
    requirement of interdisciplinary personnel. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Due to the recent advances in the domain of smart agriculture as a
    result of integrating traditional agriculture and the latest information technologies
    including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence
    (AI), there is an urgent need to address the information security-related issues
    and challenges in this field. In this article, we propose the integration of lightweight
    cryptography techniques into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture to meet the
    requirements of resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, we investigate the
    adoption of a lightweight encryption protocol, namely, the Expeditious Cipher
    (X-cipher), to create a secure channel between the sensing layer and the broker
    in the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol as well as a secure channel
    between the broker and its subscribers. Our case study focuses on smart irrigation
    systems, and the MQTT protocol is deployed as the application messaging protocol
    in these systems. Smart irrigation strives to decrease the misuse of natural resources
    by enhancing the efficiency of agricultural irrigation. This secure channel is
    utilized to eliminate the main security threat in precision agriculture by protecting
    sensors’ published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from unauthorized
    changes to sensitive data that can negatively impact crops’ development. In addition,
    the secure channel protects the irrigation decisions made by the data analytics
    (DA) entity regarding the irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned
    to actuators from any alteration. Performance evaluation of our chosen lightweight
    encryption protocol revealed an improvement in terms of power consumption, execution
    time, and required memory usage when compared with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES). Moreover, the selected lightweight encryption protocol outperforms the
    PRESENT lightweight encryption protocol in terms of throughput and memory usage.

    An increasing number of research studies on smart agriculture has been motivated
    by several challenges. First, the explosive growth of the world population [1].
    According to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization, an increase
    of up to 70% more food will be required in 2050. Second, the declining agricultural
    lands and exhaustion of finite natural resources such as fresh water and arable
    land. In addition, the decreasing number of agricultural laborers in the majority
    of countries. As a consequence of this agricultural workforce decline, there is
    an urgent need for the adoption of IoT solutions in agriculture practices to reduce
    the need for manual labor. IoT solutions support farmers to tighten the supply-demand
    gap. Precision agriculture integrates wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with traditional
    agriculture to improve crop yields. This is carried out by using a large number
    of low-power multi-function wireless communication sensors to remotely monitor
    the farmland to collect environmental data, crop growth data, and livestock health
    data to guarantee a reduction in the possible threats to the production process
    and help farmers make better decisions. Recently, there is a shift from the usage
    of WSNs for smart agriculture to the IoT as the main enabling technology for smart
    agriculture. The IoT combines several technologies such as radio frequency identification,
    wireless sensor networks, middleware systems, end-user applications, and cloud
    computing. In [2,3], the authors presented an IoT ecosystem architecture for smart
    agriculture that is made up of four main components, namely: IoT devices, communication
    technology, internet, and data storage and processing. First, the IoT devices
    are responsible for monitoring the farming environment and collecting environmental
    data, crop growth data, and livestock health data. Second, the role of communication
    technology is to establish robust, reliable, and secure communication between
    the cloud and the farms. Wireless communication standards are categorized based
    on the coverage range into short-range and long-range standards. The short-range
    standards include Bluetooth, near-field communication (NFC)-enabled devices, ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, and passive and active radio frequency identification (RFID) systems.
    The long-range communication standards are defined as low-power wide-area networks
    (LPWA). Examples of long-range communication standards include LoRa, Sigfox, and
    NB-IoT. The LPWA technologies provide a wide area of coverage to low-power devices
    [4]. LPWA technologies outperform conventional cellular and short-range wireless
    technologies for different emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications
    such as metering, logistics, industrial monitoring, and agriculture. However,
    LPWA technologies realize long-range ranging from a few to tens of kilometers
    and low-power operations at the expense of a low data rate. The primary aim of
    LPWA technologies is to achieve a 10-year battery life. LPWA technologies are
    suitable for delay-tolerant applications, as they achieve throughput in orders
    of ten kilobits per second and high latency in orders of seconds or minutes. Long
    range is achieved due to the use of the sub-1GHz band, and the deployment of narrow-band
    and spread spectrum techniques are the modulation techniques adopted by different
    LPWA technologies. In [4], the authors compared the technical specifications of
    various LPWA technologies and standards. The choice of communication technology
    depended on the application of the IoT device and the type of topology. Third,
    the internet is the core network layer enabling the availability of data collected
    by IoT devices anywhere and anytime. Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) [5] has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) as a routing protocol for resource-constrained nodes in IoT. RPL builds
    a robust topology over lossy links. A destination-oriented directed acyclic graph
    (DODAG) is the core of RPL, which represents a routing diagram of nodes. In [6],
    the authors proposed an enhanced routing protocol based on RPL called E-RPL that
    decreases the number of control messages. Moreover, they proposed a flexible multi-constrained
    objective function (OF) that integrates several metrics such as energy, delay,
    and bandwidth to define the end-to-end path between the sink and a given node.
    The simulation results of their proposal revealed a remarkable improvement in
    terms of end-to-end delay, energy consumption, and routing overhead. Finally,
    different platforms have been developed to provide data analytics, data management,
    and data storage of the big data collected from sensors. Data analytics (DA) has
    a primary role in improving the efficiency of smart agriculture systems and in
    increasing productivity. DA is classified into five classes based on the requirements
    of IoT applications: real-time analytics, memory-level analytics, offline analytics,
    business intelligence-level analytics, and massive analytics. In [7], the authors
    presented big IoT data analytic types, methods, and technologies for big data
    mining. DA can help in insurance, prediction, storage management, decision-making,
    farm management, and precision farming. In irrigation systems, the automated decision
    made by DA controls the water supply timing and quantity. The main objective of
    big data analytics is to analyze collected information to predict and identify
    recent trends, find hidden information, and finally, make decisions. Prediction,
    classification, clustering, and association rules are the main big data analytics
    methods. Furthermore, smart irrigation is a precision agriculture application
    [8] that aims to control water consumption in the agriculture sector as a scarce
    resource in many countries by deploying IoT technology to remotely gather information
    from sensors implanted in agriculture terrains to monitor soil different parameters
    in all stages. Based on the collected information, a decision is made on when
    to irrigate and the water quantity and quality required. Table 1 reviews the recent
    research on IoT-based precision irrigation systems, highlighting the communication
    protocol, data analytics, and security techniques deployed in these systems. As
    can be noticed, recent research ignores security techniques and concentrates on
    the usage of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, such as
    fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and regression models, to optimize
    IoT-based irrigation systems employing different environmental parameters and
    weather conditions to schedule the irrigation timing and the quantity of water
    used for irrigation. However, any alteration in the information coming from sensors
    and decisions passed to actuators can lead to crop damage, which is considered
    to be a crucial threat to the national security of any country. As such, a secure
    channel must be developed between the sensing layer and the decision-making entity
    to secure information flowing from the sensors to the decision-maker entity and
    to secure the decision returned to the actuators that control the irrigation system.
    Because precision agriculture is highly dependent on data and information from
    the monitored system, any alteration in such data during runtime can lead to expensive
    unmanageable decisions and actions from farmers. Therefore, there is a need to
    adopt the security mechanisms required to guarantee basic security functions:
    authenticity, reliability, integrity, and availability. Moreover, these security
    mechanisms must be lightweight to meet the requirements of constrained devices
    used in IoT. Table 1. Literature review of recently proposed IoT-based precision
    irrigation systems. In [1], the authors reviewed the previous work conducted on
    smart agriculture and highlights different aspects of applying IoT solutions in
    smart agriculture. Moreover, the article reviews smart agriculture’s related security
    issues and compares security issues in the industry (urban) and agriculture (rural).
    In [16], the authors presented a classification of security threats in smart agriculture
    and precision agriculture environments. The authors classified security threats
    into six possible attacks: attacks on hardware (side channel attack and radio
    frequency (RF) jamming), attacks on the network equipment (denial of service (DoS),
    MITM (man in the middle), botnets, cloud computing attacks), attacks on data (data
    leakage, ransomware, cloud data leakage, false data injection, misconfiguration),
    attacks on applications (software update attacks, malware injection, buffer overflow,
    indirect attacks (SQL injection)), attacks on support chain (third-party attacks,
    data fabrication), and misuse attacks (cyber-terrorism, invalidation, and compliance).
    Another classification of security threats is underlined in [17]. The authors
    classified the security requirements in smart agriculture into six challenges,
    namely: integrity, availability, authentication, confidentiality, privacy, and
    Non-repudiation, and highlighted the possible attacks under each challenge. Moreover,
    a review of existing solutions to IoT security problems is emphasized. In [8],
    the authors added data freshness, authorization, and self-healing to the security
    requirements of smart agriculture. In [18], the authors reviewed IoT communication
    technologies security aspects for smart agriculture. In [19], the authors reviewed
    all categories of security attacks and the application of WSNs in IoT along with
    an evaluation of the countermeasures adopted against each type of attack. Moreover,
    smart irrigation systems developed based on IoT technology consist of constrained
    nodes in terms of power, memory, and processing resources. As a result, conventional
    security protocols can not be supported in such systems [20,21]. Transport layer
    security (TLS) adds overhead in terms of memory and energy on constrained nodes.
    As a result of the dependence on constrained nodes in IoT-based irrigation systems,
    a lightweight security protocol must be deployed. Lightweight cryptography techniques
    balance throughput against power drain, memory usage, and gate equivalent and
    have lower performance when compared to cryptography standards (such as AES and
    SHA-256) [22]. Characteristics of lightweight cryptography are highlighted in
    ISO/IEC 29192 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27. Lightweight properties are evaluated based
    on chip size and energy consumption and small code and/or RAM size in case of
    software implementation [21]. In [21], the authors discussed privacy in IoT in
    the context of developing solutions and frameworks that address profiling and
    tracking, localization, and tracking challenges and underlined state-of-the-art
    lightweight cryptographic framework for IoT. In [23], the authors proposed a set
    of lightweight security protocols for encryption, authentication, and key management
    for IoT. The authors compared their proposed protocols with IPsec in terms of
    security and computational efficiency. They succeeded in achieving a decreased
    level of resource consumption with an increased level of security. In [24], the
    authors implemented AES and PRESENT ciphers on a smartphone and provided a performance
    evaluation comparison between the two algorithms. AES is the symmetric block cipher
    defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the standard
    for bulk data encryption, whereas PRESENT is a symmetric ultra-lightweight block
    cipher that was standardized by ISO/IEC. On the other hand, the Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has been widely deployed as an application
    layer messaging and information exchange protocol in machine-to-machine (M2M)
    communication [25]. This is due to its ability to function with resource-constrained
    devices that utilize low bandwidth and unreliable links. MQTT is considered a
    lightweight, energy-efficient, and bandwidth-efficient communication protocol.
    MQTT utilizes the publish/subscribe architecture model to provide transition flexibility
    and simplicity of implementation. MQTT’s main components are the publishers (lightweight
    sensors), the subscribers (applications interested in sensor data), and the brokers
    (connect publishers and subscribers and classify sensor data into topics) as illustrated
    in Figure 1. The data generated by a publisher are dispatched to multiple subscribers
    through an MQTT broker. MQTT was proposed in 1999 by Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM
    and Arlen Nipper of Arcom and is currently an OASIS (Organization for the Advancement
    of Structured Information Standards) standard; it also has a standard defined
    in ISO/IEC 20922: 2016. Figure 1. MQTT architecture. Motivated by the increasing
    importance of smart irrigation systems in conserving water as a scarce natural
    resource, the role of precision agriculture in agriculture development, and the
    urgent need to apply information security techniques in the IoT part of the smart
    agriculture ecosystem, our aim in this research is to integrate a lightweight
    cryptography layer into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture and to investigate
    the deployment of a lightweight encryption protocol (the Expeditious Cipher) to
    create a secure channel between the sensing layer and the broker of MQTT protocol
    as well as between the broker and its subscribers in smart irrigation systems.
    This secure channel protects the sensors’ published sensitive data from eavesdropping
    and theft and preserves the integrity of data, in addition to protection of the
    decision that is made by the DA entity and returned to actuators. It should be
    noted that the security in IoT-based systems lies in IoT local systems consisting
    of devices constrained in energy and computing power. The following points summarize
    the main contributions of this article. The main contribution of this article
    is the integration of a lightweight cryptography layer to the IoT ecosystem for
    smart agriculture that meets the requirements of constrained devices used in smart
    agriculture in general and specifically, in our proposed IoT-based irrigation
    system. The article investigates the deployment of a lightweight encryption protocol
    (Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher)) to create a secure channel between the sensing
    layer and the broker in the MQTT protocol as well as a secure channel between
    the broker and its subscribers in smart irrigation systems (our case study). The
    proposed model is evaluated through simulation to validate the lightweight property
    of the chosen encryption protocol in terms of power consumption, execution time,
    and memory usage. Moreover, a performance comparison is carried out between the
    Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher), AES, and PRESENT cipher (lightweight standard protocol)
    in terms of power consumption, execution time, memory usage, and average throughput.
    The security requirements of IoT-based agriculture systems and the potential attacks
    against them are discussed. A state-of-the-art lightweight security architectures
    proposed for securing MQTT protocol is reviewed after highlighting the concept
    of lightweight cryptography. The remainder of the article is organized as follows:
    Section 2 presents our proposed secure smart irrigation system after briefly reviewing
    the state-of-the-art proposed lightweight security architectures for securing
    MQTT protocol. Section 3 highlights and discusses the performance evaluation results
    of our selected lightweight encryption algorithm versus AES, in addition to a
    performance comparison between X-cipher and the PRESENT cipher. Section 4 summarizes
    the findings of the article and highlights our suggestions for future work. 2.
    Materials and Methods In this section, the proposed secure IoT-based irrigation
    system architecture is outlined. First, a brief review of the proposed lightweight
    security techniques for securing the MQTT protocol is given. Then, the proposed
    model architecture and hardware components are explained in detail. In addition,
    the applicability of the selected lightweight protocol (X-Cipher) on NodeMCU is
    verified. 2.1. MQTT Security Challenges and Solutions MQTT runs over TCP with
    few security techniques such as simple authorization policies and basic authentication
    techniques. TLS/SSL with session key management has been suggested for securing
    MQTT; however, proposed security techniques for MQTT should be lightweight for
    deployment in IoT environments. TLS/SSL has been proven to have performance issues
    in terms of processing time, memory required, and energy consumption, in addition
    to the various possible attacks such as Heartbleed, CRIME, BEAST, and RC4. Furthermore,
    TLS does not provide fine-grained access control [26]. Moreover, MQTT suffers
    from several security shortcomings, mainly from a lack of confidentiality, integrity,
    availability (DOS attack), mutual authentication, access control, control message
    security, and end-to-end security. In [27], the authors reviewed the symmetric,
    asymmetric, and hybrid lightweight schemes proposed in the literature for guaranteeing
    the confidentiality of transmitted data using MQTT. Moreover, the authors’ review
    suggested security techniques for guaranteeing access control in MQTT. According
    to [28], the security threats against MQTT are mainly replay attacks and man-in-the-middle
    attacks (MITM). Value-to-keyed-hash message authentication code (Value-to-HMAC)
    has been deployed to achieve information confidentiality. In [26], the authors
    designed a security architecture for MQTT-SN to achieve end-to-end security in
    addition to fine-grained access control. Moreover, they introduced a certificate
    subject to create a secure direct channel between a publisher and a set of subscribers.
    In addition, they designed security schemes to integrate mutual authentication
    and control message security functions into the standard MQTT-SN control messages,
    without relying on the TLS. In [20], the authors proposed ChaCha20-Poly1305 Authenticated
    Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) as a solution to secure resource-constrained
    node communication over MQTT/MQTT-SN. RFC 6574 [29] describes constrained nodes
    as they are bandwidth constrained, energy constrained, and memory constrained.
    Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme revealed a low memory requirement
    and low processing time. In [30], the authors presented a lightweight authentication
    and encryption mechanism based on ECDHE-PSK (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Ephemeral)-(Pre-Shared
    Key) for IoT-constrained devices. The proposed security mechanism outperforms
    the ECDHE-ECDSA in all performance evaluation tests. 2.2. Proposed IoT System
    Architecture The main objective of our proposed system is the addition of a lightweight
    cryptography layer to the agriculture IoT ecosystem, as shown in Figure 2. The
    function of this layer is to create a secure communication channel between the
    sensing/actuator layer (IoT nodes) and the subscriber layer, thus protecting sensors’
    published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from unauthorized changes
    to sensitive data that can negatively impact crop development. In addition, the
    secure channel protects the irrigation decision made by the data analytics (DA)
    entity regarding the irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned
    to actuators from any alteration while meeting the requirements of IoT-constrained
    devices in terms of memory usage and power consumption by ensuring the application
    of lightweight cryptography techniques. Figure 2. Traditional Agri-IoT ecosystem
    versus proposed Agri-IoT ecosystem. Figure 3 depicts the architecture of our proposed
    secure IoT-based smart irrigation system. Figure 3a illustrates the general system
    architecture and Figure 3b shows the hardware components of the proposed system.
    The proposed architecture consists of five layers: the sensing/actuator layer,
    the lightweight cryptography layer, the communication layer, the network layer,
    and the application layer. Figure 3. The proposed model. (a) proposed model architecture.
    (b) proposed model hardware. 2.2.1. The Sensing Layer The sensing layer is made
    up of multiple low-power sensors that are spread on agricultural land to continuously
    collect soil temperature and humidity. The DHT11 sensors are used to measure the
    temperature value in degrees Celsius and the humidity value in percentage. The
    DHT-11 sensor has three pins: two of which are for power and one is for output
    data transmission. The three pins are used to connect the DHT11 sensor to the
    NodeMCU ESP8266 board. The DHT-11 library must be added to the Arduino IDE software
    before uploading to the NodeMCU ESP8266 board the code written to read the humidity
    and temperature value from the DHT11 sensor. Together, the DHT-11 sensor and the
    NodeMCU form the IoT node. The NodeMCU runs the MQTT client code and publishes
    the sensed soil parameters (the temperature and humidity readings) to the MQTT
    broker after encrypting the message using the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher). The
    MQTT broker runs on Raspberry Pi, which is a low-power single-board computer.
    NodeMCU ESP8266 has a built-in WiFi module that is used as the communication protocol
    between NodeMCU and the Raspberry Pi. The MQTT protocol is chosen due to its short
    message transmission capability and low-bandwidth requirement, which makes it
    more convenient for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Moreover, the Raspberry
    Pi was selected as a processing layer because of its low cost and common use in
    IoT applications. Mosquitto is an open-source lightweight MQTT broker and is selected
    as it is suitable for Raspberry Pi. The Mosquitto broker decrypts the message
    and adds the information in the message to the related topic. Then, information
    is encrypted again before being published (broadcast) to all subscribers. The
    ThingSpeak cloud platform is used among subscribers that execute cloud analysis
    for making irrigation decisions regarding the time of irrigation and the quantity
    of water. Then the irrigation decision is published to the broker to be decrypted
    and then encrypted again before being published to the actuator. The nodeMCU at
    the actuator layer decrypts the message and then passes the control signal to
    the attached pump to activate the irrigation. 2.2.2. Lightweight Cryptography
    Layer In this layer, a lightweight protocol must be deployed, because the proposed
    IoT-based irrigation system is made up of constrained devices in terms of memory
    and energy. Characteristics of lightweight cryptography were highlighted in ISO/IEC
    29192 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27. Lightweight properties are evaluated based on chip
    size and energy consumption, and small code and/or RAM size in case of software
    implementation [21]. So, the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) was selected [31].
    The X-cipher was proposed in 2011 and is considered a lightweight high-throughput
    encryption protocol. The cipher sub-keys are generated using the well-studied
    SHA-512 and Whirlpool 512 hash functions. The two hash functions are cascaded
    in a pseudo-random manner that depends on the user key to enhance the cipher security.
    The cipher utilizes a variable-size user key. The encryption rate can attain 512
    bits per cycle in the case of hardware implementation with parallelization encryption
    paths. Eight rounds are recommended for the proper operation of the Expeditious
    Cipher (X-cipher). The circuitry of the encryptor and decryptor are identical,
    as such, a high code density and small implementation area are achieved, as required
    by lightweight cryptography. An additional important feature of the X-cipher is
    the separation of key scheduling process from the encryption process, which allows
    the change of cipher design, key, and block size by simply changing the hash function.
    The Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) complete encryption algorithm is presented in
    [31]. NodeMCU has a cryptography module called crypto that contains various functions
    for working with cryptographic algorithms. The AES 128-bit is supported in ECB
    and CBC modes, in addition to several hash functions, namely, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256,
    SHA-384, and SHA-512. The MQTT module implemented in C language is available on
    the NodeMCU ESP8266 board to run the MQTT client to publish the temperature and
    humidity readings to the MQTT broker running on Raspberry Pi. So, because the
    proposed Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) depends on the SHA-512 hash function that
    is already implemented in the crypto module and the modulo 2 addition between
    the hashed key and the plain text, the selected lightweight algorithm can be compiled
    easily on the NodeMCU board. Table 2 compares the operational features of AES
    (traditional encryption protocol), PRESENT (lightweight standard protocol), X-cipher
    (selected lightweight protocol), and the lightweight encryption protocol proposed
    recently in the literature. Table 2. Comparison between X-cipher, AES, PRESENT,
    and lightweight encryption. 2.2.3. Communication Layer The communication between
    NodeMCU ESP8266 and the Raspberry Pi is achieved using WiFi, as the NodeMCU has
    a built-in WiFi module. On the other hand, the communication between the Raspberry
    Pi and the internet can be carried out using LoRaWAN technology taking into consideration
    the low data rate characteristic of LPWA technologies discussed in Section 1 or
    through the GSM module. 3. Results In this section, we validate through simulation
    that the chosen lightweight cipher satisfies the requirements of constrained devices
    in IoT-based smart irrigation systems in terms of power consumption and memory
    usage. Moreover, we compare the chosen lightweight cipher with PRESENT, a standard
    lightweight protocol, and AES, a standard encryption protocol. 3.1. Simulation
    Scenario Table 3 presents the simulation packages used in the performance evaluation
    of the X-cipher. A Windows 10 virtual machine runs the Raspberry Pi emulator that
    was selected. An Ubuntu 20.1 virtual machine is used for the subscriber. The DHT-11
    sensors are connected directly to the Raspberry Pi Emulator. Figure 4 illustrates
    selected parts of the Python code used to obtain humidity and temperature reading
    from DHTT-11 sensors. The Adafruit_DHT Python library is available for reading
    the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a Raspberry Pi. First, the
    sensor type and the pin that the DHT-11 is connected through to Raspberry Pi must
    be specified. Then, the function Adafruit_DHT.read_retry is used to read from
    the specified pin. As can be noticed, the humidity and temperature readings are
    encrypted using the lightweight class function encrypt, which is our class implementation
    for the X-cipher protocol. Moreover, Figure 5 depicts a selected part of the MQTT
    client code for the Raspberry Pi emulator. The paho.mqtt.client Python library
    is deployed to provide a client class with support for MQTT protocol, and it also
    provides some helper functions that facilitate publishing messages to an MQTT
    server. Figure 6 highlights selected parts of the python code used to calculate
    memory usage. Calculations of memory usage rely on the process.memory_info and
    choosing the “rss” option returns the actual physical memory the process is using.
    Figure 7 illustrated selected parts of the Python code used to calculate power
    consumption. The pyRAPL Python library is utilized to measure the energy footprint
    of a host machine along with the execution of a piece of Python code. Three performance
    metrics were used to evaluate and compare the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) and
    the AES cipher [32]: power consumption, execution time, and memory usage for a
    file of 10,000 message comma separated of total size 20 MB. Figure 4. The Raspberry
    Pi emulator code for obtaining humidity and temperature readings from sensors.
    Figure 5. MQTT client code for the Raspberry Pi emulator. Figure 6. Memory usage
    calculation function. Figure 7. Power consumption calculation function. Table
    3. Software versions deployed in performance evaluation. Figure 8 compares the
    two algorithms’ power consumption during the encryption and decryption process.
    As shown in the graph, X-cipher requires less power consumption than AES throughout
    the whole encryption and decryption process. This makes X-cipher more convenient
    for IoT devices with limited energy resources. This is due to the dependency of
    X-cipher on just the XOR function between the generated hashed sub-key and the
    plain text, whereas AES depends on substitution–permutation operations. Moreover,
    the number of rounds in X-cipher is just eight, whereas the number of rounds is
    ten in the case of AES. Figure 8. Power Consumption during encryption and decryption
    processes for AES and X-cipher. Figure 9 compares the memory usage during the
    encryption and decryption process for the two algorithms. As shown in the graph,
    X-cipher requires less memory than AES throughout the whole encryption and decryption
    process. X-cipher has average memory usages of 20.04 MB and 22.38 MB during the
    encryption and decryption processes, respectively, in contrast to AES, which has
    average memory usages of 24.56 MB and 36.2 MB during the encryption and decryption
    processes, respectively. The higher memory usage in the case of AES is due to
    the substitution–permutation principle employed in AES. This implies that X-cipher
    is more suitable for IoT devices with constrained memory capacity. Figure 9. Average
    Memory usage for AES and X-cipher. Figure 9 presents the average memory usage
    for both algorithms for the encryption and decryption of 20 MB messages. Figure
    10 illustrates the average execution time for AES and X-cipher. As shown in both
    figures, the selected lightweight algorithm (X-cipher) outperforms AES in terms
    of average memory usage and average execution time. Figure 10. Average Execution
    time for AES and X-cipher. 3.2. Comparison with Related Work In this section,
    we compare the performance of the X-cipher versus the PRESENT ultra-lightweight
    cipher [33] presented in the literature for the same size of data of 20 MB. Our
    selected algorithm X-cipher outperforms the PRESENT algorithm in terms of throughput
    and memory usage as shown in Table 4 and Table 5. This is because PRESENT deploys
    the substitution permutation network principle although it has a reduced substitution
    box and due to the higher number of rounds, which is 31 rounds. Table 4. Throughput
    results comparison between X-cipher and PRESENT. Table 5. Memory usage results
    in comparison between X-cipher and PRESENT. 4. Conclusions Smart irrigation systems
    integrate IoT technology with smart agriculture to conserve water consumption
    during the irrigation of agricultural land. This research focuses on the evaluation
    of the adoption of a lightweight security protocol to secure communication in
    smart irrigation systems. The adopted encryption algorithm (Expeditious Cipher)
    creates a secure channel between publishers and the broker of the MQTT protocol
    as well as between the broker and its subscribers. MQTT was chosen as the IoT
    application protocol for messaging in our proposed irrigation system, as it is
    a bandwidth- and energy-efficient protocol. The evaluated lightweight protocol
    reduces resource consumption in terms of memory usage and power consumption as
    well as minimizes the execution time, which makes it suitable for IoT-based resource-constrained
    systems. There is a trade-off between the security level and the memory and energy-processing
    resources required. AES achieves a higher security level at the cost of more memory
    usage and energy consumption, which causes performance degradation in constrained
    devices, opposite to lightweight cipher, which achieves an adequate level of security
    with low memory usage and reduced energy consumption. Comparing our selected X-cipher
    protocol with the PRESENT cipher reveals a lower memory usage and higher throughput
    in favor of the X-cipher. In the future, we will investigate the integration of
    our proposed system with software-defined networking (SDN) technology to implement
    the security models at the controller to offload publishers and brokers from the
    additional processing required by security algorithms. Moreover, we will develop
    a deep-learning model to predict the irrigation time and the required amount of
    water required for irrigation. Author Contributions Conceptualization, C.F. and

  description: Incorporating soil-improving microorganisms and biostimulants in the
    plant is a novel practice with multiple benefits; while it increases the availability
    of nutrients for the crop and favors carbon sequestration, it positively affects
    the forage quality. The present study is part of the precision agriculture program,
    a project carried out at the Experimental Agricultural Field of the Tecnológico
    de Monterrey (Querétaro, Mexico) as part of the educational innovation initiative.
    Complementary to the Tec21 educational model, the use of agile methodologies (SCRUM
    Methodology) was implemented to solve a challenge or case study in the area of
    agri-food biosystems. The implementation of this tool allowed to evaluate the
    morphology and composition of a crop of forage oats (Avena sativa) using digital
    systems and traditional analytical methods; The effects of the application of
    mycorrhizal fungi (Glomus intraradices) and commercial biostimulation (BIOZYME®
    TF, UPL) were evaluated and the results were contrasted with conventional management,
    based exclusively on the use of mineral fertilizers. The information generated
    contributes to the development of new academic methodologies that support the
    transition towards sustainability and innovation in agriculture.

  description: This paper seeks to advance understanding of the barriers that constrain
    and the drivers that promote the adoption of automation and robotics in agriculture.
    The paper focuses on Ontario, Canada, as the case study. The choice of the province
    is informed by the fact that it is generally considered one of Canada's leading
    agriculture powerhouses. The paper employed a mixed-methods approach consisting
    of survey questionnaires and in-depth focus group discussions. The article sheds
    light on the complex and context-specific factors determining farmers’ adoption
    of automation and robotics technology. Principally, adopters and non-adopters
    of automation robotics technology agree that government has a critical role in
    accelerating the adoption of automation and robotics technology. More importantly,
    the paper spells out the various facets of that role and the contexts within which
    they can be most effective and impactful. The discussion explores the significance
    of the results in relation to the relevant extant literature and highlights the
    key implications of our findings for future policy and practice. It also offers
    some solutions in the form of policy recommendations and suggested action steps
    for removing barriers and exploiting opportunities associated with adopting technology.
    While empirically focusing on Ontario, the findings and analysis have implications

    understanding of the barriers that constrain and the drivers that promote the
    adoption of automation and robotics in agriculture. The paper focuses on Ontario,
    Canada, as the case study. The choice of the province is informed by the fact
    that it is generally considered one of Canada''s leading agriculture powerhouses.
    The paper employed a mixed-methods approach consisting of survey questionnaires
    and in-depth focus group discussions. The article sheds light on the complex and
    context-specific factors determining farmers’ adoption of automation and robotics
    technology. Principally, adopters and non-adopters of automation robotics technology
    agree that government has a critical role in accelerating the adoption of automation
    and robotics technology. More importantly, the paper spells out the various facets
    of that role and the contexts within which they can be most effective and impactful.
    The discussion explores the significance of the results in relation to the relevant
    extant literature and highlights the key implications of our findings for future
    policy and practice. It also offers some solutions in the form of policy recommendations
    and suggested action steps for removing barriers and exploiting opportunities
    associated with adopting technology. While empirically focusing on Ontario, the
    findings and analysis have implications for all of Canada and other industrialized
    countries. Introduction Over the past three decades, breakneck technological changes
    have led to seismic industrial restructuring in the agriculture and agri-food
    sector, with exponential advances in automation, robotics and mass digitization
    of cultivation, production and delivery processes that are fundamentally reshaping
    the sector (Niagara Community Observatory, 2019; OECD, 2019; Wolfert et al., 2021).
    These trends point to the imperatives of ‘smart’ precision agriculture techniques,
    processes embedded in cyber-physical systems, or platforms that are radically
    transforming the agri-food value chain from primary agriculture to processing,
    packaging, distribution and consumption (Archontakis and Anastasiadis, 2019; Cambouris
    et al., 2014; Campus, 2021; Capmourteres et al., 2018; Geldes et al., 2017). Against
    these trends, agriculture worldwide stands at a critical crossroads (Canadian
    Census of Agriculture, 2021; Mitchell et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2018). These
    global trends present opportunities, risks and challenges. They represent a fluid
    and dynamic global market context where first-movers in the technological race
    are poised to gain tremendous advantages. Technology development and adoption
    capacities fundamentally determine a region or country''s place on the global
    economic map (Breznitz, 2021; Niosi, 2005). In Canada, for instance, innovative
    technology has become an indispensable component of the agriculture sector''s
    capacity to increase its competitiveness and productivity, including addressing
    the growing challenges of critical labour shortages (Geldes et al., 2017). According
    to the Canadian Agri-food Economic Strategy Table (2018), technology adoption
    is one of the most pervasive challenges limiting the global competitiveness and
    productivity of Canada''s agri-food businesses. Canadian agri-food sector expenditures
    on research and development (R&D) as a percentage of sales have dropped by 24%
    since 2008 and lag other OECD competitors (de Avillez, 2011; Agriculture and Agri-Food
    Canada, 2011; Canada''s Agri-Food Economic Strategy Table, 2018). The Canadian
    Agri-food Economic Strategy Table (2018) further notes that while a number of
    Canada''s agri-food businesses are attempting to adopt new technologies, the sector''s
    investment in machinery and equipment has been on a steady long-term decline.
    This is due not to a lack of interest but several systemic challenges. The results
    are that despite increased public investments over the past two decades in technology
    R&D, along with a mushrooming of public, private and post-secondary agri-food
    laboratories, automation and robotics technology adoption in the Canadian agriculture
    sector has not kept pace with these developments (Agricultural Institute of Canada,
    2018; Canada''s Agri-Food Economic Strategy Table, 2018). This trend is particularly
    concerning given the breakneck pace of technological advances in robotics, automation
    and digitization in the agri-food sector and the attendant increase in global
    competition not only among industrialized countries but also from emerging economies
    (Borbasova et al., 2015; Cillo et al., 2019; Materia et al., 2017). In light of
    the above trends and issues, the objectives of this paper are two-fold: first,
    to advance understanding of the barriers that constrain and the drivers that promote
    the adoption of automation and robotics in pursuit of globally competitive production
    systems in agriculture. Second, the paper offers some solutions in the form of
    policy recommendations and suggested action steps for removing barriers and exploiting
    opportunities to accelerate automation and robotics technology transfer and adoption
    in the agriculture sector. However, term ‘adoption’ is a relevant but complex
    concept that needs to be considered in specific contexts (Allan et al., 2022).
    Therefore, to provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying factors shaping the
    adoption of automation and robotics technology in agriculture, the discussion
    focuses on the province of Ontario, Canada, as a case study. The reason for empirically
    focusing on Ontario is that it makes up the largest national share of farms and
    farm operators among Canada''s ten provinces.1 For instance, Ontario is the leader
    among all Canadian provinces in farming commodities such as soybeans, corn for
    grain and greenhouse products. Results from the 2021 Census of Agriculture show
    that Ontario accounted for over one-quarter – 25.5% – of total farms in Canada,
    while making up 7.7% of total farm area. Compared with other provinces, Ontario
    has the largest proportion of Canada''s farms in a range of areas, including greenhouse,
    nursery, and floriculture production, accounting for 31.8% of the country''s total.
    In light of these figures, Ontario is demonstrably one of Canada''s leading agriculture
    powerhouses, and therefore provides fitting case study. However, while the focus
    is on Ontario, the findings from the study have implications for all of Canada,
    and more importantly, other industrialized countries worldwide. The rest of the
    paper is structured as follows: The next section provides a literature review
    and analytical framework related to the role of automation and robotics in competitive
    production systems in agriculture. It also examines the extant literature on the
    barriers that constrain and the drivers that promote the adoption of such technologies.
    In doing so, the discussion examines core concepts such as agriculture innovation
    systems (AIS), the role of strategic leadership, and the function of intermediaries
    within such systems. The third section lays out the research methods employed
    in the 2-year study that resulted in this paper. This is followed by a fourth
    section concisely outlining the results. The fifth section then discusses the
    significance of the results in the context of the extant literature and highlights
    their practical implications. The final concluding section recaps the paper, linking
    the research objectives with key results and their significance. Analytical framework
    As noted in the introduction, innovative technology has become indispensable to
    the agriculture sector''s capacity to increase its competitiveness and productivity.
    However, there are systemic challenges and barriers associated with the adoption
    of new technologies in Canada and worldwide. These challenges take several form
    (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 2011; Garbade et al., 2012), which principally
    include the following: first, a general lack of information about available technologies;
    second, a lack of understanding among farmers about how to integrate technology
    with existing systems and operations; third, fragmented regional innovation systems
    in which research centres and technology providers within the same geographic
    space often work in isolation rather than in close partnership; and fourth (resulting
    from the third), weak support systems for integrating technology across a region''s
    agri-food supply chain. The prosperity of agriculture and agri-food industries
    in the knowledge economy often rests on the economic vitality of a mosaic of regional
    agglomerations of agriculture and agri-food clusters concentrated within geographic
    nodes. In Ontario and Canada, for example, such agglomerations are spread across
    the country. However, a regional agglomeration of activities among a cluster of
    farms based on available natural resources, labour pool or market size is not
    necessarily an innovation system (Niosi, 2005). For a regional innovation system
    to exist in agriculture, the geographic agglomeration of farms and other supporting
    institutions must demonstrate commitment to the creation and use of new and improved
    technology. This means that while farmers will leverage the natural endowments
    of favourable soil and climate conditions, they must manifest a sustained demand
    for new and improved technology and greater use of skilled labour in pursuit of
    global competitiveness and efficiencies to maintain or increase their international
    market share. This paper thus defines a competitive and dynamic agriculture innovation
    system as a geographically embedded cluster of interacting farms and other agri-food
    businesses along with post-secondary and private research centres and laboratories,
    aiming at the production and use of science and technology to accelerate the global
    competitiveness and productivity the sector (Bradford and Bramwell, 2018; Niosi
    et al., 2000; Niosi, 2005; Wolfe and Gertler, 2016;). An ‘innovation system’ in
    this regard, is an assemblage of heterogenous parts (researchers, technology developers,
    intermediaries, farmers and other end-users) within working towards a set of common
    goals (Bramwell et al., 2019; Conteh, 2020; Conteh and Harding, 2021; Kivimaa
    et al., 2018; Klerkx and Begemann, 2020; Wolfe and Gertler, 2016). Moreover, a
    functional and integrated AIS involves strategic leadership and close interconnections
    between the state, market and non-profit actors in the pursuit of greater technological
    development, adoption and economic competitiveness. This is because, contrary
    to the myth of liberal orthodoxy, innovation systems seldom create themselves
    organically (de Boon et al., 2021). Like all market entities, AIS are subject
    to perverse tendencies like rivalry, rent-seeking, intellectual property violations,
    abuse of personal data and information asymmetry, and other opportunistic behaviours
    (Conti et al., 2021; Turner et al., 2020). Innovation systems are so-called because
    they consist of tangled webs of actors in conflictual and cooperative joint action
    (Garbade et al., 2012). An effective and functional innovation system is thus
    about strategic and visionary leadership in creating the institutional support
    systems serving as a governance architecture. Innovation systems point to a set
    of policy, regulatory, financial and other institutions jointly set up by governments,
    industry and non-profit stakeholders. These institutions consist of an amalgam
    of laws (such as intellectual property rights and data management and privacy
    standards), resources (such as funding or research and development) and organizations
    (such as extension services, post-secondary institutions, research centres and
    industries) that support and sustain the pursuit of a shared set of innovation
    goals. Furthermore, the mere development of technology does not necessarily make
    an innovative region globally competitive. Developed technologies must be transferred
    into the hands of farmers and other agri-food businesses. Similarly, such businesses
    must manifest a high propensity for adopting new and improved technologies into
    their operations. The rate of robotics and automation technology adoption within
    an agri-food cluster is thus a function of push and pull factors. The push factors
    are those elements that determine the development and transfer of technology by
    a constellation of laboratories, post-secondary institutions and research centres
    within an agri-food innovation ecosystem. However, equally significant for an
    agri-food innovation system to manifest global competitiveness are the ‘pull’
    factors of automation and robotics technology adoption. These factors refer to
    the conditions that incentivize (or disincentivize) farmers to adopt new technologies
    to improve the efficiency and productivity of their operations. The ‘push’ and
    ‘pull’ factors of automation and robotics technology adoption in the agri-food
    sector points to the fact that a dynamic and globally competitive innovation system
    it is not merely a function of the amounts of money spent on R&D but also understanding
    the barriers/drivers to innovative automation and robotics technology adoption
    by businesses in the agri-food sector. In this regard, some scholars have pointed
    to the need to embrace an end-user development model of technology adoption –
    co-creation – in agriculture to strengthen connections between researchers, technology
    developers and farmers (Glover et al., 2021; Leeuwis and Aarts, 2021). Implicit
    in this model is the fact that the rate of automation and robotics technology
    adoption is often partly a function of upstream push factors related to the development
    and transfer of technology by a constellation of laboratories, post-secondary
    institutions and research centres within an AIS. There are several reasons for
    adopting an end-user development model (Knickel et al., 2021; Ronner et al., 2021;
    Toffolini et al., 2021). First, it would deepen the appreciation among technology
    developers for the risk calculus of farmers and why they may tend to be ‘risk-averse’,
    as some technology developers tend to complain. Underlying this model is the need
    to bridge the differences between technology developers and farmers. Second, adopting
    an end-user development model would mean including farmers at all stages. However,
    for agriculture and agri-food innovation systems to be fully functional, and the
    end-user model to be operational, there is a need for intermediaries – or organizational
    actors – at the centre of AIS. Intermediaries have been described by other names
    such as ‘middle actors’, ‘hybrid actors’, ‘boundary spanners’, ‘user assemblages’
    and ‘interaction arenas’ (Kivimaa et al., 2018). Regardless of the name, they
    are the organizational brokers shepherding the development, promotion and adoption
    of new and improved technologies in innovation systems (Bramwell et al., 2019;
    Fait et al., 2019; Klerkx et al., 2009). They are the bridge or lynchpins (such
    as advisory and extension services) that connect actors nested within an innovation
    system (Breznitz, 2021; Kivimaa et al., 2018; Ramirez et al., 2017). In short,
    they are intercessors or mediators bringing together the distinct worlds and cultures
    of government, the automation and robotics technology industry and the agriculture
    sector to collaborate under one canopy (Ramirez et al., 2017). At the heart of
    every functional and effective agri-food innovation system are purpose-driven
    intermediaries. In light of the above review of the extant literature, the rest
    of the paper explores through a set of survey and focus group questions (elaborated
    in the methods section below) how concepts like ‘push-pull’ factors of technology
    adoption, agriculture innovation systems, the end-user development model and the
    role of intermediaries might shed light on our understanding of the barriers that
    constrain and the drivers that promote the adoption of automation and robotics
    in Ontario. Similarly, we hope to generate some solutions for removing such barriers
    and exploiting opportunities to accelerate automation and robotics technology
    transfer and adoption in the province''s agriculture sector. Methods In pursuit
    of two objectives outlined in the introduction above, the authors of this paper
    employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze quantitative and qualitative
    data over a period of 26 months. The data consist of survey questionnaires and
    in-depth focus group discussions. These activities were organized into phases
    and sequenced to feed into each other, as outlined below. Survey In this phase
    of the project, the research team administered a province-wide survey of Ontario''s
    agriculture sector, canvassing farms across Ontario on their adoption of innovative
    automation and robotics technology. The survey was meant to identify several key
    issues, namely: (1) reasons for and for not adopting automation and robotics technology;
    (2) the main barriers/drivers to adoption; (3) how the barriers to adoption were
    overcome and (4) what steps could be taken to accelerate innovative automation
    and robotics technology transfer and adoption in the agriculture sector. All respondents
    were also asked a series of Likert-scale questions related to their perceptions
    of the agriculture innovation system in their region. The online survey was distributed
    in four ‘waves’ from November 2020 to February 2021. In the first wave, the researchers
    emailed a unique survey link to individuals or organizations in their proprietary
    databases considered to be active in the agri-food sector. For the second and
    third waves a unique link to the survey was sent to 2743 email addresses extracted
    from websites of farms and agribusinesses based in Ontario. For the fourth wave,
    a unique link to the survey, along with a short write-up of the project was included
    in two consecutive issues of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture weekly newsletter
    (5 and 12 February 2021). Several criteria were used to extract the final dataset
    from the total responses. The final, curated dataset included (1) respondents
    who identified as owning, operating or working for a farm and (2) respondents
    who identified as producing crops and/or raising livestock. These two criteria
    were used in combination to ensure that those who identified as being associated
    with a farm, provided confirming information about the type of farm. Of the total
    of 295 survey respondents, 174 met these criteria and have been included in the
    final data set. Focus group discussion The findings of the survey above served
    as the basis for generating a set of questions that guided a series of discussions
    with multi-stakeholder focus groups held in May and June 2022. The groups met
    either in person or online via Microsoft Teams. Overall, 42 individuals registered
    to participate and were spread across five focus groups. Each focus group had
    a combination of farmers, researchers, technology developers, manufacturers, intermediaries
    and government officials. The research team posed a number of questions but employed
    an open-ended conversational flow that enabled the focus groups to come up with
    solutions drawn from their expertise and experience as well as the evidence generated
    in our earlier findings. Some of the questions we addressed with the focus groups
    were: 1. How could government better help farmers adopt and implement automation
    and robotics technology in Ontario? 2. Since technology research, development
    and adoption processes are complex and often take time, if done correctly, how
    could government programmes be altered to factor in the element of time? 3. How
    could researchers and technology developers be better at encouraging farms to
    adopt automation and robotics technology? 4. In what ways could we improve farmers’
    awareness of the research and technology development resources and opportunities
    available? 5. How could intermediaries (such as advisory and extension services
    that act as a bridge between technology developers and adopters) be better mobilized
    and positioned to promote and support greater transfer and adoption of automation
    and robotics technology? All focus group discussions were recorded and transcribed.
    The research team also took observatory notes (memos) during the focus group discussions,
    and those memos were incorporated into the data. We employed a mix of deductive
    and inductive coding methods to analyze the data. For the recorded and transcribed
    data, we used the deductive method whereby the questions (noted above) we posed
    to focus group participants served as the coding frame that guided the analysis
    of the data. For this deductive coding process, the research team first read through
    the data to get a sense of what it looks like. We then assigned codes, going through
    the data line-by-line to code as much as possible, resulting in the identification
    of themes that came up the most. Because the deductive approach is vulnerable
    to overlooking themes outside the coding frame, we also employed an inductive
    coding method that enabled us to examine the memos (observatory notes) that the
    research team took during the focus group discussions. These memos provided materials
    for an open coding, whereby we identified themes that emerged during the discussions
    but were not anticipated by our research questions. The inductive coding of our
    memos thus enabled the team to have a more complete and unbiased coverage of the
    themes that emerged from the focus group discussions. For both the deductive and
    inductive coding processes, the data was analyzed through two stages of coding,
    deploying inter-rater reliability to ensure consistency among the research team''s
    identification and assignment of themes in the data. In the first round of data
    analysis, the principal investigator and their research assistants engaged in
    separate coding of the data. In the second round of data analysis, the research
    team came together to compare their coding results. Where there were disagreements,
    the team engaged in in-depth discussion to reach a common agreement, thereby ensuring
    inter-rater reliability in their observations and analyses of the focus group
    data. We then integrated and distilled the themes across all the focus groups
    into the final results. In the section below, following the discussion of the
    survey results, we present our analysis of the focus group data. Results In this
    section, we provide a concise synthesis of the results from the survey and focus
    group data phases of the research. In the discussion section below, we will explore
    the significance of the results in the context of relevant extant literature and
    highlight the key policy implications of our findings for the agriculture sector.
    Survey results For the survey phase of the study, based on 171 responses, the
    top three reasons farmers give for adopting automation and robotics were productivity,
    efficiency and costs. Two-thirds of adopters (67%) identified increasing productivity
    as one of their three top reasons for implementing automation and robotics technology.
    More than half (57%) of survey respondents cited increasing production efficiency,
    and 56% said automation and robotics technologies reduced costs. The top reasons
    given by non-adopters for not implementing technology over the past 10 years were
    high costs of acquisition (47%), lack of relevant technology (35%) and insufficient
    return on investment (34%). Those who did adopt technology were asked about the
    barriers they had experienced during the implementation process. The top three
    barriers cited were insufficient return on investment (45%), lack of government
    support and funding (36%) and a lack of in-house expertise (34%). When asked what
    the role of government should be in supporting the uptake of automation and robotics
    technology, adopters and non-adopters gave the same three responses: to provide
    financial assistance, provide research grants for in-house development, and promote
    established and proven technologies. While providing financial assistance was
    the most frequently identified role for government by both adopters and non-adopters,
    it was the clear choice of adopters (80%) compared to non-adopters (68%). The
    provision of research grants for developing in-house technology was a role cited
    by 54% of adopters and 60% of non-adopters, indicating that with the right incentives,
    current non-adopters might be more willing to develop technology in-house. Promoting
    established and proven technologies was cited by 33% of adopters and 35% of non-adopters
    as a key role of government while promoting new technologies was cited by 28%
    of adopters and 35% of non-adopters. When these numbers are combined, the promotion
    of technology is the second-most frequently cited role for government by adopters
    (61%) and non-adopters (70%). Additionally, the survey shed light on contextual
    factors shaping the adoption of new technologies, such as farmer interactions
    with agri-food laboratories and research centres, their perception of changing
    trends in automation and robotics, and how these might affect their businesses.
    The survey thus provided a quantitative portrait of the current barriers and opportunities
    of automation and robotics technology adoption in Ontario''s agriculture sector.
    Focus group data results Several themes emerged from the analysis of the focus
    group discussion data, but for this paper, we focus on findings related to the
    role of government. The aim is to shed light on policy initiatives and programme
    reforms that governments worldwide could undertake in concert with their industry
    and non-profit partners in the agriculture sector to address the issues and challenges
    of automation and robotics technology adoption that we uncovered in the study.
    In this vein, the findings are presented in this section in the form of policy
    recommendations. It is best to view the recommendations as inter-related within
    a holistic lens for envisaging measures that government, the agriculture industry,
    and non-profit stakeholders should consider in their efforts to accelerate the
    adoption of automation and robotics technology (Table 1). Table 1. Summary of
    focus group discussion findings. Public policy and programme reforms Embrace a
    broader conception of technological innovation Redesign cost-share and other incentive
    programmes to fully reflect a broader construct of innovation and a wider range
    of risk mitigation in agriculture Diversify the structure of cost-share programmes
    Design cost-share programmes to accommodate and acknowledge early adopters Factor
    in the element of time in cost-share programmes Embrace a greater risk orientation
    Diversify financial resources of cost-share funding Improve the dissemination
    of information about cost-share programmes Explore ways to reduce the administrative
    burden Support and facilitate the development of standards for data interoperability
    and address security and privacy issues Build the requisite digital and physical
    infrastructure in rural areas to support greater use of automation and robotics
    technology Expand the capacity of experimental research stations and demonstration
    farms Harness emergent labour trends to cultivate the requisite skill sets needed
    for developing and using more relevant automation and robotics technology Promote
    societal acceptance of agri-food innovations Coordinate policies and programmes
    across levels of government Embrace a broader conception of innovation One of
    the key findings from the focus group discussion is that government should seek
    to redefine common notions and usages of the term ‘innovation’ away from the tendency
    to narrowly focus on new or novel technology (Breznitz, 2021). In particular,
    such a broader and more nuanced understanding of innovation implies exploring
    myriad forms of innovation. It also makes room for a broader range of farm operations
    and business models as viable candidates for technology adoption. In fact, embracing
    a broader and nuanced conception of innovation is foundational to all the other
    findings that follow below. Redesign cost-share and other incentive programmes
    to fully reflect a broader construct of innovation and a wider range of risk mitigation
    in agriculture The need for financial incentives to de-risk development, commercialization
    and adoption was one of the recurring themes in the focus group data. For instance,
    cost-share programmes are seen by focus group participants a vital way to minimize
    the financial risk for technology developers and farmers alike. Such programmes
    would cover the costs and financial risks of testing or validating a new technology
    on the farm as a critical part of the commercialization process. The focus group
    data points to seven action steps on how government should fundamentally rethink
    its role in developing such programmes that mitigate risk, as well as make functional
    changes to how it runs the programmes. Diversify the structure of cost-share programmes
    First, in keeping with the two findings above to embrace a broader conception
    of innovation and redesign cost-share programmes, the focus group participants
    call for the diversification of the structure of cost-share programmes by articulating
    a clear set of criteria encouraging different types of innovations. For example,
    many interviewees and focus group participants pointed out that government programmes
    often do not reflect the realities and diversity of agriculture. For instance,
    in some cases, new automation and robotics technologies require new barn designs.
    As a further example, automated robotic milking systems cannot be installed in
    conventional tie-stall barns. However, new barns are not an eligible expense in
    cost-shared programmes that support the installation of robotic milking systems
    in Ontario. These issues point to the need for a broader construct of innovation
    targeting the concrete and specific needs of different commodities and production
    systems. Similarly, government incentive programmes could target various types
    of farms along a spectrum of capacity from small to large operations, from those
    with limited capacity (e.g. new farmers) to those that can absorb ambitious and
    high-capacity innovations. Current minimum levels of co-funding (government fund-matching
    programmes requiring a percentage of financial and/or in-kind contribution to
    be provided by the farmer) in Ontario are often too high for smaller farms to
    consider, and the competitive nature of the programmes means that only a few farms
    receive support. In a similar vein, cost-share programmes should accommodate different
    business models, such as purchasing, renting and servicing automation and robotics
    technologies. The main undercurrent in this finding to diversify the structure
    of cost-share and other incentive programmes is for government to have greater
    flexibility and explore a wider range of risk mitigation initiatives for different
    kinds of farming operations and technological needs. Design cost-share programmes
    to accommodate and acknowledge early adopters Second, the focus group participants
    suggest that government should design cost-share programmes to accommodate and
    acknowledge early adopters of new technologies. They consider funding or cost-share
    programmes that support the adoption of automation and robotics technology as
    a disincentive to early adopters. For instance, cost-share programmes in Ontario
    are generally reactive in nature, responding to a record of adoption by early
    adopters. However, funding or cost-share programmes in the province do not allow
    retroactive payments. This means that those early adopters who use technology
    before a cost-share programme is launched are not eligible for support. In a sense,
    funding and cost-share programmes essentially support so-called ‘laggards’ – those
    who are late adopters while ignoring farmers who took the risk of pioneering new
    or improved technology. While this policy incentivizes the wider adoption of successful
    technologies, focus group participants speculate it discourages overall levels
    of adoption. Cost-share programmes should thus be restructured to support the
    leaders, not laggards or followers. For example, this would also involve calibrating
    options for more government funding to be directed to pioneer projects which can
    be further incentivized with financial or other rewards for their owners’ willingness
    to share successes with a wider audience. This means mobilizing early adopters
    as champions of new and improved technologies. Farmers tend to trust each other''s
    experience considerably more than the promises of technology developers. Factor
    in the element of time in cost-share programmes Third, government should factor
    in the element of time in cost-share programmes. Focus group participants indicate
    that the timing of cost-share programmes in Ontario is often misaligned with production
    cycles, making it difficult for farmers to find the time to prepare applications.
    More generally, the element of time implies the need for realistic expectations
    about the processes of research, technology development and adoption in agriculture.
    This is particularly significant given the peculiarity of technology development
    and adoption in agriculture related to the several production seasons involved
    in the validation process. Some field-based research projects for new or improved
    technologies in agriculture often need several years of field data to know what
    works. If farmers are to willingly participate in these trials, then government
    has a critical role in mitigating the risk involved, especially if the technology
    does not perform as expected. The livelihoods of farmers are on the line if they
    lose some or all their crops or livestock. Paying closer attention to the element
    of time would thus involve factoring in a wider range of programmes accommodating
    single-year to multiyear projects. Similarly, it would exploit shorter-term opportunities
    in year-round operations like greenhouses, for instance, that are not particularly
    constrained by seasons. Cost-share programmes would also have built-in time horizons
    that allow business owners and farmers to adopt technology in a slow and incremental
    fashion because learning how to use technology takes time. The ultimate goal would
    be to incorporate flexible timelines for various kinds of farming operations,
    navigating the complex and often industry-specific and commodity-specific nuances
    of technology adoption. Embrace a greater risk orientation Fourth, the focus group
    data indicates that government should embrace a greater risk orientation in accelerating
    the adoption of automation and robotics technology by farmers. Notwithstanding
    the negative connotations of uncertainty as a barrier to adopting new technology,
    by embracing a greater risk orientation, government can, in fact, leverage uncertainty
    as a driver of adoption. For example, with the increasing complexity of farming
    linked to the challenges of climate change, unstable, fluctuating global markets,
    and shifting consumer expectations and demands, farmers see automation and robotics
    technology as a way to alleviate some of this instability. They see it as offering
    some level of control in a sector where much is out of their control. However,
    funding mechanisms should better reflect the realities of uncertainty and risk.
    In addition to all the forces of uncertainty outlined above, farmers operate in
    less controllable environments, subject to the vagaries of weather and seasons,
    and frequently at the mercy of climactic and biological forces. Furthermore, technologies
    such as harvesting robots must be designed and trained to identify a range of
    similar but not identical units in more dynamic and varied production environments.
    All this means incorporating appropriate incentive mechanisms and compensation
    packages for farmers in high-risk ventures that may fail to generate their anticipated
    outcomes. Diversify financial resources of cost-share funding Fifth, the focus
    group participants indicate that government could diversify the financial sources
    of cost-share funding by exploring more innovative financial instruments, such
    as partnerships with banks and other financial institutions to take on certain
    kinds of ventures – especially ambitious and high-risk technological development
    and adoption projects. Similarly, governments could deploy more innovative fiscal
    incentives to accelerate technology adoption. Examples of such innovative tax
    instruments include the accelerated investment incentive, full expensing for manufacturers
    and processors and full expensing for clean energy investments that were announced
    in the Government of Canada’s 2018 Fall Economic Statement.2 Improve the dissemination
    of information about cost-share programmes Sixth, focus group participants see
    room for government to improve the dissemination of information about cost-share
    programmes in the public domain. Principally, this involves employing innovative
    conduits of information flow to improve how farmers access that information. For
    instance, governments could harness with greater intentionality industry associations
    (like the Ontario Federation of Agriculture) which already serve as well-established
    information networks. The networks of these industry associations cultivated over
    many years can serve as effective channels for disseminating and promoting information
    about available cost-share programmes for automation and robotics technology adoption.
    Explore ways to reduce the administrative burden The seventh and final findings
    for improving cost-share programmes are to explore ways to reduce the administrative
    burden of accessing such programmes. A recurring theme in the focus group data
    is the highly administrative and bureaucratic nature of funding and cost-share
    programmes in Ontario. For instance, application and reporting requirements are
    often overly burdensome. One immediate remedy would be to make the application
    processes for cost-share programmes simpler and more straightforward. It would
    also mean more advance notice of new programmes to allow farmers more time to
    prepare their applications. A related suggestion for reducing the administrative
    burden is for governments to design and manage cost-share programmes with greater
    continuity, consistency and predictability. As one focus group participant puts
    it, ‘we should have intake times written more in stone like there''s going to
    be an intake 9/12/16 months from now for this particular thing. Programme predictability
    and more advance notice might influence greater uptake’. Growers need to have
    the confidence that cost-share programmes will be there over the long term as
    they invest their livelihoods into experimenting with new or improved technologies.
    Farmers sometimes avoid high-risk projects because of the limited and unpredictable
    lifespan of incentive programmes. Support and facilitate the development of standards
    for data interoperability and address security and privacy issues Another recurring
    theme of the focus group data focused on how government could address the challenges
    associated with managing, using, harmonizing, sharing, storing and protecting
    the massive volumes of data that are generated by automation and robotics technology.
    Principally, government should take a more active role in supporting and facilitating
    the development of standards for data interoperability to reduce fragmentation
    in data systems and enable data collected on one system to be easily combined
    with data collected on another. For example, such standards will address the challenges
    of farms often having multiple systems that are unable to communicate. It will
    also alleviate problems in the supply chain where data cannot be shared among
    supply chain partners. A more synchronized data collection and management system
    will immensely facilitate collective learning across the sector. Other critical
    issues related to data include privacy, security and ownership. Standards should
    thus address the risks associated with collecting, storing and sharing large volumes
    of data to mitigate the endemic legal and ethical incertitude pervading the security,
    privacy and ownership of the data. However, the lack of standards is not limited
    to the issues around data but other aspects of technology''s design, functionality
    and performance. There is also a national standards perspective to think about,
    such as standards related to providing technical support, service and guidelines
    for purchasing technology. A final point about the development of standards relates
    to assessing challenges that prevent broader uptake and scale-up, identifying
    what standards are needed to increase trust amongst user groups, and ensuring
    consistency, quality and performance of automation and robotics technology. In
    general, clearly established standards encourage close collaboration, engagement
    and consensus-building with all relevant stakeholder groups. Build the requisite
    digital and physical infrastructure in rural areas to support greater use of automation
    and robotics technology Addressing broadband connectivity issues in rural areas
    was deemed by the focus group participants as a pre-requisite for any meaningful
    policy and programme initiative to accelerate the adoption of automation and robotics
    technology by farmers. For example, all other incentive programmes will be pointless
    if poor broadband connectivity in rural communities renders the use of automation
    and robotics technology an ongoing challenge. Throughout our research, farmers
    repeatedly pointed out that adequate digital infrastructure to fully support digital
    devices are a critical part of their decision making when considering technology
    adoption. Although the predominant focus was on digital infrastructure, participants
    in our study also highlighted the need to update physical infrastructure with
    state-of-the-art utilities such as gas, electricity, renewable energy, water and
    wastewater. Expand the capacity of experimental research stations and demonstration
    farms While the adoption of new technology is no doubt a problem, evidence from
    the focus group data points to upstream issues and challenges related to developing
    and validating relevant new products and rendering them market ready. This means
    that governments rethink their engagement with upstream innovation activities
    by supporting more targeted applied/experimental research for validating automation
    and robotics technology. This would require expanding the mandates and capacity
    of research stations and demonstration farms to prioritize automation and robotics
    technology experimentation and validation. An expanded mandate for research stations
    and demonstration farms will task them with focusing more on leading-edge automation
    and robotics technology validation. They will also serve as platforms for adapting
    foreign technology to domestic needs. Experimental research stations could be
    a vital conduit for partnering with international technology producers in adapting
    foreign technology to domestic needs. Revamping the mandate of research stations
    and increasing investment in such facilities would enhance the ‘soft-landing’
    of newly developed foreign technologies entering domestic farms. Harness emergent
    labour trends to cultivate the requisite skill sets needed for developing and
    adopting more relevant automation and robotics technology The focus group participants
    highlighted labour shortage (exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic) as a prevalent
    challenge. However, they view it as also having triggered unprecedented opportunities
    for automation and robotics. Exploiting these opportunities requires that government
    focus on cultivating the requisite skill sets needed for developing and using
    the new technologies. First, it would require addressing the downstream issue
    of reskilling the labour force so that they possess not just technical skills
    in operating sophisticated equipment but also knowledge about agriculture and
    its peculiarities. Second, government could target upstream initiatives focused
    on providing training programmes that combine technology development with knowledge
    of agriculture. This will help close the current cultural gaps between technology
    developers and the agriculture community and the resulting tendency for newly
    developed technologies to be irrelevant to the pressing needs of farmers. Both
    the upstream and downstream skills training initiatives would entail government
    working with post-secondary and other training institutions which already possess
    the pedagogical logistics for generating these requisite skills. Promote societal
    acceptance of agri-food innovations Society''s acceptance of innovations is another
    factor that the focus group participants consider as a critical variable in a
    farmer''s decision making about incorporating new technologies into their food
    production systems. The agriculture sector must contend with changing consumer
    tastes, societal values and other expectations. Managing these societal pressures
    makes developing and adopting new or improved technologies unpredictable, messy,
    time-consuming and costly. Farmers are keenly aware that the public is concerned
    not only about how innovation affects the safety of foods consumed but also increasingly
    about the ecological footprint of food production. The focus group participants
    thus see government has having a vital role to play in developing new pathways
    to engage and educate the public and address society''s questions and misinformation
    about innovation in the agri-food sector. Coordinate policies and programmes across
    levels of government None of the findings and recommendations above from the focus
    group data would make a lasting impact without greater policy and programme coordination
    among levels of government, especially in multi-tiered federal jurisdictions like
    Canada. For instance, the focus group participants see the province of Ontario''s
    policy and programme efforts as only partial measures without adequate coordination
    with other levels of government. They see greater policy and programme coordination
    vertically among levels of government and horizontally across departments within
    the same level of government to ensure greater synchrony as a vital pre-requisite
    for governments’ role in accelerating the adoption of automation and robotics
    technology in agriculture. Discussion In this section we will explore the significance
    of the survey and focus group discussion results in the context of relevant extant
    literature and highlight the key policy implications of our findings for the agriculture
    sector. One of the main extrapolation from the survey data findings above is that
    the rate of robotics and automation technology adoption in agriculture is a function
    of push and pull factors. As we noted earlier in the analytical framework section
    of the paper, the push factors are those elements that determine the development
    and transfer of technology by a constellation of laboratories, post-secondary
    institutions and research centres. However, equally significant for the agri-food
    sector to manifest global competitiveness are the pull factors of automation and
    robotics technology adoption. These factors refer to the conditions that incentivize
    (or disincentivize) farms to adopt new technologies to improve the efficiency
    and productivity of their operations. The push and pull factors of automation
    and robotics technology adoption in the agriculture sector point to the fact that
    a dynamic and globally competitive innovation system is not merely a function
    of the amounts of money spent on R&D but also of understanding what best incentivizes
    as well as what holds back technology adoption by farmers. A second and equally
    important implication from the survey and focus group data is the vital significance
    functional AIS as the context within which policy interventions to accelerate
    technology adoption are most effective. Improving the performance of agriculture
    innovation system is, in fact, closely intertwined with the findings and recommendations
    from focus group discussions. For example, it is through a functional and effective
    innovation system that governments can deliver successful cost-share and other
    incentive programmes. Through the work of partners in such AIS, standards for
    data interoperability and security and privacy can be voluntarily incorporated
    into farming operations as industry best practices and norms of socialization.
    Similarly, experimental research stations are entities whose operations are usually
    embedded within AIS. And finally, promoting societal acceptance of agri-food innovations
    is not the exclusive business of government but one best undertaken in partnership
    with industry and non-profit actors. The key implication is that the role of government
    in policy development and programme reform aimed at accelerating automation and
    robotics technology adoption in agriculture is best seen within the context of
    wider functional AIS within which it works with industry and non-profit actors
    in the agriculture sector to accelerate the adoption of automation and robotics
    technology. A functional and integrated AIS, as we noted in the analytical framework
    section, involves strategic leadership and close interconnections between the
    state, market and non-profit actors in the pursuit of greater technological development,
    adoption and economic competitiveness. In addition to regulations and provision
    of resources, strategic leadership in building a functional AIS requires actively
    bringing together public and semi-public entities, post-secondary institutions,
    research and training centres, technology producers and farmers into sustained
    and iterative networks. Building such networks means, first and foremost, cultivating
    trust among AIS partners from diverse cultures – technology developers, researchers
    and farmers. The majority of interviewees and focus group participants made direct
    reference to ‘trust’ and its vital importance in building an AIS where technology
    developers and farmers can work together. For example, a key part of building
    such trust is for the AIS leadership to work on establishing ethical standards
    for communicating and promoting new technology to mitigate technology developers’
    tendency to overstate their digital technologies’ performance and benefits. Similarly,
    AIS leadership should create the requisite standards for validating new technologies
    to avoid situations where immature technologies that do not have enough successful
    case studies to demonstrate their merit are aggressively promoted and sold to
    farmers. A third theoretical and policy implication of the survey and focus group
    data is the need to embrace an end-user development model of technology adoption
    – co-creation – to strengthen connections between researchers, technology developers
    and farmers. As we noted in the analytical framework, the rate of automation and
    robotics technology adoption is often partly a function of upstream factors related
    to the development and transfer of technology by a constellation of laboratories,
    post-secondary institutions, and research centres within an AIS. The end-user
    model bridges the cultural and cognitive divides between technology developers
    and farmers by including farmers at all stages of a technology''s development,
    from conceptualizing to validating, prototyping and manufacturing. A final policy
    implication from the findings above that aligns with, and sheds further light
    on, the extant is the need to deploy purpose-driven intermediaries. As we noted
    earlier in reference to the extant literature, intermediaries are organizational
    actors at the centre of AIS consisting of iterative relations between groups bound
    together by their shared interests in a set of technologies. For example, intermediaries
    are the organizational conduits through which government and its agri-food innovation
    partners deliver and monitor cost-share and other incentive programmes. They are
    often the custodians of industry standards and norms of best practice. Intermediaries
    are also active agents in promoting societal acceptance of agri-food innovations.
    Moreover, the idea of strategic leadership in building a functional AIS would
    be meaningless if not for the efforts and activities of intermediaries who shepherd
    the cultivation of networks in such AIS. If AIS is the scaffolding in the acceleration
    of technology adoption, as we argued above, then intermediaries are the planks
    of that scaffolding. They are the translators and curators of knowledge and information
    not only in helping technology end-users manage the problem of information overload
    but also making such information less intimidating and more accessible and intelligible.
    Intermediaries are vital to encouraging growers’ interest in learning and deeper
    engagement with new technologies. Conclusion In this paper, we have employed a
    mixed-method approach in an attempt to shed light on the emergent and longstanding
    barriers and drivers to innovation, specifically automation and robotics technology
    adoption. In a similar vein, the paper extrapolated from the survey and focus
    group findings some policy recommendations and suggested action steps for removing
    barriers and exploiting opportunities to accelerate automation and robotics technology
    transfer and adoption in the agriculture sector. While the empirical focus was
    on Ontario, Canada, the findings, discussion and policy recommendations have worldwide
    implications for accelerating automation and robotics technology adoption by agriculture
    businesses in industrialized countries. As we noted in the discussion of the survey
    results, there is a well-demonstrated value in adopting automation and robotics
    technology with two-thirds of adopters (67%) noting increasing productivity, more
    than half (57%) citing increasing production efficiency, and 56% mentioning reduced
    costs as their reasons for implementing automation and robotics technology. Most
    significantly, adopters and non-adopters alike agree that government has a critical
    role to play in accelerating the adoption of automation and robotics technology
    in agriculture through initiatives like embracing a broader conception of technological
    innovation, restructuring cost-share incentive programmes, supporting and facilitating
    the development of standards for data interoperability, and ensuring greater security
    and privacy. Furthermore, they expected government to build the requisite digital
    and physical infrastructure in rural areas, expand the mandate and capacity of
    experimental research stations, harness emergent labour trends to cultivate the
    requisite skills, and promote societal acceptance of agri-food innovations. They
    also called for more strategic leadership by public, private and non-profit stakeholders
    in building functional and effective agriculture innovation systems. Finally,
    they expressed a strong desire for purpose-driven intermediaries with a clear
    mandate, adequate resources and the technical competence to shepherd farmers and
    technology developers into sustainable and iterative relationships of technology
    co-creation. In closing, it is our hope, as researchers that the recommendations
    generated from our study will serve as evidence-based action steps for accelerating
    the development and adoption of automation and robotics technology not only in
    Ontario and Canada''s agriculture sector, but countries worldwide pursuing a globally
    competitive production system. Acknowledgements I am also indebted to my colleagues,

    Helsinki, Finland Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Pests cause significant
    damage to agricultural products and limit the development of agriculture. According
    to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, direct
    and indirect damage from pests causes a 20% to 40% reduction in agricultural yields
    each year, where the indirect damage includes fungal infections and disease transmission
    caused by pests. [1] Although a large number of chemicals are used to counteract
    the decline in agricultural yields caused by pests, such measures have harmful
    consequences including chemical contamination of fields and ecological damage.
    To address the agricultural development challenges posed by pests, computer-aided
    decision-making systems for agricultural pest management are a feasible solution
    with the goal of optimising the agricultural return rate while protecting the
    environment and resources. Most current state-of-the-art agricultural decision
    support systems use a large number of expensive sensors to collect data for making
    decisions [2] or provide decision-making support through data analysis of laboratory
    data for agricultural workers. [3] The extraordinarily high cost and low robustness
    of these decision systems hinder their application in real-life scenarios. Meanwhile,
    most agricultural decision support systems are committed to providing support
    for irrigation and disease management [4] rather than pest management due to the
    lack of efficient pest detection methods. In this paper, we propose an object
    detection-based decision support system, PestDSS, to provide pest management decisions
    on whether to use pesticides and explanations of decisions. The system is implemented
    based on cloud computing architecture, mainly including a farm information management
    module, an agricultural knowledge base module, and a decision-making tool module.
    The workflow of PestDSS is shown in Fig. 1. The decision-making tool uses image
    information from the user to calculate pest densities and species and makes decisions
    in conjunction with contextual information such as crop growth stages. After a
    decision-making process, a feedback task is sent to users for optimising the expert
    system. The contributions of this work are fourfold. Firstly, we develop an agricultural
    decision support system based on an object detection model to provide decisions
    for pest management. Secondly, we construct a pest detection dataset by handheld
    devices for wheat pest detection in the real environment. Thirdly, a pest detection
    model is proposed to provide population density and species of pests for the decision-making
    tool. The proposed pest detection model achieved higher mean average precision
    on three pest detection datasets compared to Faster RCNN [5] and Yo1oX [6]. Last,
    a case study on wheat pest management is conducted to validate the effectiveness
    of the system conceptually and to demonstrate the usability and limitations of
    our system based on user surveys. Fig. 1. The workflow of PestDSS. Show All SECTION
    II. Related Works A. Decision support systems for agriculture With the rapid development
    of computer technologies in the context of precision agriculture, such as Cloud
    Computing, Big Data, the Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence, researchers
    are committed to building a system to provide agricultural workers with precise
    and sustainable agricultural decisions to balance agricultural inputs and outputs.
    The systems are called the decision support system. The agricultural decision
    support system is more formally defined as a smart system which is capable of
    providing decisions based on data or supporting the agricultural decision-making
    process in different situations. [7] Some work demonstrated the effectiveness
    of agricultural decision support systems. For example, a decision support system
    was proposed for irrigation management. [8] Meanwhile, the best irrigation solution
    in terms of water use efficiency was identified in a case study of maize through
    the proposed system. [8] In disease management, a decision support system combined
    with drones to reduce environmental pollution by using ultrasonic sensors and
    images to detect plant diseases and apply herbicides precisely. [2] Moreover,
    a Bayesian model was utilised in the decision support system [9] to predict the
    risk of wireworm infestation for providing pest management strategies. Overall,
    a large number of successful agricultural support systems have been proposed and
    some of the work have recorded the use of pesticides. However, there is still
    a lack of general decision support systems to support pest management, due to
    the lack of effective and cost-effective pest detection methods. B. Object detection
    for pest management Object detection is a classical computer vision task that
    focuses on acquiring bounding boxes and classifying all instances of interest
    in an input image. In the early work on computer vision methods applied to pest
    management, manually designed image feature extraction methods were used in object
    detection tasks, such as the local binary pattern operator [10] and entropy-based
    histogram thresholding algorithm [11]. These efforts have some obvious limitations
    such as the inefficiency of the methods in complex image backgrounds. With the
    success of deep neural networks for computer vision tasks, convolutional neural
    network-based object detection models are applied to pest detection tasks. Current
    advanced convolutional neural network-based object detection models are divided
    into two categories based on model structure, two-stage detection models and one-stage
    detection models. The difference between two-stage detection models and one-stage
    detection models is whether there is a structure for proposing bounding boxes.
    Faster RCNN [5] as a state-of-the-art two-stage detection model was used in pest
    detection through a fixed detection device and optimised by integrating a local
    attention module and a global attention module. [12] Yolo is a series of one-stage
    object detection models that demonstrate higher performance with a lightweight
    model structure than Faster RCNNs. [6] Due to the advantages of the Yolo object
    detection model, a large number of pest detection efforts were proposed based
    on the Yolo object detection model. [13] These efforts were able to obtain pest
    numbers. However, due to the lack of sampling methods and standards, it is not
    possible to obtain population densities of pests that are more effective in making
    decisions. In recent years, transformer-based neural networks have shown advantages
    in encoding global features. The transformer-based object detection model, DETR,
    was used to detect the pests in the traps through images. [14] However, the training
    of such models requires a larger number of datasets due to the lack of inductive
    biases in the transformer structure, such as rotation invariance and scale invariance
    in the convolutional structure. In general, the object detection model solves
    the pest detection problems in pest management tasks. However, there is still
    a gap between pest detection and pest management decision-making. Fig. 2. System
    architecture of PestDSS. Show All SECTION III. Proposed Methods Decision support
    systems are computer-assisted tools that improve the quality of decision-making
    by extracting and implementing rules or systematic knowledge from collected data.
    [15] In this work, we propose an agricultural decision support system, called
    PestDSS, which extends a farm information management module to an agricultural
    decision support system by integrating a pest management decision tool and an
    agricultural knowledge base. The farm information management module in PestDSS
    provides contextual information for the pest management decision tool by capturing
    and recording farm and crop-related information from users to reduce production
    costs, maintain high crop quality, and comply with agricultural and environmental
    standards. The pest management decision tool is built based on an object detection
    model and a rule-based expert system. The object detection model is used to detect
    the densities and species of multiple pests through manually acquired images of
    farmland. The detection results are processed by the rule-based expert system,
    which integrates the farm and crop information to provide a decision recommendation
    on whether pests need to be repelled. A. System architecture The system architecture
    of PestDSS is based on cloud computing and is therefore highly reliable and scalable.
    The various modules of the system consist of separate services and provide interfaces
    in the form of RESTful APIs as Fig. 2 shown. These separate services are implemented
    through Springboot and are deployed on Kubernetes clusters. The object detection
    service in PestDSS is a trained pest detection model implemented by Pytorch. PestDSS
    offers three different clients focusing on different concerns, such as the web
    page client focusing on farm information management, the android client focusing
    on decision-making tools for pest management, and the RESRFul API focusing on
    providing access and the ability to extend functionality for technicians. Fig.
    3. Pest detection model for pest management. Show All B. Pest detection model
    We propose an object detection model and a density calculation method to detect
    pest densities and species by image information. The object detection model structure
    is modified from one stage detection model, YoloX [6], which includes a convolutional
    neural network for feature extraction, a path aggregation network (PAN) as detection
    neck structure for incorporating lower-level features into higher-level features,
    and multiple decoupled detection heads for higher detection accuracy, as shown
    in Fig. 3. The main structural change lies in the optimisation of the detection
    neck structure, where the direction of data fusion has an impact on the accuracy
    of tiny object detection. We used a PAN to replace the structure in the original
    work of YoloX to obtain higher performance on pest datasets. In addition to model
    structure, there are some training tricks used in this work including data augmentation
    and label assignment strategy. We use image flipping, splitting, HSV perturbation,
    and object copy and paste during the model training stage. The difference with
    YoloX is that we turn off the mix-up function and mosaic function due to its unfavourable
    performance of smaller detection models [6] [16]. The task-aligned assigner [17]
    is used as the label assignment strategy, rather than SimOTA in YoloX. The task-aligned
    assigner uses an anchor alignment metric to combine the assignment of the bounding
    box with the classification task to select the positive sample of the generated
    anchor. The loss function is shown as Loss=λ Loss CIoU + Loss Obj + Loss Cls ,
    (1) View Source where λ is a balance coefficient for Complete-IoU loss used for
    location, Loss Obj and Loss Cls are binary cross entropy loss for object and classification.
    Fig. 4. The workflow of the rule-based expert system for pest management. Show
    All To calculate the population density of pests in the field, we propose an algorithm
    to calculate the actual area of an image through the equivalent focal length.
    Equation (2) is a basic method for calculating the actual area of images, where
    F equivalent and S sensor are the focal length of a camera lens and film frame
    size, respectively. The file frame size is also known as the size of the camera
    sensor. However, it is a challenge to obtain the camera setting from image data,
    especially for the film frame size. Meanwhile, it is unreliable to maintain a
    dynamic table of all camera models and sensor information. Therefore, we use the
    equivalent focal length as F equivalent in (2). The equivalent focal length is
    the focal length applied to another lens used on 35 mm film frame size that would
    give the same field of view on this camera. The 35 mm film frame size is also
    known as the size of full-frame sensors. We obtain the equivalent focal length
    F equivalent from the Exchangeable Image File (EXIF) information. The size of
    full-frame sensors is a fixed 24×36(  mm 2 ) . By this method, we are able to
    obtain the density of pests. S actual = D target F equivalent ⋅ S sensor (2) View
    Source C. Rule-based expert system For providing advice on pest management decisions,
    we are required to integrate prior agricultural knowledge in the text form and
    automated decision-making processes. We propose a rule-based expert system that
    extracts quantified rules for pest management from literature review through regular
    expressions and data cleaning to address the aforementioned challenges. The effectiveness
    of expert systems has been proven in a wide range of works that use computers
    to automatically simulate the decision-making process of human experts solving
    complex problems by extracting rules from the knowledge and experience provided
    by one or more experts in a particular field [18] [19]. The proposed rule-based
    expert system in this work includes five main components, reasoning machine, expositor,
    knowledge database, global database, and thresholds optimiser, as Fig. 4 shows.
    The reasoning machine is a set of continuous IF (CONDITION) (BEHAVIOUR) ELSE (BEHAVIOUR)
    structures used to make decisions based on pest densities and species from detection
    models, crop growth stages, and pest management records from farm information
    management module. The expositor generates explanations of the decision for end
    users based on the decision and decision path. Meanwhile, relevant expert knowledge
    from the knowledge database is provided to end users. The knowledge database stores
    a large amount of agricultural knowledge in text and image form, which is used
    to initialise the thresholds required by the reasoning machine. The initialised
    rule thresholds are stored in Global Database. When user feedback is obtained,
    the threshold optimiser is able to optimise the thresholds. D. Threshold Optimisation
    The initial thresholds extracted from the knowledge database are insufficient
    to construct an effective automated pest management decision tool. There are several
    reasons for this problem. Firstly, we identify the problem of missing data for
    quantitative agricultural pest management thresholds. For example, some works
    identified spring outbreaks of gout fly that can severely affect crop yields [20],
    but there are no defined population density thresholds for which eradication is
    required. Secondly, we identify some lower thresholds, close to the point where
    pests are required to be removed as soon as they are identified. These thresholds
    are obviously dependent on the particular data sampling method. Due to differences
    in sampling methods, thresholds for pest management should also be adjusted. Last
    but not least, the early research of pest management thresholds may not be suitable
    for the current agricultural environment due to the extensive use of pesticides
    and the introduction of biological control in recent years. The pests may develop
    resistance to pesticides or have natural enemies. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig.
    4, a feedback task is scheduled by the farm information management module after
    the expert system has completed a decision. Moreover, the decision recorder is
    stored by the farm information management module. The feedback task is sent to
    users at regular intervals, including a questionnaire and pest detection. Users
    are required to provide feedback on the validity and impairment of the decision
    and the optimiser adjusts the threshold globally with a small learning rate. TABLE
    I Statistical Information of Three Datasets SECTION IV. Experimentation and Results
    For evaluating the usability of PestDSS, two parts of work are performed including
    evaluating the performance of the pest detection model and evaluating the decision
    support system in a case study of wheat pest management during this project. A.
    Image dataset During the development of PestDSS, a wheat pest dataset is constructed,
    named the WheatPest dataset. Current common agricultural pest datasets are constructed
    through the use of search engines or in a laboratory environment. Unlike those
    datasets, images in the WheatPest dataset are collected from a real environment
    and conform to specific sampling criteria to ensure the sample distribution of
    objects in real-use scenarios, especially for the images used to calculate pest
    densities. Compared to the datasets constructed by taking photos of pests caught
    in traps, our dataset is more challenging due to the complex natural environment.
    In addition to the WheatPest dataset, two public datasets are used in the evaluation
    of the pest detection model including the IP102 dataset [21] and an Aphids dataset
    from AgriPest dataset [22]. IP102 is a large public pest image dataset including
    19,167 annotated images for 97 classes. However, this dataset is collected by
    search engines and has larger objects for detection. The Aphids dataset [23] is
    built for two kinds of aphids through data cleaning from the AgriPest dataset
    [22]. This dataset is a typical tiny object detection dataset for pests. The statistical
    information of those datasets is shown in Table. I. B. Experimentation setting
    For evaluating the performance of the proposed pest detection model, we compare
    the proposed pest detection model with two state-of-the-art object detection models
    including Faster RCNN [5] and Yo1oX [6] in terms of mean average precision (mAP).
    The mAP is defined as the mean value of the area under a Precision-Recall curve.
    The input of detection models is 640*640 images. The convolutional neural network,
    CSPDarknet [6], is used as the feature extractor in this work. Input sizes of
    the detection neck in Yo1oX and our proposed model are 20*20*512, 40*40*256, and
    80*80*128, respectively. The anchor setting of Faster RCNN is 64, 128, and 256
    with the ratio of 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1. All three models are trained with early stopping
    and data augmentation which is turned off 20 epochs earlier. All three datasets
    are split into a training dataset, a validation dataset, and a test dataset in
    the ratio of 8:1:1. TABLE II The Mean Average Precision of Object Detection Model
    On Three Datasets C. Pest detection model Table. II presents the performance of
    object detection models on three datasets. Our model outperformed in three datasets
    compared with Faster RCNN and Yo1oX due to the optimised model structure and suitable
    data augmentation methods. The reason for the similar mAP of three detection models
    in the IP102 dataset is that the dataset has a large amount of data and is built
    for large objects. Therefore, the data augmentation methods and detection neck
    for fusing multi-layer features do not show a significant improvement in mAP.
    In contrast, the benefit of detection neck for small object detection is presented
    in the Aphids dataset and WheatPest dataset. As described in the method section,
    the orientation of the data fusion in the detection neck affects the final performance
    of the detection model, which demonstrates the advantages of the PAN structure.
    In addition, the mAP of Yo1oX model which uses mixup and mosiac data augmentation
    methods lagged behind our model, especially on the WheatPest dataset. D. Case
    study: Wheat Pest Management in fields After the development of PestDSS, we conduct
    a user-based case study, Wheat Pest Management in farmlands, to evaluate the usability
    of PestDSS. The aims of the case study are to demonstrate the functionality of
    PestDSS, obtain decision results as proof-of-concept, and obtain user feedback
    for system optimisation. Eleven participants are invited to use the PestDSS system
    via an Android client and to evaluate the pest management decision-making process
    in the form of Likert scales. Participants are asked to use the pest management
    decision-making tool by following the PestDSS guidelines. All participants complete
    the decision designation process and receive a decision with explanations. Table.
    III shows how users rated the ease of use of the decision-making tool where the
    detection process as the main interaction process is rated separately. According
    to the feedback from participants, PestDSS provides a semi-automatic pest management
    decision tool and effective access to relevant agricultural knowledge. However,
    the semi-automatic detection process is a serious limiting factor for the usability
    of the system. SECTION V. Conclusions Rapid advances in computer technology have
    made it possible to provide farmers with accurate advice on sustainable pest management
    decisions. We develop a decision support system, PestDSS, that provides a cloud-based
    farm management information solution, an agricultural knowledge base, and an object
    detection-based decision-making tool for pest management. Through PestDSS, users
    are able to manage farm data, gain agricultural expertise, and use the pest management
    decision tool. In the experiment, the pest detection model used in the decision-making
    tool achieves higher mAP compared to Faster RCNN and Yo1oX on the three pest detection
    datasets through data augmentation methods and optimised model structure. In the
    case study of wheat pest management, we demonstrate the functionality of PestDSS
    via the Android client and outline the potential benefits of the decision-making
    tool that is able to save costs and provide sustainable pest management advice
    based on optimisable economic thresholds without human error. With the benefit
    of cloud-based architecture, PestDSS shows great reliability and scalability.
    The limitation of this case study is that we do not compare the decision from
    PestDSS with the decisions from agricultural experts, due to the fact that the
    positive decisions do not occur in our case study. TABLE III The Mean Average
    Precision of Object Detection Model On Three Datasets In our further work, we
    will add more decision-making tools to PestDSS than just pest management decisions.
    The further features will include disease detection and management, fertilizer
    management, and weed management. Although the current implementation of PestDSS
    provides a semi-automatic pest management decision-making tool, experimental results
    show that the accuracy of the decision is limited by that of the object detection
    model. In addition, the scalable PestDSS has the potential to build fully automated
    farm management solutions for a large range of farms in combination with drones
    or robots. Furthermore, the acceptance of decision support systems is an important
    research question. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT We gratefully acknowledge the support provided

  description: Early crop yield prediction provides critical information for Precision
    Agriculture (PA) procedures, policymaking, and food security. The availability
    of Remote Sensing (RS) datasets and Machine Learning (ML) approaches improved
    the prediction of sugarcane crop yield on the local and global scales, but an
    additional effort on the plot scale prediction is required. Challenges for plot-level
    prediction include a high ratooning capacity of the sugarcane crop, the lack of
    high spatial resolution data during the critical growth stages, and the non-linear
    complexation of yield data. The principal objective of the study is to analyse
    the potential of a time series of high-resolution multispectral Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) imagery along with three advanced ML techniques, namely Random Forest
    Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Nonlinear Autoregressive
    Exogenous Artificial Neural Network (NARX ANN) as a solution to the plot-level
    sugarcane yield prediction. An experimental sugarcane field containing 48 plots
    was selected, and UAV imagery was collected during the three consecutive cropping
    seasons' early and middle crop growth stages. Each dataset per growth stage was
    analyzed separately to predict the sugarcane crop yield in an attempt to discover
    how early the prediction of pre-harvest yield can be achieved. The datasets of
    the first two cropping seasons were trained and tested using the three ML techniques,
    utilizing 10-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. The third cropping season
    dataset was then used to evaluate the reliability of the developed prediction
    models. The results show that the correlation of Vegetation Indices (VIs) with
    crop yield in the middle stage outperforms the early stage in all three ML models.
    Moreover, comparing these models indicates that the NARX ANN method outperformed
    the others in the middle stage with the highest correlation coefficient (R2) of
    0.96 and the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.92 t/ha. It was followed
    by the SVR (R2 = 0.52, RMSE of 14.85 t/ha), which performed similarly to the RFR
    method (R2 = 0.48, RMSE = 11.20 t/ha). In conclusion, the best-suited model for
    predicting sugarcane yields during the middle growth stage is a NARX ANN model
    employing the Normalized Difference RedEdge (NDRE), which demonstrates the feasibility
    of the ML approaches to predict the plot level sugarcane yield at a specific period
    of growth as they are less sensitive to the inconsistency of data collection times.

    crop yield prediction provides critical information for Precision Agriculture
    (PA) procedures, policymaking, and food security. The availability of Remote Sensing
    (RS) datasets and Machine Learning (ML) approaches improved the prediction of
    sugarcane crop yield on the local and global scales, but an additional effort
    on the plot scale prediction is required. Challenges for plot-level prediction
    include a high ratooning capacity of the sugarcane crop, the lack of high spatial
    resolution data during the critical growth stages, and the non-linear complexation
    of yield data. The principal objective of the study is to analyse the potential
    of a time series of high-resolution multispectral Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
    imagery along with three advanced ML techniques, namely Random Forest Regression
    (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous
    Artificial Neural Network (NARX ANN) as a solution to the plot-level sugarcane
    yield prediction. An experimental sugarcane field containing 48 plots was selected,
    and UAV imagery was collected during the three consecutive cropping seasons''
    early and middle crop growth stages. Each dataset per growth stage was analyzed
    separately to predict the sugarcane crop yield in an attempt to discover how early
    the prediction of pre-harvest yield can be achieved. The datasets of the first
    two cropping seasons were trained and tested using the three ML techniques, utilizing
    10-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. The third cropping season dataset
    was then used to evaluate the reliability of the developed prediction models.
    The results show that the correlation of Vegetation Indices (VIs) with crop yield
    in the middle stage outperforms the early stage in all three ML models. Moreover,
    comparing these models indicates that the NARX ANN method outperformed the others
    in the middle stage with the highest correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.96 and
    the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.92 t/ha. It was followed by the
    SVR (R2 = 0.52, RMSE of 14.85 t/ha), which performed similarly to the RFR method
    (R2 = 0.48, RMSE = 11.20 t/ha). In conclusion, the best-suited model for predicting
    sugarcane yields during the middle growth stage is a NARX ANN model employing
    the Normalized Difference RedEdge (NDRE), which demonstrates the feasibility of
    the ML approaches to predict the plot level sugarcane yield at a specific period
    of growth as they are less sensitive to the inconsistency of data collection times.

    ANN) 1. Introduction Accurate and timely prediction of crop yields can be of great
    value to a variety of stakeholders within the agricultural sector, including large
    and small-scale farmers, agribusinesses, and refineries [1]. Precise early-season
    yield prediction can assist in managing harvesting, marketing, and transportation
    operations, leading to improved efficiency and cost savings for crop growers and
    farming retailers [2]. Unique characteristics of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum
    L.) in terms of crop density and height and a multi-year cropping cycle hinder
    pre-harvesting yield prediction via conventional field sampling methods such as
    visual evaluation approaches and manual crop cutting and weighting [3]. Therefore,
    Remote Sensing (RS) data having high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution
    (Satellite or Aerial imaging systems) is increasingly being applied for continuous
    sugarcane growth monitoring and prediction [4], [5]. However, the recent development
    of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has demonstrated new potential for
    agricultural yield prediction that is not limited by the spatiotemporal resolution,
    expense, and environmental limitations of satellite images. The empirical models,
    specifically the most widely used Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), are frequently
    employed approaches to establish a quantifiable correlation between remotely sensed
    data (either satellite or aerial imagery) and in-field measurements of sugarcane
    yields [6], [7], [8]. However, the growth of each sugarcane ratoon might vary
    based on agricultural management practices, geographic and temporal characteristics,
    as well as fertilizer treatment. As a result, the basic linear formula of the
    MLR model cannot consistently tackle the likelihood of a higher variance of the
    yield [9], [10]. To address the above-mentioned limitations, Machine Learning
    (ML) models like Random Forest Regression (RFR) [11], [12], [13], Support Vector
    Machine (SVM) [14], [15], and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [16], [17] were
    used. Even though these ML models can adapt to dynamic crop environments and are
    a more flexible predictive tool compared to simple linear regression, recent studies
    on ML models have demonstrated the benefits of employing Nonlinear Autoregressive
    Exogenous Artificial Neural Network (NARX ANN) as a recurrent neural network in
    the modeling process [18], [19]. However, there have been no records of the NARX
    being used to predict sugarcane crop yield. The ML model performance depends on
    the sugarcane type, region, study scale, and data availability, suggesting that
    a thorough comparison of different ML approaches for estimating sugarcane yield
    is required. Alongside the selection of a suitable methodology, the inclusion
    of appropriate explanatory variables is a crucial step toward the establishment
    of an accurate yield prediction model. The existing studies have used Vegetation
    Indices (VIs) such as Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) [2],
    [7], [20], Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [9], [21], [22], [23],
    Green Vegetation Index (GVI) [23], Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) [24], [25],
    and Normalized Difference RedEdge (NDRE) [12] as explanatory variables. There
    is a correlation between sugarcane yield and these VIs, however, before employing
    any VI, it is crucial to weigh their merits and disadvantages, as well as the
    intended applications. In our earlier work [26], we conducted a comprehensive
    analysis of all 23 different VIs commonly used in crop yield prediction studies.
    The selection of these VIs was based on the general knowledge that certain spectral
    bands of light are absorbed or reflected by specific plant pigments and cellular
    structures, which can provide valuable information on crop health and photosynthetic
    activity. However, there is not a specific VI that is universally applicable to
    all crops, and it is crucial to carefully evaluate the performance of different
    VIs in each specific application. Therefore, to select the most suitable VIs for
    predicting sugarcane yield, we utilized two phases of feature selection algorithms,
    Pearson''s correlation and the stepwise feature selection. In this process, we
    evaluated the correlation between each VI and the observed sugarcane yield, as
    well as the performance of different combinations of VIs in predicting yield using
    a novel cross-validation technique. Through this analysis, we identified five
    VIs that showed a high level of accuracy in predicting sugarcane yield, including
    NDRE, Green Red NDVI (GRNDVI), Phenological NDVI (PNDVI), Canopy Chlorophyll Content
    Index (CCCI), and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI). These five VIs
    showed their ability to capture specific physiological and biochemical aspects
    of sugarcane, such as chlorophyll content, crop biomass and canopy structure,
    which are known to be closely related to yield. As a result, these VIs will be
    considered in this study to improve the prediction accuracy through the ML algorithms.
    For this study, the primary objective is to investigate the potential of ML models,
    namely RFR, SVR, and NARX ANN that have never been employed in sugarcane yield
    prediction. Furthermore, since sugarcane yield depends not only seasonally but
    also geographically on a wide (across areas/regions) and small (inside paddocks/rows)
    scale, it would be expected that high spatiotemporal resolution UAV imagery enables
    us to monitor the crop status at a plot level and enhance the yield prediction
    accuracy. The main objective is to examine all of the data using two periodic
    scenarios (early and middle crop growth stages) to find the ideal time for predicting
    crop yield and enabling harvest planning and management before harvesting. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Study area This study was carried out at an established
    experimental sugarcane site in the Bundaberg district of Queensland, Australia
    (see Fig. 1). The region has a humid subtropical climate, with a rainy and hot
    summer spanning from December to February and a relatively dry winter extending
    from June to August. Sugarcanes (Q242 variety) were planted in 48 plots, each
    of which had six rows with a 1.83 m spacing between two adjacent rows and measured
    21 m long and 11 m wide. Download : Download high-res image (390KB) Download :

    district, Queensland, Australia, with a zoom-in to the field. 4. 2.2. Data collection
    During the cropping seasons 2016–2017 to 2018–2019, two primary data sources,
    including the UAV imagery and the field yield measurements, were gathered from
    the experimental site. For this study, in order to eliminate the effect of fertilization
    of adjacent plots and background soil reflection, two bordering rows were not
    considered. They are the first (westernmost) and sixth (easternmost) rows of each
    of 48 plots. Instead, the crops grown in rows 2–5 in each plot were considered
    representative crops within the same plot. Manual harvesting of two 5-meter portions
    from Rows 3 and 4 was performed to estimate annual sugarcane yields on 24 October
    2017, 24 September 2018, and 24 September 2019. Table 1 demonstrates the descriptive
    statistics of the measured yield data, which indicates a significant spatial variation
    in sugarcane yields between the plots as well as temporal variations between the
    cropping seasons, mainly due to the variation in nitrogen fertilizer management
    practices in different plots, soil conditions, crop age (in general, the sugarcane
    yield decreases with age), and weather conditions. Table 1. Descriptive statistics

    88.00 134.39 15.93 The time series of multispectral UAV images (3-cm spatial resolution)
    was acquired using a DJI Phantom-3 Advanced multirotor drone equipped with an
    integrated MicaSense RedEdge sensor. The MicaSense platform boasts efficient flight
    capabilities and utilizes five multispectral sensors for more precise multispectral
    image capturing in five spectral bands: Blue (485 nm), Green (560 nm), Red (660
    nm), Near-Infrared (840 nm), and RedEdge (717 nm) [27]. The images were captured
    at an altitude of 45 m with a parallel camera angle to the ground and achieved
    satisfactory results with 60 % side and 90 % forward overlaps in all flights.
    The sensor was equipped with a Downwelling Light Sensor 2 (DLS 2) and Global Positioning
    System (GPS) antenna to gather irradiance and location data during the collection
    of the UAV images, which took place between 11 a.m. and 2p.m. to minimize shadowing
    effects. The UAV spectral reflectance was subsequently calibrated using data on
    irradiance, heading, orientation, and solar angle. Six Ground Check Points (GCPs)
    were surveyed in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 55 projection of the
    World Geodetic System (WGS) 1984 datum using a Real-time Kinematic (RTK) GPS with
    a spatial uncertainty of less than 2 cm (Fig. 1.). Flights were made weekly or
    fortnightly in 2016–2017, and thereafter with 1-to-3-month intervals in 2017–2018
    and 2018–2019, when the weather allowed, over the active cropping season of sugarcane
    to monitor the overall crop growth pattern in each cropping season. In the Australian
    region, sugarcane generally has four growth stages: germination or establishment,
    tillering, grand growth, and maturity or ripening [28]. However, the sugarcane
    establishment stage is excluded in this study since the crops were planted before
    the first data collection in November 2015. Therefore, we grouped each cropping
    season based on the availability of UAV images into two stages: Early (09, 19,
    and 27/January/2017, 20 and 28/February/2017, 06/February/2018, 31/January/2019,
    and 10/February/2019) and Middle (09, 17, and 27/March/2017, 13 and 24/April/2017,
    11/May/2017, 05/March/2018, 05/May/2018, 31/March/2019 and 27/April/2019), and
    investigated on which stage is optimal for predicting the crop yield at the harvest.
    Due to the equipment limitations and weather conditions, the number of images
    and the dates of acquisition are different each year. In order to reduce the error
    caused by the crop phenological changes in each stage of each year, the average
    values of estimated indicators from available UAV images at each growth stage
    were utilized. 2.3. Estimation of Vegetation Indices Prediction model development
    for crop yields highly depends on the selection of a sufficient subset of explanatory
    variables. A variety of remotely sensed data characteristics, such as spectral
    band reflectance, textural information, and VIs, can be employed to predict crop
    yield. Therefore, a selection of appropriate explanatory variables requires a
    thorough understanding of their strengths and limitations, following respective
    applications [29], [30]. We picked the most associated predictive VIs specific
    to sugarcane yield, including NDRE, GRNDVI, WDRVI, CCCI, and PNDVI, for this study
    based on the findings of our previous study [26], which was conducted in the exact
    location of 12 plots. The collected images were initially orthorectified and mosaiced
    using the Pix4Dmapper package and the automated processing template ''Ag Multispectral,''
    which is developed for image processing using photogrammetry and computer vision
    technologies. Utilizing ArcMap (version 10.8.1), the polygons of the selected
    plots were created, as shown in Fig. 1. For the 2016–2017, 2017–2018, and 2018–2019
    cropping seasons, the ArcToolbox zonal statistics tool was used to calculate the
    mean values of all pixels within each polygon. Following that, using the equations
    described in Table 2, the calculated mean values of each plot for five spectral
    UAV bands were used to derive the 5 VIs in each cropping season. Table 2. The
    applied vegetation indices in the present study. The abbreviations R, G, B, NIR,
    and RE stand for Red, Green, Blue, and Near Infrared, and RedEdge respectively.
    Vegetation Indices Formula Normalized Difference RedEdge (NDRE) Green Red NDVI
    (GRNDVI) Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) Canopy Chlorophyll Content
    Index (CCCI) Pan NDVI (PNDVI) Time-series NDVI observations of the seasonal variations
    of a vegetative canopy show that A change in plant leaf between green to yellow
    or red will not be detected by NDVI since it does not account for the green nor
    yellow reflectance when calculating NDVI [31]. Therefore, the Red reflectance
    in NDVI can be replaced with RedEdge, Green, Blue, or their combinations, to explore
    the valuable information in the visible spectral range. When it comes to demonstrating
    seasonal variations in crop growth with high temporal accuracy, GRNDVI, which
    is the balance of Green, NIR, and Red reflectance, is preferable to NDVI, since
    the green band used in GRNDVI is less affected by soil or background reflectance,
    making it more suitable for areas with dense vegetation [32]. It is possible to
    characterize physiological and phenological characteristics of crops with greater
    precision using WDRVI, which responds to Leaf Area Index (LAI) values from moderate
    to high by extending the dynamic range of bands that are used in the NDVI [33].
    NDRE is a variant of NDVI formulae as a useful metric for chlorophyll and LAI
    status [20]. This index, which employs the RedEdge band instead of the Red band,
    can be used to evaluate the crop health status in Middle to final crop growth
    stage with high chlorophyll content [34]. CCCI, which is based on NDVI and NDRE,
    utilizes a NIR spectrum, making it ideal for measuring nitrogen concentration.
    It has been used in past studies to quantify the quantity of nitrogen in crops
    to help manage nitrogen fertilizer and estimate crop yield [35], [36], [37]. PNDVI
    employs the sum of Blue, Red and Green bands instead of the Red band of NDVI.
    In general, the PNDVI is positively correlated with crop yield, as a higher PNDVI
    value indicates a higher level of vegetation health and density, which usually
    translates to higher crop productivity [38]. 2.4. Yield predictive models Predictive
    yield models were developed utilizing the final dataset generated by combining
    the five VIs and the measured sugarcane yield data for 48 polygon plots over three
    cropping seasons (Fig. 2.). Download : Download high-res image (639KB) Download

    develop ML models to predict the sugarcane yield. 13. 2.4.1. Random Forest regression
    The RF regression [41] technique has been widely used for the prediction of crop
    yields because of its capability to process high data dimensionality, robustness
    against overfitting, outlier identification, and ability to explore the input
    variable importance [37], [38]. The proposed RF regression algorithm approach
    is built on decision trees that are learned simultaneously and independently from
    each other, with the final prediction incorporating all of the findings from each
    tree [43]. Before data training through the RF regression, different combinations
    of the most significant RF hyperparameters, such as mtry, ntree, and node size,
    were investigated to tune the RF regression. mtry is the quantity of randomly
    picked variables that will be considered for each data split. A frequent recommendation
    for an mtry value is to start with 5 evenly spread integers across the range beginning
    from 2 [41]. The number of trees is represented by the term ntree. The larger
    the number of trees, the more accurately the RFR predicts; however, employing
    too many trees is needlessly inefficient, especially when dealing with huge data
    sets. Complexity in trees is controlled by node size, which determines how many
    samples are included within each terminal node. More complicated trees may be
    created with fewer nodes, but smaller nodes result in shallower trees [41]. We
    utilized the “ranger” function [44] within R Programming software [45] to do a
    comprehensive grid search over these three parameters and loop through each parameter
    combination to evaluate the model. 2.4.2. Support vector regression Support Vector
    Regression techniques are designed for data regression analysis as a supervised
    machine learning model. The goal of the SVR algorithm is to develop a hyperplane
    or a group of hyperplanes in an N-dimensional space, where N represents the number
    of variables in a dataset that might be utilized for regression problems [46].
    When dealing with regression in machine learning, the SVR algorithm attempts to
    identify the best fit hyperplane with the highest number of points. This algorithm
    has been popularly employed for crop yield prediction in recent years [40], [47],
    [48], [49], [50] since it identifies non-linearity in data in order to generate
    a more reliable and precise model. This algorithm has several advantages, including
    solid generalization capacity, high prediction accuracy, and ease of implementation.
    A few essential SVR hyperparameters should be established before proceeding. In
    the context of predicting a continuous output, a hyperplane is a decision line
    with which to function. Kernels are collections of mathematical functions used
    in the training phase to construct a mapping association between the input data
    of lower dimensions and the output data of higher dimensions [51]. Different kernel
    functions such as Linear, Gaussian, Quadradic, and Cubic are used to ensure that
    proper separation of the hyperplanes is obtained. In this study, the regression
    learner toolbox in MATLAB software was adopted to run the SVR models. Various
    hyperparameter combinations are modeled using this toolbox, and the optimal ones
    are chosen based on statistical indicators such as the R2 and RMSE. It also optimizes
    the Box constraints value, which is a parameter that helps to minimize overfitting,
    Epsilon value which is linked to the minimal prediction error that is ignored,
    and scale which is related to the width of the kernel function. 2.4.3. Artificial
    neural network Artificial Neural Network is among the most potent non-linear regression
    approaches in ML algorithms for crop yield prediction [52], [53]. Overfitting
    may occur during model training in rigid non-linear models such as the neural
    network, meaning that the model fits well with the training dataset but predicts
    poorly with the testing dataset. Therefore, a Non-linear Auto-Regressive network
    with exogenous inputs (NARX) with the Bayesian regularization backpropagation
    as training function was adopted in this study to avoid overfitting by minimizing
    the linear combination of squared errors and weights [54], [55], [56]. In prediction
    models for multivariable and non-linear data series, the efficacy of the dynamic
    neural network has been demonstrated to be the most reliable and efficient approach.
    There are numerous layers to the NARX, which is a recurrent dynamic network with
    feedback interconnections (backpropagation). This algorithm uses historical data
    input with time delay regulators and is improved by modifying hyperparameters
    such as the number of hidden neurons and delays, which were both established experimentally
    [57]. All data processing for the NARX ANN model in this study was performed within
    “ntstool” toolbox in MATLAB software. 2.5. Comparative analysis of the predictive
    models The performance of three ML models was evaluated using two indicators of
    prediction accuracy, namely R2 and RMSE. R2 can be interpreted as the fraction
    of variance explained by the provided predictor as seen in Equation (1). RMSE
    in Equation (2) estimates the measurement error. The larger the related errors,
    the larger the RMSE value will be. (1) (2) Here, indicates the predicted yield
    (t/ha), is the actual yield (t/ha), is the mean value of the actual yield, and
    n refers to the repetitions number. The models were assessed in terms of accuracy
    estimation of sugarcane yields by comparing the yield values obtained from the
    ML models with the observed yield values from the ground measurements. Each ML
    technique was conducted through 10-fold iterations by splitting the data by growing
    season into training and testing splits, thus the R2 and RMSE values demonstrate
    all iterations average and accuracy of the models. 2.6. Workflow As shown in Fig.
    2, the workflow for this study consists of the following steps: first, the yield
    data was collected from two crop growth stages, with a total of 384 and 480 observations
    for the early and middle stages, respectively. However, the imbalanced distribution
    of yield data among crop plots and cropping seasons (as shown in Table 1) could
    negatively impact the accuracy of the prediction model development. Therefore,
    an n-fold cross-validation strategy was employed to mitigate this issue by training
    and testing on historical datasets from the seasons 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 and
    evaluating the performance of the model using new data from the season 2018–2019.
    The first two cropping seasons (2016–2017 and 2017–2018) were used as the historical
    dataset for training and testing, while the last cropping season (2018–2019) was
    used as the validation dataset. Next, the historical dataset was divided into
    several folds for training and testing using a 10-fold cross-validation approach.
    Each fold was approximately the same size, and the method was repeated 10 times.
    Three ML methods, RFR, SVR, and NARX ANN, were then used to train the prediction
    models and test them on the remaining fold. The ML model performance was assessed
    by calculating two indicators of prediction accuracy, the R2 and RMSE. For each
    ML approach and each growth stage, the best-fitting model was selected. Finally,
    the most accurate ML model at the most appropriate growth stage was chosen. The
    developed prediction model''s reliability was ultimately assessed using the last
    cropping season data (2018–2019). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Parameter setting
    and yield predictive models The three ML model parameters were fine-tuned by testing
    different combinations of model hyperparameters. The top-performing model in terms
    of the RMSE and R2 results for each loop combination was chosen to pick the appropriate
    model hyperparameters (Table 3). The RF regression model parameters were fine-tuned
    by testing 64 different varieties of mtry, node size, and sample size. We loop
    over each parameter combination and apply 500 trees because the past examples
    showed that 500 trees were sufficient to obtain a steady error rate [41]. Also,
    for repeatability, we used the integer 123 as the seed for the random number generator.
    This allows us to sample the same observations consistently for each sample size,
    making the impact of each modification obvious. Table 3. The hyperparameters of

    the different methods, we found that the NARX ANN approach outperformed the two
    other approaches in both training and testing phases, achieving an R2 of greater
    than 0.72 and an RMSE of less than 7.09 tons per hectare while applying early-stage
    data, and an R2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 3.89 tons per hectare with the middle stage
    data (Table 6). In addition, Fig. 3 shows the agreement between the prediction
    and the observed sugarcane yields of different models that were developed using
    two cropping seasons (2016–2017 and 2017–2018). This Figure proved that the performance
    of the RFR, SVR and NARX ANN models was enhanced by considering the middle growth
    stage instead of the early stage, and the NARX ANN (Fig. 3e-f) outperformed the
    two other methods (Fig. 3a-d). The NARX ANN consistently predicted the yield data
    distribution, but the RFR overestimated low yield data and underestimated high
    yield data, which is a significant weakness. Download : Download high-res image

    improvements were observed in all three approaches, and the R2 was considerably
    increased and the RMSE was significantly decreased when the middle growth stage
    data was employed. Further, we evaluated the three ML models performance in the
    middle growth stage spanning from March to early May on the 2018–2019 cropping
    season dataset (Table 7). The results of the NARX ANN model (R2 = 0.96, and RMSE
    = 4.92) indicated that this approach would considerably contribute to yield modelling
    during the middle stage at the plot level, which is approximately 5 months before
    harvesting (August and September). During this growth stage, the sugarcane begins
    to transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, and therefore the crop is
    susceptible to environmental stress and climatic factors. Adding the meteorological
    factors such as rainfall and evaporation, minimum and maximum temperature, and
    sunlight hours would improve the model prediction capacity. Table 7. The predictive

    RFR 0.48 11.20 SVR 0.52 14.85 NARX ANN 0.96 4.92 Regarding the predictive variable
    selection, we evaluated the best-fitted model based on the application of 5 predictive
    variables (the NARX ANN model in the middle stage) on each VI separately. The
    most associated predictive variables in predicting sugarcane yield with the NARX
    ANN model (Table 7) were identified as the NDRE. This conclusion should influence
    the computational processing of the VI calculation since calculating one or two
    VIs consumes less effort than evaluating five VIs. In terms of the most sensitive
    spectral bands, Table 8 shows that the NARX ANN model is more susceptible to those
    predictor variables (NDRE, WDRVI, and CCCI) which include Red, NIR, and RedEdge
    spectral bands. This also suggests that the Blue and Green spectral bands involved
    in the PNDVI and GRNDVI were less relevant for modeling the sugarcane yield. The
    RedEdge spectral band could be utilized to minimize the impact of soil on the
    crop at the early crop growth stages, as well as saturation for later growth stages,
    according to Li et al. [58]. Table 8. The results of the NARX ANN model applied
    to March to early May data for each VI separately. Vegetation Index R2 RMSE (t/ha)
    NDRE 0.94 4.23 WDRVI 0.93 4.46 CCCI 0.92 4.59 PNDVI 0.90 5.25 GRNDVI 0.88 5.82
    All the above results confirm that the NARX ANN model shows the highest accuracy
    and reliability, while the RF model performed the lowest but with acceptable accuracy
    to predict the sugarcane yield at the plot level when treated with different levels
    of nitrogen. In conclusion, the best-suited model for predicting sugarcane yields
    during the middle growth stage is a NARX ANN model employing the NDRE. 3.2. Discussion
    By applying three ML methods, this study aimed to enhance sugarcane yield prediction
    models at the plot level, as compared to the past studies conducted at the block-
    or field level. For this purpose, 18 multispectral UAV images including five spectral
    bands were combined according to their growth stage. These spectral bands had
    concluded five VIs to infer the potential of RFR, SVR, and NARX ANN methods to
    predict sugarcane yields. In this study, the following research questions were
    supposed to be investigated: 1) How can an ML approach be associated with high-resolution
    UAV imaging data for predicting sugarcane yields at the plot level? and 2) What
    growth stage is the optimal time for predicting future sugarcane yields? The complex
    correlation between sugarcane yields and VIs as predictive variables complicates
    the construction of a yield prediction model using basic linear regression models
    [10]. The MLR model has been applied by Rahman and Robson [2], [7] to predict
    sugarcane yields in Bundaberg, Queensland, using two different RS data sets. Although
    integrating the Sentinel datasets with time-series Landsat data improved the accuracy
    of the prediction model from R2 = 0.69 and RMSE 4.2 (t/ha) to R2 = 0.87 and RMSE
    11.33 (t/ha), it is still not comparable to the NARX ANN results in this study
    (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE 4.92 (t/ha)). In this study, the ML models were employed to
    predict sugarcane yields due to their capability to handle the non-linear complications
    caused by the meteorological and environmental impacts, cropping system, and fertilizer
    treatments. Extensive studies have also evaluated the efficiency of the RFR and
    SVR models in predicting crop yield [59], [60], [61], but to the extent of our
    knowledge, no previous study has focused on sugarcane yields at the plot level
    using the UAV dataset and evaluated these two most common ML models with the NARX
    ANN model. For example, Wang et al. [60] conducted a comparison of these two ML
    approaches with statistical methods to predict crop yield, although such an analysis
    was undertaken at the country level in winter wheat in the United States. On sugarcane
    fields located in north-east Queensland of Australia, researchers applied four
    ML models, including RFR, Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Trees (ET), and Extreme
    Gradient Boosting (XGB) [59]. However, the methodology was examined on satellite
    data such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery at the field level. We examined
    and fine-tuned each ML model based on its unique hyperparameters and different
    data splits. The 10-fold cross-validation method was also employed to guarantee
    that the training and testing sets were near to the population set''s distribution
    and that the prediction accuracy was consistent. We evaluated the final prediction
    models of the RFR, SVR, and NARX ANN generated from the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018
    datasets on the 2018–2019 dataset to eliminate the influence of the model training
    set on the model evaluation. To some extent, this reduced the probability of case-specific
    outcomes and overfitting while also improving the model''s transferability [39].
    For the middle growth stage from March to early May, the accuracy and reliability
    of the sugarcane yield prediction model based on the NARX ANN model were higher
    than those of the models based on the SVR and RFR algorithms (Table 6). This could
    be attributed to the NARX ANN''s ability to handle non-linear and dynamic input
    data, such as meteorological and environmental impacts, cropping system, and fertilizer
    treatments, and its ability to model the dependence of current inputs and outputs
    on past inputs and outputs [56], [62], [63], [64]. As a result of different nitrogen
    fertilizers, the yield data collected for individual sugarcane plots at each growth
    stage was not evenly distributed. Previous research examined the performance of
    the model for one single or whole growth period of the same nitrogen variety to
    minimize the impact of the growth period and nitrogen status on the model comparison
    [63], [66]. Filtering crop data based on nitrogen fertilizer type, on the other
    hand, lowers the number of observations, which may influence model performance.
    Furthermore, most of the time, the amount or type of fertilizer used was unknown
    in that study. In this study, we gathered multispectral images and field measurements
    from 48 crop plots with different nitrogen fertilizer treatments. Therefore, the
    models developed here based on this data can be regarded as an efficient and practical
    method of estimating sugarcane yield without any background knowledge of the applied
    nitrogen fertilizer, and in the future, they could well be considered as a generic
    approach for any variety of nitrogen fertilizer. The remarkable accuracy of the
    ML approach for predicting sugarcane yield using high-resolution UAV images could
    allow for a better understanding of the spatial variability within-plot of yield
    across the season as a piece of critical information to agricultural management
    strategies. This study only focused on the Bundaberg district of Queensland, Australia
    to correlate the sugarcane yields with the UAV imagery at the plot level. Further
    research is needed to assess the technique''s capacity to monitor the spatial
    variability of sugarcane yield in various sites at different sugarcane types.
    4. Conclusion This study demonstrated the potential of using high spatial resolution
    UAV data in conjunction with advanced ML models for predicting sugarcane yields.
    Among the three ML models presented, the NARX ANN model predicted sugarcane yield
    with R2 > 0.92 and an RMSE < 3.89 t/ha in the early and middle growth stages.
    It was also found that sugarcane yield was well predicted based on the NARX ANN
    model around the middle crop growth stage spanning from March and early May. This
    is useful for crop yield prediction at a particular growth stage of a cropping
    season and allows us to inform harvest programs, transportation, and milling before
    harvesting. The proposed method''s reliability in prediction may be affected by
    data inconsistency, as the availability of UAV data in different cropping seasons
    could not be synchronized, and therefore further verification of the method''s
    consistency through additional cropping seasons with synchronized UAV data availability
    across all months is suggested. Declaration of Competing Interest Acknowledgement  The

  description: 'Purpose: The main objective of the work was to investigate the perception
    of rural producers in the municipality of Guaíba, Rio Grande do Sul state, in
    relation to the implementation of precision agriculture (PA), in order to verify
    the difficulties and benefits of the implementation of this practice in rural
    life. Originality/value: PA technology is increasingly present in the planting
    process, enabling productivity improvement, lower environmental impact, and rural
    development, an area of fundamental economic importance for the country. Understanding
    the perception of the farmers in relation to PA can generate important insights,
    allowing for successful implementations of that technology. Design/methodology/approach:
    The research was carried out based on semi-structured interviews. Thus, information
    was obtained on the perceptions of each farmer in the face of digital transformation
    in the field and the obstacles encountered in the practices of such technology.
    Data collection was carried out with five farmers in the municipality of Guaíba.
    Subsequently, the data were analyzed using the content analysis technique, in
    its variant of propositional discourse analysis. Findings: The results show that,
    despite all the technological apparatus, there are challenges to be overcome in
    the face of the implementation of digital agriculture. Among the difficulties
    mentioned, the complexity of the systems – a fact not yet reported in theory –,
    lack of qualified personnel, cost of machinery, dependence on the climate, and
    difficulties in accessing the internet stand out. Benefits of the implementation
    of PA were also pointed out, such as the lower use of inputs, the better harvest
    yield, the improvement in the farmer’s technical knowledge, and the possibility
    of adapting the existing machinery, which, contradictorily, was also pointed out
    as being a difficulty.'

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Dubai, United Arab Emirates SECTION I. Introduction
    A. Background information on Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Computing
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology that enables machines
    to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception,
    reasoning, learning, and decision-making [1] –[3]. AI has been applied to a wide
    range of applications, including natural language processing, image recognition,
    robotics, and autonomous vehicles [3]. In recent years, AI has also been recognized
    as a powerful tool for addressing environmental and sustainability challenges.
    It has the potential to significantly improve the sustainability of computing
    systems [4], [5]. AI technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing,
    and robotics can help optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and enhance resource
    efficiency [6]. Sustainable Computing, on the other hand, is the design, development,
    and use of computing systems that are environmentally friendly, socially responsible,
    and economically viable [7]. Several studies have explored the intersection of
    AI and Sustainable Computing. For instance, this paper [2], explores the intersection
    of sustainable energy and AI, and the emergence of the concept of sustainable
    AI in response to the ethical concerns surrounding AI’s potential negative impact
    on society and the environment. The authors propose a new approach to contextual
    topic modeling, which combines different clustering techniques, to identify the
    main scholarly topics, sub-themes, and cross-topic themes within the field of
    sustainable AI in the context of energy. The paper also employs content analysis
    of relevant scientific publications to provide a comprehensive overview of the
    scholarly discourse on sustainable AI in energy. The study seeks to advance the
    understanding of sustainable AI in energy and to identify key research areas that
    can promote the development of sustainable AI solutions for energy. In another
    study, Waltersmann et al [8] examined the use of AI in improving resource efficiency
    in manufacturing companies. The authors analyzed 70 papers focusing on AI tasks,
    methods, and their impact on resource efficiency. They noted that the typical
    AI use cases include predictive maintenance, production planning, fault detection,
    quality prediction, and increased energy efficiency. They suggested more research
    in Green AI and considering sustainability in the development and use of AI solutions
    Other studies explain that digitization is an increasingly popular tool for improving
    the economic, environmental, and social performance of the industrial sector.
    By integrating information technology in general and AI in particular into manufacturing
    systems, sustainability performance can be enhanced by improving production efficiency,
    minimizing waste, and reducing the negative environmental impact [9], [10]. Digitization
    also has the potential to create safer and more comfortable working conditions,
    making it a key step toward a sustainable future for the industry [9]. According
    to a different research article, the utilization of AI could aid in creating culturally
    appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to decrease the
    natural resource and energy intensity of human activities [11]. Nevertheless,
    the authors contend that the genuine potential of AI is not just in lessening
    the intensities of energy, water, and land use, but in promoting and facilitating
    environmental governance on a larger scale. However, there are also challenges
    in implementing AI-based solutions for Sustainable Computing. [12] emphasized
    the need for ethical and responsible AI applications to avoid unintended consequences
    and ensure equitable outcomes. In another study, the authors present a thorough
    computational analysis of trustworthy AI [13]. Their research delves into six
    pivotal aspects of trustworthy AI: safety and robustness, nondiscrimination and
    fairness, explainability, privacy, accountability and auditability, and environmental
    well-being. The study examines contemporary technologies associated with each
    aspect, as well as their application in real-life systems. Overall, the literature
    suggests that AI has the potential to significantly improve the sustainability
    of computing systems, but at the same time, it is important to address the ethical
    and social implications and ensure responsible and equitable AI applications.
    B. Purpose of the paper The purpose of this paper is to explore the intersection
    of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Sustainable Computing and examine how AI can
    be leveraged to address sustainability challenges while improving the efficiency
    and effectiveness of computing systems. The paper reviews current research in
    the field such as [1], [2], [4] -[6], identifies key opportunities and challenges
    [11], [14], [15], and then proposes a governance framework for responsible and
    ethical AI applications in sustainable computing. The paper also highlights potential
    future directions for research and development in this emerging field. C. Research
    questions and objectives The following research questions guide this study. The
    study aims to explore the potential of AI to enhance the sustainability of computing
    systems while addressing the ethical and social implications of using this technology.
    To accomplish this, the following research questions have been formulated: How
    can AI be effectively utilized to enhance the sustainability of computing systems?
    What are the ethical and social considerations that must be addressed when implementing
    AI-based solutions in sustainable computing? What challenges must be overcome
    to implement AI-based solutions in sustainable computing effectively? The objectives
    of this study are as follows: To identify the opportunities and challenges associated
    with leveraging AI to tackle sustainability challenges in computing systems. To
    evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability impact of AI-based solutions for
    sustainable computing. To propose a governance framework that ensures the responsible
    and ethical application of AI in sustainable computing, taking into account ethical,
    social, and environmental considerations. This study makes a significant contribution
    to the knowledge about how AI can effectively tackle sustainability challenges
    in computing systems. Moreover, it offers valuable insights and guidance for the
    responsible and ethical application of AI in sustainable computing through the
    introduction of a robust governance framework. This framework can serve as a model
    for ensuring that AI-based solutions align with ethical and sustainable practices,
    ultimately driving positive impacts on the environment and society. SECTION II.
    Literature Review A. Overview of AI and Sustainable Computing Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Sustainable Computing are two rapidly evolving fields of research that
    have the potential to significantly impact society and the environment. AI is
    the development of computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence,
    such as perception, reasoning, and learning, while Sustainable Computing focuses
    on optimizing energy efficiency, reducing e-waste, and minimizing the carbon footprint
    of computing systems. One of the primary applications of AI in Sustainable Computing
    is energy management. AI can help reduce energy consumption in data centers and
    improve the efficiency of cooling systems, reducing overall carbon emissions [16],
    [17]. Another area where AI is being applied is in transportation, where intelligent
    transportation systems can optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion, thereby
    reducing greenhouse gas emissions [18]. The incorporation of AI into Sustainable
    Computing presents not only benefits but also significant ethical and societal
    concerns. Specifically, the utilization of AI in decision-making processes may
    result in unintentional biases and discrimination, with the potential to disproportionately
    affect marginalized groups, including those defined by race and gender. An example
    of such an issue is the use of AI algorithms to predict the likelihood of criminal
    behavior [19]. Furthermore, the increasing automation of jobs through AI can lead
    to job displacement, particularly in industries where repetitive tasks can be
    automated [20]. To ensure the responsible use of AI for sustainability, it is
    crucial to address these ethical and social issues. This includes developing ethical
    guidelines and regulations for the development and deployment of AI systems in
    Sustainable Computing [21]. It also involves ensuring that AI systems are transparent
    and explainable so that stakeholders can understand the decision-making processes
    and identify potential biases [22]. Overall, AI and Sustainable Computing hold
    significant promise for addressing sustainability challenges while improving the
    efficiency and effectiveness of computing systems. However, to realize this potential,
    it is important to balance the benefits with the ethical and social considerations
    involved in the development and deployment of AI systems. B. Impact of AI on Sustainable
    Computing The integration of AI in sustainable computing has the potential to
    significantly reduce energy consumption, carbon emissions, and other environmental
    impacts of computing systems and networks [2], [23]. For example, AI can be used
    to optimize data center operations, such as cooling and power management, and
    to enable dynamic load balancing to reduce energy waste. AI can also be used to
    enhance the efficiency of renewable energy systems, such as wind and solar power,
    by predicting their output and optimizing their operation [24]. C. Applications
    of AI in Sustainable Computing AI has numerous applications in sustainable computing,
    such as energy-efficient computing, smart buildings, and green transportation.
    In energy-efficient computing, AI can be used to optimize power consumption, reduce
    carbon emissions, and improve system reliability [2]. In smart buildings, AI can
    be used to control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems,
    lighting, and other devices to improve energy efficiency and occupant comfort
    [4], [5], [25]. In green transportation, AI can be used to optimize traffic flow,
    reduce congestion, and improve fuel efficiency [18]. D. Case Studies of AI and
    Sustainable Computing in Practice Several case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness
    of AI in sustainable computing. For instance, Google''s DeepMind AI system has
    been used to optimize the cooling systems of its data centers, resulting in a
    40% reduction in energy consumption [26]. The city of Barcelona has implemented
    an AI-powered smart lighting system that adjusts street lighting levels based
    on real-time data to reduce energy consumption by 30% [27]. The company Tesla
    has integrated AI into its electric vehicles to improve their energy efficiency
    and range. In addition, they are currently developing a \"scalable hierarchical
    energy distribution grid\" technology to revolutionize the distribution of solar
    power within the electric grid [28]. E. Opportunities and Challenges and Limitations
    of AI in Sustainable Computing The integration of AI with sustainable computing
    offers significant opportunities for reducing environmental impact, optimizing
    resource utilization, and enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of computing
    systems. For example, [29] reviewed the potential of AI in the healthcare sector,
    and suggested five fundamental elements that can serve as a roadmap for creating
    and applying AI-driven healthcare technologies that are ethical, sustainable,
    and inclusive, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Other
    studies conducted systematic reviews of AI applications in sustainable energy
    systems and highlighted the potential of AI for enhancing renewable energy integration,
    demand-side management, and energy efficiency [2], [16]. However, the adoption
    of AI in sustainable computing also poses various challenges. One challenge is
    the high computational and energy requirements of AI algorithms, which can offset
    the energy savings achieved by their implementation [30]. Another challenge is
    the lack of standardization and interoperability of AI systems, which can hinder
    their integration with existing computing infrastructure [11]. Additionally, there
    are ethical and social implications of AI, such as privacy concerns and the potential
    for AI systems to exacerbate existing inequalities [5]. Several other studies
    have also identified challenges in implementing AI for sustainable computing,
    including data security concerns, ethical issues, and social implications [6],
    [11], [15]. SECTION III. Methodology A. Research Design This study uses a cross-sectional
    survey design to collect data on the perceptions and practices of AI and sustainable
    computing among professionals in the field [31], [32]. Cross-sectional surveys
    are widely used in social science research to gather data on the characteristics,
    attitudes, and behaviors of a population at a specific point in time [33]. In
    the context of this study, a cross-sectional survey is being used to collect data
    on the perceptions and practices of AI and sustainable computing among professionals
    in the field. This is consistent with the use of cross-sectional surveys in other
    studies that seek to understand the perceptions and behaviors of professionals
    [34], [35]. In order to establish the credibility and consistency of the survey
    tool, this study incorporated pre-testing with a group of professionals in the
    relevant field, as suggested by previous research [36], [37]. Furthermore, to
    obtain both quantitative and qualitative data, the study utilized a combination
    of closed-ended and open-ended questions in the survey, which is a recommended
    approach [38]. B. Data Collection and Analysis The data collection and analysis
    process started with the distribution of the survey through email invitations
    to a targeted sample of professionals in the field. The sample was chosen based
    on their experience and expertise in AI and sustainable computing and included
    individuals from academia, industry, and government organizations. The survey
    was designed to gather information on participants'' perceptions of the use of
    AI in sustainable computing, as well as their experiences and opinions on the
    impact, applications, and challenges of AI in the field. This study utilized a
    survey instrument that contained questions designed to investigate the perceptions
    and practices of AI and sustainable computing among the participants. The survey
    covered a broad range of topics, including the current state of AI and sustainable
    computing, the benefits and challenges associated with AI in sustainable computing,
    as well as the ethical and social implications of AI in sustainable computing.
    The survey was distributed to a sample of professionals in the field (N=82), and
    the response rate was approximately 59%, resulting in 48 responses. Of these,
    six were incomplete and therefore considered invalid, leaving us with 42 valid
    responses. Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and percentages, were utilized
    to analyze the data and gain insight into the current trends and practices in
    the field. C. Some of the Survey questions and sample answers We conducted a survey

    in this study was evaluated for its validity and reliability using established
    methods in survey research [40]. The instrument was pre-tested with a small sample
    of professionals (5 participants) in the field to ensure its validity and reliability,
    and adjustments were made based on their feedback. The survey was also reviewed
    by experts in the field to ensure its face validity. Face validity here refers
    to the extent to which the survey instrument appears to be a valid measure of
    the construct it intends to measure. To assess the internal and external validity
    of the survey findings, several steps were taken. First, the sample was carefully
    chosen to ensure that it represented a diverse range of professionals in the field.
    Second, the survey questions were carefully crafted to ensure that they accurately
    captured the participants'' perceptions and practices of AI and sustainable computing.
    Finally, the statistical methods used for data analysis were carefully selected
    to ensure that they were appropriate for the data collected and the research questions
    being addressed [39]. SECTION IV. Results and Discussion A. Findings of the research
    The survey of 42 professionals in the field yielded several important findings
    regarding their perceptions and practices of AI and sustainable computing. First,
    respondents generally viewed AI as a valuable tool for promoting sustainability,
    with 36 participants (around 86%) indicating that AI had the potential to significantly
    improve sustainability outcomes. However, there were also concerns about the environmental
    impact of AI, with 26 participants (around 62%) of respondents expressing some
    level of concern about the energy consumption of AI systems. These findings highlight
    the importance of incorporating sustainability considerations into AI development
    and deployment. Based on the comprehensive literature review conducted during
    this study, we found it necessary to develop a framework to guide the development
    and deployment of ethical and socially responsible AI in sustainable computing.
    Our review identified several ethical and social challenges associated with AI
    in sustainable computing, underscoring the need for a systematic approach to address
    them. Therefore, we propose a framework that emphasizes the key principles of
    transparency and comprehensibility, bias mitigation, privacy and data security,
    social impact assessment, human oversight, and adherence to ethical guidelines
    and governance frameworks. The framework, as shown in Figure 1 serves as a tool
    to help ensure that AI solutions for sustainable computing are developed and deployed
    responsibly and ethically. The following are the main points in the proposed governance
    framework: Transparency and comprehensibility are crucial for AI algorithms used
    in sustainable computing to be transparent and explainable to stakeholders. This
    encompasses disclosing the data used to train the algorithms, the methods used
    for data collection, and the criteria used for decision-making. Such transparency
    and explainability foster trust and accountability in the use of AI for sustainability.
    Bias mitigation is vital for AI algorithms used in sustainable computing to be
    designed to mitigate bias and discrimination. This involves identifying and removing
    biases in the data used to train the algorithms, ensuring diverse representation
    in the data, and regularly monitoring for bias and discrimination. Privacy and
    data security are important for AI algorithms used in sustainable computing to
    prioritize the protection of privacy and data security. This includes implementing
    appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data, obtaining informed consent
    for data collection and use, and ensuring that data is only used for its intended
    purposes. Social impact assessment is essential for AI algorithms used in sustainable
    computing to undergo a social impact assessment to evaluate the potential social
    impacts on stakeholders. This includes assessing the potential impact on jobs,
    communities, and individuals, and implementing measures to mitigate negative impacts.
    Human oversight is critical for AI algorithms used in sustainable computing to
    have human oversight to ensure that decisions made by AI are fair, just, and aligned
    with social values. This includes providing opportunities for stakeholders to
    provide feedback and review AI decisions. Lastly, ethical guidelines and governance
    are necessary for AI algorithms used in sustainable computing to adhere to ethical
    guidelines and governance frameworks to ensure the responsible and ethical use
    of AI. This includes developing codes of conduct and ethical guidelines for the
    use of AI in sustainable computing, and establishing governance structures to
    oversee the use of AI. The following diagram could be a helpful way to visually
    represent the six considerations of the framework: Fig. 1. The Proposed Governance
    Framework. Show All B. Implications of the results The findings of this study
    have several implications for the field of sustainable computing. For example,
    the high level of interest in using AI to promote sustainability suggests that
    there may be opportunities for collaboration between AI researchers and sustainability
    experts. However, the concerns about the environmental impact of AI highlight
    the need for continued research into ways to make AI systems more energy-efficient
    and sustainable. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of the suggested
    governance framework for the ethical and socially responsible use of AI in sustainable
    computing. The high level of interest in using AI to promote sustainability emphasizes
    the need to incorporate sustainability considerations into AI development and
    deployment. Collaboration between AI researchers and sustainability experts can
    also be enhanced by implementing the proposed governance framework, which includes
    transparency and comprehensibility, bias mitigation, privacy and data security,
    social impact assessment, human oversight, and adherence to ethical guidelines
    and governance frameworks. Additionally, continued research into ways to make
    AI systems more energy-efficient and sustainable is necessary to address concerns
    about the environmental impact of AI. C. Discussion of the research questions
    and objectives The findings of this study provide insights into all of the research
    questions and objectives outlined at the beginning of the study. For example,
    the opportunities and challenges associated with leveraging AI to tackle sustainability
    challenges in computing systems were identified. Similarly, the ethical and social
    considerations that must be addressed when implementing AI-based solutions in
    sustainable computing were also listed and explained. Overall, the findings of
    this study suggest that while AI has significant potential to promote sustainability,
    there are also important environmental and social considerations that must be
    taken into account when developing and deploying AI systems. A summary of these
    considerations was explained in section [IV-A] and listed in Figure-1. SECTION

    Rapid population growth and economic prosperity among other factors are exacerbating
    existing water stress in the east and southeast regions of England, hence, the
    water sector is increasingly shifting focus from the expansion of water sources
    and increased abstraction to demand-side management (DSM) strategies aimed at
    improving household water efficiency and reducing per capita consumption. A crucial
    component of water DSM strategy is a good understanding of household water use
    patterns and the myriad factors that influence them. Smart metering, conflated
    with innovative techniques and groundbreaking ancillaries continue to support
    DSM strategies by providing quasi-real-time data, offering powerful insights into
    household water consumption patterns and delivering behaviour-changing feedback
    to consumers. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state
    of household water consumption and their determinants as reported in the literature.
    The paper also reviews the methods and techniques for measuring and understanding
    consumption patterns and discuss prominent DSM instruments utilised in the household
    water demand sector globally along with their relative impact on per capita consumption
    (PCC). The review concludes that while disaggregation remains a very effective
    means of revealing consumption patterns at micro-component levels, the process
    is time-consuming and costly, relying on high-resolution data, specific hardware
    and software combination, making it difficult to incorporate into the utility’s
    routine DSM framework. A future research is proposed, that may focus on an alternative,
    scalable consumption pattern recognition approach that can easily be incorporated
    into the utility’s DSM strategy using medium resolution smart-meter data. Previous

    managementWater consumptionSensors 1. Introduction Current water demand in England
    and Wales has reached unsustainable levels (Dobson et al., 2020; Grecksch, 2019).
    This is dominated by household water demand, constituting 55% of the 32 Cubic
    Gigametres per year (Gm3/yr) total UK household water consumption footprint (HR
    Wallingford, 2015; Lawson et al., 2018). The southeast region (including London)
    does not only have the highest household water consumption in England and Wales,
    – 9% higher than the UK average – but is also one of the driest, with dwindling
    aquifer recharge, unsustainable abstraction rates and the highest susceptibility
    to frequent, severe and long drought events (DEFRA, 2008; Environmental Agency,
    2008; Ofwat, 2016; Lawson et al., 2018; Southeast Water, 2018). Consequently,
    the southeast has been classified by the Environment Agency as significantly water-stressed
    (Environment_Agency, 2008). Currently, 18 million people live in this region,
    with a 35% share of the UK total gross disposable household income (GDHI), making
    it also the most populous and affluent region (ONS, 2016). The UK is projected
    to see population growth above 10 million people over the next 20–30 years, with
    an increase of 41–50% expected in the most water-stressed regions, (Lawson et
    al., 2018; Environmental Agency, 2008). This would severely exacerbate the water-stress
    situation by adding in excess of half a trillion litres (L) per annum to cater
    for demand (Lawson et al., 2018). Moreover, the southeast continues to enjoy an
    unparalleled upsurge in economic prosperity (Hope, 2018) which has a positive
    correlation with per capita consumption (PCC). The introduction of mandatory demand-side
    management (DSM) policies along with ambitious water efficiency standards for
    new builds (Lawson et al., 2018; Waterwise, 2017), including running retrofitting
    schemes for existing properties (approximately 90,000 retrofits have been carried
    out across the South East region between 2017 and 2018), are gradually driving
    down PCC from 150 l/p/d in 2008 to 141 l/p/d in 2018 (DEFRA, 2008; Lawson et al.,
    2018; DEFRA, 2019). Notwithstanding these achievements, consumption, is beginning
    to rise again, especially in unmetered households, which consume around 30 l/p/d
    more than metered households (Waterwise, 2016). This is largely due to the disproportionate
    rise in population and affluence among other factors (Grecksch, 2019). Currently,
    PCC in the southeast is 146 l/p/d with unmetered properties recording as high
    as 170 l/p/d (Southeast_Water, 2018). Progression in meter penetration in certain
    areas is helping to drive down PCC where it is estimated to achieve a reduction
    of about 15%, which makes it one of the most effective instruments (WWT, 2019).
    However, as water demand is determined by a multitude of factors such as climate
    and household characteristics (Willis et al., 2011; Fielding et al., 2012), more
    needs to be done in terms of deploying DSM responses by the specificity of the
    factors that influence demand and the desired impact (Inman and Jeffrey, 2006).
    For example, in the case of the southeast, devising instruments that specifically
    target sociodemographic or socioeconomic determinants such as population growth
    and affluence will yield better outcomes than relying on metering alone. Furthermore,
    instruments used during drought conditions should vary significantly from those
    used to drive down PCC in normal situations (Anderson et al., 2018; Kayaga and
    Smout, 2011). Lastly, behaviour-targeting instruments would be more effective
    in unmetered households, where average PCC is 13% (about 30 L) more than in metered
    homes (DEFRA, 2018; Environment_Agency, 2008; Waterwise, 2016). The UK water legislation
    (Legislation.gov.uk, 2014) sets the grounds for long-term water resource planning
    and recommends the provision of a range of measures to sustainably manage water
    resources to improve household water use efficiency, reduce aggregate demand and
    reduce the pressure on water resources. The building regulations of England and
    Wales (2015) has stipulated that all new residential buildings must be to a standard
    water consumption of 125 l/p/d or 110 l/p/d for water-stressed areas. The responsibility
    for the implementation of water efficiency rests with water companies. However,
    compared to energy, national effort to achieve water efficiency is lacking in
    sufficiency and coherence as each company adopts different approaches (National
    Audit Office, 2020). Reviews by Cominola et al. (2015), House-Peters and Chang
    (2011), Inman and Jeffrey (2006) and many more over the years have demonstrated
    how DSM policies are multifaceted and heavily influenced by several factors including
    geographical, seasonal, political, social, cultural, technical and economic variables.
    Renwick and Green (2000) and Inman and Jeffrey (2006) both conclude that price-related
    policies in summer have greater success in communities with larger landscaped
    areas, while restrictive policies such as outdoor bans are better at achieving
    a reduction in aggregate demand during droughts. Willis et al. (2009) and Gonzales
    and Ajami (2015) underscored the profound influence that society and community
    attitudes have on the effectiveness of DSM strategies. Similarly, reviews on end
    use (micro-component) analysis have elaborated on myriad methods and techniques
    of quantifying household water consumption through disaggregation (e.g. Blokker
    et al., 2017; Cominola et al., 2015; House-Peters and Chang, 2011) with some going
    into factors influencing consumption (e.g. Arbués et al., 2003; Bich-Ngoc and
    Teller, 2018; Parker and Wilby, 2013; Russell and Fielding, 2010). However, there
    are no reviews that provide a profound meta-analysis of DSM strategies, consumption
    determinants and measurements, all in one place. Also, previous reviews on end-use
    characterisation did not draw a clear distinction between flow-trace and sensor-based
    methods. There is also the need for a review that makes DSM recommendations based
    on the specificity of the factors that influence household consumption and aggregate
    demand. This paper is intended to provide water planners with an up-to-date overview
    of methods and techniques of measuring and ascertaining household water consumption
    patterns and practices in household water demand management to assist in choosing
    an appropriate combination of strategies to address water demand issues. It begins
    with a comprehensive review of the processes of end use analysis, with particular
    emphasis on flow trace and sensor-based approaches, and presents an integrated
    data collection method for measuring and quantifying household water consumption
    to support the delivery of effective DSM instruments. Secondly, it reviews the
    determinants of household water consumption and water demand, followed by the
    most prominent DSM instruments utilised in the household water sector along with
    their respective strengths and weaknesses as reported in the literature. It then
    presents a list of determinant-driven DSM instruments along with their potential
    impact on PCC. Finally, the paper proposes future research path to provide an
    alternative, cost-effective and scalable consumption pattern analysis using medium
    resolution smart-meter data. 2. Research method The “Preferred Reporting Items
    for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)” inclusion and exclusion criteria
    for the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analysis was adopted in the acquisition
    of materials for this review (Liberati et al., 2009). The Prisma flow diagram
    (Fig. 1) illustrates the flow of records identified, included and excluded through
    the different phases of a systematic review. Although this review was carried
    out in the context of finding a solution for the water stress problem in the southeast
    of England, materials were obtained globally, from a variety of high impact journals,
    studies, reports and proceedings. The inspiration for the two key components of
    this review namely, water demand-side management strategies and water end use
    measurement, came from the two highly-cited works of Inman and Jeffrey (2006)
    and Giurco et al. (2008) respectively. Keywords with a focus on household water
    demand such as “demand-side management instruments” and “water conservation” were
    obtained from Inman and Jeffrey (2006) while keywords with a focus on water consumption
    measurement such as “micro-components”, “end use analysis”, “smart meters” and
    “data-loggers” were chosen from and Giurco et al. (2008). Giurco et al. (2008)
    explained that “micro-component” and “end use” mean the same, with the former
    being more widely used in the UK while the latter being the most widely used globally.
    A purposive keyword search was executed with the view to identifying relevant
    literature on the important constituents of household water demand management
    strategies and the different means of measuring and quantifying household water
    consumption. This was carried out through Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct,
    Mendeley, ResearchGate and IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink and Semantic Scholar databases
    leading to the identification of 950 journals and conference papers. A further
    204 white papers and technical reports were identified through other web sources.
    Following the PRISMA guidelines, materials were screened and assessed for eligibility
    using certain inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig. 1), resulting in 150 articles
    being included in the review consisting of 96 journals, 20 conference papers,
    31 technical papers and 3 book sections (Table 1). Download : Download high-res

    measurement processes End use (or micro-components) is the term used in water
    demand-side study to refer to such specific water use events as having a shower,
    watering the garden, toilet and clothes washing (Giurco et al., 2008; Kowalski
    and Marshallsay, 2005). End use analysis usually starts with data capture processes,
    data transfer and data analysis tools, as illustrated in Table 2: Table 2. End
    use measurement processes. Data Capture processes Data transfer Data analysis
    This is the primary enabler of the collection of water usage data from households.
    It includes meters, data loggers and fixture and appliance sensors. Other methods
    such as consumer surveys and the use of logbooks and diaries can play a pivotal
    role in water consumption and behavioural data collection. Technologies used for
    the transfer of data facilitate data correction and delivery from the primary
    data collection device such as a meter or data logger to a data processing site.
    This is done manually in the case of traditional meters (Tavares et al., 2018),
    or automatically in the case of Automatic Meter Reading/Advanced Metering Infrastructure
    (AMR/AMI) meters (Boyle et al., 2013; Pericli and Jenkins, 2015). Data analysis
    technologies are used to process and disaggregate the usage data from meters and
    data loggers into end use events, typically using pattern recognition and machine
    learning algorithms (Makki et al., 2013). 3.2. Primary usage data Traditionally,
    the primary source of household water usage data is water meters (Willis et al.,
    2013). The temporal resolution of the data obtained differs significantly depending
    on the generation of meter used to collect the data — from monthly to yearly intervals
    with ordinary manually read (‘dumb’) meters (Sønderlund et al., 2016) to smart
    meters capable of generating real-time or near real-time usage data (Cole and
    Stewart, 2013; Nguyen et al., 2018a). Some of the more modern generations of ordinary
    meters have Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) technology, which allows remote meter
    reading and data transfer (Pericli and Jenkins, 2015). Most traditional meters,
    however, have significant limitations (Pericli and Jenkins, 2015), making them
    unsuitable for consumption measurement without being linked to data loggers (Giurco
    et al., 2008). Data loggers allow for the constant reading of water consumption
    by recording a pulse generated by a meter which can either be accessed by downloading
    the data directly from the logger manually or remotely (Giurco et al., 2008; Nguyen
    et al., 2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b) data loggers were attached to the pulse output
    of household water meters to record flows at specified resolutions. The flow data
    was transformed into a high-resolution flow trace, which was then disaggregated
    into temporal end use events with flow rate and volume attributes, using a pattern-recognition
    algorithm. A smart water meter is essentially a traditional water meter, but with
    data logging and data transfer capabilities added. These meters, which normally
    work by recording captured pulses representing a specific volume of water over
    time, and enables data transfer via a two-way communication channel (Giurco et
    al., 2008). This is a feature of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), an
    extension of the current one-way communication AMR technology and it enables the
    flow of data between the meter and utilities and vice versa (Boyle et al., 2013).
    AMI technology is also capable of analysing water consumption data and then communicating
    this information back to the water consumer via the internet at variable intervals
    (Nguyen et al., 2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b; Accenture, 2010). 3.3. End use analysis
    Many utility studies have emphasised the importance of disaggregating usage to
    a specific end use and/or appliance level (Carrie Armel et al., 2013) in order
    to gain a true record of consumption (Giurco et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2013a,
    Nguyen et al., 2013b), to isolate end uses responsible for the highest consumption
    and to identify and classify pivotal consumption behavioural patterns attributable
    to household groups (Ellert et al., 2016). A plethora of tools and methods have
    been utilised in end use analysis (Nguyen et al., 2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b;
    Bennett et al., 2013; Cole and Stewart, 2013; Kalogridis et al., 2015; Nguyen
    et al., 2015; Vašak et al., 2015; Ellert et al., 2016), the most prominent of
    these methods include flow trace-based analysis and sensor-based analysis. Most
    flow trace-based approaches rely on pattern matching and machine learning techniques
    to disaggregate high-resolution flow-traced data to micro-component categories
    such as bath, shower, toilet, dishwasher, and washing machine. The production
    of high-resolution water consumption data in real-time or near real-time attributable
    to the advent of AMI technology has revolutionised end use analysis, offering
    powerful insights into water consumption patterns (Boyle et al., 2013; Nguyen
    et al., 2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b; Nguyen et al., 2018b). However, while many
    of the current generations of smart meters produce much higher data temporal resolutions
    than traditional meters, the adoption of technologies in the water industry is
    still in its infancy. Not only is there a lack of standardisation, but also the
    data granularity varies very widely among the different technologies (Pericli
    and Jenkins, 2015). Furthermore, end use disaggregation is often an add-on capability
    gained by attaching data loggers or acoustic sensors to water meters (Boyle et
    al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b), followed by the application
    of processing software such as ‘Trace wizard’ (Aquacraft, 2015) and Identiflow
    (WRc, 2008), smart algorithms and AI-based machine learning techniques such as
    ‘Dynamic Time Warping’ (DTW) and ‘Hidden Markov Model’ (HMW) (Nguyen et al., 2013a,
    Nguyen et al., 2013b; Makki et al., 2013). Less costly methods are sometimes used
    that rely on house inspections, logbook entries, water diaries and household surveys
    to measure and report end use consumption (Giurco et al., 2008; Willis et al.,
    2011). Table 3 summarises some groundbreaking flow-trace and sensor-based tools
    and techniques used to perform water end use analysis as reported in the literature.

    based-tools 3.3.1.1. Trace Wizard Developed by ‘Aquacraft’, an American water
    management company, the ‘Trace Wizard’ software system is an advanced tool that
    takes high-resolution raw flow trace data from a data logger and converts it into
    a disaggregated database of end uses of water and then assigns specific fixtures
    to each water use event (Aquacraft, 2015). Time-specific flow trace data, which
    comes with signatures associated with all key water use events, from data loggers
    are analysed to give precise information about household water consumption patterns
    (DeOreo et al., 1996). Many studies, especially in America and Australia, have
    used Trace Wizard in their end use analysis. In a study by Fielding et al. (2013),
    a total of 221 households in South East Queensland, Australia households had their
    water meters replaced with smart meters which had data loggers bolted onto them
    recording 0.014 L pulses at 5-s intervals. Trace Wizard Software version 4.1 was
    then used in combination with water audits and consumer water usage diaries to
    analyse the high-resolution water usage data. The analysis led to the identification
    of flow traces for each major end uses, namely toilet, washing machine, taps,
    showers and bathtubs, dishwasher, irrigation and leaks. In a similar end use study
    by Willis et al. (2013) in Gold Coast, Australia on 151 homes, all existing water
    meters were replaced with high-resolution smart meters and data loggers with 72
    pulses/L of water used, and pulse counts recorded every 10 s. This data was disaggregated
    using Trace wizard in conjunction with documentation of water use behaviours by
    means of self-reported water use diaries and stock appliance audits to help identify
    flow trace patterns for each household. Other recent studies include Switzerland
    - Pastor-Jabaloyes et al. (2018); Australia – Britton et al. (2013); Australia
    - Nguyen et al., 2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b; Australia - Gurung et al. (2014);
    Australia - Gato-Trinidad et al. (2011); and 1200 single-family homes in USA -
    Aquacraft (2011). 3.3.1.2. Identiflow Developed by UK’s WRC, Identiflow is a web-based
    micro-component analysis tool used to identify water end uses through signature
    analysis (Giurco et al., 2008). Identiflow, like Trace Wizard, is based on a decision
    tree algorithm and it performs a semi-automatic disaggregation of the total water
    consumption at the household level. Identiflow uses such features of various water-use
    devices as volume, flow rate (average and maximum flow), duration, to disaggregate
    the different end use events (Kowalski and Marshallsay, 2005; Andrea et al., 2015).
    The software’s key function is the identification of the usage of a range of end
    use devices, such as toilets, taps, showers, baths, washing machines and dishwashers.
    A range of statistical reports is generated covering device characteristics, frequency
    and duration of use, volume per use, and the contribution of each device to overall
    consumption (DEFRA, 2008). Unlike Tracewizard, the Identiflow technology is only
    available as part of WRC consultancy services in the UK with very little information
    about the technology disclosed so far. Consequently, it is unclear precisely how
    many studies have been conducted with the technology (Morrison and Friedler, 2015).
    One such study was undertaken by Kowalski and Marshallsay (2005), to investigate
    and understand the temporal and regional variability in end use data in the UK,
    for the purposes of demand forecasting. The study combined end use data from 500
    properties with socioeconomic and sociodemographic data from the UK 2001 Census
    and concluded that household occupancy and wealth are the most significant factors
    that influenced household water consumption. Neither Tracewizard nor Identiflow
    is without limitation (K.A. Nguyen et al., 2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b), although
    the latter is reported as having superior accuracy in terms of the volume of event
    classification (Andrea et al., 2015). Both tools present shortcomings in the accuracy
    of their event classification, which is contingent upon the physical features
    used in the description of each end use appliance under study. This increases
    the likelihood of more than one dissimilar end use event being classified under
    one category by virtue of the similarity of the description of their physical
    characteristics (Morrison and Friedler, 2015). A similar problem arises when different
    end uses present identical flow characteristics. Moreover, the two tools lack
    the ability to automate the analysis of the data collected. Human interaction
    and manual reclassification are always required, making it difficult and time-consuming
    to disaggregate large data (Kowalski and Marshallsay, 2005; Nguyen et al., 2013a,
    Nguyen et al., 2013b). 3.3.1.3. Autoflow In an attempt to overcome some of the
    shortcomings of the most successful flow trace-based tools discussed above, such
    as an inability to accurately differentiate between different end use categories
    sharing identical flow signatures, Nguyen et al. (2015) presented Autoflow. Autoflow
    is a tool that performs a deep, autonomous analysis of high-resolution residential
    water demand flow patterns from smart by relying on a hybrid combination of the
    pattern recognition algorithms and data mining techniques—Hidden Markov Model
    (HMM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms—to
    work out distinct flow signature patterns for each end use event classification.
    One unique feature of this model is its ability to perform a cascading disaggregation,
    using the classified single event registry from the initial process as the basis
    of a sophisticated combined end use event disaggregation module to separate simultaneously
    occurring end use events. In this study, Nguyen et al. (2015) utilised the data
    from 500 households obtained from a study conducted in Brisbane, Australia (Beal
    and Stewart, 2014). An initial disaggregation into seven different end use events
    was performed using Trace Wizard before Autoflow was used to perform an enhanced
    classification, leading to a classification accuracy ranging from 85.9% to 96.1%
    for single events and 81.8–91.5% for combined event disaggregation (depending
    on which of the three pattern recognition algorithms – HMM, ANN, DTW – was used).
    Autoflow currently allows a web portal access to household water consumers to
    view a range of temporal consumption tables, as well as the visualisation of their
    disaggregated water usage data (Nguyen et al., 2018b). 3.3.1.4. Sensor-based tools
    Other technologies and techniques are available that help in data collection and
    the understanding of water end use behaviour at home — from the use of such high-technology
    means as retrofitted sensing and IoT devices, algorithms, simulation or monitoring
    tools to the use of surveys, logbooks and diaries (as mentioned earlier). Most
    of these initiatives are part of a study and can only be implemented in conjunction
    with other processes requiring different expertise. A few of them are, however,
    are plug-and-play edge solutions that provide homeowners with detailed appliance
    water use information without the involvement of any professional or the installation
    of a non-standard metering device. 3.3.1.5. Nonintrusive Autonomous Water Monitoring
    System (NAWMS) Inspired by advances made in the provision of high-resolution real-time
    usage data to energy customers, Kim et al. (2008) introduced ‘NAWMS’— Nonintrusive
    Autonomous Water Monitoring System— an innovative system that monitors water consumption.
    It is a non-intrusive, autonomous, adaptive and self-calibrating system that uses
    wireless vibration sensors attached to pipes, eliminating the need for plumbing
    or special expertise. It empowers households with spatiotemporal information on
    their water consumption. NAWMS relies on the vibrations generated by water flow
    along the plumbing system leading to a fixture, which is measured by an accelerometer
    attached to the piping infrastructure. It performs end use disaggregation by measuring
    the total volume of water through exploiting the flow meter installed at the main
    supply of the home and through signals generated by the accelerometer installed
    on the pipes leading to individual fixtures (Carboni et al., 2016). The estimation
    of flow rates is based on the readings of pipe vibration collected at a frequency
    of 100 Hz using individual accelerometers. (Kim et al., 2008; Ellert et al., 2016).
    3.3.1.6. Appliance water disaggregation via non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM)
    Many end use studies (such as Beckel et al., 2012; Ellert et al., 2016; Schantz
    et al., 2014) have relied on non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) approaches to
    disaggregate appliance water consumption. NILM is a very popular approach, used
    mainly in energy studies, consisting of processes in which given household consumption
    metering data is used to infer the temporal consumption status of different household
    appliances (Beckel et al., 2012; Biansoongnern and Plungklang, 2016; Ellert et
    al., 2016; Revuelta Herrero et al., 2018). In Ellert, Makonin and Popowich’s (2016)
    study, data from electricity end use disaggregation is leveraged to help with
    water disaggregation. Appliance disaggregation models are built that, drawing
    from the water-consuming appliance electricity consumption signature, can infer
    the amount of water used by the appliance. This allows the understanding of total
    consumption attributable to appliance use and by human use without the need for
    the installation of water sub-meters or water sensors. Beckel, Sadamori and Santini’s
    (2012) study retrofitted non-intrusive vibration sensors for detecting the operation
    of water-consuming appliances. These sensors measure vibrations from pipes, providing
    a rich source of data for identifying loads. 3.3.1.7. HydroSense Froehlich et
    al. (2009) introduced HydroSense; a simple, low-cost, pressure-based sensing mechanism
    that performs water use disaggregation at the fixture level from a single installation
    point. The sensor was attached to a tap or the water connection point for a dishwasher,
    clothes washer, or toilet, and used to infer flow rate, with the capability of
    identifying water activities at fixture level and estimating the amount of water
    consumed at each fixture. HydroSense works by identifying the unique pressure
    waves generated through the opening and closure of fixture valves. These waves
    are reverberated throughout a home’s plumbing system, thus making the single-point
    sensing approach possible. While conventional flow-trace based end use analysis
    is performed by examining water flow at a single flow meter to determine the category
    of fixture responsible for water usage at any given time (For example, it can
    determine that a toilet was flushed as opposed to which toilet was flushed), HydroSense
    performs disaggregation by identifying the specific fixture that was used. This
    makes it easy to isolate efficient fixtures from inefficient ones. Campbell et
    al. (2010) developed ‘WATTR’, a self-powered wireless sensor node used for the
    collection and transmission of water pressure signals in household plumbing, based
    on the HydroSense application. Like HydroSense (Froehlich et al., 2009), WATTR
    operates by detecting the oscillations of transient pressure generated through
    the opening and closing of a water valve at household fixture levels but uses
    a self-powered system to do so. 3.3.1.8. WaterSense Another sensor-based fixture-level
    disaggregation tool similar to Hydrosense is Srinivasan et al.’s (2011) WaterSense.
    The WaterSense system performs the disaggregation at fixture level using only
    simple motion sensors. Water usage events are clustered based on both flow signatures
    and motion sensor signatures, and each of these clusters represents a unique water
    fixture in the home. Unlike Hydrosense, however, the WaterSense system is unable
    to differentiate two identical water fixtures in the same space. 4. Household
    water DSM DSM policies, comprising a range of multivariate measures, focus typically
    on encouraging efficient consumption and the conservation of existing water supplies
    through economical, technical, social and efficient management (Brooks, 2006;
    K. Fielding et al., 2012), as opposed to increasing supply through developing
    water abstraction. (DEFRA, 2018; Kayaga and Smout, 2011; López-Avilés et al.,
    2015). DSM policies work better when decentralised, where they involve the participation
    of regulators, firms, households and every end use of water and the integration
    of engineering, environmental and economic aspects of water management. However,
    the water industry typically implements water-regulating strategies on a reactionary
    basis, such as setting a consumption target for consumers in order to reduce consumption
    during water-stress periods (Beal et al., 2011). According to Brooks (2006), an
    effective DSM policy should achieve at least one of the following goals: i. The
    reduction of the quantity or quality of the water required to complete a specific
    water related-task; ii. The ability to conserve water by altering the way a water-related
    task is performed; iii. Minimising water loss from the source through usage to
    disposal; iv. The resilience to continue to provide adequate supply during water-stressed
    times. With the current water consumption trends in England and Wales, it is important
    to assess the impact of these interrelated complex factors, such as the rate of
    population growth, the socioeconomic and sociodemographic projections and the
    extent of climate change. The Environment Agency and water companies in England
    and Wales do collaborate with regional and local development agencies over the
    sufficiency of water resources to support population growth and housing development.
    By integrating current technology for water efficiency, metering, cost-effectiveness
    tariffs and innovative DSM approaches, PCC across England and Wales are aimed
    to reduce to 120–130 l/p/d by 2030 (DEFRA, 2008). 4.1. Factors that influence
    household water demand Household water demand is the measure of the quality and
    quantity of water used by household customers within the water system in the region
    (Brooks, 2006). Water demand deals with water use at a macro or aggregate scale,
    whereas household water consumption is about water use at a micro-component scale
    – indoor and outdoor uses at residences such as drinking, washing up, shower,
    washing clothes, flushing the toilet, watering the garden, and maintaining swimming
    pools (Giurco et al., 2008). Several factors have been reported in the literature
    to influence household water demand and consumption. The literature associates
    environmental factors such as climate change and precipitation with aggregate
    demand (Renwick and Green, 2000; UKWIR, 2015; Worthington and Hoffmann, 2006)
    while consumption at household level has been associated with such factors as
    household occupancy, the age of occupants and property type as some of the most
    significant determinants (Willis et al., 2011; Fielding et al., 2012; Liu et al.,
    2016; Grafton et al., 2011; Makki et al., 2013, 2015; Reynaud, 2015). Arbués et
    al. (2003) formulated an econometric model expressed as ‘Qd = f(P, Z)’ which inextricably
    relates the quantity of water demand (Qd) to the measure of price (P) and other
    determining factors (Z) such as environment, household characteristics, and policy
    instruments (Olmstead and Stavins, 2009). However, experts have yet to reach a
    consensus on water demand function methodology (Arbués et al., 2003). Mazzanti
    and Montini (2006) presented W = f (P,I,Z) as an alternative, where W = water
    per capita consumption; P = water price; I = household income and Z = socioeconomic
    variables. While both models express price as a key component of the water demand
    function, only the latter included household income as part of the equation. Considering
    these models, the review proposes a classification of household water demand determinants
    into endogenous (contextual), exogenous (environmental) and behavioural (psychosocial)
    factors (as illustrated in Fig. 2) and in the next section, a list of determinant-driven
    DSM instruments along with their relative impact is presented (Table 5). Download

    Exogenous factors Exogenous factors include all the variables outside the control
    of the water consumer such as climate, geography, seasonality and population growth.
    These factors invariably influence aggregate demand and must be captured and isolated
    in order to ascertain changes in water demand attributable to other factors. Renwick
    and Green (2000) formulated an econometric model of household water demand to
    ascertain the effect of climate variabilities from “normal” seasonal pattern and
    assess the relative contributions of different factors in the reduction of aggregate
    demand. Some of the most influential exogenous factors affecting demand as reported
    in the literature are geographical, seasonal and population variables (Makki et
    al., 2015; 2013). Factors under geographical and seasonal variables include availability
    or scarcity of water sources, altitude, precipitation, evaporation, climate change,
    weather conditions, temperature and seasonal variability. Exogenous factors could
    include an increase in regional frequency and scale of floods and droughts, and
    permanent changes in average renewable water sources due to variations in precipitation,
    humidity and temperature. Water scarcity is affected by population and behavioural
    responses to climate change, such as an increase in water demand for the purposes
    of cooling and heating (Makki et al., 2013; Olmstead, 2010). While these factors
    do impact both the long-term availability and the short-term variability of water
    sources in many areas (Olmstead, 2010), studies by Willis et al. (2011) reported
    a low level of variation between summer and winter indoor household water consumption
    attributable to seasonality or climate. Furthermore, Makki et al. (2015) performed
    Friedman’s multivariate ANOVA tests on household’s daily metered consumption across
    several periods (winter 2010, summer 2010, winter 2011 and summer 2011), concluding
    that six indoor end use events namely, shower, washing machine, taps, toilet,
    dishwasher and bath are not affected by seasonality. Similarly, Manouseli et al.
    (2019) found PCC relatively insensitive to climate and seasonal factors. However,
    Grafton et al. (2011) found climate variables such as the amount of rainfall and
    average summer temperature to be a statistically significant determinant of household
    consumption – contributing 5% to PCC and Gato-Trinidad et al. (2011) found weather-related
    factors to affect indoor consumption by 7%. Kenney et al. (2008) estimated that
    every degree Fahrenheit increase in average temperature results in a 2% increase
    in water consumption. Rathnayaka et al. (2017, 2015) also found that both outdoor
    and indoor water use are significantly higher during summer than winter, with
    the average tap and irrigation consumption being 10.60 l/p/d and 29.6 l/p/d more
    in summer than in the winter in Melbourne respectively, while Kenney et al. (2008)
    concluded that outdoor activities in Colorado such irrigation increase household
    consumption by 30% in summer, regardless of temperature and precipitation. In
    a study to estimate the effectiveness of a household water efficiency programme
    in the Southeast of England, Manouseli et al. (2019) concluded that a 10% rise
    in temperature results in a 0.3% increase in PCC while a 10% increase in number
    of days with more than 1 mm of rain can lead to a 0.33% fall in PCC. However,
    the same study found that a 10% increase in temperature leads to a 1.4% rise in
    PCC for affluent households and a 1.33% increase for one-person households. Geographical
    factors such as altitude were also found to have a negative and significant effect
    on household water consumption (Mazzanti and Montini, 2006). 4.3. Endogenous factors
    Endogenous factors, on the other hand, relate to factors that directly influence
    PCC (Lawson et al., 2018). These include socioeconomic and sociodemographic variables
    as well as household characteristics (Fig. 2). Research has found a positive correlation
    between sociodemographic, behavioural, psychological and infrastructural variables,
    and household water consumption. In a study to ascertain the role of these variables
    in household water conservation, Fielding et al. (2012) found that these variables
    accounted for 40% of the variance in household water consumption. Variables such
    as owner-occupied properties, household income level and household characteristics
    (e.g. the presence of bathtubs, garden and pools) have been proven to have an
    influence on water consumption (Vieira et al., 2018; Arbués et al., 2010; Willis
    et al., 2013; 2011). In a microcomponent analysis study on 700 properties in England
    and wales, Homewood and Snowdon (2014) found occupancy and makeup of dwellings
    to have the most significant influence on PCC, as did past research (Fielding
    et al., 2012; Willis et al., 2013; Beal et al., 2013; Beal et al., 2011). Data
    from the Environmental Agency (2008) suggests that PCC in England and Wales correlates
    inversely with occupancy. Tynemarch (2007) estimates a 5 l/p/d reduction in PCC
    per 0.1 increase in occupancy. With regards to household income and level of education,
    research has shown a positive correlation between the level of education and a
    stronger propensity to conserve water (Makki et al., 2015). Equally, higher-income
    households are far more likely to install water-efficient devices. Income, therefore,
    correlates with education and is often a reflection of households’ water conservation
    measures (Worthington and Hoffman, 2008). However, this does not always translate
    into water conservation as households with lower income tend to engage in more
    water conservation practices and have much lower PCC than higher-education/higher-income
    households (Makki et al., 2013, 2015; Olmstead and Stavins, 2009). Watson (2017)
    assessed the propensity of lower-income and single-parent households to conserve
    water and concluded that their PCC is high and that their willingness to adopt
    conservation practices and install efficiency devices was inhibited by the difficulties
    associated with raising their family single-handedly. As far as gender is concerned,
    Horsburgh et al. (2017) observed a 17% reduction in per visit water usage in women’s
    restroom after replacing manual fixtures with automatically activated ones, compared
    with an increase of 4.7% in men’s. Women used 4 times less water in the toilets
    than via the taps, making the toilet responsible for the bulk of their overall
    water conservation (Horsburgh et al., 2017). Age is a significant determinant
    of consumption, although the literature is divided on the age group responsible
    for the highest consumption (Fielding et al., 2012). Gregory and Di Leo (2003)
    and Aprile and Fiorillo (2017) concluded that older household occupants are more
    likely to engage in water conservation behaviour, while Beal et al. (2011) argued
    that pensioners have higher consumption than average as they tend to spend more
    time at home (Willis et al., 2013). It has been demonstrated that affluent households
    with children and teenagers tend to have higher frequency and duration of end-use
    events such as showers (Makki et al., 2013, 2015; Beal et al., 2011; Willis et
    al., 2013; Beal et al., 2012). Notwithstanding this, Dalhuisen et al. (2003) and
    Renwick and Green (2000) have both corroborated previous research that demand
    for water is income inelastic – a change in income results in a much less than
    proportionate change in demand. For instance, a 10% increase in income will only
    result in a 2.5% increase in household water demand (Renwick and Green, 2000).
    Research has found housing tenure to be correlated with water conservation behaviours,
    with house owners having a higher propensity than renters to invest in water-efficient
    devices (Aprile and Fiorillo, 2017; Grafton et al., 2011). In a survey by Randolph
    and Troy (2008) to ascertain the water conservation attitudes of householders
    according to their tenure and building types, 47% of public housing tenants expressed
    lack of ability to reduce consumption in comparison with 28% of private tenants
    and 37% of outright owners while 10% of both rental tenure types thought a lot
    more could be achieved. With regards to actual building and plot size, Renwick
    and Green (2000) estimated that in urban California, a 10% increase in square
    foot of plot will lead to an increase of 2.7% in water demand, while Guhathakurta
    and Gober (2007) found that a 1000 square foot increase in plot size in an average
    household in Phoenix, Arizona will result in about 1.8% increase in consumption.
    Kontokosta and Jain (2015) on the other hand reported that building size in terms
    of the number of floors does not affect consumption – average consumption falls
    by approximately 0.8% for every 10% increase in floor area, which they attributed
    to building efficiency. 4.4. Efficiency devices The presence of water efficiency
    devices in households significantly reduces per capita consumption. Household
    water efficiency includes the retrofitting of water-efficient devices to ensure
    the maximum value of water by reducing waste, effectively doing more with less
    water (Vieira et al., 2018). An empirical study by Renwick and Archibald (1998)
    in California revealed that fitting low flow toilets reduced water consumption
    by 10%, showerheads by 8%, and using water-efficient irrigation technologies saved
    11%. Studies in England and Wales concluded that retrofitting toilet devices,
    taps and showerheads resulted in water consumption reductions of 9–12% (Fielding
    et al., 2012) and Beal et al. (2012) also found that replacing the old-style showerhead
    and tap with star rated ones would reduce water consumption by 75% and 65% a year
    respectively. Currently, there is a focus on the legislature to incorporate water
    efficiency in buildings and specific regulatory instruments have been introduced
    to promote and provide incentives for water efficiency both in new builds and/or
    retrofit programs (Waterwise, 2016) with the potential to achieve a PCC of 125
    l/p/d (DEFRA, 2008) and reduce consumption by 35–50% (Inman and Jeffrey, 2006).
    For instance, in 2011–12, 2008 retrofit water closet devices saved between 60,000
    L per day (l/d) and 90,000 l/d, 2458 faucet devices saved between 30,000 l/d and
    40,000 l/d and 12,147 shower devices saved 360,000 l/d in England and Wales (DEFRA,
    2014). Table 4 shows Ofwat guidance on savings to be achieved by households on
    retrofit. Table 4. Guidance on savings to be achieved by households on retrofit

    5. Determinants of household water demand. Empty Cell Determinant Summary Reference
    Exogenous factors Water scarcity Water sources are under significant pressure
    due to environmental factors. Environment_Agency (2008); OECD (2008); WFD (2006)
    Altitude Results suggest that water consumption decreases with altitude (i.e.
    as temperature drops). Mazzanti and Montini (2006); OECD (2008) Precipitation
    A 10% fall in annual precipitation would lead to a 3.9% increase in per capita
    aggregate demand. House-Peters and Chang (2011); WFD (2006) Evaporation Meteorological
    variables such as precipitation and evaporation are among some common indicators
    of drought. Moglia et al. (2018); WFD (2006) Climate Change Climate change, drought,
    and permanent water scarcity are interrelated. Russell and Fielding (2010); WFD
    (2006); Willis et al. (2010) Weather condition and temperature Water demand increases
    with temperature and decreases with precipitation. A 1 °C increase in annual temperature
    would lead to a 6.6% rise in per capita aggregate demand per annum. House-Peters
    and Chang (2011); Monteiro and Roseta-Palma (2011) Seasonal variability Both outdoor
    and indoor water use is significantly higher in summer than winter – average tap
    and irrigation consumption being 10.60 l/p/d and 29.6 l/p/d greater in summer
    than in the winter respectively. Rathnayaka et al. (2015, 2017); Worthington and
    Hoffman (2008) Endogenous factors Affluence and education Lower-income households
    tend to engage in more water conservation practices and have much lower PCC than
    higher-education/higher-income households. Moglia et al. (2018); Worthington and
    Hoffman (2008); Makki et al. (2013, 2015); Olmstead and Stavins (2009) Occupancy
    Occupancy and makeup of dwellings have the most significant influence on PCC.
    An average occupant of a five-person household consumes 8.7% less water than an
    average occupant living alone Homewood and Snowdon (2014); Fielding et al. (2012);
    Willis et al. (2013); Beal et al. (2013); Manouseli et al. (2019) Age Households
    with children and teenagers, tend to have higher frequency and duration of end-use
    events such as showers. Makki et al. (2013, 2015) Gender 17% reduction in per
    visit water usage in women’s restroom after replacing manual fixtures with automatically
    activated ones was observed, compared with an increase of 4.7% in men’s. Horsburgh
    et al. (2017) Tenure Household tenure (for instance, whether a home is owned or
    rented) has a strong influence on household water conservation. Homeowners use
    less water than renters. Russell and Fielding (2010); Randolph and Troy (2008)
    Metering Metering is estimated to achieve water savings of between ten and 15
    per cent of household consumption. UKWIR (2005) Plot and building size In Phoenix,
    Arizona a 9.8%increase in lot size results in a 1.8% increase in water consumption.
    Guhathakurta and Gober (2007) Efficiency Replacing the old-style showerhead and
    tap with star rated ones would reduce water consumption by 75% and 65% a year
    respectively. Beal et al. (2012) Outdoor usage Households with gardens and pools
    are among the highest water consumers, especially in summer. House-Peters and
    Chang (2011); Monteiro and Roseta-Palma (2011) Empty Cell Psychosocial and behaviour
    To complement efficiency approaches, it is important to also have the awareness,
    knowledge, intention or motive to conserve water (Russell and Knoeri, 2019) Beal
    et al. (2012); Russell and Knoeri (2019) Notwithstanding the compelling evidence
    that efficiency devices do result in a significant reduction in household water
    consumption, research has also proved that corresponding offsetting behaviours
    can potentially diminish the effectiveness of efficiency devices. Campbell et
    al. (2004) found evidence that behavioural offsetting occurred in the response
    consumers to conservation policies relating to the installation of water-efficient
    devices in Phoenix, Arizona. It was found that, even though efficiency devices
    did result in a reduction in consumption, water saved fell significantly short
    of what was achieved under laboratory tests. However, significantly higher conservation
    was achieved where people were unaware that retrofits were in place. This, therefore,
    suggests that offsetting behaviours occur when people are aware of the presence
    of efficiency devices (Campbell et al., 2004). For instance, if people are aware
    that their shower-head is low-flow, they may be inclined to have longer showers
    (Fielding et al., 2012). Beal et al. (2012) indicated that younger, more educated
    higher-income households have a tendency to install efficiency devices which may
    not always translate into water conservation if they do not actively curtail their
    consumption. Therefore efficiency technology must be complemented with water consumption
    behaviours as part of a successful DSM strategy (Beal et al., 2012). 4.5. Psychosocial
    and behavioural determinants Clearly, the success of any water efficiency technology
    is contingent upon human behaviour. To complement efficiency approaches, it is
    important to also have the intention or motive to conserve water (Russell and
    Knoeri, 2019). Environmental studies have established a strong correlation between
    people’s behaviour towards the environment and their propensity to conserve water
    (Tijs et al., 2017; Willis et al., 2011; Aprile and Fiorillo, 2017). Therefore,
    being able to contextualise people’s water consumption in terms of its consequent
    environmental impact is crucial to the quantification of water consumption behaviour
    in a holistic manner – e.g. having baths instead of showers, having shorter showers,
    not leaving the tap running when brushing teeth, washing fruits in a bowl rather
    than under a running tap and only running full loads of washing. 4.6. Types of
    DSM policies As water demand is influenced by many factors, the effectiveness
    of any policy to reduce demand depends on how much of these factors it takes into
    account. Although the use of price as a water demand management instrument has
    been an issue of growing concern among policymakers in the past decades (Arbués
    et al., 2003), price has been expressed as an integral part of the water demand
    function by economists (Kayaga and Smout, 2011). Water DSM policy instruments
    are broadly categorised into those being price-related and non-price related (Lavee
    et al., 2013; Renwick and Archibald, 1998; Renwick and Green, 2000; Reynaud and
    Romano, 2018). Policies and measures are designed to address different aspects
    of water conservation, with some being more effective at monitoring consumption,
    improving consumers’ knowledge about their overall water consumption (Vieira et
    al., 2018) while others are better at reducing Aggregate Demand (Kayaga and Smout,
    2011, 2014; Olmstead and Stavins, 2009; Renwick and Green, 2000). Price-related
    policies include rates, billing and tariff structures (Kenney et al., 2008) whereas
    non-price-related policies comprise such instruments as public education and awareness
    campaigns, restrictions, technological and behavioural measures (Lavee et al.,
    2013; Inman and Jeffrey, 2006; Reynaud and Romano, 2018). The chances of achieving
    and sustaining reductions in demand could be immensely enhanced if DSM strategies
    considered household characteristics as well as psychosocial and end use profiles.
    (Beal et al., 2013; Giurco et al., 2011). Russell and Fielding (2010) also argued
    in favour of making water use behaviour a pivotal feature of water DSM, highlighting
    the need for a better understanding of the psychosocial attributes of household
    water demand. Fig. 3 illustrates the different branches of DSM as reported in

    4.7. Price-related DSM policies Renwick and Green (2000) used predictive equations
    to predict values for the price and climatic variables to help explain changes
    in residential water demand and to assess the relative contributions of price
    and non-price policies in the reduction of demand. Many experts in this field
    such as Rogers et al. (2002), Kenney et al. (2008), Lu et al., (2019) and Olmstead
    and Stavins (2009) contend that price-related DSM policies have a significant
    bearing on household water demand, offering an effective tool for maintaining
    the sustainability of water resources. This assertion is evidenced in the fact
    that many water companies routinely use water pricing as a short-term economic
    instrument in their DSM policies to influence water demand (Harou et al., 2014).
    Although this is effective in achieving some degree of water conservation, particularly
    during water scarcity periods such as droughts (Lavee et al., 2013), Reynaud and
    Romano (2018) argue that the effectiveness of price-related DSM policies affecting
    residential water demand is contingent upon the price elasticity of consumption,
    which is the degree of responsiveness of consumers’ demand to change in price.
    Arbués et al. (2010) note that “the larger the price elasticity, the more effective
    these policies are at reducing water consumption”. However, demand elasticity
    in household water consumption characteristically fluctuates between elastic and
    inelastic states —varying typically between −0.5 and −0.1 (Kenney et al., 2008).
    asserted that a 10% increase in price will lead to water demand decreasing by
    6%, while Reynaud (2015) argued that 10% increase in price can result in a 1–5%
    reduction in household water consumption. This is due to the variety of variables
    at play in the determination of water price elasticity, such as indoor and outdoor
    use, seasonal variation, income disparities, and geography (Dalhuisen et al.,
    2003; Renwick and Green, 2000). For this reason, Renwick and Archibald (1998)
    and Coleman (2009) argue that any reference to price elasticity of water must
    be qualified within a particular price range. This multivariate nature of the
    determinants of price elasticity means that residential customers do not respond
    unequivocally to increases in water prices due to inelasticity (Renwick and Green,
    2000). Despite the many variations in the determinants of water price elasticity
    (Coleman, 2009), aggregate demand of residential water does not always respond
    to higher prices (Dalhuisen et al., 2003) making it relatively price inelastic
    (Renwick and Archibald 1998; Dalhuisen et al., 2003), water being a basic necessity
    and not having a close substitute. This makes price a rather ineffective DSM instrument
    (Renwick and Green, 2000; Coleman (2009); Renwick and Archibald 1998); the percentage
    change in consumer’s demand is invariably less than the percentage change in price
    (Kenney et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2019). These factors, coupled with political
    and legal barriers (Lu et al., 2019), have made price a less attractive DSM policy
    for most water suppliers often used in conjunction with other DSM policies (Renwick
    and Green, 2000; Kenney et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2019). Studies by Shan et al.
    (2015) on the implementation of 3 DSMs namely, compulsory water restriction, knowledge
    and water price adjustment have shown positive responses to all three intervention
    strategies by most household water consumers. Further to this, price elasticity
    in domestic water is heterogeneous and is determined by a broad range of variables
    including household size, income level (Arbués et al., 2010) sociodemographic
    variables, and psychosocial tendencies as well as the specific task the water
    is being used to accomplish (Reynaud and Romano, 2018). 4.8. Non-price DSM policies
    Non-Price DSM policies relate to any non-market-based measures (Reynaud and Romano,
    2018) or set of measures adopted by water suppliers to conserve water at the point
    of consumption (Mcgranahan, 2002; Wichman et al., 2016). These policies are invariably
    heterogeneous (Reynaud and Romano, 2018), and are heavily influenced by sociodemographic
    (Vieira et al., 2018), psycho-social and other variables (Fielding et al., 2012),
    being most successful when implemented as an integrated management solution in
    conjunction with other DSM policies (Renwick and Green, 2000; Kenney et al., 2008)
    so that they interact in synergy to achieve a significant reduction in demand.
    In addition to Reynaud and Romano’s (2018) classification of non-price DSMs into
    public education, efficiency technology and water restrictions or Command and
    Control including rationing (Lu et al., 2019; Renwick and Green, 2000), this review
    proposes behavioural change technique (BCT) as a fourth, but equally overarching
    category. Behavioural change is an endogenous part of any implemented DSM policies
    (Inman and Jeffrey, 2006), including price-related DSM. Lu et al. (2019) proposed
    that “it is possible for some households to interpret an increase in water prices
    as profit-making by the utility rather than an incentive to engage in prosocial
    activities. Households who can afford the price increase and view it as profit-motivated
    are less likely to reduce consumption. If instead, they receive a message telling
    them that reducing consumption is for a good cause, they may be more willing to
    do so”. In assessing the comparative effectiveness of non-price DSM policies in
    reducing aggregate demand and their distributional implications, Renwick and Archibald
    (1998) advocated and Arbués et al. (2010) alluded to the disaggregation of household
    characteristics into granular variables in order to account for the heterogeneity
    that characterises water consumer groups. Renwick and Archibald (1998) further
    noted that in any given community, the extent of a fall in PCC, attributable to
    a specific policy instrument, is directly dependent on the socio-economic, sociodemographic
    and structural characteristics of households. Many water suppliers routinely use
    educational programs such as public relations campaigns, adding information about
    water consumption in water bills and organizing collaborative workshops. The main
    purpose of this is to induce attitudinal and behavioural change on the part of
    consumers in their day-to-day interaction with water (Hurlimann et al., 2009).
    Akin to price policies, many studies have placed user variables at the heart of
    the effectiveness of this form of DSM. Public education is thereby implemented
    in tandem with other policies both as a complementary addition to the primary
    policy — to maximise its effectiveness — as well as a part of an integrated approach
    for synergistic effect (Lee and Tansel, 2013). Furthermore, in any given DSM policy
    implementation, offering education to the appropriate group in accordance with
    their characteristics could maximise the effectiveness of that policy. For example,
    as smaller households are less efficient in using water utility equipment due
    to economies of scale (Arbués et al., 2010; Cominola et al., 2018; Jorgensen et
    al., 2014), better results will be achieved if efficiency educational campaigns
    and the introduction of exogenous incentives are tailored to smaller households
    (Arbués et al., 2010). Conversely, a more appropriate campaigning message may
    be directed to larger households with different characteristics. While disaggregation
    of policies is important (Kayaga and Smout, 2011), this is one that lends itself
    more to bolstering some of the less effective voluntary measures (Renwick and
    Green, 2000) and behaviour change and the use of efficiency mechanism. Contrary
    to the huge success of many forms of non-price policies, some proponents of alternative
    policies have argued that such instruments, especially command and control policies,
    “decrease consumer welfare, increase deadweight losses, are inequitable and unpopular
    and place an unnecessary administrative burden on struggling public and private
    sector water utilities” (Worthington and Hoffman, 2008). Many studies have discussed
    various DSM instruments vis-à-vis their impacts (Moglia et al., 2018; Stavenhagen
    et al., 2018) and Inman and Jeffrey (2006) presented a conceptual framework of
    processes involved in alleviating water stress using household DSM instruments.
    A list of determinant-driven DSM instruments along with their relative impacts
    is presented (Table 6). Table 6. Determinant-driven DSM instruments. Demand Determinant
    DSM instrument Results/impact Exogenous factors (Environmental) • Restrictions
    and temporary use bans Restrictions by eight water agencies in California during
    scarcity reduced average demand by 29% (Renwick and Green, 2000) (Kenney et al.,
    2008). • Rationing during drought Using rationing during scarcity, average household
    water demand was reduced by 19% (Renwick and Green, 2000). • Efficient device
    subsidies and retrofits. Implementing these policies in drought conditions by
    eight water agencies in California reduced average household water demand by 9%
    (Renwick and Green, 2000). • Education and awareness campaigns. Effective information
    campaigns affect demand by altering consumers’ tastes and preferences. Implementing
    these in California reduced average household water demand by 8%. Awareness campaigns
    produce a reduction of 15–30% if started early in a drought situation. (Syme et
    al., 2000). • Rebate Indoor rebate scheme helped to reduce household demand by
    approximately 10% (Kenney et al., 2008). • Leakages reduction in the distribution
    networks. Reducing leakage will save 22% of water supply in the UK (Lawson et
    al., 2018; WFD, 2006). • Reclaimed water can be used for non-drinkable applications
    to increase drinkable water availability Reclaimed water rainwater harvesting
    for housing complexes in the city of Morelia, Mexico resulted in a 38% reduction
    in freshwater consumption (García-Montoya et al., 2016; WFD, 2006). • Tariffs
    and price increase Moderate reductions in demand 5–15% achievable via price increases.
    Block tariff pricing structure led to a 5% reduction compared to a uniform rate
    pricing structure Renwick and Green (2000); Monteiro and Roseta-Palma (2011);
    (Kenney et al., 2008). Exogenous factor (Population increase) Endogenous factors
    Psychosocial/behavioural • Education and awareness campaigns. 69% of consumers
    would be encouraged to save more water if they were educated on conservation matters
    (Hoy and Stelli, 2016). • Metering Savings from metering are estimated to be about
    10–25% of PCC (WFD, 2006; DEFRA, 2018). • Feedback Consumption feedback led to
    a decrease in water use of between 2.5 and 28.6%, with an average of 12.15% (Sønderlund
    et al., 2016). • Efficient building design Homes in London built for 105 l/p/d
    do achieve a range of between 110lpd and 125.77 l/p/d depending on occupancy (DEFRA,
    2018). • Gamification By adopting a gamification paradigm to induce a change in
    water consumption behaviour, the SmartH2O platform achieved 10% and 20% reduction
    in consumption in Switzerland and Spain respectively (Rizzoli et al., 2018). 5.
    Household water consumption behaviour As discussed earlier, many empirical studies
    have strongly established that household water demand is influenced by the heterogeneity
    associated with households’ socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics
    such as income, age distribution and household preferences towards water use and
    conservation (Arbués et al., 2010; Willis et al., 2013). As such, any end use
    study aimed at analysing consumption for the purpose of reducing water consumption
    must incorporate real usage data with behavioural (psychosocial) and sociodemographic
    data (K. Fielding et al., 2012; Schultz et al., 2016). While the advent of smart
    meters is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, the actual PCC reduction
    attributable to the current generation of smart meters in the water sector is
    unclear (Sønderlund et al., 2016) but could be as little as 1% in the energy sector
    (DECC, 2010). This can be clearly due to the fact that, as discussed previously,
    smart meters are incapable of highlighting wasteful water behaviour at home. Recent
    sociology studies have shown that people relate to water only in a utilitarian
    fashion, meaning, they think of water in relation to specific practices and end
    use and the values they associate with those practices (Yang et al., 2017). Measuring,
    capturing and quantifying consumers’ attitudes and behaviours toward household
    water consumption has proved challenging to many researchers, not least because
    while people’s explicit behaviours can be recorded introspectively and through
    other means (diaries, observation, surveys), an implicit attitude cannot be measured
    by introspection. Available implicit attitude measurement tools, such as the Implicit
    Association Test (AIT) do not depend on the respondent’s ability to self-report
    their attitude (Nosek and Banaji, 2007). While there is an abundance of research
    on water consumption and conservation drivers and determinants in the literature
    (Basani and Reilly, 2008; House-Peters and Chang, 2011; Matos et al., 2014; Lowe
    et al., 2015; Makki et al., 2015), studies on the implicit attitudes that drive
    consumers’ water consumption behaviours are very scanty. 5.1. Water consumption
    behaviour capture through surveys and self-reported diaries Although environmental
    psychologists have argued against relying on self-reported behaviours (Gatersleben,
    2015; Gatersleben et al., 2002), appliance stock audit, self-reported water diaries
    and household surveys have featured prominently in many end use studies to complement
    meter data (Beal et al., 2011, 2013; Beal and Flynn, 2015; Makki et al., 2015;
    Vieira et al., 2018). In the design of a decision support system (DSS) as part
    of the Integrated Support System for Efficient Water Usage (ISS-EWATUS) project
    in Greece and Poland, Magiera et al. (2018) used web surveys on 174 household
    water consumers to investigate the psychosocial behavioural factors determining
    their propensity to engage in daily water conservation behaviours. Web-based water
    diaries were also used by participants to log their usage. Many more end use studies
    (Beal et al., 2011; Fielding et al., 2012; Beal et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2013a,
    Nguyen et al., 2013b; Makki et al., 2015) have complemented their end use analysis
    with consumer diaries, appliance inventory audits (to ascertain efficiency) and
    surveys which are very instrumental in unravelling consumers’ sociodemographic,
    psychosocial and infrastructural variables and their roles in providing a complete
    picture of people’s daily household water consumption habits and behaviours. 5.2.
    Water consumption behavioural tracking through technology Behavioural tracking
    (also referred to as individual-centred mapping), a technique of observing and
    recording people’s temporal actions and behaviours in a particular setting using
    a variety of both heuristic and technology-based techniques, is predominantly
    used in the fields of environmental psychology, as a means of identifying locational
    or temporal patterns of people’s behaviours (Ng, 2016). While many behaviour capture
    and modelling methods, such as surveys, observation and diaries, have been used
    in many studies (Cameron and Wright, 1990; Magiera et al., 2018; Nguyen et al.,
    2013a, Nguyen et al., 2013b; Spinks et al., 2011; Wutich, 2009), technology such
    as IoT and sensing (Yang et al., 2017; Waterwise, 2016), and techniques such as
    clustering (Fontdecaba et al., 2012; Jorge et al., 2015) play a pivotal role in
    the successful capture, measuring, understanding and modelling of water consumption
    behaviour. Akin to Ng (2016) principles of individual-centred behaviour mapping,
    here are some of the most successful case studies where varieties of sensors and
    IoT devices were used either individually or as an integrated tool (capable of
    measuring flow, temperature. from a variety of endpoints) to infer behaviours
    by tracking water usage at fixture and appliance level: 5.2.1. Motion sensors
    In Srinivasan, Stankovic and Whitehouse’s (2011) WaterSense study, inexpensive
    motion sensors ($5 each) were utilised to cluster all water activity events in
    terms of flow signatures and motion sensor signatures, each of which was a representation
    of a unique water fixture. This made it possible to track users’ spatiotemporal
    water consumption behaviour in the home. 5.2.2. Temperature sensors In Yang et
    al.’s (2015) ‘EWATUS’ IoT-led end use study which took place in Poland and Greece,
    a combination of flow and temperature sensors were fitted to fixtures and water
    appliances of 30 households which helped in collecting vital spatiotemporal water
    consumption behavioural data and identifying wasteful behaviours in real-time.
    5.2.3. Flow sensors Arroyo et al. (2005) developed ‘WaterBot’, a water fixture
    system that used water flow sensor as well as camera to detect and track water
    consumption and consumer activity at the faucet. Kuznetsov and Paulos (2010) developed
    an unobtrusive flow sensor, which was fitted to showers and taps to measure water
    consumption at the respective fixture level by capturing uniquely generated waveforms
    produced by the flow. Dutta and Dontiboyina (2016) also developed a faucet device
    that used ‘Hall Effect’ flow sensors to monitor and measure faucet-level water
    consumption and to provide an audio-visual alert to consumers when a certain level
    of consumption is reached. While flow sensors provide a quick and easy solution
    to inline high-resolution water consumption behavioural data acquisition, their
    application is limited to faucet ends, which makes them inapplicable to other
    fixtures and appliances. 5.2.4. Pressure sensors A good solution to the applicability
    limitation of flow sensors is Froehlich et al.’s (2009) pressure sensor used in
    the HydroSense study, which proposed a single-point sensing solution — also referred
    to as “infrastructure mediated sensing” (Kim et al., 2012) — that can detect when
    fixtures and appliances are turned on and off in the house. 5.2.5. Vibration sensors
    Kim, Park and Srivastava’s (2012) vibration sensor, used in the ‘NAWMS’ study
    (Kim et al., 2008), collected vibrations generated by water flow along the household
    plumbing infrastructure leading to a fixture, measuring the total water volume
    per fixture. 5.3. Implicit attitude measurement We examine the implicit (subconscious)
    factors that determine the explicit (deliberate and measurable) attitudes or behaviours
    at the point of water consumption. The tools (e.g. sensors) discussed above help
    to measure and capture explicit attitudes, providing detailed knowledge of household
    water consumption patterns such as the length and frequency of showers, the frequency
    of washing machine and dishwasher use. Measuring these behaviours repeatedly will
    help isolate those that are reasoned actions (Ajzen, 1991) from habits (Andrews,
    1903; Ajzen, 1991), that are the results of recurring situations comprising related
    behavioural cues (Jorgensen et al., 2013). Most behaviours are a function of psychosocial
    attributes of the individual (Beal et al., 2011; K. S. Fielding et al., 2012),
    such as their implicit attitudes, beliefs, habits, routines, personal capabilities,
    and contextual factors. None of these is subject to the consumer’s introspection
    (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995) at the point of consumption and therefore reside
    outside the consumer’s conscious awareness. Consequently, unlike explicit attitude
    and behaviour, the available methods and techniques used to measure implicit attitude
    are not dependent on self-reporting (as in surveys, diaries) or behaviour tracking
    (as in appliance and fixture sensors). One popular tool used by psychologists
    to measure implicit attitude is the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (Nosek and
    Banaji, 2007) used to identify the strength of automatic associations that people
    make between mental representations of concepts (Greenwald et al., 1998), further
    asserting that if memories that reside outside the consumer’s conscious awareness
    can influence their actions, then associations could also influence their explicit
    attitudes and behaviour. IAT mostly comprises tasks involving sorting objects
    into groups as quickly as possible, leaving respondents very little time to reflect
    on their feelings about the concepts in question (Nosek and Banaji, 2007). AIT
    is more prominently used in such areas of psychology as prejudice and racial stereotypes.
    (Cunningham et al., 2001; Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010; Greenwald et al., 1998). However,
    despite its unconventional format, it has gained popularity in many disciplines
    including social groups, politics, food, retail, health, and even pop culture
    (Nosek and Banaji, 2007). In summary, the success of a DSM response to water consumption
    impact is contingent upon the ability to measure and quantify water consumption,
    to understand the sociodemographic, socioeconomic and behavioural determinants
    of consumption and to gain insight into the implicit attitudes driving those behaviours.

    Evidently, metering is one of the most effective DSM tools to encourage water
    conservation and the advent of smart meters has revolutionised data collection
    in the household water sector. While the household smart metering technology remains
    in its infancy, compared with uptake in the energy sector, it has facilitated
    a broad range of end use studies internationally, providing real-time or near
    real-time data for water consumption monitoring in the home and behaviour change.
    More collaborative work is needed between the regulatory bodies and the water
    sector to increase smart meter penetration and compulsory water efficiency labelling.
    Water end use analysis is prohibitively time-consuming, costly and convoluted,
    relying on specific hardware and software combination, not to mention the technical
    as well as analytical expertise required to conduct one successfully, especially
    on a large-scale basis, making it impossible to incorporate routine end use analysis
    into water utility’s DSM framework. To overcome this problem, future smart meters
    could be equipped with ‘smart’ pattern recognition algorithms, making them capable
    of performing autonomous disaggregation of usage data to end use in real-time.
    Alternatively, utilities’ data processing infrastructure could have this capability
    incorporated into them – by harnessing the potentials of technologies and techniques
    discussed above in an integrated approach towards quantifying household water
    consumption for an effective DSM policy. Future end use studies would also be
    greatly facilitated if smart meters did, not only universally provide high-resolution
    data at real-time intervals, but also provide disaggregated data that shows consumers
    water usage in end use detail. A disaggregation model that integrates electricity
    consumption signatures of water appliances with high-resolution water smart meter
    data and fixture sensors could provide the ultimate mechanism for accurately measuring
    consumption in micro-component detail. Furthermore, current trends in technology
    such as ‘Industry 4.0’ could be used to drive a water-energy nexus in an integrated
    and proactive way to measure consumption and deliver targeted feedback in real-time.
    As most generations of smart meters are not capable of churning out sub-minute
    data (essential for end use analysis), future research may focus on the differences
    in hourly consumption patterns and how they impact both household consumption
    and aggregate demand. Peak demand management is an important component of most
    DSM strategies and as such, the accurate identification of household consumption
    patterns that underpin peak temporal demand and detailed characterisation of these
    patterns is a crucial step towards effectively reducing consumption, shifting
    the peak demand in households and improving demand forecasting. This would also
    help to effectively track individual households’ patterns of behaviour, ascertaining
    the extent to which these patterns change and their impact on aggregate demand.
    Finally, building such a peak classification model would not require any additional
    cost as it is possible with existing medium resolution smart meter data, would
    not require additional hardware or software to implement and can be easily incorporated
    into routine DSM strategies. This would add great value to smart meter data, transforming
    it into an intervention tool used to target households according to their temporal
    and peak patterns. Author contributions The final manuscript has been approved

    \ by visible and thermal proximal sensing\nsystems under different water stress\
    \ levels to evaluate the canopy water content (CWC). The oven-\ndrying method\
    \ was employed for assessing the canopy’s water state. This CWC is of great importance\n\
    for irrigation management decisions. The proposed framework is to integrate visible\
    \ and thermal\nimaging data using an artiﬁcial neural network as a valuable promising\
    \ implement for accurately\nestimating the water content of the plant. The RGB-based\
    \ features included 20 color vegetation indices\n(VI) and 6 gray level co-occurrence\
    \ matrix-based texture features (GLCMF). The thermal imaging\nfeatures were two\
    \ thermal indicators (T), namely normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT)\n\
    and the crop water stress index (CWSI), that were deliberated by plant temperatures.\
    \ These features\nwere applied with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for\
    \ training the samples with minimal\nloss on a cross-validation set. Model behavior\
    \ was affected by ﬁltering high-level features and\noptimizing hyperparameters\
    \ of the model. The results indicated that feature-based modeling from\nboth visible\
    \ and thermal images achieved better performance than features from the individual\n\
    visible or thermal image. The supreme prediction variables were 21 features: 14VI,\
    \ 5GLCMF,\nand 2T. The fusion of color–texture–thermal features greatly improved\
    \ the precision of water content\nevaluation (99.40%). Its determination coefﬁcient\
    \ (R2 = 0.983) was the most satisﬁed with an RMSE\nof 0.599. Overall, the methodology\
    \ of this work can support decision makers and water managers to\ntake effective\
    \ and timely actions and achieve agricultural water sustainability.\nKeywords:\

    \ of global water resources are consumed through agriculture [1]. Ex-\ntreme water\
    \ use in the agricultural sector also causes water scarcity in semi-arid and arid\n\
    regions [2]. Rice is one of the most economical crops that requires large amounts\
    \ of water.\nDecreasing water availability for agriculture threatens the productivity\
    \ of the irrigated\nrice ecosystem and ways to save water and increase the water\
    \ productivity of rice must\nbe found [3]. By optimizing the timing, duration,\
    \ and amount of irrigation and drainage,\nwater-saving irrigation practice has\
    \ been proven effective in saving water and increasing\nrice yield [4]. To improve\
    \ the water use efﬁciency of plants, it is important to accurately\nand timely\
    \ predict crop water status. Canopy water content (CWC) is a signiﬁcant factor\n\
    in regard to the water use efﬁciency of plants [5], drought assessment [6], a\
    \ key input\nvariable in irrigation management decisions, and crop ripening monitoring\
    \ [7]. Moreover,\nit is a vital parameter that reﬂects plant physiological status\
    \ and health [8]. It is one of the\nindicators widely used to evaluate a plant’s\
    \ water condition [9]. Traditionally, there are\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091785\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n2 of 23\nvarious manners of observing the water state\
    \ in a plant such as lab-based leaf water content\nanalysis [10], stomatal conductance\
    \ [11], and sap ﬂow measurement [12]. Despite the high\nprecision delivered by\
    \ these ways, they are time consuming, destructive and laborious,\nparticularly\
    \ in large-scale areas [13]. Moreover, the interest in monitoring the plant water\n\
    status has increased in the scientiﬁc community through remote sensing, which\
    \ is very\nwidely used to reliably retrieve leaf water content [8].\nWe focused\
    \ on modern procedures for estimation of the CWC from optical remote sens-\ning\
    \ data, especially from visible (RGB: red–green–blue) and thermal imaging. These\
    \ have\nseveral beneﬁts compared to hyperspectral sensors. Thermal sensing is\
    \ useful since it is\ncheap, non-destructive, convenient, and can be done remotely\
    \ [14]. Digital imaging may\nprovide a low-cost and easy-to-use alternative [15].\
    \ The hyperspectral camera is heavy,\nexpensive, and requires professional imaging\
    \ and data processing [16]. The superiority of\nproximity sensing technology with\
    \ regression algorithm relies on three major aspects: hand-\ncrafted feature selection,\
    \ data fusion for different sensors, and selecting the best model\nhyperparameters.\
    \ Elsherbiny et al. [17] explained that the regression algorithms could be\nupgraded\
    \ for robust prediction of rice water status through some actions, including high-\n\
    level features nominating, hyperparameters optimization, providing various alternatives\n\
    for the most sensitive features, and integrating the model with the best-combined\
    \ features.\nPrimary, common methods for extracting RGB-based features include\
    \ color vegetation\nindices (VI) and gray level co-occurrence matrix-established\
    \ texture features (GLCMF).\nSeveral studies have found that the crop water deﬁcit\
    \ will directly affect the biochemical\nprocesses and morphology of crops, and\
    \ this effect can be observed in the color changes of\nthe crop leaves. Digital\
    \ images are composited by pixels, which are a combination of the\ncolor channels\
    \ RGB. The VI can be calculated from these channels [18]. Wang et al. [19]\ngenerated\
    \ regression models using the G–R parameter of the RGB color system with the\n\
    moisture content of cotton and the moisture content index. The prediction accuracies\
    \ were\nup to 90.7% and 91.0%, respectively. Zakaluk and Sri [20] checked the\
    \ use of artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks (ANN) for digital images, taken by a 5 megapixel\
    \ RGB camera to predict the leaf\nwater potential of potato plants. Then, the\
    \ relationship between leaf water potential and\nimage features was determined.\n\
    Another variant of GLCMF was derived from RGB images to estimate the water\nsituation\
    \ in plants. Wenting et al. [21] concluded the relationship between GLCMF of the\n\
    RGB image of crop leaves and leaf water content at heading-stage maize with an\
    \ expected\nR2 value of 0.702 and the RMSE was within ±2%. Shao et al. [22] indicated\
    \ that GLCMF-\nbased partial least square regression model can predict water content\
    \ in grapevines with\nbetter performance. The prediction R2 was 0.833 with an\
    \ RMSE of 1.049. Additionally,\nthe thermal imaging system can provide an indication\
    \ of the water condition in the plant.\nLeaf temperature is an alternative measure\
    \ that is a suitable indicator of a plant’s water\nstate [23]. Moller et al. [24]\
    \ showed that thermal imagery can be used to accurately estimate\ncrop water status.\
    \ Ballester et al. [25] used a handheld infrared thermal imager to study\nleaf\
    \ moisture content in citrus trees and persimmon trees.\nThe integration of different\
    \ data sources was a vital component of this work to im-\nprove the quality and\
    \ robustness of the CWC prediction model. This has previously been\nused to evaluate\
    \ plant phenotypes. Moller et al. [24] elucidated that the fusion of visible\n\
    and thermal imaging could develop the accuracy of the crop water stress index\
    \ (CWSI) com-\nputation and provide accurate data on the crop water status of\
    \ grapevines. Shao et al. [22]\nclariﬁed that the incorporation of both GLCMF\
    \ and reﬂectance features could enable the\nprediction of water content of grapevines\
    \ and be beneﬁcial for grapevine management and\nachieved prediction R2 of 0.900\
    \ with an RMSE of 0.826.\nThe hyperparameter optimization of the model is another\
    \ factor that has a signiﬁcant\nimpact on the efﬁciency of water content prediction.\
    \ The performance of any machine\nlearning (ML) model is profoundly affected by\
    \ hyperparameter selection, which has several\nbeneﬁts: it can improve the performance\
    \ of ML algorithms [26] and improve the repro-\nducibility and fairness of scientiﬁc\
    \ studies [27]. Furthermore, it could perform a major role\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 1785\n3 of 23\nin improving the prediction model because of the direct control\
    \ of the behaviors of training\nalgorithms [28]. In this research, the ANN building\
    \ possibility was used as a tool to support\naccurate irrigation management decision\
    \ making by means of visible and thermal sensors.\nDawson et al. [29] developed\
    \ an ANN model for predicting water content in leaves de-\npending on single leaf\
    \ reﬂectance and transmittance, which are important input variables\nto vegetation\
    \ canopy reﬂectance models. The R2 was deﬁned as 0.86 with an RMSE of 1.3%.\n\
    Marti et al. [30] described the application of ANN to estimate stem water potential\
    \ from soil\nmoisture at different depths and standard meteorological variables,\
    \ such as temperature,\nrelative humidity, and solar radiation. The ANN presented\
    \ high-performance accuracy\nwith an optimum R2 of 0.926.\nTo maximize irrigation\
    \ in rice ﬁelds, the plant’s water content should be explored\naccurately via\
    \ proximal sensing systems. Although visible and thermal imagery are widely\n\
    used to estimate water content in plants, the best performing algorithm has a\
    \ high priority\nin research interests. Based on our knowledge, no prior research\
    \ has implemented the\nhybrid methodology of BPNN with features extracted from\
    \ thermal and RGB imaging to\ndevelop a predictive model for accurate estimation\
    \ of the water content status of rice under\ndifferent irrigation water treatments\
    \ and climate change. Hence, the main objectives of\nthis study were (i) to create\
    \ a well-structured CWC modeling of rice relying on high-level\nfeatures derived\
    \ from RGB and thermal images, (ii) to deﬁne the superior variants of\nthermal\
    \ and RGB features for robust CWC prediction, and (iii) to evaluate the performance\n\
    of BPNN models using the best-combined features and to adopt the ﬁnest model that\
    \ could\nbe recommended for precision irrigation in the future.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\n2.1. Experimental Design\nThe experiment was conducted on 120 potted\
    \ plants of rice under natural conditions\nat Zhejiang University (120◦09′E, 30◦14′N),\
    \ Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, P.R. China.\nOften, a plastic cover was set\
    \ up over the plants during precipitation to control the water\nadded for them,\
    \ and to obtain the heterogeneous water condition from the tested leaves.\nTo\
    \ prepare the germination, the rice seeds (Xiushui 134) were submerged in the\
    \ water\nfor four days at a temperature of 28–30 ◦C, and the water was replaced\
    \ twice a day.\nThen, the 10 rice plants were sown into a single PVC (polyvinyl\
    \ chloride) pot, which had\ndimensions of 140 × 95 × 125 mm. Each pot was ﬁlled\
    \ with 300 g of black peat moss\n(HAWITA Gruppe GmbH, Germany) and was irrigated\
    \ to achieve saturation during\nthe ﬁrst growing month. The compound fertilizer\
    \ treatment, N–P2O5–K2O (15-15-15),\nwith a rate of 100 kg ha−1 was applied at\
    \ 10-day intervals, produced by Qingdao SONEF\nChemical Company. Potted rice plants\
    \ were transplanted on July 10, 2018 and divided into\n3 groups, each with 40\
    \ pots. It was harvested on August 12, August 30, and September 21,\n2018 for\
    \ the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd groups, respectively. Table 1 shows the summary statistics\n\
    of air temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD). The values\
    \ of\nVPD were determined from the formula stated by Abtew and Melesse [31]. In\
    \ this work,\nthere were three different growth stages of the rice plants: tillering,\
    \ stem elongation,\nand panicle initiation. The water deﬁcit was implemented within\
    \ a period of 27–34 days,\n34–52 days, and 52–74 days of plant life for the 1st,\
    \ 2nd, and 3rd groups, respectively.\nAs declared in Figure 1, an experiment was\
    \ carried out with a completely randomized\nblock design in a factorial experiment.\
    \ The experimental design was divided into three\ngroups, each comprising four\
    \ irrigation treatments: fully-irrigated (T1: 100%), mild (T2:\n80–70%), moderate\
    \ (T3: 60–50%), and severe water stress (T4: 40–30% ﬁeld capacity),\nrespectively.\
    \ The number of replicates (R1, R2, etc.) of treatment was 10 samples. Generally,\n\
    the gravimetric approach was used to measure the volume of water by manually weighing\n\
    pots twice a day, supplemented by replacing the transpiration of water to preserve\
    \ the\nrespective moisture stress conditions. Gross water applied volumes were\
    \ estimated for\neach group, 1st stage values were 44.35, 41.65, 39.4, and 37.15\
    \ L (liter) for well-controlled,\nmild, moderate, and severe stress conditions,\
    \ respectively. Their corresponding values at\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n4\
    \ of 23\nthe 2nd group were 60.35, 56.40, 53.29, and 49.25 L and at the 3rd group\

    \ (PowerShot SX720 HS, Canon Inc., Tokyo,\nJapan) was used to capture digital\

    \ elevation, side, and plan view, as displayed in Figure 2. For the plan\nview,\
    \ the camera was installed on a tripod and ﬁxed perpendicular with a height of\

    \ infrared camera is Tau2-640 (FLIR systems, Inc., USA), which had a\nresolution\
    \ of 640 × 512 pixels, and a focal length of 19 mm. The sensitivity of the Tau2-640\n\
    camera is 0.05 ◦C (50 mK), and the accuracy of the measurement is ±5% after calibration.\n\
    The thermal sensor has a spectral response in the range of 7.5–13.5 µm. The thermal\n\
    camera was mounted on a tripod at a distance of 1 m above the crop, and the angular\n\
    ﬁeld of view was perpendicular to the plants. The thermal images were taken from\
    \ the\ntop view of the plant canopy. The water status measurements were conducted\
    \ between\n12:00 and 13:00 local standard time on all plants, when the crop plants\
    \ had a maximum\ndaytime temperature, were in perfect sun, and with minimal wind\
    \ movement. The crops\nexhibit high emissivity as well as low reﬂectivity [32].\
    \ In the thermal images, a signiﬁcant\ndifference in soil temperature was noticed,\
    \ but when the soil was masked out, it was not\nimportant when remaining focused\
    \ on the crop. The thermal value obtained by thermal\ninfrared images was originally\
    \ stored in the raw image in which each pixel is 14 bits.\nThe raw format can\
    \ be converted to JPG ﬁle format to explain the temperature distribution\nof plants\
    \ in each part of the image. The following is the equation for calculating the\n\
    transformed temperature from the thermal raw image [33]:\nTem = [Thraw × 0.04]\
    \ − 273.15\n(1)\nwhere Thraw and Tem (◦C) represent the thermal value and the\
    \ corresponding pixel tem-\nperature, respectively. The ﬁrst constant (0.04) is\
    \ to calibrate the thermal camera and obtain\nthe image pixel temperature (◦K),\
    \ and the second value (−273.15) is to convert Kelvin\nto Celsius.\n2.4. Image\
    \ Segmentation\nVarious objects such as rice plants, soil, and pots were included\
    \ in the thermal and\nRGB images collected at the different growth stages of the\
    \ rice plants. It was necessary\nto separate the plants and backgrounds for the\
    \ efﬁcient computation of the canopy water\ncontent. Firstly, for the RGB images,\
    \ a thresholding technique was employed, which is a\nprocess of image segmentation\
    \ to convert the image to grayscale [34] and produce a binary\nimage [34], which\
    \ has two possible pixel values, namely the intensity value of the image\nthat\
    \ is more than or equal to the threshold value of 1 (white or foreground) and\
    \ when\nit is less than the threshold value or value 0 (black or background) that\
    \ can be removed.\nEach pixel in the binary image has a size of 1 bit. After separating\
    \ the rice pixels from the\nbackground objects, a set of candidate features, including\
    \ color and texture, were extracted\nfor further analysis. Secondly, for the thermal\
    \ images, python software was employed\nto generate a code for segmenting the\
    \ rice plants. The ground temperature was higher\nthan any parts in the image,\
    \ despite the soil and pot being lower than others. Accordingly,\nwe can separate\
    \ the temperature of the objects as either higher or lower than that of rice\n\
    plants. Average plant temperature was calculated for all pixels in each thermal\
    \ image.\nFigure 3 describes thermal image segmentation and canopy temperature\
    \ distribution\nduring the different irrigation treatments in the three growth\
    \ stages of the rice. At the 1st\nstage, the canopy temperatures were observed\
    \ in the ranges of 32–33.5 ◦C (well-watered),\n33.8–35.4 ◦C (mild stress), 35.75–36.5\
    \ ◦C (moderate stress), and 36.9–37.55 ◦C (severe stress).\nThe canopy temperature\
    \ ranges for such treatments at the 2nd stage were 37.5–39.1 ◦C,\n39.22–41.72\
    \ ◦C, 42.39–45.8 ◦C, and 46.24–48 ◦C, respectively. Their corresponding values\
    \ at\nthe 3rd stage were 22.85–24.5 ◦C, 25–27.7 ◦C, 28–30.1 ◦C, and 30.5–33 ◦C,\

    \ Extraction from RGB Images\nRGB images contain large amounts of data, thereby\
    \ analyzing the image requires a\nlarge volume of memory and leads to more time.\
    \ Consequently, to decrease the volume of\ndata, an image is depicted using a\
    \ series of features. The purpose is to capture the image’s\ncertain visual properties.\
    \ Feature extraction has a crucial role in different image processing\nsystems.\
    \ The most common ways to extract features from RGB images are RGB color space\n\
    percentage and GLCM-based texture features.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n7 of\
    \ 23\n2.5.1. RGB Color Space Percentage\nThe RGB imagery involves three bands\
    \ of red, green, and blue, where each band has\na value of each pixel [35]. The\
    \ rice plants modiﬁed the content of chlorophyll to balance\nphotosynthesis and\
    \ transpiration under conditions of water stress. The RGB channel values\nwere\
    \ affected, owing to different levels of canopy water content. The percentage\
    \ values of\nthe RGB color space were determined as typical features using the\
    \ following formulas:\nR=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\ni=1 Ri\n(2)\nG=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\n\
    i=1 Gi\n(3)\nB=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\ni=1 Bi\n(4)\nwhere Ri, Gi, and Bi are the pixel\
    \ value for the red, green, and blue band in the digital\nimage, respectively;\
    \ i and Snum are the ﬁrst pixel and the maximum number of pixels,\nrespectively;\
    \ R, G, and B are mean values of RGB color space.\nAbout 20 color vegetation indices\
    \ for plant water status estimation were evaluated.\nTable 2 reveals RGB-based\
    \ vegetation indices as claimed by numerous previous studies.\nIn our study, these\
    \ indices were examined to explore their feasibility for CWC modeling\nand compared\

    \ Matrix-Based Texture Features (GLCMF)\nSeveral studies related to assessing\
    \ the water status of the plant have used GLCMF:\nWenting et al. [21], to predict\
    \ maize leaf moisture content, and Ushada et al. [46], to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ content and leaf water potential of moss. This is based on the fact that changes\n\
    in the textural appearance of a plant canopy due to the water status reﬂects tonal\
    \ variations\nover the community of plants [47]. The co-occurrence matrix is a\
    \ statistical method for\nexamining the texture of a grayscale image [48]. The\
    \ GLCMF analyzes the grayscale rela-\ntionship between two pixels in the image\
    \ space that are separated by a certain distance and\nthen randomly extracts the\
    \ canopy texture feature information premised on probability\ncharacteristics.\
    \ There were six variants of GLCMF in this study such as contrast, dissimilar-\n\
    ity, homogeneity, angular second moment (ASM), energy, and correlation. The contrast\n\
    clearly represents the depth of the image and texture. Dissimilarity measures\
    \ the distance\nbetween pairs of pixels in the region of interest. Homogeneity\
    \ estimates the closeness of\nthe distribution of elements in the GLCMF. ASM discovers\
    \ the roughness distribution and\ntexture image. Energy measures textural uniformity.\
    \ The correlation ﬁnds out the degree of\ncorrelation in the local grayscale image.\
    \ The RGB-based GLCMF variables are explicated,\nas shown in Table 3.\nTable 3.\

    \ Thermal Images\nThermal indicators (T) are features extracted from thermal images\
    \ depending on the\nrice plant temperatures, which consist of two indices in this\
    \ study: the crop water stress\nindex (CWSI) and normalized relative canopy temperature\
    \ (NRCT).\n2.6.1. Canopy Temperature-Based Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)\nThe\
    \ CWSI deduced from canopy temperature for many crops has been widely nom-\ninated\
    \ as an instrument to elucidate plant water conditions and schedule irrigation\
    \ [50].\nThe CWSI concept is linked to the standard in which the leaf surface\
    \ is cooled during the\ntranspiration process, and as soil moisture in the root\
    \ zone is also depleted, leaf temperature\nincreases and stomatal transpiration\
    \ and conductance decrease. An empirical approach\nwas proposed to determine crop\
    \ water stress as reported by Idso et al. [51]:\nCWSI =\n[(Tc − Ta) − (Tnws −\
    \ Ta)]\nh\x10\nTdry − Ta\n\x11\n− (Tnws − Ta)\ni\n(5)\nwhere Ta, Tc, Tnws, and\
    \ Tdry are air temperature (◦C), canopy temperature (◦C), non-water-\nstressed\
    \ canopy temperature (◦C), and water-stressed canopy temperature (◦C), respectively.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n9 of 23\n2.6.2. Normalized Relative Canopy Temperature\
    \ (NRCT)\nTo calculate the NRCT index, wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures were\
    \ suggested by\nJackson et al. [23] as the lower and upper baseline, respectively.\
    \ As stated in the formula\nby Elsayed and Darwish [9], the NRCT was computed\
    \ as follows:\nNRCT =\nTc − Tmin\nTmax − Tmin\n(6)\nwhere Tmin and Tmax are the\
    \ lowest and highest temperatures measured in the experiment\n(◦C), respectively.\n\
    2.7. Canopy Water Content Computation\nAfter scanning by the visible and thermal\
    \ imaging system, the plants in each pot were\npicked. The roots were removed\
    \ and the rest was studied to provide a reference for data\nanalysis. Thus, the\
    \ above-ground part of the plants in one pot was deﬁned as one sample\nin this\
    \ study. To obtain the fresh weight (FW), the samples were weighed before drying.\n\
    Then, the dry weight (DW) was obtained after drying the samples for 24 h in an\
    \ oven at\na temperature of 70 ◦C. The percentage of canopy water content was\
    \ estimated by the\nfollowing formula:\nCWC (%) = FW − DW\nFW\n× 100\n(7)\n2.8.\
    \ Dataset and Data Analysis Software\nA total of 120 readings were split into\
    \ training, validation, and testing, where 80%\n(96 samples) were used for the\
    \ training and validation process of the regression model,\nwhile the other 20%\
    \ (24 samples) were used to verify the model’s performance by com-\nparing the\
    \ expected CWC values with the calculated CWC values. A leave-one-out cross-\n\
    validation (LOOCV) approach was utilized to train and validate the model. LOOCV\
    \ ex-\ncludes one sample for validation and uses the rest of the samples for training\
    \ in every trial.\nThis method can decrease over-ﬁtting and permits a more accurate\
    \ assessment of model\nprediction strength [52]. The feature selection, model\
    \ establishment, and data analysis were\nimplemented using Python 3.7.3. The ANN\
    \ module from the Scikit-learn library version\n0.20.2 was used for the regression\
    \ task. The software was run on a PC with Intel Core\ni7-3630QM, 2.4 GHz CPU,\
    \ and 8 GB RAM.\n2.9. Implementation of a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN)\n\
    The BPNN employs the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) as a supervised learning\n\
    algorithm that contains a ﬂexible function to train a speciﬁc data set [53]. MLP\
    \ is one of\nthe neural network models that has the same back-propagation structure\
    \ for supervised\ntraining. Typically, back-propagation is used for the training\
    \ of feed-forward. The neural\nnetwork is structured from 3 types of layers: (1)\
    \ the input layer is the primary data for the\nneural network, (2) the hidden\
    \ layer is an intermediate layer between the independent\ninputs layer and dependent\
    \ output layer, and (3) the output layer produces the results\nof the speciﬁed\
    \ inputs. Figure 4 displays the architecture of an artiﬁcial neural network,\n\
    which is a class of machine learning algorithms. It uses multiple layers to gradually\n\
    extract high-level features from the raw input. Five squares as input layers are\
    \ noted\nas vector I. The network contains two hidden layers, the number of nodes\
    \ determined\naccording to regression accuracy. Four squares as hidden layers\
    \ represent the “activation”\nnodes and usually are noted as weight; W, Wh, and\
    \ Wo are with layers 1–2, 2–3, and 3–4,\nrespectively. The ﬁnal square represents\
    \ the output layer that shows the predicted value\nof canopy water content. The\
    \ bias neuron (B) is a special neuron added to each layer in\nthe neural network,\
    \ which is usually taken to be 1 [54]. The artiﬁcial neural networks\nare generalized\
    \ mathematical models that use a series of neurons or nodes interlinked by\nweighted\
    \ connections to simulate human cognition as it applies to pattern identiﬁcation\n\
    and prediction [55].\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n10 of 23\n \n\U0001D466 ൌ ሺ\U0001D703\

    Input variants involve RGB-based features (color: 20VI and texture: 6GLCMF) and\n\
    thermal properties (2T). To facilitate the model training process, a transformation\
    \ was\nperformed to rescale the features. Normalization is transformed across\
    \ individual features\n(f) to adjust for differences in magnitude between different\
    \ features. Feature normalization\n(fnorm) is computed by subtracting the minimum\
    \ image data (fmin) and by dividing the\ndifference between the maximum (fmax)\
    \ and the minimum feature value as shown by the\nfollowing formula:\nfnorm =\n\
    f − fmin\nfmax − fmin\n(8)\nThe neuron is the primary component of ANN, which\
    \ involves its elementary math-\nematical functions. The neuron output (y) can\
    \ be expressed by the following equation:\nwhere Wn indicates the nth weights\
    \ of the combination that produces the output, θ is the\nunit step function, W\
    \ is the weight related with the nth input, and µ is the average.\ny (θ) × ∑\n\
    n\nj=1(Wn − µ)\n(9)\nThe generalized weight (W) can be realized using the equation\
    \ below, where i is the\nindex for each covariate of x, o(x) is the predicted\
    \ outcome probability by covariate vector,\nand log-odds is a link function for\
    \ the neural network.\nW =\n∂log(\no(x)\n1−o(x))\n∂xi\n(10)\nAt training, the\
    \ maximum number of neural network iterations was 1000 iterations.\nA neural network\
    \ can stop at exact iterations with the highest network performance.\nTo choose\
    \ the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the cross-validation technique with\n\
    the LOOV method was performed on the training dataset. The parameter of limited\n\
    memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (lbfgs) was used as a weight optimizer\
    \ to\nimplement the algorithm efﬁciently [56]. Otherwise, there are several methodologies\
    \ to\nselect premium features depending on feature selection algorithms that have\
    \ become an\nobvious requirement for prediction and modeling [57]. Glorfeld [58]\
    \ concluded that an\nindex, such as the following BPNN algorithm in this analysis,\
    \ can be used to select the\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n11 of 23\nmost important\
    \ variables and improves the predictive capacity of the regression model.\nThis\
    \ index is explicated in the following formula:\nM =\n∑nH\nj=1\nh\x10\n| I |Pj/\

    \ measure for the input variable, np is the number of input variables,\nnH is\
    \ the number of hidden layer nodes, | I |Pj is the absolute value of the hidden\
    \ layer\nweight corresponding to the pth input variable and the jth hidden layer,\
    \ and | O |j is the\nabsolute value of the output layer weight corresponding to\
    \ the jth hidden layer.\n2.10. Hyperparameter Optimization and High-Level Variants\
    \ Selection\nOne of the purposes of this research was to compare different features\
    \ during training\nthe BPNN model. The three types of the dataset (samples×features)\
    \ for analysis were\n120 × 20, 120 × 6, and 120 × 2. These data were employed\
    \ as input for the neural network.\nWe optimized the model by selecting the prominent\
    \ hyperparameters. The parameters\nwere the number of neurons in two hidden layers\
    \ (nr1 and nr2) and activation function\n(fun). The main steps of neural network\
    \ training, appropriate hyperparameters estimation,\nand feature arrangement are\
    \ described in Figure 5. This ﬁgure illustrates the pseudo-code\nfor training\
    \ a neural net with various variants. The number of features in each loop was\n\
    with color indices: 20, 19, 18, etc.; texture features: 6, 5, 4, etc.; and thermal\
    \ indicators:\n2, 1. Generally, the variants were fed to the model randomly in\
    \ the 1st loop, the low-\nlevel features were dropped during each loop, and the\
    \ superb features were organized\nin ascending order concerning the highest contribution.\
    \ Then, the ANN outputs were\ncompared to decide high-ranking variants at minimum\

    Various combinations of variables were examined to predict CWC, and the top neural\n\
    network architectures for hidden conﬁgurations were presented. The numbers of\
    \ hidden\nneurons were different due to the variations in the feature values extracted\
    \ from the\nvisible and thermal images. The proposed features of color indices,\
    \ texture characteristics,\nand thermal indicators were evaluated to adopt the\
    \ best-combined variants.\n3.1.1. Color Vegetation Indices (VI)\nThe optimal VI\
    \ identiﬁed in each loop during neural network training are clariﬁed in\nFigure\
    \ 6. The neural network performance was estimated with different VI. As explained\n\
    in Table 4, model performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, and MAPE) were evaluated through\n\
    training, cross-validation, and a test set. Moreover, the prediction accuracy\
    \ (Acc) was\ncalculated. The best hyperparameters such as hidden neurons, activation\
    \ function, and the\nmaximum number of iterations of the neural network were chosen.\
    \ Several architectures\nof the BPNN model relying on VI were collected. The best\
    \ neural network results were\nattained by fusing data of 14VI at the 7th loop,\
    \ as displayed in Figure 6. The ﬁnest\nhyperparameters of activation function,\
    \ hidden neurons, and maximum iterations were\nlogistic, (19,15), and 119 iterations,\
    \ respectively. The RMSECV decreased to 2.291 vs. 2. 444\ncompared to 14VI vs.\
    \ 20VI. The prediction ability of the BPNN-VI-14 model increased\nequivalent to\
    \ the model with full VI, with prediction R2 (0.632 vs. 0.556), MAPE (2.832% vs.\n\
    3.273%), RMSE (2.788 vs. 3.065), MSE (7.776 vs. 9.394), and Acc (0.972 vs. 0.967).\n\

    \ three growth stages, were grown with four levels of irrigation\nunder outdoor\
    \ conditions. The temperature of the rice canopy was affected by the water\nstress.\
    \ The temperatures of non-water stressed and water-stressed canopy were 31 ◦C\n\
    and 38 ◦C at the 1st stage, 37 ◦C and 49.1 ◦C at the 2nd stage, and 22 ◦C and\
    \ 34.07 ◦C at\nthe 3rd stage, respectively. We exploited the previous temperatures\
    \ for computing the\ntwo thermal indicators: CWSI and NRCT. The relationship of\
    \ both CWSI and NRCT with\nthe CWC of rice at each growth stage is designated\
    \ in Figure 8. It was observed to be\ninversely related, and the R2 at each stage\
    \ independently was higher than the R2 at three\nstages. By applying ANN with\
    \ thermal indicators, the prediction formula to compute the\nCWC at any stage\
    \ of rice growth was explored with high accuracy. The neural network\noutputs\
    \ with thermal indicators at the 1st and 2nd loop are illuminated in Table 6.\
    \ It depicts\nthe optimal parameters of the T-based BPNN model and its outputs\
    \ (R2, MAPE, RMSE,\nMSE, and Acc) through cross-validation, training, and test\
    \ set. The results approved\nthat the BPNN-CWSI-NRCT was a high-quality model\
    \ for CWC computation (R2 = 0.803,\nMAPE = 1.989%, RMSE = 2.043, MSE = 4.172,\
    \ and Acc = 0.980) as opposed to BPNN-CWSI\n(R2 = 0.505, MAPE = 3.782%, RMSE =\

    \ against 1 and 2T, respectively. The model of BPNN-T-2\nwas excellent for estimating\
    \ the CWC by (19,18) neurons in two hidden layers, logistic as\nactivation function,\

    \ Features Extracted from Visible and Thermal Imagery\nThe ﬁndings inferred that\
    \ in comparison with the BPNN-GLCMF-5 and BPNN-VI-14\nmodels, the BPNN-T-2 model\
    \ had dependable foretelling. Further, the thermal indica-\ntors (T) were joined\
    \ with VI and GLCMF to improve the forecasting performance and\ndiscover the unmatched\
    \ model. The three approaches were espoused as a new expecta-\ntion procedure\
    \ of the rice water content, incorporating VI-T, GLCMF-T, and VI-GLCMF-T\nfeatures\
    \ with the BPNN model. Their outputs (MSE, RMSE, and MAPE) and notable\nparameters\
    \ are disclosed in Table 7. The order of the models was deﬁned by the smallest\n\
    RMSECV: the performance of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21>BPNN-GLCM-T-7>BPNN-VI-T-16.\nTheir\
    \ corresponding values at cross-validation R2 were 0.984 (RMSECV = 0.361), 0.982\n\
    (RMSECV = 0.447), and 0.956 (RMSECV = 0.661), respectively. Their prediction outputs\n\
    with the R2, MAPE, RMSE, MSE, and Acc were 0.983, 0.564%, 0.599, 0.359, and 0.994;\
    \ 0.972,\n0.668%, 0.764, 0.583, and 0.993; and 0.978, 0.682%, 0.674, 0.455, and\
    \ 0.993, respectively.\nThe distinguishing parameters of the most robust model\
    \ were with hidden layer neurons\n(8,9), activation function (logistic), and maximum\
    \ iterations (422). The BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-\n21 model had quick predictive outcomes\
    \ within 31.911 s for a single sample compared to the\noven-drying method [17,60];\
    \ a test time of 24 h is required to dry the sample. The ﬁndings\nare in agreement\
    \ with Meeradevi et al. [61] who used ANN as a fast tool with a prediction\ntime\
    \ of 9.74 s. The results elucidated that the improvement in prediction accuracy\
    \ of CWC\ncan be fulﬁlled if adequate neural network parameters and higher variables\
    \ are assigned.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n16 of 23\nTable 7. Various architectures\

    \ (sec).\n3.2. Neural Network Learning Curves with Super Features\nThe learning\
    \ curve of the regression model was promoted in this study through the\nfollowing\
    \ considerations: (1) number and characteristics of nominated features, (2) pick-\n\
    ing the supreme parameters, and (3) neural network deﬁnite iterations to avoid\
    \ model\nover-ﬁtting. The ﬁrst two points are discussed in the previous sections.\
    \ The last factor\nrefers to the neural network stopping at speciﬁc iterations\
    \ that can progress the network\nperformance, as indicated in Figure 9. These\
    \ curves exhibit an evaluation of the model’s\nbehavior with the higher variants\
    \ at training, cross-validation, and testing. As the number\nof iterations increases,\
    \ the accuracies of training, cross-validation, and testing increase\ngradually\
    \ to reach a point where the learning curves show a good model. As publicized\n\
    in Figure 9a–d, the optimal repetitions of the BPNN training process through the\
    \ highest\nvariables (14VI, 5GLCMF, 2T, and VI-GLCMF-T-21) were 119, 175, 217,\
    \ and 422 steps,\nrespectively. The learning curves of the innovative models reached\
    \ a cross-validation\naccuracy of 0.625, 0.656, 0.851, and 0.984, respectively.\
    \ The learning outcomes veriﬁed that\nthe accuracy measure steadily increases\
    \ over iterations of training. When the permissible\niterations of the neural\
    \ network are exceeded, the model generally takes the form of making\nan overly\
    \ complex model. Moreover, training accuracy was usually higher than cross-\n\
    validation accuracy. The three-stage model of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T was accomplished\
    \ with\n21 variables and 422 steps. Its prediction accuracy was 99.4% (R2 = 0.983\
    \ with an RMSE\nof 0.599), and the learning curve performance was impressive (Figure\
    \ 9d). The expected\nperformance was improved as said by Thawornwong and Enke\
    \ [62]; to avoid over-ﬁtting,\nthe network was trained by the back-propagation\
    \ algorithm with early stopping.\n3.3. Neural Network Topology with Higher Variants\n\
    The neural network architectures after gathering senior features are introduced\
    \ in\nFigure 10. This ﬁgure showed the best neural network structure with the\
    \ variants chosen.\nEach network topology offers basic information such as the\
    \ synaptic weights trained,\na range of hidden neuron layers, steps for converging,\
    \ and the overall errors. The network\ntopology is constructed with a speciﬁc\
    \ combination of input variables with a number of\nhidden neuron layers. For instance,\
    \ the model of BPNN-VI-14 had hidden neuron layers\n(19,15), BPNN-GLCMF-5 needed\
    \ (6,10), BPNN-T-2 required (19,18), and BPNN-VI-GLCMF-\nT-21 desired (8,9). The\
    \ layout presented in Figure 10a depicts the BPNN-VI-14 model;\nthe training process\
    \ needed 119 steps to achieve a lower error function. The process has\nan overall\
    \ error of roughly 2.358. The learning process of the BPNN-GLCMF-5 model\n(Figure\
    \ 10b) demands 175 steps, containing an overall error of about 3.130. At the BPNN-T-\n\
    2 model (Figure 10c), the training process obligated 217 steps with a total error\
    \ of about\n0.960. At the BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21 model (Figure 10d), the learning\
    \ process requested\n422 steps, and the overall error was 0.0317.\n3.4. Canopy\
    \ Water Content Prediction and Validation\nFrom the results, the thermal features\
    \ had a high ranking for measuring the CWC of\nrice in contrast to VI and GLCMF.\
    \ The super thermal variables were linked to acceptable-\nlevel features as follows:\
    \ VI-GLCMF-T, VI-T, and GLCM-T. The VI-GLCMF-T features\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13,\
    \ 1785\n17 of 23\nwere the premium integration to ﬁlter the uppermost variables.\
    \ The neural network\nwas trained with the previous features (independent variables)\
    \ for predicting the CWC\n(dependent variable). The expected CWC values were then\
    \ compared with the reserved\nvalues not implemented for the neural network. Figure\
    \ 11 illustrates the scatter plots of\nobserved and predicted CWC in rice exploiting\
    \ the proposed features. This study evaluated\nmultivariate methods and compared\
    \ the results clearly, so the use of multivariate methods\ngreatly enhances predictability.\
    \ Independent validation can also be considered the most\nrobust method for evaluating\
    \ the accuracy of the regression model since validation data\nare not involved\
    \ in the model development process. The BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21 was\nthe ﬁrst best\
    \ predictive model as evidenced by the performance and showed a stronger\nrelationship\
    \ between the superlative features and CWC. These features involved in this\n\
    model are of great signiﬁcance for predicting water content. Its outputs with\
    \ R2 were\n0.984 (cross-validation) and 0.983 (test set). The BPNN-GLCMF-T-7 model\
    \ ranked second\nin performance. The R2 value was 0.982 and 0.972 in the cross-validation\
    \ and test set,\nrespectively. The BPNN-VI-T-16 was the third highest accurate\
    \ model (R2 = 0.956 and\n0.978 for cross-validation and test set, respectively).\
    \ Models constructed with individual\nfeatures of either VI or GLCMF had lower\
    \ performance expectations, while these features\ncombined with 2T achieved robust\
    \ forecasting. Otherwise, the residual value plays a vital\nrole to validate the\
    \ obtained regression model. The difference between the actual CWC\nand the predicted\
    \ CWC value is the residual. We calculated the residual value with the\nﬁrst three\
    \ higher models. At BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-21, −1.223% and 1.916% were the lowest\nand\
    \ highest residuals for the CWC prediction, respectively. At BPNN-VI-T-16, the\
    \ lowest\nand highest residuals were −1.128% and 1.380%, while the lowest residuals\
    \ of −0.583%\nand highest of 2.859% were calculated with BPNN-GLCMF-T-7.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n\

    rice in contrast to VI and GLCMF. The super thermal variables were linked to acceptable‐\n\
    level features as follows: VI‐GLCMF‐T, VI‐T, and GLCM‐T. The VI‐GLCMF‐T features \n\
    were the premium integration to filter the uppermost variables. The neural network was \n\
    trained with the previous features (independent variables) for predicting the CWC (de‐\n\
    pendent variable). The expected CWC values were then compared with the reserved val‐\n\
    ues not implemented for the neural network. Figure 11 illustrates the scatter plots of ob‐\n\
    served and predicted CWC in rice exploiting the proposed features. This study evaluated \n\
    multivariate methods and compared the results clearly, so the use of multivariate meth‐\n\
    ods greatly enhances predictability. Independent validation can also be considered the \n\
    most robust method for evaluating the accuracy of the regression model since validation \n\
    data are not involved in the model development process. The BPNN‐VI‐GLCMF‐T‐21 was \n\
    the first best predictive model as evidenced by the performance and showed a stronger \n\
    relationship between the superlative features and CWC. These features involved in this \n\
    model are of great significance for predicting water content. Its outputs with R2 were 0.984 \n\
    (cross‐validation) and 0.983 (test set). The BPNN‐GLCMF‐T‐7 model ranked second in \n\
    performance. The R2 value was 0.982 and 0.972 in the cross‐validation and test set, respec‐\n\
    tively. The BPNN‐VI‐T‐16 was the third highest accurate model (R2 = 0.956 and 0.978 for \n\

    the predicted CWC value is the residual. We calculated the residual value with the first \n\
    three higher models. At BPNN‐VI‐GLCM‐T‐21, −1.223% and 1.916% were the lowest and \n\
    highest residuals for the CWC prediction, respectively. At BPNN‐VI‐T‐16, the lowest and \n\
    highest residuals were −1.128% and 1.380%, while the lowest residuals of −0.583% and \n\

    Color and texture are two important aspects in digital imagery. Plant temperature is \n\
    also a remarkable tool in thermal imaging, which can be used as an indicator to identify a \n\
    plantʹs water condition. The plant color feature can be used for plant stress assessment \n\
    [63]. Texture analysis is significant in many areas such as remote sensing and its common \n\
    applications include image classification and pattern recognition [64]. These features of VI \n\
    and GLCMF were applied with a neural network for CWC quantification in rice. The re‐\n\
    sults confirmed that the neural network behavior with GLCMF was superior to VI for \n\
    predicting the water status of plants. This is similar to applying classification in the fol‐\n\
    lowing studies: Jana et al. [65], to classify eight varieties of fruits, and Dubey and Jalal [66], \n\
    to recognize diseases in fruits. Texture features performed better than color features for \n\
    classification via support vector machine algorithm with accuracy, 32.29% and 69.79% and \n\
    83.5% and 88.56%, respectively. Moreover, the thermal analysis results agreed with the \n\
    findings of Jones [67], who identified that water content or transpiration has an inverse \n\
    relationship with leaf temperature. The CWC values were highly influenced owing to the \n\

    \ best-combined\nfeatures: (a) VI-T-16, (b) GLCMF-T-7, and (c) VI-GLCMF-T-21.\n\
    4. Discussion\nColor and texture are two important aspects in digital imagery.\
    \ Plant temperature is\nalso a remarkable tool in thermal imaging, which can be\
    \ used as an indicator to identify a\nplant’s water condition. The plant color\
    \ feature can be used for plant stress assessment [63].\nTexture analysis is signiﬁcant\
    \ in many areas such as remote sensing and its common\napplications include image\
    \ classiﬁcation and pattern recognition [64]. These features of VI\nand GLCMF\
    \ were applied with a neural network for CWC quantiﬁcation in rice. The results\n\
    conﬁrmed that the neural network behavior with GLCMF was superior to VI for predicting\n\
    the water status of plants. This is similar to applying classiﬁcation in the following\
    \ studies:\nJana et al. [65], to classify eight varieties of fruits, and Dubey\
    \ and Jalal [66], to recognize\ndiseases in fruits. Texture features performed\
    \ better than color features for classiﬁcation\nvia support vector machine algorithm\
    \ with accuracy, 32.29% and 69.79% and 83.5% and\n88.56%, respectively. Moreover,\
    \ the thermal analysis results agreed with the ﬁndings of\nJones [67], who identiﬁed\
    \ that water content or transpiration has an inverse relationship\nwith leaf temperature.\
    \ The CWC values were highly inﬂuenced owing to the loss of water\nthrough transpiration;\
    \ CWSI and NRCT reﬂected normalized temperature values for the\ncrop. These results\
    \ are in agreement with Blum et al. [68], who indicated that the CWC\ndecreases\
    \ with increasing canopy temperature as a result of increased water stress.\n\
    The current work has allowed a more accurate determination of the water conditions\n\
    in rice, using the best-combined features extracted from RGB and thermal images.\
    \ The pro-\nposed approaches use all of the sensitive features to changes in the\
    \ CWC that greatly\nincrease the model performance. Our outcomes achieved greater\
    \ accuracy than those of\nAlchanatis et al. [69], who demonstrated that fusion\
    \ of thermal and visible imaging can\nprovide precise data on the crop water status\
    \ of grapevines, and the CWSI was highly\ncorrelated with measured stomatal conductance\
    \ with an R2 value of 0.97. The developed\nmodel outperformed Leinonen and Jones\
    \ [70], who stated that the combination of thermal\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n\
    20 of 23\nand visible imagery was a more accurate tool for estimating canopy temperature\
    \ and\ncould be used to identify water deﬁcit stress in a plant. They investigated\
    \ the relation-\nship between the measured stomatal conductance and the calculated\
    \ CWSI with an R2 of\n0.867. Likewise, the ﬁrst-order model of the BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-21\
    \ was very precise in\ncontrast to that of Sun et al. [71], who referred to a\
    \ reasonable model for computing CWC\nin wheat based on the ratio vegetation index\
    \ (RVI: 1605 and 1712 nm) and the normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI:\
    \ 1712 and 1605 nm), having the highest R2 and lowest\nRMSE in model calibration\
    \ and validation (R2c = 0.74 and 0.73; RMSEC = 0.026 and 0.027;\nR2v = 0.72 and\
    \ 0.71; RMSEV = 0.028 and 0.029). Furthermore, the proposed model is better\n\
    than Ge et al. [72], who concluded that leaf water content in maize at a pot-scale\
    \ is success-\nfully predicted with the hyperspectral images using the PLSR model\
    \ for two genotypes\nin model cross-validation (R2 = 0.81 and 0.92; RMSE = 3.7\
    \ and 2.3; MAPE = 3.6 and 2.2).\nThe created model achieved high performance compared\
    \ to Pandey et al. [73], who reported\nthat PLSR analysis can be performed to\
    \ predict the leaf water content of pot-grown maize\nand soybean plants with the\
    \ highest accuracy (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 1.62, and MAPE = 1.6%)\nfor validation.\
    \ In addition, this research is in agreement with the following study in that\n\
    the combination of color–GLCM–thermal features are high-quality variants in regression\n\
    or classiﬁcation applications. Bhole et al. [74] used different features such\
    \ as the color (CM:\ncolor moments and CCV: color coherence vector), texture (GLCMF),\
    \ and thermal (T) with a\nrandom forest for classiﬁcation of eleven categories\
    \ of fruits. The results showed that the\nmodel accuracies for integrating GLCM-T,\
    \ CM-T, CCV-T, and CM-CCV-GLCM-T features\nwere 84.26%, 91.17%, 92.95%, and 93.4%,\
    \ respectively.\nFinally, remote and proximal sensing images acquired with high-resolution\
    \ cameras,\nmounted at ground level or on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), have\
    \ spatial resolutions\nof a few centimeters. These images can provide sufﬁcient\
    \ accurate information for both\nassessing plant water status in the ﬁeld and\
    \ implementing appropriate irrigation man-\nagement strategies [75]. Thus, this\
    \ work can assist in improving inexpensive, effective\nhigh-throughput phenotyping\
    \ platforms for large numbers of breeding plants at different\nlevels of irrigation.\
    \ A practical sharing of research may improve site-speciﬁc rice irrigation\nmanagement\
    \ through designing an intelligent irrigation system based on the best-proposed\n\
    model. The methodology of this study that relied on ground-based cameras can be\
    \ scaled\nup to UAV-based applications to increase productivity [76] and monitor\
    \ the water condition\nof crops in large-scale areas.\n5. Conclusions\nEstimation\
    \ of canopy water content (CWC) is highly important in precision plant\nreproduction\
    \ and agricultural development. Low-cost outdoor cameras, such as visible\nand\
    \ thermal imaging systems, would be an applicable implement for predicting water\n\
    content in the plant. Therefore, the present study explored the ability to incorporate\
    \ top-\nlevel features retrieved from visible and thermal imaging with a back-propagation\
    \ neural\nnetwork (BPNN) to adopt a three-stage model of CWC for rice. Hand-crafted\
    \ features,\nincluding 20 vegetation indices (VI), 6 GLCM texture features (GLCMF),\
    \ and 2 thermal\nindicators (T), were identiﬁed for analysis. The experimental\
    \ results showed that the\nproposed model of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T provided effective\
    \ recognition of CWC in the\nrice crop. Expectation accuracy increased to 99.4%\
    \ by conjoining 21 superlative features.\nAt hidden neuron layers (8,9), the R2\
    \ raised to 0.983 with an RMSE of 0.599. The models\nwith separate features performed\
    \ lower than the best built-in features. Their corresponding\nvalues with prediction\
    \ R2 were 0.632 (RMSE = 2.788), 0.679 (RMSE = 2.607), and 0.803\n(RMSE = 2.043)\
    \ using 14VI, 5GLCM, and 2T, respectively. Ultimately, the superlative model\n\
    has a high level of conﬁdence and reliable outcomes. In the future, this tool\
    \ may open an\navenue for rapid, high-throughput assessments of the water condition\
    \ of plants, as well as\nbeing equally important for procedures related to agricultural\
    \ water management.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n21 of 23\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: The scientific grasp of the distribution and dynamics of land use and\
    \ land cover (LULC) changes\nin South America is still limited. This is especially\
    \ true for the continent’s hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry\nsubhumid zones,\
    \ collectively known as drylands, which are under-represented ecosystems that\
    \ are highly\nthreatened by climate change and human activity. Maps of LULC in\
    \ drylands are, thus, essential in order\nto investigate their vulnerability to\
    \ both natural and anthropogenic impacts. This paper comprehensively\nreviewed\
    \ existing mapping initiatives of South America’s drylands to discuss the main\
    \ knowledge gaps, as\nwell as central methodological trends and challenges, for\
    \ advancing our understanding of LULC dynamics\nin these fragile ecosystems. Our\
    \ review centered on five essential aspects of remote-sensing-based LULC\nmapping:\
    \ scale, datasets, classification techniques, number of classes (legends), and\
    \ validation protocols.\nThe results indicated that the Landsat sensor dataset\
    \ was the most frequently used, followed by AVHRR\nand MODIS, and no studies used\
    \ recently available high-resolution satellite sensors. Machine learning\nalgorithms\
    \ emerged as a broadly employed methodology for land cover classification in South\
    \ America.\nStill, such advancement in classification methods did not yet reflect\
    \ in the upsurge of detailed mapping of\ndryland vegetation types and functional\
    \ groups. Among the 23 mapping initiatives, the number of LULC\nclasses in their\
    \ respective legends varied from 6 to 39, with 1 to 14 classes representing drylands.\
    \ Validation\nprotocols included fieldwork and automatic processes with sampling\
    \ strategies ranging from solely\nrandom to stratified approaches. Finally, we\
    \ discussed the opportunities and challenges for advancing\nresearch on desertification,\
    \ climate change, fire mapping, and the resilience of dryland populations. By\n\
    and large, multi-level studies for dryland vegetation mapping are still lacking.\n\

    \ characterized by water deﬁcit, high spatially and temporally\nvariable precipitation,\
    \ and seasonal climatic extremes [1–4]. Globally, drylands consist of\nforests\
    \ (18%), barren land (28%), grasslands (25%), croplands (14%), and other wooded\n\
    lands (10%) [5]. They cover about 41% of the Earth’s surface and harbor more than\
    \ a third of\nthe world’s human population [6]. Drylands also have high ecological\
    \ importance globally,\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14030736\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n2 of 30\n\
    as they contribute to about 40% of global net primary productivity (NPP) [7],\
    \ host 35% of\nthe biodiversity hotspots worldwide [2], and occupy 1.1 billion\
    \ hectares (27%) of the forest\narea [5]. These environments are critically important\
    \ to society yet exceptionally vulnerable\nto climate change and desertiﬁcation\
    \ [8,9].\nDrylands’ vulnerability to predicted increases in global temperatures,\
    \ as well as the\nseverity of drought events and reduced rainfall in many regions\
    \ [6], can lead to a substantial\ndecline in land productivity and ecosystem functions\
    \ and services, accelerating the deserti-\nﬁcation process [10]. The combined\
    \ effects of climate change and desertiﬁcation threaten\nplant species’ richness,\
    \ which sustains dryland ecosystems’ multifunctionality, such as\ncarbon storage\
    \ and nutrient cycling [11]. Recent estimates suggest that 6% of the world’s\n\
    drylands have undergone desertiﬁcation, with a further 20% at high desertiﬁcation\
    \ risk [12],\naggravating the threat of malnutrition, economic hardship, migratory\
    \ movements, and\npoverty [13,14]. As a result, desertiﬁcation has become a globally\
    \ deﬁned environmental\nissue [15] and one of the most signiﬁcant environmental\
    \ challenges nowadays [16].\nThe preservation of drylands’ woody vegetation increases\
    \ the protection of these ecosys-\ntems against desertification [17] and enhances\
    \ their resilience to climate change [18]. Con-\nservative action is critical\
    \ to avoid overgrazing and woodcutting, two major desertification\nvectors [19].\
    \ On top of that, dryland woodlands are key ecosystems to regulate the global\n\
    carbon cycle [18,20] as their high variability contributes to short-term alterations\
    \ in carbon\nstock [21]. In addition, drylands play a determining role in various\
    \ essential ecosystem pro-\ncesses and related abiotic patterns [22], besides\
    \ providing significantly relevant resources for\nlocal livelihoods and their\
    \ food security. Hence, accurate and up-to-date information on the\nstatus of\
    \ dryland vegetation and subsidizing resources from technical–scientific innovation\
    \ in\nthe Remote Sensing (RS) framework are necessary for efficient policymaking.\n\
    Drylands in South America represent approximately 31% of the continent’s total\
    \ land\narea and 8.7% of the global drylands [5]. Despite its large distribution\
    \ and ecological impor-\ntance, few studies have directed attention to mapping\
    \ land cover in drylands [23–25]. Current\nRS-based studies have been mainly developed\
    \ for humid tropical forests (with closed canopy\nand high biomass, e.g., the\
    \ Amazon) and are unsuitable for detecting, mapping, and monitor-\ning drylands\
    \ [26]. The predominance of sparse vegetation and the heterogeneity of vegetation\n\
    composition, marked by the co-existence of trees, shrubs, and grasses, is the\
    \ main challenge\nto remote sensing studies focused on drylands [27]. Moreover,\
    \ the limited number of South\nAmerican drylands’ land use and land cover (LULC)\
    \ mapping poses limitations for studying\nthe Earth’s environmental systems [28,29],\
    \ managing water resources and ecosystems, as well\nas understanding and modeling\
    \ associated ecological and climate impacts [30]. In addition,\nintegrating information\
    \ from different remotely collected data sources remains overlooked,\nespecially\
    \ for studying the continent’s drylands. Therefore, accurate and timely LULC classifi-\n\
    cation is needed to overcome the challenge of differentiating heterogeneous dryland\
    \ areas [31]\nand to monitor the loss of these fragile ecosystems in South America\
    \ [32].\nThe information gap is also explained by the use of coarse spatial resolution\
    \ satellite\ndata to produce the previous LULC maps for global assessments [33].\
    \ As a result, global or\ncontinental maps do not provide sufﬁcient details to\
    \ represent regional dryland ecosystems\nof South America spatially. Even at regional\
    \ scales, the heterogeneity, higher spectral\nvariability, and relatively low\
    \ radiative signals of drylands make mapping their vegetation\nand structure challenging\
    \ [34]. Therefore, mapping South American drylands is essential\nto monitor the\
    \ status of speciﬁc land cover types of these highly threatened ecosystems\nregionally\
    \ and globally. Consequently, updating the state-of-the-art of South American\n\
    dryland mapping contributes to understanding the impact of LULC changes on each\
    \ type\nof vegetation formation and how they inﬂuence the global energy balance,\
    \ CO2 budget,\nand hydrological cycles.\nThe objective of this study was to identify\
    \ existing mapping initiatives of South Amer-\nica’s drylands and discuss how\
    \ they advance our understanding of LULC dynamics in\nthese ecosystems, what the\
    \ main knowledge gaps are, as well as the major methodological\ntrends and challenges.\
    \ For that, we conducted a literature review focused on ﬁve essen-\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 736\n3 of 30\ntial components of RS-based land cover mapping: scale,\
    \ satellite datasets, classiﬁcation\ntechniques, number of classes (legends),\
    \ and validation protocols. By analyzing current\nmapping efforts, we discussed\
    \ the opportunities and challenges related to adequately\nmapping LULC in drylands\
    \ to advance research on desertiﬁcation, climate change, ﬁre\nmapping, and the\
    \ resilience of dryland populations.\n2. Deﬁnition of Drylands\nAridity is a long-term\
    \ hydrologic and climatic condition of water scarcity. Numerous\naridity indices\
    \ have been proposed and widely applied in the scientific literature to quantify\n\
    the degree of dryness at a given location and, thus, spatially delimit arid climatic\
    \ zones [35–37].\nThe aridity index (see Equation (1)) represents the counterbalancing\
    \ between natural moisture\ninputs and losses [38]:\nAI =\nP\nPET ,\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ AI corresponds to the Aridity Index, P to precipitation (mm), and PET to potential\n\
    evapotranspiration (mm), calculated based on the Penman–Monteith method (see [39]\
    \ for\nfurther details).\nThis index is considered biologically accurate in climates\
    \ highly inﬂuenced by sea-\nsonality [40], and it is widely used to deﬁne the\
    \ location of drylands. From a general\nperspective, the overlapping of the multiple\
    \ existing indices would result in an agreement\nover the general location of\
    \ drylands. Regions conventionally deﬁned as drylands typically\nhave low AI,\
    \ derived from low annual rainfall and high potential evaporation [7], and\nscarce\
    \ vegetation [41]. The water deﬁcit in drylands constrains the production of crops\
    \ and\npasture, signiﬁcantly impacting the livelihood of local populations. There\
    \ are two main\nfactors responsible for changing dryland vegetation: anthropogenic\
    \ climate change and\nland-use practices [12].\nThe exact extension of drylands\
    \ can change according to their water limitation degree\nand the criteria adopted\
    \ to access this condition [42]. For our review, we are following\nthe United\
    \ Nations Environmental Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre\n(UNEP-WCMC)\
    \ delimitation of drylands [43], which are areas with AI lower than 0.65. This\n\
    deﬁnition is widely known and formally adopted by several institutions [6]. The\
    \ United\nNations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) [38]\
    \ proposed the\nfollowing classiﬁcation based on aridity (excluding humid areas\
    \ for having an AI > 0.65):\n1.\nHyperarid zone (AI < 0.05): areas with deﬁcient\
    \ and irregular seasonal rainfall and\nperennial vegetation restricted to shrubs\
    \ in riverbeds. It is relevant to mention that we\nadjusted the boundary between\
    \ hyperarid and arid zones to ﬁt the deﬁnition we are\nfollowing, given by UNEP-WCMC.\
    \ UNESCO originally adopted a more restrictive\nthreshold for this zone (AI <\
    \ 0.03);\n2.\nArid zone (0.05 ≤ AI < 0.2): areas with annual rainfall between\
    \ 80 and 350 mm, and\nperennial vegetation consisting of woody succulent, thorny\
    \ or leaﬂess shrubs;\n3.\nSemiarid zone (0.2 ≤ AI < 0.5): areas with mean annual\
    \ rainfall between 30 and 800 mm\nin the summer and between 200 and 500 mm in\
    \ the winter at the Mediterranean and\ntropical latitudes; vegetation is composed\
    \ of steppes, savannas, and scrubs;\n4.\nDry Subhumid zone (0.5 ≤ AI < 0.65):\
    \ areas that comprise primarily tropical savannas\nand steppes.\nOf the approximately\
    \ 37 million square kilometers classiﬁed as semiarid and arid zones\nworldwide,\
    \ 25.56 million (69%) refer to rangelands [44], where native vegetation either\n\
    has been grazed or has the potential to be used to produce grazing livestock [45].\
    \ These\nlandscapes occur in annual and perennial grasslands, shrublands, savannas,\
    \ woodlands,\nand deserts [46]. In South America, Patagonian ecosystems from Argentina\
    \ and Chile\ncollectively constitute one of the world’s largest rangeland areas\
    \ [47]. By and large, it is\nworth mentioning that not all rangelands are in drylands.\n\

    South America is the fourth largest continent worldwide, occupying 12% of the\
    \ Earth’s\nland surface (17.8 million km2), with several regions and land cover\
    \ types. Drylands are\ndistributed among South American countries in different\
    \ quantities, representing almost 80%\nof the Argentinian territory [10]. Table\
    \ 1 lists the proportion of drylands to the whole country,\ncontinental, and global\
    \ areas of each South American country where these ecosystems are\nfound, at three\
    \ different scales [10]. Guyana and Uruguay have a minimal portion of drylands\n\
    covering their territory, while French Guyana and Suriname are the only countries\
    \ within\nSouth America where drylands (or potential ones) are absent.\nTable\

    \ subtypes are recognized\nin South America (Figure 1), covering an estimated\
    \ 5.1 million km2 [10]. Semiarid is the\nmost common dryland subtype (46%), followed\
    \ by the dry subhumid (41%), arid (8%), and\nhyperarid (5%) zones [5]. The semiarid\
    \ zone represents 14% of South America, with its\nhighest country-level proportions\
    \ found in Argentina (38%) and Brazil (9%) [10]. The most\ncritical water-stressed\
    \ subtypes are found in arid areas largely distributed over Argentina\n(70%) and\
    \ the hyperarid regions predominantly in Chile (over 60%) and Peru (35%) [10].\n\
    Drylands in South America are primarily characterized by savannas, shrublands,\n\
    woodlands, and grasslands [48], generally grouped into biomes. The high diversity\
    \ of\nvegetation types is distributed over several South American ecoregions.\
    \ The Caatinga is\nthe driest forest of the continent, consisting of xeric shrubland\
    \ and thorn woodland [49].\nThe Llanos (plains) del Orinoco is the second largest\
    \ ecosystem of northern South America,\nencompassing parts of Venezuela and Colombia\
    \ [50,51]. The sub-tropical shrubland in\ncentral Argentina, known as Espinal,\
    \ is considered one of the most vulnerable ecoregions\nand is prone to LULC changes\
    \ [52]. Concerning drylands that fall within the hyperarid\nclassiﬁcation, the\
    \ Atacama Desert of northern Chile is broadly acknowledged as the driest\nglobally\
    \ [44]. Thus, it is used as one of the references for numerical thresholds for\
    \ the\nextremely arid or hyperarid categories of AIs [53].\nSouth America’s dry\
    \ forest is less popular than the tropical rainforest [5]. However, the\ncontinent\
    \ is predominantly covered with dry forests, including Tumbes-Piura in Ecuador\
    \ and\nPeru, the Cauca, Magdalena, and Patía Valleys in Colombia, and parts of\
    \ the Tumbes-Chocó-\nMagdalena biodiversity hotspots. Dry forests in South America\
    \ occupy 199 million hectares,\nequivalent to 5% of the global forests and 18%\
    \ of the worldwide dryland forest area [5].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n5 of\

    4. Literature Search and Selection of Sources\nWe performed a comprehensive review\
    \ focused on identifying RS-based literature\non LULC mapping initiatives of South\
    \ America at various scales with an unlimited\nstarting date until August 2021.\
    \ We retrieved global, continental, national, and regional\nmapping studies from\
    \ the Clarivate Analytics Web of Science scientiﬁc database (WoS,\nwebofscience.com),\
    \ last accessed 15 October 2021. We only considered peer-reviewed docu-\nments\
    \ to ensure the authenticity and quality of the outcomes. Identifying these mappings\n\
    created the basis for discussion around four issues of high relevance to drylands\
    \ research:\ndesertiﬁcation, climate change, ﬁre, and population.\nThe terms applied\
    \ to the search were ‘Remote Sensing’, ‘Drylands’, and ‘South Amer-\nica’, and\
    \ it was based on each study’s abstract/title/keywords. Articles about grasslands,\n\
    savanna, shrubland, woodlands, and rangelands located in South America were more\n\
    relevant for the search. Additionally, to increase the accuracy of the search,\
    \ we ﬁltered\nthe initial search using the words ‘Global’, ‘Map’, and ‘Mapping’,\
    \ as well as the names\nof countries and dryland ecoregions in South America.\
    \ While screening, we selected the\narticles based on their titles, scope, objectives,\
    \ and study area. The main goal was to identify\nRS-based vegetation mapping studies\
    \ considering any portion of South America’s drylands.\nWe then gathered information\
    \ regarding ﬁve essential components of RS-based land cover\nmapping: mapping\
    \ coverage, satellite datasets, classiﬁcation techniques, legends, and\nvalidation\
    \ protocols.\nInitially, a total of 4142 publications from peer-reviewed journals\
    \ were retained from\nthe search process using the word “Drylands”. However, this\
    \ total included all dryland\nregions across the world. By reﬁning the process\
    \ using multiple combinations and disre-\ngarding topics not related to remote\
    \ sensing, we reviewed 59 papers. We added 25 studies\nto the initially retrieved\
    \ sources after looking at their reference lists in the revision process,\nbringing\
    \ the total number of sources used in this study to 84 papers. We disregarded\
    \ grey\nliterature because it consists primarily of reports that are not peer-reviewed\
    \ and often not\nwritten in English.\n4.1. Mapping Initiatives in South American\
    \ Drylands Using Remote Sensing\nFrom the 84 studies we reviewed, we identified\
    \ 23 initiatives that produced maps\ncomprising South America, either entirely\
    \ or partially (Figure 2). Among these initiatives,\nabout 35% are global, 26%\
    \ continental, 26% regional, and 13% national (with maps only for\nBrazil and\
    \ Chile). We did not find country level maps for Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia,\
    \ and\nPeru, countries with a considerable presence of drylands. Regionally, only\
    \ a few studies\nfocused on mapping specific ecoregions, such as the Gran Chaco,\
    \ Espinal, Llanos del Orinoco,\nand Caatinga. The latter is part of the country-level\
    \ map produced by the MapBiomas project\n(www.mapbiomas.org, accessed on 30 September\
    \ 2021), which has specific working groups to\nmap each Brazilian biome, despite\
    \ being published as a national map.\nSeveral initiatives have mapped South America’s\
    \ land cover at the continental level\nsince the early 1900s [58], mostly from\
    \ multiple sources and built from techniques other than\nRS-based ones. All the\
    \ vegetation maps from the 1970s and 1980s hold a climate element\nin the classiﬁcation\
    \ scheme and, therefore, symbolize a mix of current and potential land\ncover\
    \ [59]. Since the late 1980s, South America’s vegetation maps have been produced\
    \ from\ndata collected systematically by Earth-Observation (E.O.) satellites (Table\
    \ 2). They beneﬁt\nfrom homogeneous observations across the continent and provide\
    \ improved spatial detail.\nHowever, they do not share the same thematic richness\
    \ as earlier products [59].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n7 of 30\n \nand Peru,\

    \ which has specific \nworking groups to map each Brazilian biome, despite being\
    \ published as a national map. \n \nFigure 2. Timeline of RS-based mapping efforts\

    \ America’s vegetation maps have been pro-\nduced from data collected systematically\
    \ by Earth-Observation (E.O.) satellites (Table 2). \nThey benefit from homogeneous\
    \ observations across the continent and provide improved \nspatial detail. However,\
    \ they do not share the same thematic richness as earlier products \n[59]. \n\
    The first RS-based map of South America was produced by the University of Mary-\n\
    land. This product aimed primarily to provide improved information for the modeling\
    \ \ncommunity [60]. After a seven-year gap, the University of Maryland also produced\
    \ the \nfirst global map. In the 2000s maps, the interval between the release\
    \ of new LULC maps \nfor South America reduced, and the first regional LULC map\
    \ was produced in 2004 for \nLlanos del Orinoco, in Venezuela. This map remains\
    \ the most significant contribution \nfrom RS to the country, which still lacks\
    \ a country-level map published in the scientific \nliterature. Around a decade\
    \ later, the first 30 m resolution global land-cover map from \nLandsat (TM and\
    \ ETM+) increased the level of detail for observation and monitoring at \nthe\
    \ global level [61], which was later improved [62]. The 2010s saw an increase\
    \ in the \nnumber of maps at various scales, with an average of one map published\
    \ every year. In \nFigure 2. Timeline of RS-based mapping efforts that comprise\

    \ so RS-based observations\nof LULC are only available from the last 40 years.\
    \ In the 1990s and early 2000s, both MODIS\nand AVHRR were used to develop global\
    \ land cover classification at the 1 km pixel resolution.\nNowadays, multiple\
    \ Earth observation datasets are available, with distinct spectral, spatial,\n\
    and temporal resolutions [85]. Even with freely available fine-resolution datasets,\
    \ dryland\nmapping initiatives (Table 2), including the most recent ones, used\
    \ medium to coarse spatial\nresolution satellite imagery. Therefore, maps including\
    \ drylands can be found at 1 km (AVHRR,\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n9 of 30\n\

    \ and how they affect \nproductivity at the regional and local levels. Since 2008,\
    \ Landsat data became free and \nopen, facilitating the application of its consistent\
    \ imagery format in various fields [87]. \nSome studies chose the MODIS dataset\
    \ possibly due to its temporally denser availa-\nbility compared to Landsat. The\
    \ MODIS-derived products used in dryland mappings \nwere MOD13Q1 Vegetation Indices\

    \ a combination of multiple MODIS products: MCD43A2, \nMCD43A4, MCD12Y3, MCD44W,\

    \ are not time-series based. The exceptions are two initiatives that \nrelease\
    \ annual maps from the MODIS Land Cover Type Product (global level) and Map-\n\
    Biomas (country level). MapBiomas has mapped the most extensive period compared\
    \ to \nall existing initiatives at the national level, with yearly maps starting\
    \ from 2017 and going \nbackward to 1985, spanning more than 30 years of coverage.\
    \ \n4.3. LULC Classification Methods \nRS-based classification is recognized as\
    \ the most efficient method of LULC mapping \n[88]. It has mainly been employed\
    \ using a pixel-by-pixel approach, even though cloud \ncover remains a major cause\
    \ of missing data [89]. Corrective pre-processing is a funda-\nmental first step\
    \ to minimize the cloud effects and other sources of noise and avoid inter-\n\
    pretation problems. For instance, there was a consensus between authors in the\
    \ reviewed \nstudies that atmospheric correction is a requirement to improve the\
    \ retrieval of surface \nreflectance, vegetation indices, and many ecosystems’\
    \ structural and functional proper-\nties, such as leaf area index (LAI). It is\
    \ important to note that our review here is focused \non aspects related to classifier\
    \ development, even though there are other requirements for \nimage classification\
    \ (i.e., legend definition, input data generation, and sample data prep-\naration).\
    \ \nThe studies at the global/continental level described in Table 2 were notably\
    \ different \nfrom the dryland’s spatial distribution shown in the reference map\
    \ (Figure 1). Such a gap \nmay be a consequence of the lack of compatibility among\
    \ all satellite datasets and the \nclassification approaches used. Among the techniques,\
    \ supervised classification was the \nmost applied, among which machine learning\
    \ algorithms prevailed (Figure 4). Random \nFigure 3. Proportional representation\

    \ use of time-series vegetation indices as an\nadditional source in the mapping\
    \ process was a trend in all existing coarse-resolution global\nland cover products.\
    \ The two main indices were the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 736\n11 of 30\nIndex (NDVI) [66,69,70] and the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI) [67,70]. However, each of\nthese indices has advantages and disadvantages\
    \ for in terms of better representing drylands\nin a map. Among these indices,\
    \ EVI [92] responds well to chlorophyll, quantiﬁes water-use\nefﬁciency, and tolerates\
    \ background reﬂectance, but does not vary much over drylands.\nNDVI [93] is suitable\
    \ to monitor phenology and long time series, but is not sensitive\nto woody components.\
    \ Once used as metrics to run machine learning-based algorithms\n(e.g., Random\
    \ Forest), these indices tend to increase the accuracy of classiﬁcations given\n\
    that reliable training samples are available. In the scientiﬁc literature, other\
    \ indices not\npreviously used for mapping drylands are worth testing to classify\
    \ drylands, such as the\nNormalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) [94] and the\
    \ Modiﬁed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (MSAVI) [95].\nThe pros and cons of\
    \ using each of these indices will reﬂect the classiﬁer’s ability to\nidentify\
    \ the diverse types of sparse vegetation formations in drylands. That is mainly\
    \ be-\ncause estimating vegetation cover depends on the inverse relationship between\
    \ reﬂectance\nand plant cover or spectral indices and vegetation greenness. In\
    \ the wavelength range\nrelevant for plant detection (between 400 and 2500 nm),\
    \ the main canopy-related factors\ninﬂuencing the reﬂected radiance are the optical\
    \ properties of both the vegetation and\nthe environment around the canopy (e.g.,\
    \ soil and atmosphere) and how these elements\nare arranged in the vegetation\
    \ canopy [96]. In desert environments, changes in the mix of\npalatable and unpalatable\
    \ grasses and bush dominance negatively impact changes in the\nvegetation structure\
    \ [97]. Thus, conducting studies using different vegetation indices and\ninforming\
    \ the positive outcomes, setbacks, and failed results may help advance the iden-\n\
    tiﬁcation of the heterogeneity of vegetation formations in drylands. Unmixing\
    \ methods,\nsuch as those used by MapBiomas and INPE, can overcome some of these\
    \ difﬁculties when\ndealing with complex systems. The spectral mixture analysis\
    \ (SMA), which is an image\ntransformation technique rather than a classiﬁer [98],\
    \ retrieves the relative abundance of\neach pixel’s endmember based on the inversion\
    \ of a mixture model [34]. In this regard,\nthe sensitiveness of the multiple\
    \ endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) [99] to\nchanges in the spectral\
    \ albedo makes this method a suitable choice for drylands [34].\n4.4. Classiﬁcation\
    \ Schemes\nThe lack of standardization is one of the main issues for classiﬁcation\
    \ legends [60]. This\nis particularly true for drylands. A common issue observed\
    \ in the legends of most global\nmaps is that woody vegetation in drylands lacks\
    \ adequate representation because it often\ndoes not fulﬁll the criteria of ‘forest’\
    \ [48]. In addition, some drylands are represented in\nglobal LULC maps as large\
    \ homogeneous areas and do not reﬂect the reality of vegetation\ndistribution\
    \ in these landscapes, as proved by regional-scale maps [84]. Detecting speciﬁc\n\
    dryland formations is challenging at lower resolutions as each pixel contains\
    \ more than one\nland cover type [80]. Such spectral confusion impacts classiﬁcation\
    \ scheme decisions and\nomits typical dryland formations from the ﬁnal maps. Overall,\
    \ our work found classiﬁcation\nschemes ranging from 1 to 14 dryland classes in\
    \ each one of the 23 maps analyzed. A more\ndetailed analysis of each map’s legend\
    \ allowed us to detect approximately 50 different\nnames for dryland classes.\
    \ After grouping similar classes (e.g., herbaceous vegetation and\nnatural grassland,\
    \ or barren lands and deserts), we found 16 dryland vegetation types in\nSouth\
    \ American maps, among which grasslands, shrublands, mixed forest, open forests,\n\
    and (woody) savannas are the most common (Figure 5).\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n\

    \ the spatial distribution of dryland vegetation across South America at\na higher\
    \ level of detail is of utmost relevance for advancing research and governance\
    \ in\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n14 of 30\ndifferent topics. LULC mapping can\
    \ help solve important issues that affect humanity and\nmethodological advancements\
    \ should be tuned to the current socioecological challenges.\nSouth American mapping\
    \ initiatives contributed to understanding the implications of major\ntransformations,\
    \ at all scales, taking place over dryland ecosystems and populations, but\nthere\
    \ is still much to advance. We selected four topics often addressed in South American\n\
    dryland mapping publications to exemplify how RS methodological advancements can\n\
    help to address relevant environmental problems drylands face nowadays: desertiﬁca-\n\
    tion, climate change, ﬁre mapping, and the resilience of the population in these\
    \ fragile\necosystems.\n5.1. Desertiﬁcation\nLand degradation is deﬁned as the\
    \ reduction in or loss of land’s biological or economic\nproductivity [6]. The\
    \ United Nations Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD)\nrefers to desertiﬁcation\
    \ as land degradation in drylands [102], among which semiarid and\narid regions\
    \ are particularly vulnerable. This long-lasting process is driven by the complex\n\
    interactions of anthropogenic and climate-induced factors [7]. Although some forms\
    \ of\ndesertiﬁcation may be irreversible, policy and technical solutions combined\
    \ with local and\ntraditional knowledge sources can put these areas back on the\
    \ track of productivity and\nsustainability [13].\nConsidering the absence of\
    \ a standard assessment and monitoring system of deser-\ntiﬁcation (either for\
    \ South America or globally) [103], a recent low-resolution estimate\nputs South\
    \ America among the most affected continents worldwide. Argentina and Brazil\n\
    have the highest spatial extents of drylands experiencing desertiﬁcation processes\
    \ [12], and\nArgentina is specially affected with negative repercussions to varying\
    \ degrees [104,105].\nIn Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Chile, the problem affected\
    \ between 27% and 43% of the\nland area [13]. Few assessments were produced to\
    \ map problem areas, develop indica-\ntors, and evaluate political and economic\
    \ needs to control desertiﬁcation [106,107]. In this\nregard, the NDVI is often\
    \ the primary RS metric [108,109], considered one of the most\nrobust and independent\
    \ alternatives for analyzing land productivity [102], even with its\nlimitations.\
    \ However, quantifying desertiﬁcation remains a difﬁcult task given the diversity\n\
    and complexity of its processes [110]. There is also a lack of agreement about\
    \ tipping points\nthat, once reached, could lead to irreversible degradation over\
    \ dryland ecosystems [111] or\nmake restoration economically unfeasible. As the\
    \ information on desertiﬁcation in South\nAmerica remains insufﬁcient [112], some\
    \ questions arise. How can RS accurately map the\nextent of desertiﬁcation in\
    \ South America? Which countries in South America have been\nmostly affected by\
    \ this problem? What indicators directly measured by RS could deliver\nbetter\
    \ information about the status of dryland degradation?\nAn essential ﬁrst step\
    \ to tackle these issues is coupling RS with country-level biophys-\nical and\
    \ socioeconomic data, enabling the development of a baseline and an integrated\n\
    database. It is also important to involve regional experts and affected peoples\
    \ in a broadly\ninclusive process to select indicators of desertiﬁcation. Good\
    \ results were achieved using\nsatellite-based imagery analysis on vegetation\
    \ loss, erosion [113], and drought monitor-\ning [114], complemented by ground-based\
    \ observations, which tend to provide consistent\nand cost-effective data to measure\
    \ desertiﬁcation. Careful calibration is also an important\naspect, although many\
    \ cloud-free images are available for drylands as they experience\nlow humidity\
    \ [115]. Such an advantage allows for consistent high-resolution imagery-\nbased\
    \ validation protocols on desertiﬁcation products against ﬁeld data [116]. Therefore,\n\
    South American countries must have access to affordable satellite imagery to effectively\n\
    implement integrated practices for mapping, assessing, and quantifying desertiﬁcation.\n\
    In the scope of RS, a signiﬁcant challenge is to segregate sparsely vegetated\
    \ areas\nfrom those degraded by human impact [117]. A pressing issue is the differentiation\
    \ of\nrangelands from converted pasturelands, as evidenced by a recent comparison\
    \ of the\nworld’s land degradation datasets [117]. In South America, Southern\
    \ Brazil, Uruguay,\nand the Pampas of Argentina [117], where natural grasslands\
    \ are abundant, showed the\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n15 of 30\nmost signiﬁcant\
    \ disagreements. Further contributions from the RS community to this issue\ninclude\
    \ correlations of LULC changes to the ecosystem’s carrying capacity indicators.\n\
    5.2. Climate Change\nOverall, tropical dryland areas have faced temperature rises\
    \ superior to the global\naverage [118], and projections indicate that, during\
    \ the 21st century, warming of 3.2–4 ◦C\nmay occur over these areas (~44% higher\
    \ temperature increase than in humid regions) [115].\nMoreover, climate models\
    \ also predict changes in the intensity and frequency of drought\nevents [119,120],\
    \ strongly affecting water-limited drylands. Anthropogenic LULC changes\ninteract\
    \ with the global climate system through complex feedback mechanisms. For ex-\n\
    ample, accelerated desertiﬁcation releases an estimated 300 million tons of carbon\
    \ to the\natmosphere yearly [6]. The emitted CO2 contributes to increasing global\
    \ temperatures that,\nin turn, can drive the degradation process and desertiﬁcation.\
    \ In South America, develop-\ning countries with large dryland areas such as Argentina,\
    \ Bolivia, Paraguay, and Chile are\nparticularly vulnerable to climate change\
    \ [121]. Even though increased atmospheric CO2\ncan fertilize drylands and cause\
    \ vegetation greenness, water scarcity remains the leading\nclimate change vector\
    \ in most places, such as the Brazilian semiarid [118]. As the world\nfaces novel\
    \ and dynamic climate conditions, reliable and up-to-date mapping products for\n\
    monitoring droughts are of utmost relevance.\nAccording to the Global Climate\
    \ Observing System (GCOS), 26 out of 50 essential\nclimate variables (ECV) highly\
    \ depend on satellite observations for more consistent cli-\nmate studies [122].\
    \ Aerosol properties, albedo, carbon dioxide, leaf area index, and ﬁre\ndisturbance\
    \ are among the variables of high relevance for dryland climate-related studies.\n\
    These variables, once measured on the ground, are important to correct satellite\
    \ RS re-\ntrievals [123]. Thus, map developers should ensure that classiﬁcation\
    \ schemes are detailed\nenough to suit the climate model’s requirements [124].\
    \ Such variables also contribute to the\nmapping of areas of ecological tension\
    \ and the investigation of possible effects associated\nwith anthropogenic climate\
    \ change over drylands. In South America, RS mapping of LULC,\ncombined with climate\
    \ models, can improve our understanding of the land-atmosphere\nfeedback mechanisms\
    \ in drylands. It can also provide answers to complex questions at\nregional and\
    \ local scales. Which ecosystems, populations, and economic activities are more\n\
    vulnerable to climate change? Furthermore, how can climate change be adapted to,\
    \ and\ngreenhouse gas emissions be mitigated in South America’s drylands?\nWhile\
    \ answering these questions remains challenging, geoengineering techniques\nassociated\
    \ with solar radiation management and CO2 removal reveal feasible alternatives\
    \ to\nminimize climate change-related economic setbacks and limit global warming\
    \ [125]. Over\ndrylands, solar energy is a high-incident renewable resource during\
    \ the whole year [126].\nConsequently, investigating potential areas for installing\
    \ photovoltaic systems is a rele-\nvant mitigation strategy to combat climate\
    \ change and generate income for vulnerable\npopulations. In the scope of RS,\
    \ how can satellite sensors support land assessment and\nmonitoring for solar\
    \ energy development in the drylands of South America? A research\nstudy conducted\
    \ in drylands of the United States [127] successfully mapped solar energy\npotential\
    \ using very high-resolution imagery and multiple vegetation indices (e.g., MSAVI\n\
    and NDVI).\n5.3. Fire Mapping\nNatural and induced ﬁres are drivers of soil conditions,\
    \ land cover, and biodiversity\nchanges. Drylands are susceptible to frequent\
    \ ﬁres [128–130]. They are pyrophytic open\necosystems [131], which, combined\
    \ with topography, fuel composition, and ignitability,\ncan accelerate the spread\
    \ of ﬁre and the probability of the occurrence of wildﬁre [132,133].\nGlobally,\
    \ drylands comprise most of the estimated 420 Mha of land burned each year [134].\n\
    In addition, during 2020, South America showed the highest number of detected\
    \ ﬁres\nsince 2011 [135]. However, ﬁre occurrence and hazards in the continent’s\
    \ drylands remain\nunderstudied [136]. Even for Gran Chaco, the largest dry forest\
    \ in South America, few\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n16 of 30\nstudies have investigated\
    \ ﬁre drivers [137,138]. As the climate becomes hotter and more\nintense, droughts\
    \ may affect some drylands, and thus, there is a pressing need to improve\nﬁre\
    \ mapping and early warnings in these ecosystems [139].\nBoth infrared and thermal\
    \ bands are the most appropriate for ﬁre detection [140].\nSatellite-derived datasets\
    \ on ﬁre occurrence allow us to understand the spatial–temporal\ndistribution\
    \ of burned scars [141] and estimate greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the\n\
    burning of native vegetation [142,143]. In addition, detecting high-temperature\
    \ hotspots\nusing active ﬁres also contributes to more effective near real-time\
    \ monitoring [144]. For\nmapping burned areas, it is crucial to consider the spectral\
    \ properties of the vegetation.\nWhen ﬁre strikes the leaves, the reduction in\
    \ the leaf area index decreases the near-infrared\n(NIR) reﬂectance, and the depletion\
    \ in moisture promotes an increase in short-wave infrared\n(SWIR) reﬂectance [145–147].\
    \ Due to the contrast obtained by the sharp drop in the NIR\nreﬂectance and the\
    \ increase in the SWIR reﬂectance, the NIR/SWIR ratio has been widely\nused in\
    \ spectral indices for ﬁre detection and/or burning severity classiﬁcation [148].\n\
    A study comparing the potential of 13 spectral variables for detecting burned\
    \ areas observed\na better correlation of ﬁeld data with the Normalized Burn Ratio\
    \ (NBR) index, calculated\nusing the NIR and SWIR bands [149].\nSeveral global\
    \ burned area products have been developed at different temporal and\nspatial\
    \ scales [134,141,150,151]. The remotely sensed burned area data products MCD45A1\n\
    and MCD64A1 from NASA’s MODIS instruments have the potential to map the spatial\n\
    extent and approximate date of biomass burning worldwide at a spatial resolution\
    \ of\n500 m [134]. Additional alternatives for ﬁre mapping and monitoring with\
    \ coarse spatial\nresolution include the 250-m Fire_cci v5.0 products [141], ESA’s\
    \ 1-km GLOBCARBON [152],\nand the 300-m and 1-km L3JRC Copernicus PROBA-V Burnt\
    \ Area products [153]. In ad-\ndition to these products, the launching of the\
    \ Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite\n(VIIRS) sensor in 2011 represented\
    \ a signiﬁcant advance in ﬁre monitoring. The sensor has\nspeciﬁc bands for monitoring\
    \ ﬁre on the earth’s surface, providing data at 375 m spatial\nresolution, allowing\
    \ the detection of smaller ﬁres and a better reﬁnement in the mapping of\nlarger\
    \ ﬁres [154].\nCombining RS data with machine learning algorithms seems to monitor\
    \ ﬁre activity\nadequately and contribute to landscape management and the identiﬁcation\
    \ of ﬁre-prone\nareas. For example, the recently launched MapBiomas Fire [155]\
    \ successfully mapped ﬁre\nscars in Brazil, including the country’s drylands,\
    \ over 36 years (1985–2020). This initiative\nis a pioneer in employing a deep\
    \ learning-based approach at the national level in South\nAmerica. A recent study\
    \ modeling ﬁre probability has been conducted in the Colombian–\nVenezuelan Llanos\
    \ and used the random forest algorithm [136]. Such estimation must\nconsider the\
    \ location of the burned area and the causes of the ﬁre spread. Another direction\n\
    for ﬁre research in drylands is to increase the efforts to build a regional scale\
    \ modeling\napproach involving spatial information at a ﬁner scale, which has\
    \ been overlooked [136].\nRegionally, the LPJmL4-SPITFIRE is a Dynamic Global\
    \ Vegetation Model (DGVM) devel-\noped to simulate burnt areas [156] in Brazil’s\
    \ most dryland ﬁre-prone regions. Similar\napplications might prove helpful for\
    \ other South American dryland ecoregions.\nFire mapping could help address some\
    \ still unanswered questions. To what degree\nare South America’s drylands vulnerable\
    \ to fire in a changing climate? What is the interval\nbetween fire occurrence\
    \ and vegetation recovery in South American drylands? How may fire\nfrequency\
    \ be altering dryland’s biodiversity at different scales? A very recent study\
    \ indicated\nthat available information on the fire regime remains limited for\
    \ the continent [157]. There-\nfore, studies focused on fire perimeters, in addition\
    \ to the severity mapping and landscape\ncontrols of fires, would help advance\
    \ our knowledge about fire in drylands and be powerfully\nsupported by LULC maps.\
    \ Further investigation on post-fire regeneration is also important,\nas it might\
    \ take more than 40 years for woody ecosystems to recover [158,159].\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 736\n17 of 30\n5.4. Dryland Populations\nAccording to the World Resource\
    \ Institute (WRI), 30% of the South American pop-\nulation is settled in drylands\
    \ [160]. In Brazil, more than 35 million people live in the\nCaatinga, whereas\
    \ in Peru, approximately 88% of the country’s population live in drylands.\nPopulation\
    \ growth puts unprecedented pressure on natural resources over drylands.\nPopulations\
    \ in drylands are affected by the water-limited environment, especially\nthose\
    \ who depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for survival [13,161]. Dryland\n\
    populations have learned to adapt to highly variable climate conditions by developing\n\
    numerous technologies to make their livelihoods more resilient. However, climate\
    \ change\nand desertiﬁcation intensify the variability of environmental conditions,\
    \ posing new threats\nto drylands and their inhabitants [19]. RS-based tools and\
    \ LULC maps, coupled with\nsocial and demographic variables, could help enhance\
    \ the adaptative capacity of dryland\npopulations and promote the sustainable\
    \ management of ecosystems. Investigation on ero-\nsion detection [162,163], drought-vulnerability\
    \ [164,165] and cropland/pastureland [166]\nmapping is vital to inform policymaking\
    \ to combat food insecurity and poverty [112].\nThese policies can also help to\
    \ balance possible trade-offs between ecosystem services and\neconomic growth\
    \ in drylands.\nRS-based LULC maps have long been used to map priority sites for\
    \ conservation and\nrestoration [52] while avoiding conﬂicts with agriculture\
    \ and other land uses. Detailed and\nup-to-date information about under-protected\
    \ ecosystems combined with LULC dynamics\ndata could provide valuable information\
    \ to increase drylands’ resilience by maintaining\nlocal biodiversity and increasing\
    \ ecosystems’ multifunctionality [11]. From the hydrological\npoint of view, considering\
    \ that water is a critical limiting factor in drylands, RS maps\nwere also used\
    \ to understand potential water-use conﬂicts and the ways in which LULC\nand climate\
    \ change affect water security [167]. However, information about conﬂicts is\n\
    still scarce throughout South American drylands. Such information should target\
    \ key\nvulnerable groups (e.g., migrating pastoralists) to reduce conﬂicts for\
    \ natural resources and\nincrease adaptative strategies.\nA broader understanding\
    \ of many themes requires advancements in RS techniques to\nsurpass the limitations\
    \ posed by the existing coarse- to medium-resolution products. More\ndetailed\
    \ maps may allow the representation and sharing of local communities’ technologies\n\
    to adapt to water-limited conditions and increase land productivity [13]. Finer\
    \ resolution\ndata may also inform policies that favor risk-reducing strategies\
    \ and secure property rights.\nMapping at a more detailed level is pivotal to\
    \ extrapolate the results of studies to the\nscale needed by farmers to decide\
    \ how to manage their lands. In this way, technical and\nsocioeconomic constraints\
    \ can be reduced, while incentives for community participation in\nsustainable\
    \ land management initiatives can be promoted, as made possible by a recent\n\
    initiative from Argentina [168,169]. Their methodology combined collective mapping\n\
    with GIS- and RS-derived parameters, including LULC. Such initiatives can collectively\n\
    construct knowledge based on the interaction among local, governmental, and scientiﬁc\n\
    communities to deﬁne priority areas for conservation across South America’s drylands.\n\
    In the future, RS may help address critical issues to answer some questions: What\n\
    are the dryland vegetation conservation gaps in South America’s network of protected\n\
    areas? Where will potential conﬂicts for water arise, and what are the most vulnerable\n\
    groups? How do local populations perceive their environment, and what solutions\
    \ have\nthey developed to cope with water limitation? What are the main factors\
    \ inﬂuencing\nfarmers’ management decisions, and how can adequate incentives be\
    \ offered to promote\nsustainable practices?\n6. Methodological Trends and Current\
    \ Challenges in Dryland Mapping\nCurrent studies have been mainly conducted in\
    \ some of the largest South American\ndryland ecosystems—Dry Chaco, Caatinga,\
    \ and Llanos from Colombia and Venezuela.\nMeanwhile, smaller ecoregions have\
    \ been underrepresented by RS studies. Such a challenge\nwas corroborated by our\
    \ results, which found only three and six studies at the national\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 736\n18 of 30\nand regional scales, respectively. Unique dryland regions\
    \ found in South America, such\nas the Monte Desert in Argentina [170], as well\
    \ as other important ecoregions, remain\nunderstudied (Table 3).\nTable 3. Underrepresented\

    To advance South America’s dryland mapping, major methodological challenges\n\
    must be addressed in the future. The ﬁrst is the strong spectral mixing, particularly\
    \ in\nxeric formations, characterized by a mix of shrubs, grasses, and soil [34],\
    \ which often\nresults in a considerable inﬂuence of senesced or inactive vegetation\
    \ and soil on the\nreﬂectance spectra. The second challenge is the high heterogeneity\
    \ of drylands at many\nscales, which is mainly linked to the vegetation structure\
    \ (e.g., the height and leaf area)\nand function (e.g., evergreen shrubs and deciduous\
    \ shrubs) [8,34]. Such variability makes\nmodel parameterization considerably\
    \ harder in moderate- to coarse-resolution imagery.\nA third challenge is minimizing\
    \ temporal divergences between the environmental pro-\ncess and observation scales\
    \ [171]. For example, because there is a gap between vegetation\ngreen-up and\
    \ the start of the growing season, vegetation activity following rain events may\n\
    not be captured by spectral vegetation indices with lower temporal frequency [8].\
    \ Such a\nmismatch is commonly observed in single-time image maps. To meet these\
    \ requirements,\nit is necessary to develop cost-effective ways to process satellite\
    \ images and produce LULC\nmaps with high temporal resolution. High-performance\
    \ computing and machine learning\nalgorithms have been increasingly used, making\
    \ dryland vegetation mapping easier at the\ncontinent level.\nThe last challenge\
    \ is the lack of ground-based data networks distributed across South\nAmerica’s\
    \ drylands to calibrate and validate RS algorithms. Readily available datasets\
    \ of\nvegetation characteristics might provide comprehensive information on South\
    \ America’s\ndryland ecosystems and contribute significantly to more compatible\
    \ legends for future LULC\nmaps. In this regard, a trending approach involves\
    \ the use of databases of crowd-sourced\nfield photos to collect geo-referenced\
    \ images from different researchers. The Geo-Wiki project,\nfor example [172],\
    \ launched a mobile app in 2013 that enables the sharing of photographs\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n19 of 30\nwith environmental information. Geo-Wiki has\
    \ also vastly increased its database of in-situ\ninformation on land cover available\
    \ for the training, calibration, and validation of LULC\nmaps [173]. Similarly,\
    \ the Global Geo-Referenced Field Photo Library [174], set up by the\nUniversity\
    \ of Oklahoma, contains more than 150,000 photographs taken on field with manually\n\
    labeled land cover types.\nA trendy free web-based tool that also supports data\
    \ validation is the Temporal Vege-\ntation Analysis System (SATVeg) [175], developed\
    \ for instantaneously accessing temporal\nproﬁles of MODIS vegetation indices\
    \ in South America. Systems of this kind help support\nnumerous LULC monitoring\
    \ activities, allowing quick queries and efﬁcient updating [175].\nAnother noteworthy\
    \ initiative is a ﬁeld-based ecosystem monitoring protocol for Argen-\ntinian\
    \ and Chilean Patagonia, called the Environmental Monitoring of Arid and Semiarid\n\
    Regions (MARAS) network [47]. This dataset stores vegetation and soil data of\
    \ 426 range-\nland monitoring plots containing photographs, basic climatic and\
    \ landscape features, and\na line-intercept transect for vegetation spatial pattern\
    \ analysis.\nBy and large, our study draws attention to the development of an\
    \ integrated multi-\nlevel approach rooted in the concept of interoperability\
    \ for mapping drylands. Such inter-\noperability relates to South American experts’\
    \ joint use of land-cover information and the\nexchange of information from multiple\
    \ datasets [176]. Both technically and institutionally,\nthis approach remains\
    \ challenging considering each country’s social reality and ability to\ninvest\
    \ in technical–scientiﬁc improvements. A key solution to advance this knowledge\n\
    requires the establishment of multi-institutional cooperation agreements and the\
    \ raising\nof funds to promote these efforts. As a result, future maps will have\
    \ more compatible\nlegends, trained interpreters, and clearer accuracy assessment\
    \ protocols to improve their\napplicability in monitoring ﬁre and drought and\
    \ issuing early warnings that increase the\nability of decision-makers to tackle\
    \ the situation faster.\nFrom the RS perspective, to make this integration more\
    \ manageable, new-generation\nsatellites and techniques have emerged as promising\
    \ alternatives. For example, a data fu-\nsion approach harmonizing Landsat-8 and\
    \ Sentinel-2 data successfully represented seasonal\ncycles of annual grasses\
    \ vegetation greenness in the United States’ dryland ecosystems [177].\nOnce enhanced\
    \ by ﬁeld observations, biophysical variables, and machine learning tech-\nniques,\
    \ this methodology accurately depicted annual grass cover using spatiotemporal\n\
    resolutions that are useful to local resource management [177]. The low atmospheric\
    \ in-\nﬂuence of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in the microwave spectrum\
    \ range also\nincreases their suitability for mapping and monitoring South America’s\
    \ drylands. Sentinel-\n1, for instance, has generated open and free SAR images\
    \ since 2014, which have been widely\nused to study African savannas [178,179].\
    \ Studies in South America’s drylands may also\ncombine Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\
    \ for single-year vegetation mapping using high spatial\nresolution data and more\
    \ detailed classiﬁcation schemes. The narrow spectral bands of\nhyperspectral\
    \ RS are also advantageous compared to the barriers faced by optical data.\nUpcoming\
    \ imaging spectroscopy sensors that are satellite-based (e.g., HyspIRI, CHIME,\n\
    EnMAP, PRISMA—recently launched—and SBG) or onboard of the International Space\n\
    Station (ISS) (e.g., DESIS, EMIT, and HISUI) will allow large-area mapping [34].\
    \ These\nfuture satellite innovations will enable the upscaling of in situ data\
    \ to be used as training\ndata for the LULC mapping of South American drylands.\n\
    Methodologically, time series analysis brings new opportunities to investigate\
    \ the\ndynamics of dryland vegetation. A novel generation of technological solutions\
    \ has ben-\neﬁted from time-series analysis and satellite data integration to\
    \ create RS-based Earth\nObservation data cubes [180]. Efforts of this kind were\
    \ created in Armenia [181], Aus-\ntralia [182], Switzerland [183], and Brazil\
    \ [85]. The Brazil Data Cube [85] tends to pave\nthe way for expanding Earth Observation\
    \ data to map dryland ecosystems in other South\nAmerican countries. Such initiatives\
    \ produce analysis-ready data, increasing access to\nlarger communities of users\
    \ and supporting decision-makers with information translated\nto signiﬁcant biophysical\
    \ metrics.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 736\n20 of 30\nAmong these metrics, land-surface\
    \ phenology has arisen as a promising trend that\nenables more sophisticated land-cover\
    \ mapping [62], playing a vital role in terms of the\neffectiveness of the study\
    \ of dryland ecosystems [177]. In addition to the use of tradi-\ntional satellite-based\
    \ approaches, changes in phenological cycles can be assessed through\nunmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAVs) and phenology networks (e.g., PhenoCams). Repeated\n\
    photographs taken from digital cameras on the ground or coupled in towers may\
    \ effec-\ntively monitor plant phenology [184] and, thus, overcome the barriers\
    \ posed by seasonality.\nSuch a technique is referred to as near-surface remote\
    \ sensing and was found to reveal an\nimportant link between plant phenology and\
    \ conservation biology [185]. Although this\napproach has proved reliable in bridging\
    \ ﬁeld observations with those from satellites in\ndryland ecosystems, mainly\
    \ in the United States [186,187], its usage in South America is\nstill limited,\
    \ with few studies conducted in Caatinga [188].\nProducts from phenological observations\
    \ can be an input to climate models at various\nscales, contributing to model\
    \ land-cover change scenarios under local and regional climates.\nPrograms such\
    \ as TIMESAT [189] are feasible to examine signals found in time series pheno-\n\
    logical data [80]. A phenology-based approach is a suitable solution to improve\
    \ rangeland\nmanagement [190] and enable researchers to overcome the challenge\
    \ of segregating areas\nwith natural low productivity or sparse vegetation from\
    \ those that have been degraded by\nhuman impact.\nTo synthesize the main topics\
    \ that we discussed in this paper, Table 4 gives an overview\nof the leading scientiﬁc\
    \ landmarks of dryland vegetation mapping in the scope of remote\nsensing. We\

    We conducted the ﬁrst comprehensive review, to our knowledge, of dryland vegetation\n\
    mapping in South America. We identiﬁed 23 mapping initiatives, ranging from regional\
    \ to\nglobal coverage. Although RS-based vegetation maps introduced a set of advantages,\
    \ our\nstudy showed that the process of mapping LULC in South America has unfolded\
    \ at a slow\npace since the technology became available, with very few efforts\
    \ directed towards drylands.\nOverall, there are more global maps (eight), followed\
    \ by continental and regional maps\n(six each). Nationwide, there are only three\
    \ maps (two for Brazil and one for Chile). We\ncould not ﬁnd RS-based LULC maps\
    \ for Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay,\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 736\n22 of 30\nPeru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Regional cooperation to overcome\
    \ national challenges\nis fundamental to advance the knowledge of the continent’s\
    \ vegetation dynamics in its\nentirety, in addition to providing more consistent\
    \ information for subsidizing policymaking\nat the regional scale.\nOur study\
    \ also showed that, although almost all global and continental maps have\nbeen\
    \ produced from optical, coarse-resolution remote sensing, they are not easily\
    \ compara-\nble. Consequently, it is still challenging to combine these different\
    \ products effectively to\nimprove their application in themes that are highly\
    \ relevant to drylands. It is also notewor-\nthy that the spatial and temporal\
    \ heterogeneity of vegetation plays a major role in dryland\nmapping. This issue\
    \ may be solved using remote sensing products with high spatiotempo-\nral resolutions\
    \ (e.g., Sentinel). Concerning the use of spectral vegetation indices, instead\
    \ of\ninvestigating the most suitable ones for dryland vegetation mapping, future\
    \ methodolo-\ngies should look for ways to explore the potential of adding multiple\
    \ indices as inputs in\nmachine learning-based classiﬁcation algorithms (e.g.,\
    \ Random Forest). This multi-feature\napproach is a promising methodological trend\
    \ for improving the differentiation of LULC\nclasses that are easily mixed. Indeed,\
    \ machine learning-based algorithms coupled with\nstrengthening accuracy assessment\
    \ procedures assure high-quality products to fulﬁll the\nneeds of users from the\
    \ public and private sectors.\nA comparative overview of the methodologies and\
    \ the validation procedures is required\nto support users’ decision-making on\
    \ which dataset to use. From the available maps, Map-\nBiomas stands out for its\
    \ robust method and multiple-application products at the country\nlevel, given\
    \ its medium spatial resolution. So far, sensors from the Landsat series have\
    \ per-\nformed better at mapping drylands. The results of MapBiomas demonstrated\
    \ the potential of\nLandsat for LULC mapping. However, limitations in resolution\
    \ are likely to be overcome with\nnew sensors in future studies. For future research,\
    \ we strongly suggest exploring phenology,\ndifferentiating between natural and\
    \ human effects, as well as using auxiliary data such as\nbioclimatic variables,\
    \ the digital elevation model (DEM), and zoning data to improve remote\nsensing\
    \ LULC classification and make it more practical. By incorporating such environmen-\n\
    tal gradients, better conditions for their public recognition and wide applicability\
    \ in South\nAmerica’s dryland ecosystems will be created. In addition, overcoming\
    \ the incorrect notion\nthat drylands resemble desert places of low economic interest,\
    \ with scarce biodiversity, is\nnecessary to attract more scientific interest\
    \ to these regions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.A.G.; methodology,\

    Editor Carolyn Lawrence-Dill. SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract High-throughput
    phenotyping (HTP) has emerged as one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving
    spaces within plant science. The successful application of phenotyping technologies
    will facilitate increases in agricultural productivity. High-throughput phenotyping
    research is interdisciplinary and may involve biologists, engineers, mathematicians,
    physicists, and computer scientists. Here we describe the need for additional
    interest in HTP and offer a primer for those looking to engage with the HTP community.
    This is a high-level overview of HTP technologies and analysis methodologies,
    which highlights recent progress in applying HTP to foundational research, identification
    of biotic and abiotic stress, breeding and crop improvement, and commercial and
    production processes. We also point to the opportunities and challenges associated
    with incorporating HTP across food production to sustainably meet the current
    and future global food supply requirements. Abbreviations CT computed tomography

    by an increasing global population. By the year 2050, the current world population
    of 7.6 billion is projected to reach 9.7 billion (United Nations & Social Affairs,
    2019). Notably, more than 820 million people are currently undernourished, and
    the prevalence of malnutrition has remained just under 11% after a decade of steady
    decline (FAO, 2019). In addition, more than 2 billion people worldwide experience
    moderate to severe food insecurity, putting them at risk of undernourishment (FAO,
    2019). The increasing demand for food, fuels, and fiber due to a growing population
    and shifting diets, and the disruption of agricultural systems due to the effects
    of climate change threaten to increase food insecurity further (Godfray et al.,
    2010). Global crop yields have steadily increased since the 1960s, but this trend
    is not projected to be sufficient to meet future demand (Ray et al., 2013). Furthermore,
    past trends indicate that increases in crop production will lead to increased
    land clearing, deforestation, and land use, which are already at unsustainable
    levels (Foley et al., 2011; Tilman et al., 2011). Food systems include all activities
    involved in the production, processing, distribution, consumption, and disposal
    of food (FAO, 2018). A challenge facing food systems is that food production,
    nutritional quality, processing, and distribution need to be increased and improved
    to eliminate current and projected food insecurity, and improvements need to be
    achieved sustainably. One facet of increasing the sustainability of food systems
    is the inclusion of new technologies and new applications of technologies. Here
    we focus on how imaging technologies are being used to improve production, quality,
    and processing of crops that are an integral part of the food system (Figure 1).
    Many of the same imaging technologies are being used in research, production,
    and post-harvest assessment of crops, but these research communities are often
    siloed and do not interact as frequently as one might expect. FIGURE 1 Open in
    figure viewer High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) technologies and applications
    span across the entire food system from predicted yield estimations to post-harvest
    food quality assessments. The HTP technologies include digital, near-infrared,
    fluorescence, thermal, multi/hyperspectral, and 3D imaging Phenotyping, the assessment
    of physical, physiological, morphological, and qualitative properties of crops,
    is a fundamental aspect of research, breeding, and food quality assessment. A
    plant phenotype is the observable manifestation of a plant''s genetic information
    interacting with its environment. Manually measuring and assessing crop phenotypes
    can be expensive in terms of time and labor. A relatively simple measurement such
    as plant height can be done with a ruler, but this phenotype becomes more challenging
    when height measurements are required across fields of plants over time (a challenge
    of scale). High-throughput phenotyping (HTP), and particularly image-based HTP
    methods, has the potential to revolutionize plant research, food production, and
    quality assessment by significantly reducing the need for human intervention,
    thereby accelerating processes and minimizing error at all stages in the global
    food system (Araus & Cairns, 2014; Contador et al., 2015; Humplík et al., 2015b;
    Pu et al., 2015). High-throughput phenotyping covers a broad set of technologies
    that involve data collection (e.g., imaging and sensors, robotics, etc.), data
    analysis (e.g., computer vision, machine learning, etc.), and data interpretation
    (e.g., modeling). Therefore, the development of HTP platforms requires robust
    interdisciplinary collaboration between plant science, agricultural science, engineering,
    computer science, data science, mathematics, and other fields of research (Carroll
    et al., 2019). High-throughput phenotyping has made significant progress in recent
    years to better inform research (Bucksch et al., 2014; Chaerle et al., 2006; Devadas
    et al., 2015; Fujita et al., 2018; Ghosal et al., 2018; Granum et al., 2015; Lamb
    & Brown, 2001; Mutka et al., 2016; Pérez-Bueno et al., 2019; Raji et al., 2015;
    Strock et al., 2019; Vadez et al., 2015; Yasrab et al., 2019), breeding (Campbell
    et al., 2015; Holland et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 2015; Mir et al., 2019; Pauli
    et al., 2016; Rounsley & Last, 2010), and decision-making (Rady et al., 2017;
    Schimmelpfennig, 2016; Simko et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019) throughout crop
    development and production. This review is an introduction to image-based plant
    phenotyping and its uses in crop research, breeding, production, and assessment.
    This includes using HTP to aid in efficiently identifying genes for crop improvement,
    applications for HTP in commercial food production, data-driven decisions during
    farming, and post-harvest quality assessment. We therefore focus on a broad set
    of technologies and methodologies for image-based HTP and the tradeoffs inherent
    to them. There are still interdisciplinary challenges facing HTP and we hope that
    highlighting these challenges encourages more researchers across disciplines to
    engage with the HTP community. Core Ideas This review highlights use of high-throughput
    phenotyping across the food system. This review provides a summary of high-throughput
    phenotyping technologies. This review identifies areas of phenomics that need
    more community attention. 2 HTP TECHNOLOGIES AND ANALYSES Image-based HTP technologies
    can be used across scales from cells (e.g., chlamydomonas phenotyping) to fields
    (Dhondt et al., 2013). Cell-scale, organ, and whole plant-scale, growth chamber,
    greenhouse, and field-scale applications are amenable to different HTP platform
    strategies (Figure 2), but in general HTP technologies use three main platform
    strategies for acquiring data: (a) moving an imaging platform to stationary plants;
    (b) moving plants to a stationary imaging platform, and (c) using an array of
    imaging devices over stationary plants. Most field-based platforms rely on mobile
    imaging platforms including handheld devices, ground and aerial vehicles, gantries,
    and satellites (Shakoor et al., 2017). The advantage of field-level systems is
    the ability to phenotype large populations with replication in relevant field
    conditions. For a detailed overview of field-based phenotyping platforms and sensors,
    we recommend a recent review by Shakoor et al. (Shakoor et al., 2017). FIGURE
    2 Open in figure viewer High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) spans across scales
    from cellular to field and uses a range of imaging platforms: Microscopy-based
    imaging systems are used for cell scale phenotyping; High-throughput platforms
    including Raspberry Pi and robotic systems are applied for organ and plant-scale
    phenotyping; Vehicle, airplane, and satellite-based platforms are employed for
    pot and field-scale phenotyping Platforms for controlled-environment research
    experiments can include mobile imaging platforms but more commonly move plants
    through imaging stations (Acosta-Gamboa et al., 2016; Brien et al., 2013; Cabrera-Bosquet
    et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2014; Das Choudhury et al., 2018; Fahlgren et al.,
    2015; Fujita et al., 2018; Tisné et al., 2013; Vello et al., 2015; Yang et al.,
    2014). These highly automated platforms are costly but offer the advantage of
    controlled environments and precise automated treatments, such as water and nutrients
    that can be applied uniformly and frequently. Compared with field-scale experiments,
    controlled-environment systems can be limited in terms of replication and plant
    size. In addition to conveyor systems, arrays of low-cost computers and cameras
    have been used to collect data in controlled-environment systems (An et al., 2017;
    Minervini et al., 2017; Tovar et al., 2018). Array-based imaging systems can simultaneously
    collect data on large numbers of plants if many cameras are set up but can require
    more technical expertise for management. Array-based imaging can also be used
    to collect 3D information (e.g., stereo imaging). As a final option, researchers
    may use manual imaging techniques to avoid the upfront cost associated with automated
    systems. The barriers to begin imaging are low since researchers can use cell
    phones or other affordable cameras for phenotyping, but the labor required to
    analyze images that are often inconsistent can be significant. More controlled
    and automated platform options reduce variation from inconsistency common when
    humans move plants into an imaging station or manually move the imaging technology
    to the plants. A significant amount of variation can be introduced from operators
    of these imaging strategies, whether it be from multiple operators using different
    procedures or from operator fatigue. If manual data collection is standardized
    well with size markers, color checkers, consistent background, and lighting, methods
    of increasing throughput of data analysis can be applied (Tovar et al., 2018).
    Once an appropriate platform strategy is identified, researchers must select an
    imaging technology. Many imaging options are described in Table 1. In each case,
    a universal tradeoff exists between throughput and resolution (spatial, spectral,
    and temporal). For large morphological differences, low-resolution phenotyping
    will likely suffice. In contrast, more subtle phenotypes may benefit from high-resolution
    imaging, including technologies that expand beyond the visible range of the electromagnetic
    spectrum (Figure 3). There is also a tradeoff between the size of the target object
    and the amount of detail that can be gathered. High-resolution imaging may better
    identify variation in certain phenotypes, which could be useful when the variation
    is used for genetic mapping, but also comes at the cost of data storage and computation
    of larger quantities of data. Li et al. (2014b) and Yang et al. (2020) provide
    detailed classifications of plant phenotyping applications by imaging technology
    and plant species under study, but the breadth of potential research questions
    and applications of image-based phenotyping is wide and expanding. TABLE 1. High-throughput

    Data size: Acquisition rate: Data processing: Data interpretation: Fluorescence
    Specialized imaging chambers and/or platforms are required to combine an excitation
    source and a detector. Induced chlorophyll fluorescence can be measured. In some
    systems, multiple images are acquired and need to be input into a formula (e.g.,
    Fv/Fm) for interpretation (Baker, 2008). Cost: Data size: Acquisition rate: Data
    processing: Data interpretation: Thermal Thermal cameras contain a 2D array of
    infrared radiation sensors called microbolometers (Syllaios et al., 2000). The
    electrical resistance of the sensor material changes in response to long-wave
    infrared wavelengths. Thermal image data can be converted to grayscale images
    for use with existing software packages. Cost: Data size: Acquisition rate: Data
    processing: Data interpretation: Multi/Hyperspectral Sensors can capture and discriminate
    wavelengths in the visible, near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared, ultraviolet
    (UV), and other ranges. Multispectral sensors refer to sensors with >3 bands but
    fewer than 30. Hyperspectral imaging systems capture >30 bands and the more sophisticated
    systems can capture more than 1,000 bands. Hyperspectral systems are substantially
    more costly than multispectral sensors but give the advantage of significantly
    higher band resolution and greater number of bands. Hyperspectral imaging technologies
    have varied and complex systems for data acquisition (Lu & Fei, 2014; Ravikanth
    et al., 2017). Data files are not standard images and require more specialized
    knowledge and software to use (Curran et al., 1997; Mershon et al., 2015; Pauli
    et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; Woolley, 1971). Cost: Data size: Acquisition
    rate: Data processing: Data interpretation: LIDAR/Laser scanner Sensors measure
    the distance from the camera to points in 3D space by illuminating objects with
    laser light and measuring the time of reflectance (Lin, 2015). The resulting point
    cloud data contain potentially billions of points, resulting in large datasets
    that need specialized tools for analysis (Lin, 2015). Cost: Data size: Acquisition
    rate: Data processing: Data interpretation: Tomography Tomographic techniques
    utilize penetrating electromagnetic waves to image 2D sections of plants and reconstruct
    3D structures. Examples used in plant phenotyping include MRI, X-ray CT, PET,
    and OPT (Clark et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Tracy et al.,
    2015; van Dusschoten et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015). Data processing is complex,
    but relatively easily interpretable. Cost: Data size: Acquisition rate: Data processing:

    imaging systems. Roman numerals I, II, III, IV, and V represent red, green, blue
    (RGB), fluorescence, thermal, multi/hyperspectral, and 3D imaging systems, respectively.
    Each imaging system can be used for generating more than one phenotyping data
    type After data collection, individual images can be analyzed manually to measure
    features of interest with tools like ImageJ, a free image analysis software (Schneider
    et al., 2012). Manual analysis has the advantage of being flexible and utilizing
    human pattern recognition abilities to identify complex structures, but analyses
    with higher degrees of automation are often desirable due to the size of datasets
    from HTP platforms, which are often on the order of tens to hundreds of thousands
    of images. Automated analyses can also help reduce bias and maintain experimental
    consistency. Hundreds of software tools have been developed for a wide range of
    plant image analysis tasks and many are cataloged at https://www.quantitative-plant.org/
    (Lobet et al., 2013). In general, there is a tradeoff between the levels of automation
    and flexibility image analysis tools provide. Software dedicated to a specific
    task (e.g., measuring a single flattened leaf) is often more automated but is
    also less adaptable to new tasks, whereas software that can be adapted to a broad
    set of problems are often less approachable since choosing components, building
    workflows, and customizing parameters require technical knowledge. Once a tool
    has been identified and parameterized, many software programs have capabilities
    that can be used to batch process hundreds to millions of images. Despite a large
    number of available options, many tools are not actively maintained after publication
    (Lobet, 2017). Sustained development and maintenance of flexible image analysis
    tools require both expertise in software engineering and the target domain. A
    major challenge associated with HTP software is to unify development efforts where
    possible and build tools around a common interoperability framework that allows
    developers to build on previous efforts; otherwise the community is constantly
    reinventing frameworks rather than functionality. Most forms of computer vision
    software begin with the segmentation of the target object from the background
    scene. Once objects of interest (cells, plant organs, individual plants, plots,
    or entire fields) are separated from the background, characteristics are quantified
    to measure or model underlying traits that may contribute to growth, yield, and/or
    tolerance to biotic or abiotic stressors. In addition to traditional computer
    vision approaches, machine learning tools are increasingly popular within the
    HTP field (Marcuzzo et al., 2009; Tsaftaris & Scharr, 2019). Machine learning
    approaches allow prediction, classification, or quantification of traits that
    are otherwise difficult to measure with traditional image analysis techniques
    but come at a much higher cost of computation, time, and expertise. Generally,
    machine learning algorithms define models to describe patterns within data and
    are trained using labeled data (supervised) or trained using the inherent structure
    of the data (unsupervised). Trained models are applied to unseen data or new datasets
    with similar patterns to make predictions (Bishop, 2006). Deep learning algorithms,
    which are a subset of machine learning methods, use an artificial neural network
    architecture to bypass the requirement for feature engineering during model building
    (LeCun et al., 2015). Deep learning tools require significantly larger training
    datasets than other machine learning techniques. Transfer learning (Harris et
    al., 2008), where models build off one another, may allow for models to be repurposed
    for similar problems without the need for collecting large ground-truth datasets
    each time. The availability to collect large quantities of labeled training data
    is a major bottleneck that limits the use of machine learning methods in HTP of
    crops because annotation can be labor-intensive, species-specific, and can require
    plant biology expertise. However, crowdsourcing and the development of synthetic
    data sets are promising avenues to mitigate these issues (Giuffrida et al., 2018;
    Toda et al., 2020; Tsaftaris & Scharr, 2019; Ubbens et al., 2018; Ward et al.,
    2018; Zhou et al., 2018). In general, the HTP field will experience accelerated
    progress if more datasets are made public and if efforts in phenotyping software
    development focus on making tools that are freely available to other researchers,
    sustainable, flexible across platforms and species, and well-documented (Tsaftaris
    & Scharr, 2019). 3 HTP-ENABLED RESEARCH, BREEDING, AND CROP IMPROVEMENT Many opportunities
    exist for improved efficiency within the food system. For example, plant gene
    discovery, identification of beneficial microbes, and precision gene editing are
    all likely to yield novel strategies for increasing food production and decreasing
    agricultural inputs. Similarly, improved methods for quickly and reliably predicting
    yield will be useful to genomic selection and to accelerate the timeline for conventional
    crop improvement. Phenotyping has historically been a rate-limiting step in the
    development of crops because manual measurements to quantify phenotypes are low-resolution
    and time and labor-intensive. Manual measurements can also introduce variation
    due to differences in measurement technique, fatigue, and human error. High-throughput
    phenotyping technologies are being touted as the solution for many of these challenges,
    but it is not the technologies themselves, rather the standard adoption of analysis
    methods, that will ultimately lead to widespread use. The field of plant phenomics,
    which focuses on best practices for data collection and analysis methodologies,
    is still actively developing. 3.1 Feature identification: Using HTP to quantify
    plant morphology One of the most important and challenging questions HTP technologies
    have been applied to is the estimation of crop yield. In some cases, where yield
    is related to biomass, such as in pea (Pisum sativum L.) and wild tomato (Solanum
    pimpinellifolium L.), projected plant area correlates well with yield (Humplík
    et al., 2015a; Johansen et al., 2019; Sankaran et al., 2018). However, yield is
    a complex trait and the relationship between yield and image-derived features
    (e.g., biomass, color, height, etc.) is often species-specific. In addition to
    yield estimation methods that use visible plant traits, spectral reflectance information
    is also used. Healthy, photosynthetically active plants absorb most red and blue
    light and reflect other wavelengths of light, so several indices based on the
    ratios of absorbed and reflected wavelengths have been developed that correlate
    with yield, plant health, and photosynthetic performance with varying success
    (Condorelli et al., 2018; Johansen et al., 2019; Pauli et al., 2016; Sankaran
    et al., 2018). Sankaran et al. used unoccupied aerial systems (UAS)-based multispectral
    imaging of dry bean under drought and nitrogen stress to calculate green normalized
    difference vegetation index (GNDVI) of dry bean plants over time (Sankaran et
    al., 2018). Interestingly, they found that GNDVI had the highest correlation with
    yield at 60 days after planting (DAP) in both control and drought treatments,
    but the correlation decreased by maturity at 75 DAP (Sankaran et al., 2018). Correlations
    between reflectance features and yield presents an opportunity for yield prediction
    and early selection of better performing genotypes. However, the study by Sankaran
    et al. (2018) also demonstrates that there is a dynamic relationship between crop
    yield and spectral features, and that selection of measurement time points is
    a critical consideration during phenotyping. In addition to HTP advances applied
    to aboveground plant features, root phenotyping holds further potential for improving
    overall plant health and yield. Root phenotyping is challenging due to the subterranean
    location of roots and because of the complex, obscured, and overlapping phenotypes
    inherent in root structures (Bucksch et al., 2014). Low-cost imaging has been
    applied to roots grown in clear media, but soil-grown roots generally require
    more costly technologies such as X-ray, CT, or MRI imaging. Technologies and methods
    for image-based root phenotyping have been reviewed recently in depth (Atkinson
    et al., 2019). Measurements such as root number, length, and angle are difficult
    features to extract, but there are recent examples of success. Due to the branching
    structures of root systems, several analysis packages have used a path or graph-based
    approach to measure root phenotypes from 2D images (Bucksch et al., 2014; Das
    et al., 2015; Seethepalli et al., 2020). Yasrab et al. utilized a deep learning
    approach to navigate complex root structures by segmenting images into the background,
    first-order root, and second-order root classes (Yasrab et al., 2019). Segmented
    images were used to quantify total first-order and second-order root length, convex
    hull area, maximum width, maximum depth, first-order and second-order root count,
    and centroid depth (Yasrab et al., 2019). The model was originally trained on
    wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in growth pouches but displayed the potential for
    transfer learning to new species and image types (Yasrab et al., 2019). Using
    a fraction of the number of images for additional training, the model was effectively
    used with rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) seedlings also grown in growth pouches
    and arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.] grown on agar plates (Yasrab
    et al., 2019). The ability of deep learning networks to adapt to different plant
    species via transfer learning is encouraging since it would suggest that researchers
    can build upon existing models, which alleviates much of the burden of new annotation
    and training work. Continued advancement in imaging technologies and image analysis
    will further complement or reduce the need for manual phenotyping, which is still
    a large bottleneck in root morphology research. 3.2 Feature identification: HTP
    applied to biotic stresses Biotic stress or plant pathogen infection is a major
    cause of crop loss (Savary et al., 2006) and high-throughput phenotyping is already
    being used to work toward earlier detection of plant disease and accelerate research
    in plant pathology including the development of disease-resistant crops. The most
    straightforward application of HTP for detection and quantification of plant–pathogen/insect
    interactions is perhaps the use of red, green, blue (RGB) images taken with digital
    cameras. Color digital imaging has been successfully used to detect plant insect
    pests (Cao et al., 2015; Ebrahimi et al., 2017; Fennell et al., 2018) and to monitor
    insect behavior throughout infestation (Thoen et al., 2016). These technologies
    have been reviewed in detail by Goggin et al. (Goggin et al., 2015). Analysis
    of RGB images is also being adopted by research labs to aid other basic research
    endeavors. Researchers are able to use low-cost cameras and widely available image
    analysis software to accurately quantify disease phenotypes like leaf area affected
    by chlorosis that might otherwise be scored visually. For example, Mutka et al.
    used ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012) to analyze images from a low-cost Raspberry
    Pi microcomputer and camera to track cassava bacterial blight symptom development
    over time (Mutka et al., 2016). Again, many of the tools available to analyze
    RGB images of plants are cataloged on the Quantitative Plant database (Lobet et
    al., 2013; Lobet, 2017). In the case of studying root interactions with soil-borne
    (edaphic) pests and pathogens, root phenotyping systems can be applied. Laser
    ablation tomography (LAT), which is capable of detailed and efficient 3D imaging,
    has been used to destructively analyze root anatomy under infection with edaphic
    pests and pathogens (Strock et al., 2019). The high resolution of LAT scans can
    collect compositional information at a level of precision that is difficult to
    match with non-destructive techniques. Laser ablation tomography is suited to
    this problem because edaphic organism infestation impacts ultraviolet (UV) excitation
    of root tissues, thus resulting in differential autofluorescence emission (Strock
    et al., 2019). Laser ablation tomography has been used to quantify and classify
    root tissues and anatomical features for crop roots infected with pathogens and
    pests, such as Fusarium, cyst nematode, and western corn rootworm (Strock et al.,
    2019). These same techniques can be applied to a wide range of plant species and
    pests since the autofluorescence spectra emitted from various tissues are contrasting,
    allowing for differentiation between tissues in resulting images. Stress can manifest
    as a complex of phenotypes. One of the major challenges for image-based phenotyping
    of biotic stress is accurately discriminating between stresses. For example, many
    pathogens cause leaf chlorosis that is easily confused with nutrient stress and
    vice versa. Traditionally, plant biotic stress has been identified and quantified
    using a limited number of techniques that all rely heavily on visual assessment.
    These approaches are time-consuming and susceptible to human error, even for trained
    plant pathologists (Koch, 1876; Ravichandra, 2013). Recent phenotyping methods
    aim to increase the sensitivity, reliability, and specificity of stress detection
    and classification. In a promising example of biotic and abiotic stress discrimination,
    Ghosal et al. (2018) used RGB images of detached leaves from healthy and stressed
    soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] plants to train a deep convolutional neural network
    (DCNN) to classify leaves into nine biotic and abiotic stress categories. The
    DCNN was also able to accurately classify images of other plant species with iron
    and potassium deficiency, which supports transfer learning as a viable option
    for researchers to build on existing deep learning models (Ghosal et al., 2018).
    The use of sensors that extend beyond the visible range (Figure 3) may be particularly
    useful in stress detection and discrimination. Most biotrophic and hemibiotrophic
    pathogens invade plant tissues prior to eliciting symptoms visible to the human
    eye. A significant goal in the field of phenomics is to identify infections early
    enough to enable proactive disease management. Fluorescence imaging has been used
    in the field to detect plant biotic stresses since many pathogens and pests impact
    photosynthetic productivity, which can be assayed by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence.
    For example, Raji et al. (2015) used sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
    images to detect early stage mosaic disease in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz)
    in the field. In another recent example, hyperspectral indices were used to discriminate
    and quantify stripe rust severity and nitrogen deficiency in wheat crops under
    field conditions (Devadas et al., 2015). The reflectance in mid-green to red wavelength
    regions significantly correlated to rust infection severity, whereas the NIR region
    provided the strongest correlation with levels of nitrogen deficiency (Devadas
    et al., 2015). These results are encouraging, but the challenge that still remains
    is how to scale these methods (e.g., use of spectral indices and mathematical
    models to rate disease) to the field so they can be used more broadly. Hyperspectral
    image sensors are highly sensitive to external conditions, and a model fit to
    data collected in one crop species or location likely will have limited applications
    to other systems without recalibration. Thermal imaging is another approach for
    detecting plant diseases using non-visible spectrum wavelengths because pathogen
    infection often triggers stomatal closure in plants, which results in a decrease
    in transpiration rate and change of leaf temperature. Thermal imaging has been
    used to detect biotic stress responses in plants caused by bacteria (Pérez-Bueno
    et al., 2019), fungi (Granum et al., 2015), and viruses (Chaerle et al., 2006).
    It also has been used to detect grain infested by rusty grain beetle and cowpea
    seed beetle (Chelladurai et al., 2012; Manickavasagan et al., 2008). In some cases,
    data fusion, the process of integrating data from different sources, can provide
    more reliable, accurate, and useful information. For example, Mahlein et al. (2019)
    used hyperspectral, fluorescence, and thermal imaging to monitor Fusarium head
    blight of wheat in controlled conditions. Compared with individual sensors, the
    combined multi-sensor parameters from hyperspectral-fluorescence or hyperspectral-thermal
    imaging significantly improved the accuracy of detection (Mahlein et al., 2019).
    Although research into early detection of plant diseases is promising, the current
    cost of imaging technologies such as hyperspectral and thermal sensors and the
    challenges associated with analyzing these image types (e.g., data fusion, data
    size etc.) limit their widespread use. 3.3 Feature identification: HTP applied
    to abiotic stresses Drought is one of the largest causes of global crop loss (Challinor
    et al., 2014) and is one of the most studied abiotic stresses (El Aou-Ouad et
    al., 2018; Gago et al., 2015). Drought can be acute or occur progressively, and
    plant responses to drought stress are dynamic throughout spatial and temporal
    scales. Non-destructive HTP can measure plant responses to stress over time and
    help untangle the temporal effects of water limitation on plant phenotypes. In
    one approach, Vadez et al. (2015) measured drought responses using NIR laser scanners
    to create 3D point clouds that estimate leaf area of plants grown outdoors in
    pots placed on analytical scales. Point clouds can be used to estimate leaf area
    because they are large sets of coordinates in three-dimensional space that represent
    the external surfaces of objects. The continuous measurement of leaf area and
    water loss allowed researchers to measure differences as small as 13% in leaf
    area and diurnal transpiration rate (Vadez et al., 2015). Notably, Vadez et al.
    (2015) studied four crop species—peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), cowpea [Vigna unguiculata
    (L.) Walp.], pearl millet [Cenchrus americanus (L.) Morrone], and sorghum [Sorghum
    bicolor (L.) Moench]—and showed consistently strong correlations with ground truth
    measurements of leaf area. This result was important because it is not always
    the case that a specific method will work well on different species or even across
    developmental stages of the same species (Sankaran et al., 2018). Drought stress
    has also been studied in root systems, using various phenotyping approaches, including
    non-invasive X-ray computed tomography (CT), which are reviewed extensively in
    Wasaya et al. (2018). Temporal thermal imaging in controlled environments allows
    detailed investigations of plant water-use efficiency under drought because well-watered
    plants typically have a lower leaf temperature compared with water-limited plants
    since leaf temperature is related to transpiration and stomatal conductance. Controlled,
    automated environments also allow for precise measurements of how plants respond
    to water limitation. Fujita et al. (2018) combined thermal imaging and the automated
    watering system in the Riken Integrated Plant Phenotyping System to determine
    that stomatal closure in arabidopsis plants occurs at a specific water content
    of 1.5 g of water per 1 g of dry soil. Establishing the specific conditions that
    trigger stomatal closure in a plant species enables researchers to identify variation
    in drought responses in natural accession or mutant populations, which subsequently
    allows for the underlying genetic contributors of drought response to be identified.
    Thermal imaging also allows nearly instantaneous measurement of the temperature
    of individual plants or entire fields. The speed of thermal imaging compared with
    manual leaf/canopy temperature measurements decreases variability that is introduced
    by fluctuations in the environment (wind, shade, etc.) during measurements (Deery
    et al., 2016; Sankaran et al., 2018). Abiotic stresses can affect photosynthesis
    by damaging photosystems, changing chlorophyll content, and altering stomatal
    aperture. Fluorescence imaging has been used to monitor photosynthetic parameters
    such as the quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) under several abiotic
    stresses (Baker, 2008). In a study of two morphologically similar pea varieties
    under cold stress, Fv/Fm measurements decreased in both varieties during cold
    treatment; however, one variety showed a smaller decrease in Fv/Fm and faster
    growth (measured by projected area from RGB images) (Humplík et al., 2015a). Fluorescence
    imaging was also shown to be sensitive enough to distinguish between changes in
    chlorophyll fluorescence in two morphologically similar varieties (Humplík et
    al., 2015a) and was able to detect significant changes in light-adapted photosynthetic
    parameters after just one day of salt stress (Awlia et al., 2016). These examples
    demonstrate the sensitivity of chlorophyll fluorescence imaging for detecting
    abiotic stress at the plant level. Portable chlorophyll fluorescence sensors have
    been available for many years for use on single leaves, and specialized growth/imaging
    chambers now allow multi-plant fluorescence imaging; however, field-level image-based
    measurements of Fv/Fm are still logistically difficult due to the need for canopy-scale
    dark adaptation and saturating light pulses. One technology that may address this
    limitation is laser induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) technique, which allows
    remote or platform-based measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence in the light
    without canopy-scale saturating light pulses (Kolber et al., 2005). There are
    still many opportunities for new technologies to fill such gaps in phenotyping
    capabilities and increase throughput even further. 3.4 Population scale: Gene
    discovery, breeding, and selection As genotyping technology has improved and become
    more affordable, the scale at which researchers can identify genetic variation
    in plant populations has increased rapidly (Rounsley & Last, 2010). However, quickly
    and accurately measuring large-scale phenotypic variation has not improved at
    the same pace, creating the “phenotyping bottleneck.” Combined with current advances
    in genotyping, HTP can accelerate and improve genetic studies for breeding and
    gene discovery. One way in which image-based phenotyping improves genetic association
    studies is that HTP improves the reproducibility of measurements. A comparison
    of hyperspectral image traits from UAS and tractor-mounted cameras found that
    both HTP platforms increased trait reproducibility compared with hand measurements
    of chlorophyll content and biomass in a mapping population of durum wheat (Triticum
    durum Desf.) (Condorelli et al., 2018). This decrease in variation between replicate
    measurements increased the variation explained by all loci associated with variation
    in this quantitative phenotype (quantitative trait loci, QTL) identified in the
    study (Condorelli et al., 2018). In addition to increased accuracy, HTP facilitates
    the non-destructive measurement of a phenotype over time, which allows for observation
    of the changing effect of QTL throughout a season. For example, Pauli et al. (2016)
    imaged a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) population in well-watered and water-limited
    conditions with hyperspectral and thermal cameras several times throughout a season
    and observed that canopy temperature QTL changed over time. If canopy temperature
    QTL had been mapped at a single time point likely many important drought-associated
    genetic regions would have been missed. A genome-wide association study (GWAS)
    is a genetics approach to associate variations in the genome to a phenotype. Campbell
    et al. (2015) used daily RGB imaging along with single nucleotide polymorphisms
    (SNPs) of a population of rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants to identify SNPs associated
    with changes in growth rate during salt stress. The ability to associate SNPs
    with longitudinal growth curves based on temporal image data increased the number
    of significant SNPs identified (Campbell et al., 2015). By using daily fluorescence
    imaging, they identified a significant SNP on Chromosome 1 just 2 d after salt
    treatment, and by Day 14 this SNP became the most significant association identified
    in the study (Campbell et al., 2015). This is an example of temporal information
    increasing confidence in identified SNP since it was identified on more than 1
    d (Campbell et al., 2015). Hyperspectral indices have also been used as phenotypes
    in GWAS studies. Normalized Difference Spectral Index (NDSI) is a hyperspectral
    index shown to have a high correlation with protein content (Sun et al., 2019).
    The same significant SNP association was identified for rice protein content when
    using NDSI estimates and traditional measurements of rice protein content (Sun
    et al., 2019). This result further demonstrated the feasibility of using hyperspectral
    traits as a substitute for destructive protein content measurements in GWAS, breeding,
    and post-harvest assessment (Sun et al., 2019). Many additional examples exist
    for HTP applied to gene and QTL discovery, which are reviewed in Mir et al. (2019).
    In summary, the application of HTP with plant genetic studies is already advancing
    plant science and is expected to continue to play a significant role in future
    basic research applications. Additionally, HTP is being applied to breeding programs.
    Rapid assessment of breeding populations and varieties with HTP methods can help
    breeders make decisions more quickly with fewer resources. The advantage of image-derived
    phenotypes decreasing measurement variability also applies when phenotyping breeding
    populations, thus increasing heritability estimates (Holland et al., 2003). For
    example, handheld IR thermometer readings took ∼30 min for one operator to measure
    768 plots whereas an aerial thermal camera imaged the same area in seconds, and
    as a result, broad-sense heritability (H2) nearly tripled when estimated based
    on the thermal camera data (Deery et al., 2016). Temporal imaging also allows
    the estimation of dynamic changes in H2 over time and between image types (Chen
    et al., 2014). Developing new cultivars can take many years, so predictive models
    that help breeders select varieties earlier can be useful for improving the efficiency
    of breeding. In an example of this, NIR spectra measurements and ground truth
    measurements acquired over 4 yr were used to develop models for soluble sugar
    concentration and dry matter concentration in apples (Malus domestica Borkh.)
    that would inform breeders about which seedlings to remove from early stages of
    cultivar development (Kumar et al., 2015). Predicted sugar and dry matter concentrations
    correlated well with actual concentrations at the end of the experiment (Kumar
    et al., 2015). Earlier culling of less promising cultivars decreases the resources
    needed to develop new plant varieties. The ability to capture genetic variation
    for prediction of future crop performance makes HTP technologies a powerful tool
    for accelerating plant breeding. Unsupervised machine learning could remove the
    labor-intensive step of phenotyping breeding populations in crops like strawberries,
    where manual visual characterization is currently the standard approach. Feldmann
    et al. (2020) clustered strawberries based on traits extracted from 2D RGB images,
    such as height and width, horizontal and vertical biomass distribution, and outline-based
    descriptors, with a mathematical method called the principal progression of k
    clusters. This study is a good example of translating approaches developed for
    human facial recognition to plant science. Capacity for measuring phenotypes is
    often a limiting factor in both selection for breeding programs and linkage and
    association studies. Phenotyping large populations by hand requires large amounts
    of time and labor, but larger populations have clear advantages and are often
    required for both breeding and genomic studies. Evaluating larger populations
    can give breeders more information when making selections. Population size becomes
    especially important in genomic studies where larger populations (>500 individuals)
    enable detection of medium to small effect QTL and epistatic QTL (Würschum, 2012).
    Implementation of HTP pipelines open up the opportunity to take advantage of large
    populations and more efficient investment of time and labor. 4 COMMERCIAL AND
    PRODUCTION APPLICATIONS 4.1 Applications: Precision agriculture Precision agriculture
    refers to the field of crop science that is focused on the collection and utilization
    of data to make decisions about crop management. One of the most meaningful outcomes
    of precision agriculture is that it can potentially reduce pesticide and herbicide
    use and slow the development of resistance to these chemicals. Remote sensing
    techniques (i.e., those that detect and monitor the characteristics of a plant
    or group of plants by measuring reflected and emitted radiation from a distance)
    allow stakeholders to respond to variability in crops including pests, soil conditions,
    disease, weeds, and other stressors because it is possible to map environmental
    heterogeneity to GPS coordinates (Lamb & Brown, 2001). The ability to target herbicides
    to weeds rather than spraying an entire field is already being used by a number
    of companies (e.g., Robert Bosch GmbH, Blue River Technology, Inc.) and has the
    potential to save millions of dollars in herbicide costs worldwide and vastly
    reduce the negative environmental impacts of herbicide use (Clark & Tilman, 2017;
    Kortekamp, 2011). These companies use imaging and artificial intelligence to identify
    and differentiate weeds from crops. Through localized herbicide spraying and keeping
    a record of which herbicides have been sprayed where in the field, they are able
    to identify herbicide-resistant weeds and use herbicide rotation to eliminate
    these resistant weeds. Similarly, early detection of plant disease or other biotic
    stresses in the field can allow producers to rapidly target affected areas for
    treatment and potentially reduce the yield losses. Current applications of precision
    agriculture on U.S. farms include GPS-based yield and soil mapping, GPS tractor
    guidance systems, and variable rate technology for applying pesticides and fertilizers
    (Schimmelpfennig, 2016). These technologies have had small positive impacts on
    yield and profits for the average-sized U.S. farm (Schimmelpfennig, 2016). Wider
    implementation of existing precision agriculture methods and adoption of new technologies,
    especially new image-based technologies, remains difficult due to several factors:
    (a) the upfront cost of deploying wireless sensor networks and HTP platforms;
    (b) the costs associated with data storage; and (c) the level of technical expertise
    required (Elijah et al., 2018; Kamilaris et al., 2017). Additionally, for precision
    agriculture to be put into practice, methodologies need to be robust enough for
    producers to risk their livelihoods. Extension programs have been at the forefront
    of translating new research and technology to stakeholders, so greater investment
    in these programs may be a way to address the barriers associated with implementing
    new precision agriculture technologies (Aker, 2011). Currently, the avenue to
    derisked implementation of precision agriculture technologies is to outsource
    to commercial companies so the burden of investing in HTP platforms, sensor networks,
    and expertise does not rest on individual stakeholders. Precision agriculture
    applications of HTP imaging technologies require: (a) data collection and analysis
    to be done close to real-time; (b) analysis algorithms to be robust to variation
    in crop growth stage, environment, genotype, and imaging angle; and (c) results
    from data analysis need to be clear for management decision-making. These challenges
    are not insignificant, even for companies that have access to large datasets and
    the data collection platforms (Perry, 2020). Current research around precision
    agriculture technologies has the potential to be useful for the management of
    abiotic and biotic stress. For example, aerial spectral analysis has been successfully
    used in research applications to detect the laurel wilt disease of avocado (Persea
    americana Mill.) fields in the early stage of disease with minimal symptoms (De
    Castro et al., 2015). However, detection of disease needs to be early enough for
    targeted pesticide application to be possible without greater crop loss. Thermal
    imaging is another promising approach for detecting plant diseases because pathogen
    infection often triggers stomatal closure in plants, which results in a decrease
    of transpiration rate and change of leaf temperature. As previously mentioned,
    thermal imaging has been used to detect biotic stresses in plants caused by bacteria
    (Pérez-Bueno et al., 2019), fungi (Granum et al., 2015), viruses (Chaerle et al.,
    2006), and insects (Chelladurai et al., 2012; Manickavasagan et al., 2008). Variable-rate
    pesticide and fertilizer application is currently used in precision agriculture
    but relies on chemical tests of plants and soil to create management maps that
    are used to prescribe fertilizer application (Schimmelpfennig, 2016). Traditional
    plant and soil-based testing for nutrient deficiency are labor-intensive, relatively
    expensive, and slow. Ideally, real-time information on plant and soil status would
    inform variable rate technologies. Detecting nutrient deficiencies with imaging
    technology could make variable input programs more efficient. Hyperspectral imaging
    has accurately estimated plant nitrogen concentration in rice paddy fields (Yu
    et al., 2013). However, the correlations between nitrogen content and spectral
    reflectance have been shown to be growth stage-dependent in rice, wheat, and maize
    (Zea mays L.) (Inoue et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014a; Wen et al., 2019). Hyperspectral
    analyses have also been used to predict nitrogen content in leaves of wheat and
    apple (Li et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018). Variable rate technology could also
    be applied to irrigation. Canopy water content of a field of maize was successfully
    estimated by field reflectance spectra measurements when compared to fresh and
    dry weight measurements of leaves, stems, and fruits over 2 yr (Zhang & Zhou,
    2019). Using the same vegetation indices on all crops is unlikely to be equally
    effective across all crops and environments and would need to be optimized. The
    Genomes to Fields Initiative does an excellent job of highlighting the current
    need for publicly available, well-documented, multi-year, multi-environment datasets
    that catalog the phenotypic variation in genotype × environment interactions (Lawrence-Dill
    et al., 2019). 4.2 Applications: Decision making on postharvest quality Post-harvest
    and post-storage evaluation of crops are important but labor-intensive steps in
    food systems where food waste can be substantial (Jarolmasjed et al., 2018; Nourbakhsh
    et al., 2016). Often the evaluation step involves visual assessment or chemical
    analyses for grading, pricing, or quality control. Current research in post-harvest
    food assessment is focused on using technologies that will improve the speed,
    accuracy, and robustness of decision algorithms that often need to be executed
    in real-time. Spectral and fluorescence imaging has been applied to examine post-harvest
    damage of produce (Jarolmasjed et al., 2018; Rady et al., 2017; Simko et al.,
    2015; Zhang et al., 2019). For example, Lettuce decay indices (LEDI) based on
    either hyperspectral reflectance or chlorophyll fluorescence were found to be
    highly correlated with visual ratings of leaf decay after cold storage (Simko
    et al., 2015). Cold/freezing injury has also been accurately identified after
    harvest by hyperspectral imaging in peaches (Nourbakhsh et al., 2016) and corn
    seed embryos (Zhang et al., 2019). Near-infrared (NIR) spectral analysis has been
    used to detect codling moth infestation in apples after harvest and storage with
    relatively high accuracy (Rady et al., 2017). Hyperspectral measurements are also
    promising as a detection method for a physiological disorder called bitter pit
    in stored apples (Jarolmasjed et al., 2018). Bitter pit begins as a breakdown
    of internal membranes and later appears as brown spots on the apple flesh (Jarolmasjed
    et al., 2018). Hyperspectral analysis was able to classify harvested apples as
    “healthy” or “bitter pit” with up to 100% accuracy, depending on the number of
    spectral features included in the predictive model (Jarolmasjed et al., 2018).
    Considerable resources have been wasted on storing and transporting asymptomatic
    apples that later develop visible bitter pit symptoms and these resources could
    be saved by implementing hyperspectral imaging for postharvest quality checks
    (Jarolmasjed et al., 2018). Replacing manual post-harvest chemical analyses with
    HTP imaging technologies could also significantly reduce the resources needed
    to evaluate and grade crops before they reach consumers. For example, RGB imaging
    and hyperspectral scanning have been applied to quantify the chemical profiles
    of grapes during the growing season and after transport to wineries (Kemps et
    al., 2010; Martínez-Sandoval et al., 2016; Porep et al., 2015). Digital color
    imaging has also been used to analyze the sugar content of citrus fruits since
    there is a correlation between sugar content of citrus fruit and color (Wang et
    al., 2016). Multi/hyperspectral analysis is being widely applied in research to
    estimate chemical composition of harvested crop products. For example, hyperspectral
    sensors have been used to accurately estimate the protein content in wheat kernels
    (Caporaso et al., 2018a) and to screen cereal grains for quality and safety (Feng
    et al., 2019). Casporaso et al. (2018b) nondestructively analyzed sucrose and
    caffeine content of coffee beans using NIR and hyperspectral imaging. Although
    prediction accuracy of compound concentrations with hyperspectral data was lower
    than with traditional destructive techniques, hyperspectral imaging provided valuable
    information on spatial and bean-to-bean variability of sucrose and caffeine that
    could be valuable to breeders and roasters. Replacing destructive chemical analysis
    with hyperspectral imaging/scanning has the potential to improve the speed and
    reduce the cost of postharvest analyses, but additional work is needed to improve
    the accuracy of the analyses so that HTP is implemented in more post-harvest pipelines.
    5 DISCUSSION Technologies associated with HTP are often the primary point of focus
    and excitement. However, without enabling domain knowledge, analysis, interpretation,
    and decision-making algorithms, these technologies will not reach their full potential.
    These challenges present the phenomics community with important opportunities
    for future work. As a point of comparison, we point to DNA sequencing technologies.
    In the 1970s and 1980s, DNA sequencing was mostly limited to cutting edge research
    labs and highly trained scientists. During the last 50 yr, the technologies that
    enable sequencing have expanded, the financial cost per base pair has decreased,
    and software applications have been developed to empower easy analysis and interpretation
    of the data. Although the theoretical impact of HTP technologies has not yet been
    met, the phenomics community has started to formally organize, which is critical
    to future progress (Carroll et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2017). These phenotyping
    communities are attempting to facilitate interactions between public and private
    entities and to identify and overcome common bottlenecks in applying HTP to food
    systems. Expanding and supporting training in plant phenotyping, such as the efforts
    led by the International Plant Phenotyping Network (https://www.plant-phenotyping.org/IPPN_Training_Education)
    will facilitate adoption and development of new applications. One of the most
    challenging and rewarding aspects of working HTP phenomics is that it is an integrative
    field of study that touches on engineering, physics, mathematics, statistics,
    computer science, and domain expertise in plant science. This means that to work
    in this field requires some ability to communicate effectively across fields that
    all have their own jargon. This is important because a common language allows
    the community to better identify common issues in phenomics. There are excellent
    examples of formal education programs (e.g., https://www.predictivephenomicsinplants.iastate.edu/)
    that are beginning to bridge the expertise necessary for plant phenomics; however,
    expanding these opportunities to reach students and researchers around the globe
    is also necessary to both recruit more talent into the HTP community, and for
    expanding the use of HTP across the globe. Despite the potential broad applicability
    of HTP tools, we also must take care to avoid setting up false expectations, because
    they may result in alienating important members of the community. For example,
    although there is a heavy reliance on technology (imaging technologies, platforms),
    there is still significant human labor and domain expertise involved in developing
    phenomics standards, methods, and trait models. Further, when discussing HTP analysis
    software, terms like “user-friendly” and “fully-automated” are often only true
    to a target audience and not broadly applicable. For example, to a computer scientist,
    Python is a user-friendly language and yet can be headache-inducing to a coding
    novice. “Open source” is commonly considered synonymous with “free.” However,
    code that is written in MATLAB may be freely available but cannot be used without
    purchasing proprietary software. Similarly, resources may be “conditionally” open
    source or open access. For more on the topic of open data and software, we recommend
    reading the FAIR guidelines (Wilkinson et al., 2016). In addition to access to
    tools, software sustainability after publication is another challenge for phenomics
    and bioinformatics in general. Lobet (2017) does an excellent job of describing
    the problem of software sustainability after publication, because often software
    development halts when a student graduates or after an experiment has been completed
    (Lobet, 2017). Furthermore, even if a tool is publicly available and continues
    to be maintained, a tool with no documentation is unlikely to be widely adopted
    by a community. We understand the appeal of creating tools that are “new,” but
    value also needs to be placed on tools that have clear and documented plans for
    sustainability, growth, and community inclusion. The full potential of HTP is
    far from realized and with the current global pandemic it is even clearer that
    infrastructure, technologies, and analysis methods that allow researchers and
    stakeholders to remotely monitor and make decisions about their plants and crops
    will be critical going forward. Finally, many of the technologies used for HTP
    are expensive and research-oriented, which limits adoption by stakeholders across
    the food system. Therefore, more interactions between communities are needed to
    understand bottlenecks in the adoption of technologies and to ensure that hardware
    and analysis tools are built that address real domain problems that researchers
    and stakeholders face. Despite these challenges in picturing the future of food,
    we see that phenomics holds enormous potential for improving global food security
    by impacting foundational and applied research, enabling precision agriculture,
    and additional applications across the food system. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors

    \ developed in recent years and the perception that most of these \nplatforms\
    \ are unable to fully replicate environmental variables influencing complex \n\
    traits at the scale of climate variability nor handle the elevated numbers of\
    \ pheno-\ntypes required by breeding programs [2]. This does not exclude for example\
    \ the \ninterest of indoors (i.e., fully controlled) platforms for specific studies\
    \ or traits to be \nevaluated, or even the need to developing special outdoor\
    \ (i.e., near field) but still \ncontrolled facilities. This is the case of phenotyping\
    \ arrangements aimed to evaluate \nresilience to particular stressors (e.g., diseases,\
    \ pests, waterlogging…) or the perfor-\nmance of hidden plant parts (i.e., roots)\
    \ or non-laminar photosynthetic organs (e.g., \nears, culms). While this chapter\
    \ will focus on the general aspects concerning wheat \nphenotyping, specific information\
    \ about special setups is very abundant.\nPhenotyping of simple traits (e.g.,\
    \ plant height) can be achieved even by untrained \npersonnel within a manageable\
    \ time frame. However, manual phenotyping of com-\nplex traits, which is often\
    \ the case when focusing on drought or heat tolerance, \nrequires experienced\
    \ professionals and is time intensive. Another important point to \nconsider is\
    \ that phenotyping of the large genotype sets is generally only feasible if \n\
    conducted by several persons. Moreover, in case phenotyping is conducted visually\
    \ \nthis results in an inflation of measuring error, which might be further increased\
    \ by \nfatigue setting, and is prone to subjective appreciation of each person.\
    \ A recent \npaper [3] has defined the high throughput phenotyping as “relatively\
    \ new for most \nbreeders and requiring significantly greater investment with\
    \ technical hurdles for \nimplementation and a steeper learning curve than the\
    \ minimum data set,” where \nvisual assessments are often the preferred choice.\n\
    In what follows, this chapter will address crop phenotyping within the context\
    \ of \nits implementation under real growing (i.e., field) conditions. Literature\
    \ and exam-\nples included will refer as much as possible to wheat or other small\
    \ grain cereals \nunder field conditions. In that sense we will introduce the\
    \ term high throughput field \nphenotyping (HTFP).\nThe aim of an efficient phenotyping\
    \ method is to enhance genetic gain (Fig. 27.1), \nwhich is defined as the amount\
    \ of increase in performance achieved per unit time \nthrough artificial selection\
    \ (see Chap. 7), usually referred to the increase after one \ngeneration (or cycle)\
    \ has passed. Continuing on, the potential contribution of phe-\nnotyping to wheat\
    \ breeding is placed in context by taking the genetic-advance deter-\nminants\
    \ as a framework of reference. Alternative ways to dissect the role of \nphenotypic\
    \ on genetic gain have been assessed elsewhere [4].\nJ. L. Araus et al.\n497\n\
    Accelerating genetic gain can be achieved by increasing selection intensity, \n\
    accuracy and genetic variation, and/or reducing cycle time (see also Chap. 30).\
    \ \nPhenotyping contributes both directly and indirectly to these variables [5].\
    \ Direct \neffects include increasing selection intensity by the development and\
    \ deployment of \nmore high throughput phenotyping techniques, evaluating larger\
    \ populations even-\ntually across different environments, which is actually the\
    \ main purpose of this \nchapter, improved selection accuracy, which involves\
    \ the repeatability and preci-\nsion of the phenotyping techniques deployed, and\
    \ identifying new genetic variabil-\nity for the targeted traits, which, provided\
    \ that it exists [6], may be secured through \npreselection, using very high throughput\
    \ affordable approaches, even if they are not \nas accurate [4].\nIndirect positive\
    \ effects are diverse but also relevant. Low-cost phenotyping pro-\ntocols allow\
    \ breeders to increase selection intensity and identify new genetic vari-\nability,\
    \ for example through the evaluation of larger populations. Phenotyping \nmeans\
    \ more than just selecting the right traits and choosing the appropriate tools\
    \ for \nevaluation, together with efficient data management. It also requires\
    \ appropriate \ntrial management and spatial variability handling [1, 5]. Improved\
    \ trial management \nand field variation control will increase the selection accuracy\
    \ -of phenotyping and \nthus the heritability of the trait being selected (see\
    \ Chaps. 5, 6, 7 and 12). Therefore, \nselection accuracy is also improved through\
    \ the deploying of phenotyping tech-\nniques to account for the growing conditions\
    \ where plants are phenotyped (spatial \nvariability in environmental factors,\
    \ which also may involve the use of phenotyping \ntechniques). While phenotyping\
    \ does not directly contribute towards decrease cycle \ntime, it is likely to\
    \ play a more important role indirectly. For example, targeted \nHTFP will permit\
    \ the reliable phenotyping of greater numbers of genetic resources \nderived from\
    \ breeding lines by using smaller plot sizes and assessments obtained at \nearlier\
    \ stages of population development. This allows breeders to reduce the \nFig.\

    \ may contrib-\nute to genetic gain in wheat\n27 High Throughput Field Phenotyping\n\
    498\nduration of breeding cycles and the loss of potentially important alleles\
    \ with linkage \ndrag [4], therefore contributing to increasing the genetic gain\
    \ (see Chap. 7). \nMoreover, while most efforts are considered toward direct selection\
    \ for yield, indi-\nrect selection for physiological, morphological or biochemical\
    \ yield-component \ntraits can provide the opportunity to introduce new alleles\
    \ from which genetic prog-\nress can be made [4].\nPhenotypic expression is the\
    \ response of genotypes to varied environmental con-\nditions (GxE) or even to\
    \ the agronomical management practices (GxExM), and \ntherefore the full disentangling\
    \ of the link between plant phenotype and its genetic \nbackground cannot be achieved\
    \ (see Chap. 15) without considering the full and \naccurate quantification of\
    \ the environmental and agronomical conditions experi-\nenced during growth [5].\
    \ Therefore, appropriate documentation of the environmen-\ntal growth conditions\
    \ is essential for any crop phenomics strategy. This implies a \nsystematic collection\
    \ and integration of meteorological data at different spatio- \ntemporal scales,\
    \ frequently using low-cost sensors [7]. Finally, new avenues for data \nmanagement\
    \ and exploitation are required in order to optimally capitalize on recent \n\
    improvements in data capture and computation capacity.\nSummarizing, the objective\
    \ of practical phenotyping innovation is the imple-\nmentation of high throughput\
    \ precision phenotyping under real (i.e., field in most \ncases) conditions and\
    \ preferably at an affordable cost. On the other hand, proper \nHTFP requires\
    \ some basic uniform characteristics such as similar phenology of the \nwhole\
    \ set of varieties selected as well as the identification of the right growth\
    \ stage \n(or stages) when phenotyping has to be conducted. In other words, a\
    \ phenotypic \ntrait may have a positive, negative or no relationship with grain\
    \ yield or another \ntarget parameter depending on the growth stage at measurement.\
    \ Such differential \nperformance of a phenotypic trait may depend on different\
    \ factors such as the phe-\nnological stage when it is measured or the growing\
    \ conditions. The phenotypical \nperformance may even be biased if the targeted\
    \ germplasm is too diverse in terms \nof phenology (e.g., heading, anthesis or\
    \ maturity dates). Therefore, in addition to \nchoosing the optimal phenotypic\
    \ traits, the time at which they are assessed, while \navoiding too wide of a\
    \ genotypic range in phenology, is also crucial. This applies for \nremote sensing\
    \ traits such as vegetation indices as well as for lab traits such as the \ncarbon\
    \ isotope composition [6, 8].\n27.3  Platforms: From Ground to the Sky\nThe drawbacks\
    \ of most time-consuming phenotyping methods in terms of through-\nput and standardization\
    \ can be overcome using image-based data collection. Remote \nsensing technologies,\
    \ with the respective controllers and data loggers that comple-\nment the imaging\
    \ systems, are usually assembled into what are termed as phenotyp-\ning platforms\
    \ [5, 7, 9, 10]. The use of these platforms allows for a more efficient and \n\
    accurate phenotyping with stable error across all genotypes, whether as single\
    \ plants \nor in micro-plots. However, currently many of these platforms are costly\
    \ and/or not \nJ. L. Araus et al.\n499\napplicable on a wide scale. Therefore,\
    \ there is a strongly expressed need by the crop \nbreeding community to develop\
    \ both state-of-the-art and cost-effective, easy to use, \nand nonstationary HTFP\
    \ platforms. These platforms may also represent tailored \nsolutions to specific\
    \ cases or a feasible formula on how to apply standard phenotyp-\ning tools in\
    \ breeding programs with limited resources [11].\nThe concept of the phenotypic\
    \ platform is wide and embraces a varied range of \noptions in terms of placement:\
    \ ground, aerial or even eventually (in the coming \nyears) at the space level\
    \ (Fig. 27.2; [10]). Within the category of ground phenotyp-\ning, platforms have\
    \ quickly diversified, and the range of options is very wide: from \na simple\
    \ hand-held sensor, including for example monopods and tripods carrying \nany\
    \ sensors from a simple yet effective RGB color camera, to complex unmanned \n\
    ground vehicles of diverse nature, which are generically termed as “phenomobiles,”\
    \ \nand include tractor-mounted sensors, other tailored solutions (e.g., carts,\
    \ buggies) or \nmobile cranes. Within the ground category one may also include\
    \ highly complex \nstationary facilities. Cable-based robotics systems are becoming\
    \ also an alternative \nfor outdoor (i.e. field) phenotyping, which allow imaging\
    \ platforms to move about \na defined area [12]. Within the hand-held category\
    \ of platforms, smartphones are \nbecoming an alternative giving they may carry\
    \ out different imagers (e.g. RGB and \nthermal), data management activities and\
    \ geo-referencing functions [5, 7, 9, 10].\nFig. 27.2 Different Categories of\
    \ Ground and Aerial Phenotyping Platforms. Ground level: these \ninclude from\
    \ Handheld sensors (in this case just a person holding a mobile), to Phenopoles,\
    \ \nPhenomobiles, Stationary Platforms. From 10 to 100 m: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,\
    \ as drones of \ndifferent sizes and more or less compactness, fixed-wind drone.\
    \ From 100 to 4000 m Manned \nAerial Vehicles as airplanes or helicopters. In\
    \ the near future different categories of satellites \n(Nanosatellite, Microsatellite\
    \ and Satellites) from 50 to 700 km\n27 High Throughput Field Phenotyping\n500\n\
    Aerial platforms of different nature are being widely used, particularly more\
    \ and \nmore involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), popularly known as drones.\
    \ \nProximal and remote sensing sensors are now able to be mounted on low flying\
    \ \nmultirotor UAVs, with image acquisition capabilities at spatial scales in\
    \ centime-\nters, relevant to crop breeding [13]. The use of drones has popularized\
    \ in the recent \nyears [10] and even book manuals (even if mostly focused on\
    \ crop management) \nhave been produced. The remote sensing tools most frequently\
    \ deployed in pheno-\ntyping platforms are RGB cameras, alongside multispectral\
    \ and thermal sensors or \nimagers [14]. The increasing availability of compact\
    \ drones which don’t need to be \nassembled, bring the sensors embedded, and are\
    \ affordable, reliable and easy to \ncontrol, is popularizing more and more this\
    \ option (Fig. 27.3). Nevertheless, other \nunmanned options offer appealing alternatives\
    \ with contrasting capabilities, partic-\nularly fixed wing UAVs, where for example,\
    \ the crop area to monitor area larger \nthan a few hectares, or in related precision\
    \ agriculture activities [15]. Other alterna-\ntives such as manned aircrafts\
    \ are less used by crop breeders given the cost of this \nalternative, while the\
    \ use of satellites on phenotyping are not yet a reality in practi-\ncal terms\
    \ due to the lack of free sub-meter resolution data, but they will surely be of\
    \ \nincreasing interest in the near future as these technologies advance [5, 10].\n\

    \ standards for the deploying simple stationary, cable-based robot-\nics and ultimately\
    \ UAVs as progressively more mobile and high throughput pheno-\ntyping platforms\
    \ for the transport of the various proximal and remote sensing \nsensors/imagers.\
    \ The primary selection criterion concerning the equipment to carry \nout the\
    \ HTFP platforms concerns the choice of the most adequate sensors for the \nestimation\
    \ of the specific biophysical traits of interest at an appropriate technology\
    \ \nreadiness level. Many of the simultaneous major technological advancements\
    \ in \nHTFP platforms come from the impressive miniaturization of imaging and\
    \ mea-\nsurement technologies and on-board processing capacities, but perhaps\
    \ even more \nimportantly massive leaps and bounds in communications, compact\
    \ and lightweight \nbatteries, inertial sensors, electronic compasses, data storage\
    \ and intelligent auto-\nmated control algorithms. These have come together to\
    \ enable the development of \nmore compact and light weight scientific imaging\
    \ sensors and at the same time \nimproved indoor robotics systems and UAVs with\
    \ increasing autonomy, carrying \ncapacity, stability, and security. The result\
    \ is that scientific quality of remote sensing \nplatforms and sensors that only\
    \ 5 years ago were nearly exclusively limited to very \nexpensive indoor installations\
    \ and manned airborne platforms (only able to provide \nground spatial resolution\
    \ a.k.a. pixel sizes on the order of 5–20 m and not amenable \nto phenotyping)\
    \ are now available in more cost-effective unmanned systems. In fact, \nUAVs are\
    \ nowadays the most popular mobile platform for phenotyping pur-\nposes [16].\n\
    27.4  Phenotyping Is More than Just Monitoring Techniques\nCrop phenotyping is\
    \ about collecting useful and meaningful data for integration \ninto crop breeding\
    \ programs. As such, a complete HTFP platform research protocol \nshould include\
    \ considerations for every part of the full process in order to ensure \nthat\
    \ no bottlenecks impede the throughput of the phenotyping activities. This \n\
    includes but is not limited to (1) the equipment (sensors, platforms and software);\
    \ \n(2) use operation (e.g. pilot permits and training, flight plans, and image\
    \ acquisition \nin case of UAV); (3) proper storing and managing of experimental\
    \ datasets for long \nterm use; (4) image processing (pre-processing, calibration,\
    \ mosaicking); (5) data \ngeneration (extraction from processed image to plot\
    \ level data); (6) data analysis \n(index calculations, stats scripts) and database\
    \ structure (storage, linkages, inven-\ntory indexing, ontologies, etc.); (7)\
    \ specific case studies of bottlenecks to through-\nput, training requirements,\
    \ costs, and optimization for specific crops (scalable/\ntransferable traits)\
    \ [7]. All the major components from sensors to platforms to soft-\nware for each\
    \ key processing step are intricately intertwined and need to be consid-\nered\
    \ together such that pre-integrated systems or close attention to integration\
    \ \ndetails will improve both data quality and data throughput. Some examples\
    \ have \nbeen provided for the deployment of RGB images.\n27 High Throughput Field\
    \ Phenotyping\n502\n27.5  Data Integration: From Ideotype to Modelling \nand More\n\
    Connecting genomic and phenomic datasets remains challenging. Is in this context\
    \ \nwhere plant phenotyping is creating new needs for data standardization, analysis\
    \ \nand storage [17]. In addition, the value of phenotypic data is moving from\
    \ empiri-\ncal/descriptive context, where ideotype, understood as the fixed combination\
    \ of \ntraits that confers advantage to a given wheat genotype was the target,\
    \ to the use of \nphenotypic data in a more mechanistic way, through simulation\
    \ models aiming to \npredict genotype performance (see Chaps. 31 and 32). In that\
    \ sense integration of \nphenotypic data into simulation models to predict trait\
    \ value is of increasing impor-\ntance [18]. Besides that, large amounts of phenotypic\
    \ data are used in a statistically \noriented manner, for marker-assisted and\
    \ even more for genomic selection (see \nChaps. 28 and 29). The future of crop\
    \ breeding lies in the standardization of data \ncollection across phenotyping\
    \ platforms.\nOn the other hand, the development of specific software tools that\
    \ meet the needs \nof the crop phenotyping community in terms of remote sensing\
    \ data processing, \nextraction and analysis have been identified as potentially\
    \ the greatest bottleneck for \ngenerating high quality phenotypic data [19].\
    \ This includes for example the devel-\nopment of intuitive, easy-to-use semiautomatic\
    \ programs for microplot extraction \nencompassing also appropriate flight planning\
    \ to capture images with sufficient \nquality, which implies relevant concepts\
    \ such as view, sharpness and exposure cal-\nculations, in addition to consider\
    \ ground control points (GCPs), viewing geometry \nand way-point flights [20].\
    \ These new software tools will need be integrated to \ninclude not only the assessment\
    \ of crop growth performance (including for example \ncrop establishment, stay\
    \ green) and grain yield, but also the detection and quantifi-\ncation of phenological\
    \ stages (heading or maturity times and even anthesis), agro-\nnomical yield components\
    \ (ear density), total biomass, or identifying specific pests \nand diseases and\
    \ further quantifying its impact.\nOverall, there is a great need for new analytical\
    \ approaches that can integrate \nmultiple types of data or provide proper experimental\
    \ design in observational \ncontexts. This need will only grow with the development\
    \ of imaging, sequenc-\ning, and sensing technologies. A recent push in this direction\
    \ has been an empha-\nsis on machine learning and artificial intelligence in phenotyping\
    \ [21]. \nConcerning trait measurements, implementing machine learning methods\
    \ on \nUAV data enhances the capability of data processing and prediction in various\
    \ \napplications [16], such as wheat ear counting [22]. High spatial resolution\
    \ UAV-\nbased remote sensing imagery with a resolution between 0 and 10 cm is\
    \ the most \nfrequently employed data source amongst those utilized for machine\
    \ learning \napproaches [16]. Classification and regression are two main prediction\
    \ problems \nthat are commonly used in UAV- based applications. Taking RGB images\
    \ as a \nproximal remote sensing approach may increase the resolution of images\
    \ and \ntherefore the usefulness of these images when analyzed with machine learning\
    \ \nJ. L. Araus et al.\n503\nmethods. Thus, for example, using an RGB camera placed\
    \ on a pole at 1.2 m \nfrom the ground provided a ground spatial resolution better\
    \ than 0.2 mm, able to \nassess the thickness of the residual stems standing straight\
    \ after the cutting by \nthe combine machine during harvest. In that case, a faster\
    \ Regional Convolutional \nNeural Network (Faster-RCNN) deep- learning model was\
    \ first trained to iden-\ntify the stems cross section [23]. Machine learning\
    \ algorithms can be imple-\nmented using either open source or commercial software.\
    \ Open source coding \nenvironments such as Python and R are freely available\
    \ and may be redistributed \nand modified.\n27.6  Affordable Phenotyping Approaches\n\
    Many of the desired phenotypic traits can be acquired using cost-effective and\
    \ read-\nily available RGB cameras, which are characterized as very high spatial\
    \ resolution \nimaging sensors, with quality color calibration and PAR spectral\
    \ coverage \n(Fig. 27.3). These are extensively addressed elsewhere (e.g. [7]).\
    \ In short, several \nRGB vegetation indexes use the spectral concept for the\
    \ estimation of biomass and \ncanopy chlorophyll, while others are based on alternate\
    \ color space transforms such \nas Hue Saturation Intensity (HSI), CIE-LAB and\
    \ CIE-LUV [24]. Practical solutions \nexist for the calculation of these RGB vegetation\
    \ indexes using free, open- source \nsoftware. Thus, for example, our team at\
    \ the University of Barcelona has developed \nopen-source software tools for analyzing\
    \ high resolution RGB digital images, with \nspecial consideration to cost-effectiveness,\
    \ technology availability and computing \ncapacity using digital cameras or smartphones\
    \ for data acquisition. Besides the for-\nmulation of vegetation indices amenable\
    \ to monitor crop growth, stay green, or \nquantify the impact of a given pest\
    \ or disease which affect the green biomass, exam-\nples exist on the use of RGB\
    \ images to specific purposes such as for example assess-\ning ear density [22].\
    \ Recently methods have been proposed to phenotype early \ndevelopment of wheat,\
    \ specifically to assess the rate of plant emergence, the num-\nber of tillers,\
    \ and the beginning of stem elongation using drone-based RGB imag-\nery. Moreover,\
    \ the characteristics of the digital RGB images, together with the \nsupport of\
    \ machine learning approaches, make feasible the automatic identification \nof\
    \ plant deficiencies and biotic stressed based in the shape and pattern of leaf\
    \ symp-\ntoms such as chlorosis, necrosis spots etc.\nBesides the RGB sensors,\
    \ in the last years a wide range of affordable multispec-\ntral imagers, and even\
    \ thermal imagers, and dual multispectral/RGB or thermal/\nRGM imagers are available,\
    \ making HTFP more feasible to, for example, small \nseed companies and national\
    \ agricultural research organizations.\nThe main traits that can be measured in\
    \ the field using affordable HTP-approaches \nis included, with the sensors/indices,\

    \ et al.\n505\n27.7  Hyperspectral Imaging for Crop Phenotyping: Pros \nand Cons\n\
    Hyperspectral sensors and cameras are among the most promising for the phenotyp-\n\
    ing of advanced traits. The application of hyperspectral reflectance to proximal\
    \ (i.e. \nground level) plant phenotyping at high resolution range makes it possible\
    \ to infer, \nin the case of wheat under field conditions, not only grain yield\
    \ but for example the \ncontent of metabolites in leaves and ears [28], or photosynthetic\
    \ capacities and \nquenching. Hyperspectral imaging techniques have been expanding\
    \ considerably in \nrecent years. The cost of current solutions is decreasing,\
    \ but these high-end tech-\nnologies are not yet available for moderate to low-cost\
    \ outdoor or indoor applica-\ntions. However new methodological developments,\
    \ such as a single-pixel imaging \nsetup [29], which do not require (as much of\
    \ an investment) high computational \ncapacity, may offer a more approachable\
    \ alternative.\nIn spite of the recent availability of hyperspectral UAV sensors,\
    \ both the sensor \ndesign and the resulting data result in several complications\
    \ at the time of capture, \npre-processing, calibration, and analysis [13]. Firstly,\
    \ “hyper” literally means “too \nmuch” so hyperspectral sensors are and openly\
    \ acknowledged as frequently captur-\ning more data than is necessary for any\
    \ specific given purpose. For that reason, they \nare and will continue to be\
    \ considered as more exploratory and experimental rather \nthan operational sensors.\
    \ It is on the scientific community to take on the challenge \nof first acquiring\
    \ what may be considered as excess data in order to later distil the \n“big data”\
    \ down to the essential and prescribe the more specific and required mea-\nsurements\
    \ for any particular measurement goal, in this case the phenotyping of \nphotosynthesis\
    \ and biophysical traits relevant to the disentangling of genetic \nsequencing\
    \ data and maximizing yield to feed the future [30].\nMoreover, the use of hyperspectral\
    \ images from moving platforms, such as those \ncarried out from UAV, has additional\
    \ challenges [13]. Unlike sensors that capture \nwhole images in one instant like\
    \ RGB (which captures three separate spectral \nregions in one image with its\
    \ integrated Bayer filter) and the more common multi-\nspectral cameras (which\
    \ capture each spectral region with a different sensor and are \nlater corrected\
    \ for parallax) most hyperspectral cameras are not “area array” type. \nMost hyperspectral\
    \ imagers are of the “line scanning” type, which require a moving \nmirror and\
    \ spectral prism to iteratively measure each wavelength over a single line \n\
    of pixels as the UAV moves forward. This requires carefully programmed and timed\
    \ \ninternal sensor movements with the external robotics platform or UAV flights\
    \ at \nspecific forward movement velocities relative to the distance between the\
    \ sensor \nand crop. The data is also thus more likely to be adversely affected\
    \ by environmen-\ntal conditions and gimbal instability. In turn, the carrying\
    \ platform and hyperspec-\ntral camera system must be fully integrated as the\
    \ inertial measurement unit (IMU) \naccelerometer (yaw, pitch and roll) and positioning,\
    \ whether in local or GPS (geo-\ngraphical location) data in order to create a\
    \ correct hyperspectral image. Ground \ntopographical variability, if present,\
    \ should also be optimally corrected for using a \nseparately produced digital\
    \ elevation model (DEM).\n27 High Throughput Field Phenotyping\n506\nStill, despite\
    \ these complications, adequately integrated hyperspectral sensors \nand platforms\
    \ from stationary solutions to UAVs are available and may provide \nexcellent\
    \ data with in-depth knowledge and expertise in data interpretation and pro-\n\
    cessing. More common UAV multispectral sensors are based precisely on the exten-\n\
    sive data analysis from field spectroscopy and airborne hyperspectral imaging\
    \ \nconducted by research laboratories over the past 40 years [31]. The best bands\
    \ for \nmeasuring specific plant spectral properties that are associated with\
    \ physiological \ntraits of interest have been selected with regards to both their\
    \ specific central wave-\nlength and their bandwidth (range of wavelengths where\
    \ radiation is measured) and \ndesigned accordingly. However, no full VNIR+SWIR\
    \ hyperspectral sensors have \nbeen available for application as HTFPs with the\
    \ specific purpose of crop breeding \nuntil very recently, due to the many technological\
    \ barriers that impeded their deploy-\nment on UAVs, and as such the linkage between\
    \ spectral wavelengths and breeding \ntraits has not been completed.\n27.8  Implementing\
    \ Phenotyping in Practice\nSome approaches for practical wheat phenotyping will\
    \ be briefly presented taking \ngrain yield as the breeding target (Fig. 27.4).\
    \ A thorough set of examples of traits \nand conditions where phenotyping may\
    \ be applied in practice at different levels \n(handy, high throughput, and precision\
    \ phenotyping) may be accessed elsewhere [3].\nIdentifying the key traits for\
    \ phenotyping may result in convergent approaches. \nOn one hand, grain yield\
    \ may be dissected into three main physiological compo-\nnents: the amount of\
    \ resources (radiation, water, nitrogen…) captured by the crop, \nthe efficient\
    \ use of these resources and the dry matter partitioning (so called harvest \n\
    index). The kind of resource considered depend in each case on what is the limiting\
    \ \nfactor (e.g. under drought conditions or low nitrogen fertility, water and\
    \ nitrogen \nwill be the relevant resources, respectively). On the other hand,\
    \ retrospective stud-\nies, comparing cultivars developed through the last decades,\
    \ also provide clues on \nthe most successful, to date, physiological traits,\
    \ involved in the genetic advance \nafter Green Revolution. For this approach\
    \ it is important to avoid confounding \neffects associated with the inclusion\
    \ in the comparison, genotypes developed prior \nGreen Revolution or even transitional\
    \ ones. In that sense genetic advance in wheat \nfor a wide range of environmental\
    \ conditions has been associated with a higher \nstomatal conductance [32]. Remote\
    \ sensing techniques such as infrared thermome-\ntry or thermography may be deployed\
    \ as proxies for higher transpiration [1, 4, 5, 9]. \nAn alternative is to use\
    \ the stable carbon isotope, one of the few lab-phenotyping \ntraits widely accepted.\
    \ Usually a lower (i.e. more negative) carbon isotope composi-\ntion (δ13C) or,\
    \ alternatively, a higher carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C), particu-\nlarly\
    \ when analyzed in mature kernels and confounding effects are avoided (such as\
    \ \ndifferences in phenology [6]) is pursued, since it indicates a better water\
    \ status and \neventually more water captured by the crop, in spite the fact water\
    \ use efficiency \ndecreases. Another trait to consider is stay green, which may\
    \ be relevant particularly \nunder good agronomical conditions [33]. This trait\
    \ may be assessed through \nJ. L. Araus et al.\n507\nmultispectral of RGB-derived\
    \ vegetation indices assessed during grain filling [24, \n34]. The same category\
    \ of indices may be used to assess early vigor and ground \ncovering. The three\
    \ categories of main remote sensing approaches (RGB, thermal or \nmultispectral/hyperspectral)\
    \ may be used to assess differences in phenology, par-\nticularly heading and\
    \ anthesis nature.\nDigital RGB imaging may allow to 3D surface reconstruction\
    \ to provide estima-\ntions of plant height, and incidence of lodging, while image-pattern\
    \ recognition \nmay help to identify the presence of a pest or disease, which\
    \ may be further quanti-\nfied on their impact by RGB or multispectral vegetation\
    \ indices [26].\nGreater biomass is also considered as a key target trait for\
    \ selection, particularly \nsince harvest index is reaching theoretical maximum,\
    \ while the increasing in bio-\nmass have been minor during the more the half\
    \ century elapsed from the beginning \nof the Green Revolution to the present.\
    \ HTFP, particularly when deployed from an \naerial platform allows the assessment\
    \ of biomass through different techniques in the \nfull plot rather than in subsamples.\
    \ Moreover, there is the capacity to undertake \nrepetitive measurements which\
    \ may improve the estimation [4]. A priory the most \ncanonical way to assess\
    \ biomass is using LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) \nmounted in an aerial\
    \ platform or in a “phenomobile” [26]. However still today the \nmost common way\
    \ to assess green biomass is through vegetation indices, either \nFig. 27.4 Different\
    \ examples from the University of Barcelona using different platforms and sen-\n\
    sors; mostly of affordable nature: (1) Thermal Camera: FLIR Tau 640 with Thermal\
    \ Capture; (2) \nModified GoPro taking the NDVI, that was installed in a Mavic\
    \ pro 2; (3) Mavic 2 Pro with an \nRGB camera; (4) Sony Qx1 used from ground to\
    \ count spikes; (5) MultiSPEC 4C camera, which \nhas 4 channels, from AIRINOV\
    \ company, on a phenopole of 5 m; this multispectral camera is quite \nsimilar\
    \ to Parrot Sequoia in capacities and cost; (6) Cat s60 mobile phone, which takes\
    \ thermal and \nRGB pictures\n27 High Throughput Field Phenotyping\n508\nmultispectral\
    \ or RGB-derived, given the common perception these approaches \nbeing more affordable\
    \ and easier to use than the LiDAR [26]. However, an inherent \nlimitation of\
    \ the vegetation indices is that they saturate, which makes its use less \neffective\
    \ during the central part of the crop cycle, even when still is of value to \n\
    assess early stages of growth or stay green. Moreover, vegetation indices do not\
    \ \ninform about canopy height. Nevertheless, a more accurate determination of\
    \ green \nbiomass than that associated to vegetation indices, together with plant\
    \ height may \nbe also achieved using RGB images; this time through three-dimensional\
    \ recon-\nstruction of the crop canopy. This evaluation may improve further if\
    \ canopy height \nis combined with the number and thickness of the stems, evaluated\
    \ through high- \nresolution RGB images [23].\nAnother potential target for current\
    \ phenotyping, which has been traditionally \nneglected, is the photosynthetic\
    \ contribution of the ear to grain filling. While a \nrecent study has confirmed\
    \ that genotypic variability exists for this trait and more-\nover showing the\
    \ first examples of HTFP for this trait [35], the advent on remote \nsensing techniques\
    \ based on the combination of RGB imaging for in situ organ \ndetection, together\
    \ with thermal and/or multispectral imaging may allow in the near \nfuture the\
    \ evaluation of this trait from aerial platforms [36].\nHowever, there still exist\
    \ several areas not fully explored in terms of HTFP pro-\ntocols, such as root\
    \ phenotyping, just one among many hidden yet very important \nattributes to consider\
    \ in new potential phenotyping target traits.\n27.9  Key Concepts\nHTFP may contribute\
    \ to speed genetic advances in different ways. Nevertheless, \nphenotyping under\
    \ controlled conditions may still have applicability in some cases. \nUsually,\
    \ there is not a single technological solution, but rather different options in\
    \ \nterms of throughput and even cost are available. In this sense, affordable\
    \ phenotyp-\ning techniques, including various sensors and platforms, are more\
    \ approachable \nthan ever before. Remote sensing techniques are the most commonly\
    \ used for phe-\nnotyping but other approaches, like the lab-based traits may\
    \ be also useful. \nEventually, hyperspectral techniques may even replace many\
    \ lab-based approaches. \nBesides that, image processing and even more data analysis,\
    \ including prediction \nmodels are the actual components of the phenotyping pipeline\
    \ that will allow full \nexploitation of new technological developments, in terms\
    \ of traits and platforms, \nfor HTFP.\n27.10  Conclusions\nAs a take-home message,\
    \ phenotyping is evolving very fast in terms of throughput, \nthe range of traits\
    \ that can be assessed, and the adaptation of the costs of sensors and \nplatforms\
    \ to a growing market for these technologies. However, the computing and \nJ.\
    \ L. Araus et al.\n509\nstatistical components still remain as the most commonly\
    \ perceived bottleneck that \ncurrently limits HTFP from reaching full operability.\
    \ This includes a wide range of \nareas: from automation of data capturing and\
    \ further data processing, to the use of \nthe data produced to drive prediction\
    \ models or even its integration and application \nin genomic selection.\nIn this\
    \ sense remote sensing techniques will become more accessible to breeders \nif\
    \ image analysis services were to become more widely available, affordable and\
    \ \nautomatized (i.e., customer friendly), providing curated phenotypic data in\
    \ near real \ntime. As examples, on board data pre-processing and 5G in-flight\
    \ data transmission \nare two of the main paths forward for simplified processing\
    \ and improved usability \nof remote sensing sensors. Both go hand-in-hand with\
    \ improvements in sensor- \nplatform integration, in which the sensor and platform\
    \ have become more and more \ninterconnected and thus are able to share GPS, altimetry,\
    \ IMU, power sources and \ntransmission capacities for improved efficiency and\
    \ operability. Manual UAV flights \nand separate manual programming of sensor\
    \ data capture are already in the past. In \nmany modern commercial UAVs, smartphone\
    \ connectivity already converts the \nUAV controller to an all-in-one command\
    \ station for programming flight paths, \nviewing UAV and sensor details in-flight,\
    \ and even limited data viewing and down-\nloading in real-time. Also, in smart\
    \ sensors, such as the Tetracam MCAW system \n(https://www.tetracam.com/Products-\
    \ Macaw.htm), images are calibrated to reflec-\ntance, corrected for parallax\
    \ and combined into multiband TIFFs or even processed \ninto programmable vegetation\
    \ indexes in flight by the on-board micro-processor \nand fast solid state disk\
    \ drives; these also include Wi-Fi to smartphone connectivity. \nEven though the\
    \ current wireless connectivity of these can’t keep pace with the \nonboard data\
    \ capture and automated pre-processing, both of these, including even \nUAV hyperspectral\
    \ data, should be both processable and transmissible in real-time \nwith 5G Wi-Fi,\
    \ enabling the automation of the rest of the pre-processing, from \nStructure-to-Motion\
    \ orthomosaicking and on to micro-plot extraction (given the \nproper GIS metadata),\
    \ either in PC or cloud-based services inter-connected to UAV \nfunctionality\
    \ or specific sensors or as a third party solution, such as DroneMapper, \nPix4Dcloud,\
    \ AgisoftCloud, Micasense AtlasCloud, DroneDeploy, and many more \n(http://dronemapper.com,\
    \ \nhttps://www.pix4d.com/product/pix4dcloud, \nhttps://\ncloud.agisoft.com, https://atlas.micasense.com,\
    \ see also https://micasense.com/\nsoftware- solutions). Given that there are\
    \ already precision agriculture crop pest/\ndisease UAVs that can detect specific\
    \ pest or disease presence or absence and spray \nwith onboard imaging and artificial\
    \ intelligence decision support, the next step for \nplant phenotyping must be\
    \ close behind.\nOn the other a routinely assessment under field conditions of\
    \ particular traits, \nrelevant for grain and fodder quality (e.g., contents of\
    \ amino acids, micronutrients, \nprovitamins), or for HTFP in frontier areas such\
    \ as the breeding for higher and more \nefficient photosynthesis. This will be\
    \ feasible through hyperspectral techniques, \nproviding not only computing capabilities\
    \ are optimized, but also cost of hyperspec-\ntral sensors and imagers decrease.\n\

    \ \nAbstract \nSustainable agriculture with use of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi\
    \ (AMF) is an emerging farm management that \nimproves crops nutrient and water\
    \ use efficiency. Decision making on the effect of AMF is still dependent on \n\
    agronomic diagnosis which is long, tedious, expensive and destructive. This study\
    \ demonstrates the applicability \nof proximal fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy\
    \ for evaluating and detecting at early stage distinct types \nof mycorrhized\
    \ plantain from two cultivars (Musa paradisiaca). \nVisible-near infrared (400-1000\
    \ nm) reflectance and fluorescence data were collected from control and three\
    \ \nlevels mycorrhized plants designed in randomized and complete block under\
    \ greenhouse conditions. Two \nspectral measurements at a week interval were performed\
    \ on plant leaves by using an USB spectrometer \nmounted with an Arduino-based\
    \ LED driver clip.  \nA new normalized reflectance water NWI5 index shows with\
    \ Datt5 alone highly significant differences at \nP<0.001 respectively for Orishele\
    \ and fhia21 cultivars. dNIRmin920_980, NDVI3 and GI reflectance index are \n\
    significant at P<0.01. Seven other reflectance and 3 fluorescence indices ANTH,\
    \ FRF_R and NBI_R are \nsignificant at P<0.05. The two first principal components\
    \ for each cultivar spectral features explaining 94.1 % of \nvariance were used\
    \ to build predictive classification models. LogitBoost algorithm indicates accuracy\
    \ of 90.27% \non stratified cross-validation and 87.5% on test split. Our results\
    \ confirm that fluorescence and reflectance \nspectroscopy is a valuable tool\
    \ for early assessment of mycorrhization success rate evaluation and pattern \n\
    recognition. They also show promise for the development of non-destructive and\
    \ cost-effective detectors in \nmonitoring crops under biofertilizers with arbuscular\
    \ mycorrhizae.  \nKeywords: classification, fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy,\
    \ LogitBoost algorithm, mycorrhized \nplantain plants. \n1. Introduction\nAgricultural\
    \ remote sensing has gained great importance in sustainable and intensification\
    \ farming management. \nIt generates digital data from sensors that help in reducing\
    \ the risk and minimize damage of inappropriate \nfertilization. Indeed, low or\
    \ excessive uses of chemical fertilizers can have high adverse impact on the \n\
    environment and grain production system. Unused nitrogen released to the environment\
    \ can have detrimental \neffects (Cameron, Di, & Moir, 2013). Large application\
    \ of phosphate fertilizers and by-products has been \npracticed on arable lands,\
    \ to improve crop production, induced soil nutrients deficiency, and increasing\
    \ the levels \nof available S and P (Kassir, 2014). In the increasing demand of\
    \ environmental sustainability, more attention of \nagricultural scientific community\
    \ is being turned on biofertilizers particularly Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi\
    \ \nwww.ccsenet.org/apr \nApplied Physics Research \nVol. 8, No. 3; 2016 \n18\
    \ \n(AMF) (Weber, 2014; Sahraoui, 2013). Thus investigating the potential output\
    \ of such biological \nmicroorganisms on crops with use of remote sensing tools\
    \ is highly relevant.  \nControlled endomycorrhization is a current problem that\
    \ stayed long time ago in agriculture, horticulture and \narboriculture (Gianinazzi,\
    \ 1981). It was recently reported that diversity of plant response to mycorrhizal\
    \ \nsymbiosis essentially depends on isolates spores of species, soil fertility\
    \ and environmental culture conditions \n(Garbaye, 2013). Optical sensing systems\
    \ are potential and suitable tools for assessing mycorrhization success \nrate\
    \ since they gather information on plant response, rather than costly, time-consuming,\
    \ and destructive \nlaboratory analyses. In this field, many efforts are done\
    \ with various acquisitions sensing system and several \nspectral features developed\
    \ (Mulla, 2013; Pinheiro & Gusmo Dos Anjos., 2014) .However, there is an apparent\
    \ \nlack of study in remote sensing crop investigation with arbuscular mycorrhizae.\
    \ New spectral indices that \nsimultaneously allow assessment of multiple crops\
    \ characteristic and reveal better understanding of plant \nmolecular mechanism\
    \ could be retrieved.  \nAn incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)\
    \ interaction with plant leaves induced various spectral \nresponse in absorbance,\
    \ reflectance and transmittance. Reflectance expresses light use efficiency of\
    \ plant (Barton \n& North, 2001). Reflectance properties of leaves are determined\
    \ by the concentration of chlorophyll, other \npigments (carotenoids, xanthophylls\
    \ and anthocyanins) and absorbing biochemicals in the visible (400–700 nm) \n\
    wavelength region, by mesophyll structure in the near infrared (700–1200 nm) region\
    \ and by amount of water in \nthe near infrared (950-970 nm) and in the middle\
    \ infrared (1200–2400 nm) region (Peñuelas, 1998). When a \nfluorescent molecule\
    \ absorbs the energy of a given wavelength, a part of it is dissipated by light\
    \ emission at \nlonger wavelengths within a very short time. This small but variable\
    \ amount of energy loss is known as the \nfluorescence emission which is fingerprint\
    \ of leaf photosynthetic activity. Coupling the measurements of \nreflectance\
    \ and fluorescence with high spectral resolution has been suggested for improving\
    \ crop productivity \nevaluation (Baret, Guyot, & Major, 1988), stress diagnosis\
    \ (Lichtenthaler, Wenzel, & Buschmann, 2006) and \nnutrient diagnosis (Belanger,\
    \ Viau, Samson, & Chamberland, 2005). Decades of research in vegetation \nreflectance\
    \ and fluorescence-based methods has gone into finding multiple indices precisely\
    \ related to several \nleaf pigments, stresses, and mineral content. Combination\
    \ of fluorescence and reflectance could reveal some \nfunctional properties of\
    \ AMF in crop production particularly in plantain and banana case where their\
    \ effects \nhave been studied in recent Africa’s agricultural researches (Nwaga\
    \ et al., 2011; Gaidashova et al., 2013; Jefwa et \nal., 2013).  \nMulti-class\
    \ classification in crops remote sensing is performed by means of data mining\
    \ techniques. In this \napproach, several methods of machine learning have been\
    \ utilized for plant characteristics detection. Support \nVector Machine are important\
    \ advanced techniques intensively used (Mountrakis & Ogole, 2011; Moshou, \nPantazi,\
    \ Kateris, & Gravalos, 2014). Others efficient tools are concerned with fuzzy\
    \ logic, neural network and \nextreme learning machine (Moreno, Corona, Lendass,\
    \ Graña, & Galvão 2014; Murmu & Biswas, 2015; \nCvetković, Stojanović, & Nicolić,\
    \ 2015).The boosting meta-algorithm is relatively new, efficient, simple, and\
    \ \neasy to manipulate additive modeling technique that can use potentially any\
    \ weak learner available. LogitBoost \nis another variant of the boosting algorithm\
    \ that performs additive logistic regression (Friedman, Hastie, & \nTibshirani,\
    \ 2000) and has shown better performance than many other machine learning algorithm\
    \ especially in \nprotein data structure classification (Krishnaraj & Reddy, 2009).\
    \ At present, new improvements of this algorithm \nare proposed (Kanamori & Takenouchi,\
    \ 2013; Sun, Reid & Zhou, 2014). \nIn this study, we aimed at evaluating early\
    \ detection of mycorrhized plantain using active fluorescence and \nreflectance\
    \ spectrometry. The specific objectives were to (1) identify the most significant\
    \ fluorescence and \nreflectance vegetation indices explaining mycorrhizae effects\
    \ on plantains and to (2) build predictive \nclassification model for each mycorrhizal\
    \ treatment using spectral features discovered. \n2. Material and methods \n2.1\
    \ Plant Material and Experimental Design \nThe experiment was conducted under\
    \ greenhouse conditions at the Laboratoire des Biotechnologies Végétale et \n\
    Microbienne in National Polytechnic Houphouet-Boigny Institute of Yamoussoukro\
    \ (Côte d’Ivoire). Two \nplantain varieties namely Orishele (sensitive to water\
    \ stress) and Fhia 21 (tolerant to water stress) were \ncultivated in pots containing\
    \ sterilized substrate composed of loam and sand. The plants were inoculated with\
    \ a \nmycorrhizal morphotype of Glomus (T1), a complex of spores from the rhizosphere\
    \ of plantain in Bouaflé (T2) \nand another complex of spores from the rhizosphere\
    \ of plantain in Azaguié (T3). All treatments including control \nplants without\
    \ any mycorrhizae (T0) were split into a randomized complete block design consisting\
    \ of three \nreplicates per treatment in each of the three blocks. \nwww.ccsenet.org/apr\
    \ \nApplied Physics Research \nVol. 8, No. 3; 2016 \n19 \n2.2 Formulation and\
    \ Preparation of Inoculum \nSpores are extracted at the Laboratoire des Biotechnologies\
    \ Végétale et Microbienne in National Polytechnic \nHouphouet-Boigny Institute\
    \ of Yamoussoukro (Côte d’Ivoire) according to the method described by Gerdemann\
    \ \n& Nicholson (1963). They were disinfected using bleach 2% and 0.2% streptomycin.\
    \ The banana suckers were \nfirstly cleaned, washed and acclimated in coco peat\
    \ and then inoculated with these spores at 150 spores per pot. \n2.3 Optical Instrumentation\
    \ and Spectral Measurements \nA hand-held clip LEDs was built in our laboratory\
    \ and mounted with USB4000 spectrometer Ocean Optics for \nacquiring fluorescence\
    \ and reflectance spectra on the upper leaf surface. The spectrometer can collect\
    \ data in the \n350–1000 nm spectral region, with a sampling interval of 0.22\
    \ nm. Three Light-emitting-diodes excited the \nfluorescence at 375 nm (UV), 520\
    \ nm (green) and 630 nm (red) while the emitted fluorescence light was \ndetected\
    \ in the red (RF: 680–690 nm) and far-red (FRF: 720–755 nm) spectral regions using\
    \ a low-pass filter at \n650 nm. A white LED emitting (400-700 nm) was utilized\
    \ for reflectance measurement. All four LEDs were \ncontrolled using the computer\
    \ and Arduino, a cost effective, open source and easy programmable \nmicrocontroller\
    \ board (Arduino - Home). Reflectance spectra were carried out after comparing\
    \ with a 99% white \nreflectance standard (Labsphere®, Edmund Optics Inc. — 101\
    \ East Gloucester Pike, Barrington, NJ 080071380 \nUSA). After three scans, an\
    \ average spectrum is recorded using SpectraSuite® Software. Spectra acquisitions\
    \ \noccurred between 29 November and 06 December 2014 with experimental setup\
    \ showed in Figure 1.  \n \nFigure 1. Schematic drawing of the experimental setup\
    \ used for spectra acquisition \n \n2.4 Spectra Preprocessing and Normalization\
    \ \nThe spectra dataset recorded are firstly filtered using Gaussian normal probability\
    \ density function in matlab. \nThen, each spectrum is standardized by its own\
    \ average and standard deviation for baseline and quantity \ncorrection (Barnes,\
    \ Dhanoa & Lister., 1993). Finally, in the hypothesis that the number of photon\
    \ at any \nwavelength should be constant across shots, we proceeded to min/max\
    \ normalization. Each spectrum is \nnormalized to have a minimum value of 0 and\
    \ a maximum value of 1. This normalization was accomplished \naccording the formula:\
    \  \n ݔ௡௢௥௠ =\n(௫ି୫୧୬೔ ௫೔  )\n(୫ୟ୶೔ ௫೔  ି୫୧୬೔ ௫೔  ) \n (1) \n2.5 Fluorescence\
    \ and Reflectance Indices Calculation \nVegetation indices are widespread in remote\
    \ sensing scientific literature. A database composed of 18 \nfluorescence and\
    \ 90 reflectance indices were implemented in matlab for spectra features calculation.\
    \ We tried to \nextend to almost reviewed vegetation index at leaf and canopy\
    \ level for enabling maximum crop characteristic \ndetection. These indexes are\
    \ also supplemented with our proposed one. \n2.6 Statistical Analysis \n2.6.1\
    \ One-Way Variance Analysis with Step-Down Dunnett Post Hoc Test \nANalysis Of\
    \ VAriance (often referred to as ANOVA) is a technique for analyzing the way in\
    \ which the mean of \na variable is affected by different types and combinations\
    \ of factors. One-way analysis of variance is the simplest \nform in which we\
    \ are interested in comparing the dependent variable means of two or more groups\
    \ defined by a \ncategorical grouping factor (Bewick, Cheek, & Ball, 2004). Analysis\
    \ of variance is initially performed on two \ngroups (control and all mycorrhized\
    \ plants together) then on four groups (control and each of three mycorrhizal\
    \ \ntreatments). In order to understand subgroup differences among the different\
    \ experimental and control group, we \nwww.ccsenet.org/apr \nApplied Physics Research\
    \ \nVol. 8, No. 3; 2016 \n20 \nchose to perform step-down Dunnett test which is\
    \ more suitable and powerful (Bretz, Hothorn & Westfall, 2010). \nR software version\
    \ 3.1.2 (R Core Team, 2014) was used for ANOVA analysis and for multiple comparisons.\
    \ \n2.6.2 Principal Components and Vegetation Index Correlation Analysis \nPrincipal\
    \ components analysis (PCA) is a data reduction technique that transforms a larger\
    \ number of correlated \nvariables into a much smaller set of uncorrelated variables\
    \ called principal components. The weights used to \nform the linear composites\
    \ are chosen to maximize the variance each principal component accounts for, while\
    \ \nkeeping the components uncorrelated. We generated principal components for\
    \ each cultivar with their respective \nsignificant vegetation indices. \nCorrelation\
    \ analysis was also used for establishing relationship between new indice developed\
    \ and existing ones. \n2.6.3 LogitBoost Classifier \nBoosting implements forward\
    \ stagewise additive modeling. This class of algorithms starts with an empty \n\
    ensemble and incorporates new members sequentially. At each stage the model that\
    \ maximizes the predictive \nperformance of the ensemble as a whole is added,\
    \ without altering those already in the ensemble. Additive \nlogistic regression\
    \ use similar adaptation by modifying the forward stagewise modeling method (Witten,\
    \ Frank, \n& Hall, 2011). \nFor K-class classification (ܭ≥2), consider an ܰexample\
    \ training set ሼݔ௜,ݕ௜ሽ௜ୀଵ\nே\n where ݔ௜ denotes a feature \nvalue and  ݕ௜  ∈ ሼ1,\
    \ … ,ܭሽ  denotes a class label. Class probabilities conditioned on x denoted by\
    \ \n݌ = (݌ଵ, … , ݌௄)் are learned from the training set. For a test example with\
    \ known x and unknown ݕ, we predict \na class label by using the Bayes rule: ݕ=ܽݎ݃݉ܽݔ௞\
    \ ݌௞, ݇=1,…,ܭ. \nInstead of learning the class probability directly, one learns\
    \ its “proxy” ܨ=(ܨଵ, … ,ܨ௄)் given by the so-called \nLogit link function: \n\
    \ \n݌௞ =\nୣ୶୮ (ிೖ)\n∑\nୣ୶୮ (ிೕ)\n಼\nೕసభ\n \n(2) \nwith the constraint ∑ܨ௞\n௄\n\
    ௞ୀଵ\n (Friedman et al., 2000). For simplicity and without confusion, we hereafter\
    \ omit the \ndependence on x for F and for other related variables.  \nThe F \
    \ is obtained by minimizing a target function on training data:  \n ܮ݋ݏݏ=∑ܮ(ݕ௜\
    \ ݔ௜),\nே\n௜ୀଵ\n \n (3) \nwhere ܨ௜ is shorthand for ܨ(ݔ௜) and ܮ(ݕ௜ ,ܨ௜) is the\
    \ Logit loss for a single training example: \n ܮ(ݕ௜ ,ܨ௜)=−∑ݎ௜௞\n௄\n௞ୀଵ\n݈݋݃݌௜௞\
    \ , \n (4) \nWhere ݎ௜௞=1 if ݕ௜ =݇ and ݋ otherwise. The probability ݌௜௞ is connected\
    \ to ܨ௜௞ via (2). \nTo make the optimization of (3) feasible, a model is needed\
    \ to describe how F depends on x . For example, \nlinear model ܨ=்ܹݔ is used in\
    \ traditional Logit regression, while Generalized Additive Model is adopted in\
    \ \nLogitBoost: \n ܨ(ݔ)=∑݂௠(ݔ),\nெ\n௠ୀଵ\n \n (5) \nwhere each ݂௠(ݔ), a ܭ dimensional\
    \ sum-to-zero vector, is learned by greedy stage-wise optimization. That is, \n\
    at each iteration ݂௠(ݔ) is added only based on ܨ=∑݂௝\n௠ିଵ\n௝ୀଵ\n. Formally, \n\
    \ \n݂௠(ݔ)= argmin௙ ∑ܮ(ݕ௜ ,ܨ௜+݂(ݔ௜)),\nே\n௜ୀଵ\n  \n (6) \nݏ.ݐ.∑݂௞ (ݔ௜)=0,݅=1,…,ܰ,\
    \ \nThis procedure repeats ܯ times with initial condition ܨ=0. Owing to its iterative\
    \ nature, we only need to \nknow how to solve (6) in order to implement the optimization\
    \ (Sun et al., 2014). \nModels were performed in WEKA 3.6.13 software Explorer\
    \ interface (Hall et al., 2009). They were built \nseparately for each cultivar\
    \ using their own significant fluorescence and reflectance indices according to\
    \ \nANOVA results. The four output classes used in the analysis were T0, T1, T2\
    \ and T3 distributed on 72 \nobservations in each model. In holdout evaluation,\
    \ the data were randomly separated into training and test \ndatasets such that\
    \ 66% of the data was utilized for training the classifier model; while 33% of\
    \ the data was used \nfor testing the developed classifier model. In order to\
    \ mitigate any bias by the particular sample chosen for \nholdout, we performed\

    \ and relationship with bioparameters. From most to least \nimportance order,\
    \ these spectral features are related to water content (NWI, NWI5, NWI4, dNIRMin920_980,\
    \ \nmin950_970), chlorophyll content (Datt5, NDVI3, SR5, and RatiodRE_703), anthocyanin\
    \ content (ANTH), foliar \ndensity (FRF_R), nitrogen content (NBI_R), photosynthetic\
    \ activity (DPI) and leaf area index (GI).  \nAs expected, most of these spectral\
    \ features appear to be relevant in plantain mycorrhization studies. On the one\
    \ \nhand, we can see that indices linked to water content appear with great occurrence\
    \ in both varieties: NWI, NWI4, \nNWI5, dNIRmin920_980, min950_970. These water-based\
    \ indexes demonstrate that mycorrhized plantains have \nbetter water content in\
    \ comparison to control. This result agrees with Nwaga et al. (2011) study which\
    \ has shown \ngood correlation between water use efficiency and drought tolerance\
    \ of mycorrhized plantains. As an example, \nOrishele water content indices given\
    \ in Figure 4 show that water-based indexes means for all mycorrhized \nclasses\
    \ are higher than control ones. \n \n \nwww.ccsenet.org/apr \nApplied Physics\

    \ Therefore this parameter may stand as an indicator of \nwater status. The negative\

    \ \ncontent in leaf is high when NW5 is high. Indeed dNIRmin920_980 and min950_970\
    \ are negatively correlated \nwith relative water content. In addition, NWI5 presents\
    \ more significance in Orishele variety than in Fhia 21 \nbecause Orishele is\

    \ 1994) have reported that AMF improves nutrient uptake and growth of bananas\
    \ particularly an \nenhancement of P uptake. In this context, our study provides\
    \ additive information especially about \nmycorrhization effects on plantain nutrition,\
    \ leaf pigment content and photosynthetic activity. Indeed, in variety \nFhia\
    \ 21, ANTH index which is negatively correlated with anthocyanin content as demonstrated\
    \ by J. Baluja \n(2012), indicates that all mycorrhizal treatment induces an increase\
    \ of anthocyanins. FRF_R index is related to \nwww.ccsenet.org/apr \nApplied Physics\
    \ Research \nVol. 8, No. 3; 2016 \n25 \nfoliar density. Bramley et al. (2011)\
    \ showed that NDVI provided by GreenSeeker has a positive relationship with \n\
    index FRF_R obtained using the Multiplex long distance to flowering when the vegetation\
    \ is less developed. So \nwe deduce low rate of chlorophyll content in Fhia 21\
    \ variety for mycorrhized plants. This is also illustrated in \nfigure 5 by chlorophyll\
    \ index (Datt5, SR5, NDVI3 and GI) and is due to higher anthocyanin content. \n\

    \ depicting the range. Dots outside vertical range are outliers’ data \n \nIn\
    \ Orishele variety, improved effects of mycorrhizae on chlorophyll content and\
    \ photosynthetic activity appear \nand are respectively shown by higher value\
    \ of red-edge spectral feature (RatiodRE_703) and double peak indice \n(DPI) in\
    \ T1 and T2 mycorrhized treatments (Figure 6). Experience conducted by Zarco-Tejada\
    \ et al (2003) have \ndemonstrated that natural fluorescence emission is observable\
    \ on the first derivative reflectance spectra as a \ndouble-peak feature in the\
    \ 690–710 nm spectral region. DPI is capable for tracking natural steady-state\
    \ \nfluorescence and is closely related to photosynthetic activity so that DPI\
    \ is low when photosynthetic rates are \nhigh. Nethertheless, NBI_R boxplot means\
    \ show that plants with inoculated mycorrhizae have low nitrogen \ncontent even\
    \ if we can observe highest value of this index (1.3-1.51) for T1 treatment. NBI_R\
    \ which is \nexpressed by the ratio between epidermal phenolic compounds and chlorophyll\
    \ is positively well correlated to \nthe leaf N content (Agati, Foshi, Grossi\
    \ & Volterrani, 2015). Figure 6 illustrates distribution of vegetation \nindices\

    \ in Table 6 show clearly that for Fhia 21 cultivar treatment T1 is the best and\
    \ then treatment \nT2 follows concerning with improvement of water content performance.\
    \ Reflectance indexes in Table 7 indicate \nthat treatment T1 and T2 are efficient\

    \ article, we focus on feasibility for remotely detecting at early stage two plantain\
    \ varieties inoculated with \ndifferent Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi. Our results\
    \ firstly emphasize a new water content indice NWI5 highly \nsignificant with\
    \ Datt5 index at P <0.001. New findings also concern 3 fluorescence features (ANTH,\
    \ FRF_R, \nand NBI_R) related to anthocyanin, foliar density and nitrogen content,\
    \ and 10 others in reflectance spectra (SR5, \nNDVI3, ratiodRE_703, NWI, NWI4,\
    \ dNIRmin920_980, min950_970, Carter5, DPI, GI) linked to chlorophyll \ncontent,\
    \ water content, photosynthetic activity and leaf area index. Secondly, we derive\
    \ predictive multiclass \nclassification models for each cultivar with around\
    \ 90.3 % and 87.5 % accuracy respectively in stratified \ncross-validation and\
    \ holdout evaluation. This demonstrates capability of our fluorescence and reflectance-based\
    \ \ninstrumentation for quantitatively investigating crop growth under mycorrhizae\
    \ fertilization. Effective vegetation \nindices identification in crops specialty\
    \ as well as rapid pattern recognition of mycorrhizal treatment represent \nadvanced\
    \ key for developing non-destructive and cost-effective crops monitoring detectors\
    \ which will more \ncontribute to sustainability in agriculture. Furthermore,\
    \ we might expect better results in this study using \nimproved version of the\
    \ LogitBoost classifier. Elaborating a unique model for both plantain varieties\
    \ could also \nrepresent another challenge. \nAcknowledgments \nWe would like\

    Modern plant cultivars often possess superior growth characteristics, but within
    a limited

    range of environmental conditions. Due to climate change, crops will be exposed
    to

    distressing abiotic conditions more often in the future, out of which heat stress
    is used

    as example for this study. To support identiﬁcation of tolerant germplasm and
    advance

    screening techniques by a novel multivariate evaluation method, a diversity panel
    of

    14 tomato genotypes, comprising Mediterranean landraces of Solanum lycopersicum,

    the cultivar “Moneymaker” and Solanum pennellii LA0716, which served as internal

    references, was assessed toward their tolerance against long-term heat stress.
    After

    5 weeks of growth, young tomato plants were exposed to either control (22/18◦C)
    or

    heat stress (35/25◦C) conditions for 2 weeks. Within this period, water consumption,
    leaf

    angles and leaf color were determined. Additionally, gas exchange and leaf temperature

    were investigated. Finally, biomass traits were recorded. The resulting multivariate

    dataset on phenotypic plasticity was evaluated to test the hypothesis, that more

    tolerant genotypes have less affected phenotypes upon stress adaptation. For this,
    a

    cluster-analysis-based approach was developed that involved a principal component

    analysis (PCA), dimension reduction and determination of Euclidean distances.
    These

    distances served as measure for the phenotypic plasticity upon heat stress. Statistical

    evaluation allowed the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of homogeneous groups consisting

    each of four putative more or less heat stress tolerant genotypes. The resulting

    classiﬁcation of the internal references as “tolerant” highlights the applicability
    of our

    proposed tolerance assessment model. PCA factor analysis on principal components

    1–3 which covered 76.7% of variance within the phenotypic data, suggested that
    some

    laborious measure such as the gas exchange might be replaced with the determination

    of leaf temperature in larger heat stress screenings. Hence, the overall advantage

    of the presented method is rooted in its suitability of both, planning and executing

    screenings for abiotic stress tolerance using multivariate phenotypic data to
    overcome

    the challenge of identifying abiotic stress tolerant plants from existing germplasms
    and

    promote sustainable agriculture for the future.

    Classiﬁcation of Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    INTRODUCTION

    During evolution, plants adapted to survive in ﬂuctuating

    environmental conditions. While each climatic region has its own

    abiotic challenges for plants, adaptation to local environments

    were observed within populations of diﬀerent plant ecotypes

    (North et al., 2009; Verslues and Juenger, 2011; Gehan et al.,

    2015). These ecotypes or land races, in case of plant species that

    are also locally cultivated, often are not only well-adapted to

    their respective habitat but possess also a broad genetic diversity

    (Tanksley and McCouch, 1997; Gehan et al., 2015; Alonge et al.,

    2020). Within this genetic diversity there might be traits encoded

    that confer tolerance or resistance to a certain abiotic or biotic

    stress that has been lost in modern elite varieties (Harlan, 1975;

    Tanksley and McCouch, 1997; Fernie and Yan, 2019). Contrary to

    biotic stress resistance, which often can be evaluated visually by

    measuring the infected area (Majumdar et al., 2014), tolerance

    toward abiotic stresses needs a more elaborate read out, since

    a multitude of physiological processes is perturbed that often

    cannot be described with a single observation (Mittler, 2006;

    Quint et al., 2016; Zhu, 2016).

    Abiotic stress occurs when an abiotic factor, such as water,

    light, radiation, temperature, humidity, atmosphere, acidity and

    soil exceeds or falls below its optimal range, resulting in adversely

    aﬀected physiological processes and impaired growth (Levitt,

    1980; Lichtenthaler, 1998). The optimal range for an abiotic

    factor can depend on the respective tissues or organ. Increased

    temperatures for example can promote vegetative growth and

    development of plants up to a certain level (Heuvelink, 1989),

    while at the same stress range reproductive organs such as pollen

    are already impaired or infertile (Ozores-Hampton et al., 2012;

    Iovane and Aronne, 2021). This observations for example have

    been considered in speed breeding programs. Consequently, they

    apply a lower temperature during the period of reproductive

    growth, while vegetative growth is performed at an increased

    temperature (Ghosh et al., 2018).

    When evaluating abiotic stress adaptation of crops and

    screening them for tolerance, not only the diﬀerent response of

    plant organs but also the concept of diﬀerent phases of stress

    response should be recapitulated. Following Lichtenthaler (1998),

    stresses cause a divergence from the physiological standard

    of plants, which can end up in acute damage, if a phase

    of reconstitution cannot be reached. Reconstitution might be

    followed by a stage of hardening, which can climax to a

    stage of maximal tolerance for a certain period of time. If

    the stress remains, chronic damage of tissues might occur.

    Upon timely removal of the stress however, a new physiological

    standard might be reached. Therefore, experimental designs

    should consider the period and intensity of a stress, and

    diﬀerentiate the diﬀerent phases of stress responses and

    adaptation (Lichtenthaler, 1998; Miller et al., 2007).

    Plenty studies that dealt with the identiﬁcation of abiotic

    stress tolerant genotypes utilized yield as indicator. Among the

    earliest and most prominent yield-based indicators there are the

    stress susceptibility index (Fischer and Maurer, 1978), the mean

    productivity (Rosielle and Hamblin, 1981) and the geometric

    mean productivity (Fernandez, 1992). These indices have been

    used to identify tolerant genotypes for a variety of abiotic

    stresses, such as drought, heat and salt stress (Bouslama and

    Schapaugh, 1984; Dhanda and Munjal, 2006; Morton et al., 2019).

    To compound the information obtained by single screening

    indices which proved there usability in the past, toolkits such as

    iPASTIC or other composite selection index have been developed

    to enhance the detecting power of yield-based screenings (Pour-

    Aboughadareh et al., 2019; Sabouri et al., 2022).

    Further approaches that aimed to identify stress tolerant

    genotypes

    utilized

    chlorophyll

    ﬂuorescence

    parameters

    as

    measure of tolerance (Sharma et al., 2015; Poudyal et al., 2018).

    Additionally the reduction of tetrazolium triphenyl chloride or

    electrolyte leakage have been used to test cell viability and stress

    tolerance, respectively (Saadalla et al., 1990; Porter et al., 1995;

    Dhanda and Munjal, 2006). As reviewed, there is a signiﬁcant

    amount of literature that relies on the interpretation of a single

    traits for abiotic stress classiﬁcation and the reproductive growth

    phase, respectively, but the vegetative growth phase seems to be

    underrepresented. For this reason, the presented study aims to

    utilize multi-dimensional phenotypic information obtained from

    heat stressed tomato plants during vegetative growth, to develop

    an approach that classiﬁes abiotic stress tolerance on the basis of

    phenotypes variability under stressful conditions.

    The expectation of increasingly high temperatures in the

    future, as one example for an abiotic stress factor that is

    predicted to increasingly inﬂuence crop production in the future

    (Warszawski et al., 2021), highlights the importance of breeding

    for tolerance (Fernie and Yan, 2019). Model based simulations

    have shown that only a slightly increasing average temperature

    results in a dramatic yield loss of numerous crop plants, such

    as tomato (Ayankojo and Morgan, 2020). The complexity of

    eﬀects of heat stress is reviewed by Aleem et al. (2020), which in

    correspondence with the miscellaneous molecular changes upon

    heat stress (Mittler et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2020) allows the

    expectation of diverse optimized coping mechanisms. Therefore,

    harnessing landraces as genetic resource for yet undiscovered or

    unutilized stress-tolerance mechanisms, might be a promising

    advance and support breeding of future crops (Fernie and Yan,

    2019; Ruggieri et al., 2019).

    While numerous traits can be observed during experiments,

    and each trait might have relevance on its own, it is challenging to

    merge all gathered information without introducing a subjective

    bias to downstream analysis. These biases might derive from

    attributing diﬀerent weights to individual traits, leaving out

    traits that seem to be not relevant in the ﬁrst place, or

    losing information about absolute changes when using relative

    performances for data evaluation. To diminish subjectivity and

    foster objective evaluation of multivariate datasets principal

    component analysis (PCA) can be used as a tool to compress

    observed variability into a few calculated principal components

    (PC) (Fisher, 1936; Jolliﬀe, 2002; Bro and Smilde, 2014; Jolliﬀe

    and Cadima, 2016). While the number of PCs equals the number

    of input dimensions and observed traits, respectively, the ﬁrst

    PCs usually contain more information on observed variations

    than one input dimension would explain. This enrichment of

    information is explained by so called eigenvalues. An eigenvalue

    bigger than one indicates that the corresponding PC contains

    Classiﬁcation of Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    more information on variation than one of the input dimensions

    and vice versa (Kaiser, 1960; Jolliﬀe and Cadima, 2016). Therefor

    the Kaiser-Guttmann criterion suggested to only keep PCs with

    an eigenvalue bigger than one, and thereby reduce dimensionality

    of the dataset, while retaining the majority of observed variation

    within the datasets (Kaiser, 1960). Additional to the Kaiser-

    Guttmann criterion numerous approaches have been developed

    to reduce dimensionality (Jolliﬀe, 2002). The dimensionality-

    reduced data can serve as input for subsequent cluster analysis

    approaches. Which shall be used to test the hypothesis, that

    tolerant genotypes have more stable phenotypes. A suitable

    measure that reﬂects the sum of observed phenotypic and

    physiological changes can be the distances between the genotypes

    and their respective treatment. These distances can be calculated

    as Euclidean distances which are linear connections between

    data points (Pandit and Gupta, 2011; Dokmanic et al., 2015).

    Euclidean distances are frequently applied in supervised and

    unsupervised machine learning algorithms for data classiﬁcation

    (Abdi and Williams, 2010; Dokmanic et al., 2015; Camacho et al.,

    2018). To expand our adapted tolerance-classiﬁcation method,

    two diﬀerent statistical measures are tested within this study.

    The developed easy-to-apply computational approach shall be

    further discussed for its versatile application in both planning

    and executing screenings of diversity panels for abiotic stress

    tolerance using multivariate phenotypic datasets.

    MATERIALS AND METHODS

    Location

    The experiment conducted for this study was performed in a

    greenhouse located: 52◦20’55.0“N 13◦18’38.3”E. Plant cultivation

    and treatments took place between the 17th of January and the

    2nd of March 2021 as described hereafter.

    Plant Material

    Most tomato seeds of the 14 indeterminate genotypes were

    provided by VEG-ADAPT (https://www.veg-adapt.unito.it/)

    partners and were propagated at GAUTIER Semences (Eyragues,

    France) except genotypes T56 and Tpe (Table 1). T56 was

    known as tolerant cultivar from previous experiments and

    was provided by Cluinaris (Rosdorf, Germany) while Tpe was

    obtained from the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant

    Physiology (Golm, Germany).

    Plant Cultivation

    Upon germination in the dark on wet ﬁlter paper (Carl

    Roth GmbH+Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) in petri dishes

    (SARSTEDT AG & Co., Nümbrecht, Germany), seedlings were

    transplanted into small planting pots (5 cm diameter; volume

    of 150 mL) ﬁlled with coarse sand (grain of 0.5–1 mm, RIGK

    GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany). For each treatment and genotype,

    four biological replicates, deﬁned as distinct plants grown

    from individual seeds, were grown and investigated. Seedlings

    were cultivated at 22/18◦C day/night, 60/85% relative humidity

    in a greenhouse. Twenty two days post-sowing, plants were

    transplanted into bigger planting pots (13 cm diameter, volume

    of 600 mL) ﬁlled with coarse sand. Additional light with a PAR

    lamps equipped with Master Agro 400 W (Koninklijke Philips

    N.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands) between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.

    Fertigation

    During the ﬁrst week upon the ﬁrst transplanting of seedlings,

    water was used for irrigation. Afterwards, fertigation of the

    sand cultures was done with an adapted De Kreij nutrient

    solution (De Kreij et al., 1997), pH = 5.5 and electric

    conductivity of 1.5 dS∗m−1. Brieﬂy, following nutrients were

    provided: nitrate (10.75 mmol/L), ammonium (1.00 mmol/L),

    potassium (6.5 mmol/L), phosphate (1.25 mmol/L), magnesium

    (1 mmol/L), sulfate (1.5 mmol/L), calcium (2.75 mmol/L), iron

    (15 µmol/L), manganese (10 µmol/L), zinc (4 µmol/L), boron

    20 µmol/L), copper (0.75 µmol/L), molybdenum (0.5 µmol/L).

    The pH was adjusted to 5.6. Fresh nutrient solution was added

    up to twice a day into the trays of individual plants.

    Treatments and Experimental Design

    After transplanting of the plants on the 22nd day post-sowing,

    four plants per genotype were distributed equally on tables

    among two identical greenhouse cabins in a fully randomized

    manner as suggested by Poorter et al. (2012a). Hereafter, plants

    were shuﬄed twice a week until 4 days before sampling and

    49 days after sowing, respectively. Following 1 day of heat

    adaptation at 29/21◦C on the 34th day post-sowing, the day/night

    temperature was set to 35/25◦C for the heat stress treatment on

    the 35th day post-sowing. The control treatment maintained a

    temperature regime of 22/18◦C. Both treatments were applied

    over a period of 2 weeks and were terminated on day 49 post-

    sowing. The mean temperature, photosynthetic active radiation

    during that period of the stress application are plotted in

    Supplementary Figures S1, S2.

    Classiﬁcation of Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    Procedure

    During cultivation, no leaves or side branches were removed

    from the plants. No further plant protection procedures

    were applied.

    Data Collection

    This section describes the methods that were used to obtain

    experimental data.

    Fertigation per Day

    To determine the volume of water or nutrient solution consumed

    under control and heat stress conditions, all quantities supplied

    to individual plants were recorded. In preparation for this,

    potting material was fully soaked before the ﬁrst fertigation.

    Three additional pots per cabin were ﬁlled with coarse sand as

    reference for water evaporation. At the end of the measuring

    period, remaining water was measured. The sum of consumed

    water was subtracted by the volume of evaporated water and then

    divided by the number of days observed to obtain a value for the

    volume of water consumed per day.

    Leaf Color Measurements

    To determine the impact of heat stress on leaf color of tomato

    plants photometric measurements were performed during the

    late morning hours on day 45 after sowing. Measurements

    were performed under control and heat stress conditions in

    the respective greenhouse cabins. To calculate the mean leaf

    color for single tomato plants, the ﬁrst three leaﬂets from

    the tip of the ﬁfth leaf, counted from top, were analyzed

    with a portable spectrophotometer CM700-d (Konica Minolta,

    Inc., Tokyo, Japan) using a 3 mm CM-A181 (Konica Minolta,

    Inc., Tokyo, Japan) oriﬁce plate. The spectrophotometer was

    calibrated with the white calibration cap CM-A177 (Konica

    Minolta, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) as described in the manufacturer’s

    manual. Measurements of colors within a range of 400–700 nm

    were made using the “Spectral Component Excluded” (SCE)

    measure mode and 10◦/D65 light setting to obtain L∗a∗b colors

    that are in accordance with the CIE (International Commission

    on Illumination) standard. For better comparison of leaf colors,

    L∗a∗b values were converted into L∗C∗h values. While L remains

    unchanged, Equations (1) and (2) were used for conversion of a∗

    and b∗ into C∗ and h◦.

    C∗ =

    q

    a∗2 + b∗2

    (1)

    h◦ = atan2 (b∗, a∗)

    (2)

    The hue value h was used for leaf color comparison, since it

    has been previously described as a robust measure for leaf color

    (Mizunuma et al., 2011).

    Gas Exchange Measurements

    To obtain information on the inﬂuence of heat stress on the

    plant’s photosystem, two LI-6800 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln,

    Nebraska, USA) systems were used to conduct gas exchange

    measurements on leaﬂets of the ﬁfth developed leaf counted from

    top. Both systems were used for simultaneous measurements

    of heat and control-treated plants in the respective greenhouse

    cabins. The LI-6800 systems were swapped in the middle of

    the measurement, to avoid device dependent biases. All plants

    were measured in a randomized manner within a timeframe of

    ∼2 h after heat stress was established during the late morning

    hours on day 46 after sowing. The environmental settings for the

    device’s measuring chambers were set as follows: Temperature

    to either 35◦C (heat stress) or 20◦C (control), while relative

    humidity was set to 60%, CO2 concentration to 400 ppm and

    light intensity to 1,000 µmol/(m²∗s) for both treatments. Plants

    were adapted to the light intensity for 120 s before measurements

    were recorded. Net assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance

    to water vapor (gsw), transpiration (E), intrinsic water use

    eﬃciency (WUEg) and the diﬀerence between leaf and measuring

    cuvette temperature (dT) at 1,000 µmol/(m²∗s) were further used

    for analysis.

    Leaf Angle Determination

    In order to obtain information on diﬀerential epinastic

    movement of tomato leaves upon heat stress treatment (Van

    Zanten et al., 2010), digital photographs of whole plants were

    taken alongside the gas exchange measurements. Photographs

    were imported into ImageJ (Version 1.53e; National Institute

    of Health, USA) for determination of leaf angles with the

    “Angle tool.” Angles were determined between the stem and the

    adaxial side of the ﬁrst quarter of the petioli. At least three to

    ﬁve measurements and leaf angles, respectively, were obtained

    per picture to calculate a mean angle for each investigated

    plant individually.

    Biometric Measurements

    At the end of the experiment and 49 days after sowing,

    respectively, plant growth was determined by the produced fresh

    biomass. At that time point some genotypes already developed

    the ﬁrst truss and entered the principal growth stage ﬁve

    according to BBCH code, while the majority of plants was

    still in principal growth stage two and continued side branch

    formation (Feller et al., 1995; Meier, 2018). To do so, shoot

    and leaves were separated and individually weighed with a

    laboratory scale (Kern R⃝ PCB3500-2, KERN & SOHN GmbH,

    Balingen, Germany). Hereafter, coarse sand was washed oﬀ the

    roots, residual water was removed, and root fresh weight was

    determined with a laboratory scale.

    Data Evaluation

    Data evaluation was done using R and RStudio [RStudio Team

    (2021)] as well as Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation,

    Redmond, WA, USA). The R code used for this study

    as well as user instructions are stored at GitHub and

    can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/

    BiermannIGZ/AbioticStressToleranceClassiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, raw

    data was used as input, while conditional mean imputation was

    used for missing data (Nelson et al., 1996; Austin et al., 2021).

    Raw data consisted of data obtained for leaf angles, leaf color

    (h), stomatal conductance (gsw), transpiration (E), assimilation

    (A), intrinsic water use eﬃciency (WUEg), root, shoot and leave

    total fresh weight, as well as the fertigation and leaf temperature

    diﬀerence (dT) (Supplementary Table S1). For each treatment

    dataset covered by the principle components. For each input variable, one PC

    or dimension, respectively, is calculated. The percentage is derived from the

    proportion of the respective eigenvalue to the number of input variables

    (Supplementary Table S2).

    and genotype, four biological replicates, deﬁned as distinct plants

    grown from individual seeds, were investigated. With roughly

    ten-times more samples than input variables, prerequisites for

    PCA were fulﬁlled (Shaukat et al., 2016). To suit the developed

    script, data was sorted by genotype while the treatments were

    ordered alternating. Hereafter a PCA was performed. Due to

    the underlying PCA algorithm, coordinates of individuals for

    the respective PCs were normalized and scaled during the

    calculations. Upon application of the Kaiser-Guttmann criterion

    (Kaiser, 1960) only PCs were retained that had an eigenvalue

    bigger than one. Variable contribution to the observed variance

    within the dataset was investigated, as well as the quality of

    variable representation using the squared cosine (Abdi and

    Williams, 2010). Hereafter, Euclidean distances were calculated

    between the genotype data points according to the individuals

    PC coordinates. Mean distance of individual control plant to all

    individuals of the treated plants were calculated and checked

    for variance homogeneity with a Levene’s test. Subsequently,

    distances were z-score (z) normalized using formula (3), where

    x is the value of interest, µ the population mean and σ is

    the population standard deviation, to obtain standard normal

    distributed distance measures.

    z = (x − µ) / σ

    (3)

    Due to the number of calculated distances and z-scores, normal

    distribution was check visually with a density and a Q-Q-plot.

    Since z-scores followed a standard normal distribution, they

    can be directly interpreted with a p-value that corresponds

    to the respective sigma and standard deviation around the

    mean (Marsaglia, 2004). Finally, signiﬁcance was tested with

    a Welch’s ANOVA and a p-value of 0.05. For the subsequent

    Bonferroni post-hoc test however, a p-value of 0.15 was

    allowed for the purpose of screening the small panel of 14

    genotypes. More stringent p-values might be applied for bigger

    screening populations.

    considerable variance could be observed for single traits

    (Supplementary Table S1).

    Hence,

    it

    is

    diﬃcult

    to

    draw

    clear conclusions that would allow assessment of tolerance

    by hand from that kind of datasets, without introducing a

    subjective bias. Therefore, eﬀorts were taken to develop a

    computational approach that allows to objectively examining

    the sum of observed changes. The screen plot of the explained

    variance by the PCs showed a point of inﬂection visible at

    PC3 and a cumulative representation of 76.7% of variance

    (Figure 1). As with eigenvalues of 5.36, 1.75, and 1.32

    (Supplementary Table S2) PC1-3 also fulﬁlled the Kaiser-

    Guttmann-criterion and were retained for further analysis, while

    all remaining PCs were discarded.

    To

    get

    insight,

    into

    the

    correlation

    and

    quality

    of

    representation of traits within the PCs, two approaches were

    used. First, input variables and traits, respectively, were visualized

    on a factor map using PC1 and PC2 as abscissa and ordinate

    axis. The distance between the center and the traits indicated the

    squared cosine and the quality of representation, respectively,

    which was good for the majority of traits, while assimilation (A),

    leaf color (h), intrinsic water use eﬃciency (WUEg) and leaf

    angles only had mediocre quality of representation (Figure 2).

    Additionally, the graph suggested that there were mainly four

    major directions of correlation within the dataset.

    Second, a correlation plot was calculated that provided

    information on the variable contribution to the ﬁrst three

    PCs and indicated the proportion of variable contribution to

    the corresponding PC (Figure 3A). Visual evaluation of this

    plot showed that PC1, which explained 48.7% of the variance

    within the dataset, was almost equally determined by all input

    variables except leaf angle and root fresh weight. Within PC2,

    explaining 15.9% of variance, an over-proportional part of

    variance correlated with the root fresh weight. Assimilation

    rate, stomatal conductance and leaf angles were the major

    contributing variables within PC3, which covered 12.0% of

    variance. Overall, almost all traits contributed uniformly to

    PC1-3, while again leaf color, intrinsic water use eﬃciency

    and assimilation rate were represented clearly below average

    (Figure 3B).

    Plotting of genotypes and treatments using the group

    centroids of PC1 and PC2 revealed a clear clustering of

    treatments. Additionally, the separation of genotypes was

    observed to be in an axis-of-symmetry-like manner (Figure 4).

    To test the hypothesis, that tolerant genotypes might have a

    more stable phenotype, and would thereby cluster closer together

    FIGURE 2 | Variable correlation and representation. Projection of input

    variables on the factor map using PC1 and PC2. Distance from the center of

    the cycle represents the squared cosine, a measure for variable representation

    within the ﬁrst two dimensions. Angle between variable vectors indicates

    co-correlation. Projected traits are leaf angles, leaf color (h), stomatal

    conductance (gsw), transpiration (E), assimilation (A), intrinsic water use

    efﬁciency (WUEg), total fresh weight (FW) of root, shoot and leave, as well as

    the fertigation and leaf temperature difference (dT).

    upon PCA, Euclidean distances were determined. Indeed, the

    calculated distances showed that the data point of the commercial

    S. lycopersicum cv. “Moneymaker” (T01) and the wild related

    species S. pennellii LA0716 (Tpe), followed by T56 and T49

    clustered closer together, while landrace genotypes T40, T09,

    T29, and T25 clustered further apart (Figure 4, Table 2). Upon

    validation of normal distribution and inspection of variance

    homogeneity, a Welch’s ANOVA (p < 0.05) was performed.

    The subsequent Bonferroni post-hoc test (p < 0.15) resulted

    in ﬁve homogeneous groups (a, ab, abc, bc, and c; Table 2).

    The afore mentioned genotypes were found to belong to the

    groups a, ab and bc, c, respectively. As additional evaluation

    step, distance data was z-score normalized. Standard normal

    distribution of z-scores was checked visually with a Q-Q-

    plot and a density plot (Figure 5). As normal distribution was

    observed, one-sided p-values were calculated for the z-scores.

    Using a similar cut-oﬀ of p < 0.15, which was chosen for the

    screening purpose, a second classiﬁcation of the diversity panel

    was obtained (Table 2). According to this threshold, some of the

    aforementioned genotypes were sorted into groups of more and

    less tolerant genotypes (Table 2).

    DISCUSSION

    Among current breeding techniques, the investigation of diverse

    phenotypic traits of screening populations became important,

    to identify useful germplasm for breeding. While genome

    wide association studies (GWAS) help to associate particular

    traits with the presence or absence of genetic markers (Korte

    and Farlow, 2013), other techniques such as the discovery of

    quantitative trait loci (QTL) may also take heritability into

    account (Stinchcombe and Hoekstra, 2008). Both of these

    techniques rely on clustering of phenotypic data with the

    investigated genotypes and can complement each other (Korte

    and Farlow, 2013). Also, the obtained clusters and subsequent

    calculations will eventually allow the identiﬁcation of trait

    correlations. As heritability remains a major interest in selective

    trait breeding, techniques such as the determination of best linear

    unbiased predictions (BLUPs) may accomplish the interpretation

    of traits of interest to generate selection indices (Robinson, 1991;

    Arnold et al., 2019). While the above mentioned methods have

    been shown to be useful techniques for the identiﬁcation of

    trait speciﬁc markers or germplasm, the approach presented

    in this study mainly aims to obtain a phenotype derived

    tolerance trait, which may be used as additional input for the

    aforementioned methods.

    By performing a PCA on the dataset of phenotypic traits,

    with subsequent dimension reduction, the majority of variance

    within a given dataset is retained and compressed into a few PCs.

    In the presented study, the PCs 1–3, which were retained after

    dimension reduction, accounted for ∼76.7% of variation within

    the datasets, which can be judged as a good representation of total

    variance (Jolliﬀe and Cadima, 2016). To evaluate, which input

    variables were most important for the classiﬁcation process, it

    is important to check variable contribution and correlation to

    the individual PCs, while the number of total explained variation

    of each PC has to be kept in mind. The percentage of variable

    contribution to PCs indicated numerically as percentage in

    Figure 3A combined with the variable correlation plot (Figure 2)

    can be used to interpret the PCs meaning. Almost each of

    the given input variables correlated equally well with PC1

    (Figure 3A), that covered roughly 48.7% of the variability. The

    exceptions from this were the root fresh weight and the leaf angle,

    which were the most correlating variables for PC2 and PC3,

    respectively. In addition to this PC3 also had a high correlation

    with the assimilation rate and the stomatal conductance. For

    interpretation, this means that almost all traits correlated in

    a linear manner within PC1. The exceptions however, were

    best represented in a linear manner within PC2 and PC3,

    highlighting their importance for the observed phenotypes. The

    nature of correlation, positive or negative, can be judged from the

    correlation cycle (Figure 2).

    To draw additional conclusions from PC evaluation and

    formulate ﬁrst advice on the selection of appropriate traits that

    might be used for similar phenotypic screening experiments, an

    interpretation of the variable correlation cycle (Figure 2) might

    be helpful. As distances between the investigated traits visualized

    as arrows in the correlation cycle contains information on the

    trait correlation, and only four directions of trait correlation

    were observed, some labor-intensive measurements might not be

    necessary to capture the diversity and plasticity of phenotypes

    properly. While the over proportional contribution of single

    traits within PC2 and PC3, such as root fresh weight which

    is indicated by an arrow pointing in a unique direction, a

    leave, as well as the fertigation and leaf temperature difference (dT).

    plasticity upon heat stress is given. Amongst the other three

    out of four directions of trait correlation (Figure 2), there are

    mainly variables that are well-represented in PC1 (Figures 2, 3A).

    Therefore, it can be considered to discriminate single traits as

    reasoned in the following section.

    While the root fresh weight points in its own direction, leaf

    and shoot fresh weight were found to intercorrelate well. The

    production of shoot biomass seems to be slightly supported

    by the data on assimilation rate, what does not wonder

    since photosynthesis is the basic driver for growth. Recently,

    maintenance of high net assimilation rate was observed in heat

    tolerant tomato (Poudyal et al., 2018), which might explain the

    intercorrelation between the traits. The low value for the squared

    cosine might result from the diverse tolerance levels within the

    screening population (Figure 2, Supplementary Table S1). Since

    studies on the inﬂuence of net assimilation rate and relative

    growth rate within a temperature range are an input measure

    for computational models of plant growth (Boote et al., 2012),

    it might be advisable to accompany direct measures of biomass

    traits with indirect ones such as the net assimilation rate. The

    interconnection between biomass allocation, photosynthesis and

    further traits has been extensively reviewed by Poorter et al.

    (2012b). While the overall biomass allocations is reported to be

    dependent on the species and genotype, diverse abiotic stresses

    can for example either promote (drought) or diminish (water

    logging) the root biomass allocation within a genotype. These

    reasons might explain the observed discrepancy between root

    and shoot biomass correlation. In some cases however, an

    increased root-to-shoot ratio is an important measure for the

    development of new breeding lines that should serve as rootstock

    for grafting or foster stress tolerances (Colla et al., 2017; Singh

    et al., 2017). Therefore, it might be advisable to investigate the

    root weight and a biomass parameter for the shoot as minimal

    input to obtain a suﬃcient representation of biomass production

    and basic info on its allocation. Albeit fertigation points in

    the same direction as the shoot biomass parameters, this trait

    can be laborious. Thus, it might be applicable to discard this

    measurement from the experimental design. Yet, the intrinsic

    water use eﬃciency could be an important measure to assess the

    potential water cost for carbon assimilation under a given stress

    as it points in its own direction, respectively. Since climate change

    will likely aﬀect the scarcity of fresh water, development and

    breeding of crop plants with a well-balanced water use eﬃciency

    is continuously a focus of research and breeding (Morison et al.,

    2008; Hatﬁeld and Dold, 2019).

    Independent of the gas exchange measurements, leaf color

    and leaf angle provide additional information that might be

    suitable to investigate diﬀerent abiotic stresses (Kläring and

    Zude, 2009; Junker and Ensminger, 2016; Junker-Frohn et al.,

    2019). While leaf angle measurements might be the most

    Classiﬁcation of Abiotic Stress Tolerance

    FIGURE 4 | Plotted genotypes form treatment dependent clusters. Group centroids
    of the genotypes and their respective treatment were used for plotting. Group

    centroids were calculated from the individual coordinates of each sample within
    PC1-3 (Supplementary Table S3). Treatment (color) and genotype (shape) were

    used to visually examine the genotypes.

    interesting to determine epinastic movement as response to

    heat, light or changing levels of phytohormones (Van Zanten

    et al., 2010), leaf color might be a suitable predictor for nutrient

    stresses, as these often aﬀect plant secondary and pigment

    metabolism (Junker and Ensminger, 2016; Junker-Frohn et al.,

    2019). Both those traits can be investigated posterior to the

    experiment, provided suitable pictures have been taken. A

    review on image analysis for high-throughput image based

    plant phenotyping was published by Li et al. (2014). Of all

    investigated photosynthetic traits, the variation of assimilation

    rates was the least important and least best covered (Figures 2,

    3), if judged by the squared cosine (Abdi and Williams, 2010).

    This might be due to the observation that there was no clear

    tendency of superior genotypes under control conditions, while

    the assimilation rate under heat stress conditions follows a

    trend that could be noticed, when the genotypes are sorted by

    the respectively calculated distances. This seconds the observed

    variable contribution to PC3 (Figure 3A) and highlight the

    relevance of screening assimilation rates upon abiotic stress,

    which is further supported by earlier ﬁndings (Poudyal et al.,

    2018). The other results that were obtained from the gas

    exchange measurements, as transpiration, stomatal conductance

    and intrinsic water use eﬃciency, were well-represented within

    PC1-2. The correlation between the transpiration rate and

    the diﬀerence between leaf and measure-chamber temperature

    suggests that the leaf transpiration rate is an indirect measure

    for the cooling capacity of leaves. In order to alleviate the impact

    of heat stress, this cooling mechanism is target of some research

    (Deva et al., 2020). These observations suggest that for heat

    stress experiment, it might be applicable to replace laborious

    gas exchange measurements with the simple determination

    of leaf temperature. To apply this to a scalable phenotyping

    approach and big screening populations, respectively, infrared

    pictures might be suitable to gain insight and cope with

    the workload of a big screening population (Li et al., 2014;

    Deva et al., 2020). Those kind of measurements are often

    performed in modern phenotyping platforms, which further can

    include artiﬁcial intelligence for picture analysis and options

    for automatization (Li et al., 2014). Given that development,

    it seems to be only a matter of screening, to discover

    tolerant germplasms.

    To summarize the ﬁndings on trait correlation, it can be

    emphasize that careful selection of traits can be reasonable

    to decrease the workload during the screening and that, in

    analogy to the search for a maximized genetic diversity for

    germplasm (van Heerwaarden et al., 2013), a PCA based

    tool supporting identiﬁcation of most relevant input might

    be useful. Regardless the technique for trait selection, smaller

    trials, such as the presented one with a maximum of around

    100 plants, might be suitable to identify a set of relevant

    traits for a stress of interest. The proposed selection of traits

    might also be supported by further hierarchical clustering, as

    used for the construction of crop core collections (Hu et al.,

    2000).

    Statistical evaluation of four Euclidean distances per genotype and their respective

    treatment was done with Welch’s ANOVA (p < 0.05) followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc

    test. Resulting signiﬁcant groups (p < 0.15) are indicated with letters. Mean
    Euclidean

    distances were transformed into z-scores for which the corresponding one-sided
    p-values

    were calculated.

    The obtained scatter plot that depictures the genotypes

    position in PC1 and PC2 shows the formation of two distinct

    clusters for each treatment (Figure 4). This indicates that the heat

    stress treatment indeed aﬀected the measured phenotypic traits

    within the screening population. Further, the prominent axis-

    of-symmetry might be an indicator for the diﬀerent phenotypic

    characteristics of the investigated diversity panel, that derived

    from diﬀerent trait characteristics (Fisher, 1936), which can also

    be seen by eye from the pictures used for leaf angle determination

    (Supplementary Figure S3). The z-score normalized distances

    between the genotypes and the respective treatment followed a

    standard Gaussian distribution (Figure 5). Since there also was

    a good correlation between the observed signiﬁcant groups the

    ANOVA (Groups a, ab, bc and c; Table 2) and the respective

    sigma and p-value of mean derived z-scores, we proposed

    that the z-score can be a ﬁrst measure for the statistical

    relevance of observed plasticity and tolerance levels. Thus,

    mean distances between group centroids might be suitable for

    evaluation with z-scores too. In order to allow some room for

    the classiﬁcation of tolerant and susceptible genotypes in small

    screening populations, we used a less-stringent p-value of 0.15 as

    appropriate statistical threshold which is close to the one-sided

    p-value for observations outside the one sigma area around the

    mean (z-score > −1 ∨ > 1). However, a more stringent threshold

    might be chosen to evaluate big diversity panels. Out of the 14

    genotypes assessed, eight genotypes were found to be statistically

    more relevant (Groups a, ab, bc and c; Table 2) and were close to

    or outside of the one sigma area around the mean. The genotypes

    T40, T09, T29, and T25 seem to be most inﬂuenced by the heat

    stress treatment and therefore might be classiﬁed as the most

    heat susceptible genotypes of the small diversity panel. The most

    FIGURE 5 | Visual investigation of normal distribution of z-score transformed

    distances. (A) Observed z-scores were plotted against the theoretical

    distribution. The theoretical ideal normal distribution is indicated as straight

    line, while the gray shading indicates a conﬁdence interval. (B) Density plot

    results in a bell shaped curve, indicating a normal distribution. Z-scores of

    individual observations are indicated by the rug. The dashed black line shows

    the mean of all samples.

    tolerant genotypes according to this classiﬁcation were T01 and

    Tpe out of which Tpe (S. pennellii) served as internal control for

    tolerant genotypes, as it has often been described as tolerant for

    diverse abiotic stresses including heat stress (Tal and Shannon,

    1983; Bolger et al., 2014; Egea et al., 2018). It is surprising that

    the formerly in greenhouse production used commercial cultivar

    Moneymaker (T01) is fairly heat stress tolerant and well-adapted,

    according to the presented model, since no better genotype could

    be identiﬁed.

    Similar to the calculation of BLUPs, which are investigated

    to assess phenotypic plasticity and screening of single traits

    (Robinson, 1991; Husby et al., 2010; Arnold et al., 2019),

    the calculated z-scores derived upon clustering of multivariate

    datasets might serve as measure for phenotype plasticity and

    stability under abiotic stress, respectively. In contrast to BLUPs,

    which can be used to assess individual traits using a random

    regression mixed model, the presented method aims to identify

    genotypes that have a stable phenotype upon stress, which might

    only be observable due to synergistic changes of the phenotype.

    Since the idea behind this comparative tolerance screening

    approach is based on the sum of observed changes and aims

    to identify genotypes that remained unchanged upon changing

    abiotic factors, it expands the toolset for plant breeding and

    allows the implementation of modern automated phenotyping

    methods. Divergent from ﬁeld trials, green house experiments

    oﬀer the opportunity to control most abiotic factors, like

    temperature, humidity, light and fertigation (Poorter et al.,

    2012a). This allows to test the performance of a screening

    population under a relative controlled environment that

    ultimately should mimic stressful ﬁeld-like conditions. In order

    to avoid inﬂuence of soil microbiota, which have been shown to

    inﬂuence stress tolerance (Ashraf et al., 2004; Mendes et al., 2013;

    Yuan et al., 2022), and thereby increase reproducibility, the use

    of a hydroponic systems is recommended. Amongst those, sand

    cultures as used in this study can ﬁnd application for relative

    small plants, such as young tomatoes. The small pot volume

    allowed eﬃcient usage of green house space, determination of

    individual water consumption and frequent plant randomization

    and shuﬄing (Poorter et al., 2012a). Considering increased root

    biomass at late developmental stages, other hydroponic systems,

    such as nutrient ﬁlm technique based ones, might be advisable.

    The charm of the presented method is, that there are no

    limitations in input variables, plant species and genotypes

    as well as stresses of interest. The time that is needed for

    stress acclimatization and establishment of a stress phenotype,

    however, can be seen as a constraint. Therefore, extreme stresses,

    which are often used in molecular studies of short term stress

    response, might not be suitable to be investigated with the

    presented approach, as the stress intensity might limit the plants

    ability to develop a stressed phenotype before acute damage

    is caused by the stress (Lichtenthaler, 1998). Additionally,

    a direct measure for tolerance classiﬁcation is provided by

    the z-scores, allowing a rapid interpretation of the statistical

    relevance of observations. While other screening methods may

    rely on big populations or a ﬁxed set of input variables,

    we developed an evaluation method in which experimental

    design can be both adapted to the limitations in resources and

    capacity, as well as to the already known inﬂuences of certain

    abiotic stresses.

    \ a fast, accurate, and non-destructive \nprocess for evaluating plants' health\
    \ and environmental adaptability. HTPP accelerates \nthe identification of agronomic\
    \ traits of interest, eliminates subjectivism (which is innate \nto humans), and\
    \ facilitates the development of adapted genotypes. Current HTPP \nmethods often\
    \ rely on imaging sensors and computer vision both in the field and under \ncontrolled\
    \ (indoor) conditions. However, their use is limited by the costs and complexity\
    \ \nof the necessary instrumentation, data analysis tools, and software. This\
    \ issue could be \novercome by developing more cost-efficient and user-friendly\
    \ methods that let breeders, \nfarmers, and stakeholders access the benefits of\
    \ HTPP. To assist such efforts, this thesis \npresents an ensemble of dedicated\
    \ affordable phenotyping methods using RGB imaging \nfor a range of key applications\
    \ under controlled conditions.  \nThe affordable Phenocave imaging system for\
    \ use in controlled conditions was developed \nto facilitate studies on the effects\
    \ of abiotic stresses by gathering data on important plant \ncharacteristics related\
    \ to growth, yield, and adaptation to growing conditions and \ncultivation systems.\
    \ Phenocave supports imaging sensors including visible (RGB), \nspectroscopic\
    \ (multispectral and hyperspectral), and thermal imaging. Additionally, a \npipeline\
    \ for RGB image analysis was implemented as a plugin for the free and easy-to-\n\
    use software ImageJ. This plugin has since proven to be an accurate alternative\
    \ to \nconventional measurements that produces highly reproducible results. A\
    \ subsequent \nstudy was conducted to evaluate the effects of heat and drought\
    \ stress on plant growth \nand grain nutrient composition in wheat, an important\
    \ staple cereal in Sweden. The \neffects of stress on plant growth were evaluated\
    \ using image analysis, while stress-\ninduced changes in the abundance of key\
    \ plant compounds were evaluated by analyzing \nthe nutrient composition of grains\
    \ via chromatography. This led to the discovery of \ngenotypes whose harvest quality\
    \ remains stable under heat and drought stress. \nThe next objective was to evaluate\
    \ biotic stress; for this case, the effect of the fungal \ndisease Fusarium head\
    \ blight (FHB) that affects grain development in wheat was \ninvestigated. For\
    \ this purpose, seed phenotyping parameters were used to determine the \ncomponents\
    \ and settings of a statistical model, which predicts the occurrence of FHB. \n\
    The results reveal that grain morphology evaluations, such as length and width,\
    \ were \nfound to be significantly affected by the disease. Another study was\
    \ carried out to \nestimate the disease severity of the common scab (CS) in potatoes,\
    \ a widely popular food \nsource. CS occurs on the tubers and reduces their visual\
    \ appeal, significantly affecting \ntheir market value. Tubers were analyzed by\
    \ a deep learning-based method to estimate \ndisease lesion areas caused by CS.\
    \ Results showed a high correlation between the \npredictions and expert visual\
    \ scorings of the disease and proved to be a potential tool for \nthe selection\
    \ of genotypes that fulfill the market standards and resistance to CS. Both \n\
    case studies highlight the role of imaging in plant health monitoring and its\
    \ integration \ninto the larger picture of plant health management.  \nThe methods\
    \ presented in this work are a starting point for bridging the gap between \n\
    costs and accessibility to imaging technology. These are affordable and user-friendly\
    \ \nresources for generating pivotal knowledge on plant development and genotype\
    \ selection. \nIn the future, image acquisition of all the methods can be integrated\
    \ into the Phenocave \nsystem, potentially allowing for a more automated and efficient\
    \ plant health monitoring \nprocess, leading to the identification of tolerant\
    \ genotypes to biotic and abiotic stresses. \n \nKeywords: Phenotyping, affordable,\
    \ user-Friendly, RGB imaging, image analysis.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSammanfattning\
    \ \nHigh-throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) är en snabb, exakt och icke-destruktiv\
    \ \nprocess för att utvärdera växters hälsa och miljöanpassning. HTPP kan påskynda\
    \ \nidentifieringen av agronomiska egenskaper av intresse, eliminera subjektivism,\
    \ och \nunderlätta utvecklingen av anpassade genotyper. Nuvarande HTPP-metoder\
    \ förlitar sig \nofta på bildsensorer och datorseende både i fält och under kontrollerade\
    \ förhållanden i \nväxthus. Användningen av dem begränsas dock av höga kostnader\
    \ och av komplexiteten \ni den nödvändig utrustningen, dataanalysverktygen, och\
    \ programvaran. Dessa problem \nskulle kunna lösas genom att utveckla mer kostnadseffektiva\
    \ och användarvänliga \nmetoder som låter växtförädlare, lantbrukare och andra\
    \ intressenter få tillgång till \nfördelarna med HTPP. Denna avhandling presenterar\
    \ en ensemble av dedikerade \nprisvärda \nfenotypningsmetoder \nsom \nanvänder\
    \ \nRGB-avbildning \nför \nen \nrad \nnyckelapplikationer under kontrollerade\
    \ förhållanden för att överkomma dessa hinder. \nDet prisvärda Phenocave-avbildningssystemet\
    \ har utvecklats för att underlätta studier av \neffekterna av abiotiska stressfaktorer\
    \ under kontrollerade förhållanden. Detta har gjorts \ngenom att samla in data\
    \ om viktiga växtegenskaper relaterade till tillväxt, skörd och \nanpassning till\
    \ odlingsförhållanden och odlingssystem. Phenocave stöder bildsensorer \ninklusive\
    \ synlig (RGB), spektroskopisk (multispektral och hyperspektral) och termisk \n\
    avbildning. Dessutom implementerades en pipeline för RGB-bildanalys som en plugin\
    \ \nför den kostnadsfria och lättanvända programvaran ImageJ. Denna plugin har\
    \ sedan dess \nutveckling visat sig vara ett alternativ till konventionella mätningar\
    \ och ger mycket \nreproducerbara resultat med hög noggrannhet. En efterföljande\
    \ studie genomfördes för \natt \nutvärdera \neffekterna \nav \nvärme- \noch \n\
    torkstress \npå \nväxttillväxt \noch \nspannmålsnäringssammansättning i vete,\
    \ ett av de viktigaste sädesslagen i Sverige. \nEffekterna av stress på tillväxt\
    \ utvärderades med hjälp av bildanalys, medan \nstressinducerade förändringar\
    \ i förekomsten av essentiella ämnen utvärderades genom \natt analysera näringssammansättningen\
    \ i vetekärnan via kromatografi. Detta ledde till \nupptäckten av genotyper vars\
    \ skördekvalitet förblev stabil under värme- och torkstress. \nNästa målsättning\
    \ var att utvärdera biotisk stress genom undersökning av effekten av \nsvampsjukdomen\
    \ Fusarium head blight (FHB) som påverkar spannmålsutvecklingen i \nvete. För\
    \ detta ändamål användes fenotypningsparametrar för vetekärnor för att \nbestämma\
    \ komponenterna och inställningarna för en statistisk modell, som kan förutsäga\
    \ \nförekomsten av FHB. Resultaten avslöjar att egenskaper för kärnmorfologi,\
    \ såsom längd \noch bredd, var signifikant påverkade av sjukdomen.  \nEn annan\
    \ studie genomfördes för att uppskatta infektionsintensiteten av potatisskabb\
    \ \n(CS), Streptomyces scabies, i potatis, Solanum tuberosum. CS förekommer på\
    \ knölarna \noch förstör dess utseende, vilket avsevärt påverkar deras marknadsvärde.\
    \ Knölar \nanalyserades med en djupinlärningsbaserad metod för att uppskatta sjukdomsskador\
    \ \norsakade av CS. Resultaten visade en hög korrelation mellan prediktionerna\
    \ från \nmodellen och visuella poängsättning av sjukdomen gjord av en expert på\
    \ området, och \nvisade sig vara ett potentiellt verktyg för val av genotyper\
    \ som uppfyller \nmarknadsstandarder och resistens mot CS. Båda studierna belyser\
    \ bildens roll vid \növervakning av växthälsovård och dess integration i ett större\
    \ sammanhang för \nväxtskyddshantering. \nDe metoder som presenteras i detta arbete\
    \ är en utgångspunkt för att överbrygga gapet \nmellan bildteknik till kostnader\
    \ och tillgänglighet. Resurserna är prisvärda och \nanvändarvänliga och kan generera\
    \ avgörande kunskap om växtutveckling och \ngenotypval. I framtiden kan bildinsamling\
    \ av alla metoder integreras i Phenocave-\nsystemet, \nvilket \npotentiellt \n\
    möjliggör \nen \nmer \nautomatiserad \noch \neffektiv \nväxthälsoövervakningsprocess,\
    \ vilket leder till identifiering av toleranta genotyper mot \nbiotiska och abiotiska\
    \ stressfaktorer. \n \nNyckelord: Fenotypning, prisvärd, användarvänlig, RGB-avbildning,\

    \ worldwide because of the rapid \ngrowth of the human population and increasing\
    \ consumption of goods and \nservices, exacerbating the impact of climate change.\
    \ This has increased the \nseverity and frequency of extreme weather events including\
    \ heatwaves, \ndroughts, storms, and flooding (Altieri and Nicholls, 2017), all\
    \ of which \njeopardize food security and create risks of large-scale malnutrition.\
    \ \nResearch-based solutions have been proposed to accelerate plant breeding by\
    \ \ndeveloping genotypes that are better able to adapt to abiotic stresses and\
    \ have \nthe potential to increase crop yields (Phillips, 2010). While these approaches\
    \ \nhave yielded some new lines with improved adaptability to certain \npedoclimatic\
    \ factors, phenotyping continues to bottleneck breeding \nprograms (Araus and\
    \ Cairns, 2014). Some currently used phenotyping \nmethods still rely on low-throughput\
    \ visual assessments and manual \nmeasurements, which suffer from low accuracy\
    \ and reproducibility on top of \nbeing time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective\
    \ (Chawade et al., \n2019; Fu and Jiang, 2022). However, advances in computer\
    \ vision, data \nanalytics, and machine learning have created new opportunities\
    \ in plant \nresearch and breeding. Phenotyping methods combining these tools\
    \ can \nreduce breeding costs and have made it economically feasible to expand\
    \ field \ntrials, accelerating progress in crop selection (van Dijk et al., 2021).\
    \ For \ninstance, high throughput phenotyping methods have been combined with\
    \ \ngenotypic data to analyze yield, yield components, and quality traits while\
    \ \nalso evaluating abiotic and biotic stress resistance (Chawade et al., 2019;\
    \ Fu \nand Jiang, 2022). In addition, newly developed controlled growth facilities\
    \ \nhave enabled simulation of prolonged exposure to extreme conditions that \n\
    adversely affect plant development, leading to significant losses of yields and\
    \ \n1. \nIntroduction \n \n18 \n \nfood quality as well as possibly stimulating\
    \ the development of bio-\naggressors. However, the digital divide has left many\
    \ people on the margins \nof these developments because of a lack of expertise\
    \ with the necessary \ntechnologies, the high labor intensity of their implementation,\
    \ the cost of \nacquiring equipment, or the need for familiarization with new\
    \ protocols that \nare not considered to offer significant advantages over conventional\
    \ \napproaches. To overcome some of these problems, simple methods for \nevaluating\
    \ plant cover have been developed in which a single camera is used \nto capture\
    \ images in the visible red, green, and blue (RGB) spectrum before \nextracting\
    \ leaf area, green biomass, or senescence and color vegetation index \ndata (Casadesús\
    \ et al., 2007; Arvidsson et al., 2011; Berger et al., 2012; \nEaslon and Bloom,\
    \ 2014; Joalland et al., 2016; Armoniene et al., 2018). \nMethods of this sort\
    \ have been used successfully to evaluate plant health, \ngrowth rate, abiotic\
    \ stresses, and early vigor. Similarly, morphological \nanalysis of leaves, seeds,\
    \ and/or tubers (in the case of the root vegetable \ncrops) has proven to be effective\
    \ for evaluating quality parameters and \ndisease severity for certain bio-aggressors\
    \ (Wiwart et al., 2001; Tanabata et \nal., 2012; Whan et al., 2014; Komyshev et\
    \ al., 2017; Si et al., 2017; 2018; \nCaraza‐Harter and Endelman, 2020; Neilson\
    \ et al., 2021; Miller et al., 2022). \nSolutions using more complex equipment\
    \ to capture images in the VIS-NIR \ndomain (multispectral and hyperspectral cameras)\
    \ have been also proposed \nto evaluate moisture and nutrient content, plant health,\
    \ seed water content \ncomposition and structure parameters, and vegetation indexes\
    \ (Garcia et al., \n2021; Mortensen et al., 2021; Femenias et al., 2022; Rangarajan\
    \ et al., 2022; \nRyckewaert et al., 2022; Yipeng et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2023;\
    \ Solgi et al., \n2023). However, simpler approaches may produce inconsistent\
    \ outputs, \nwhile more advanced ones are costly and often impractical or unsuitable\
    \ for \nuse in real-scale trials. There is thus a need for new robust, user-friendly,\
    \ and \naffordable phenotyping methods that have greater reproducibility than\
    \ \ncurrent methods while also being less time-consuming and labor-intensive.\
    \ \nThe work presented in this thesis was conducted to develop affordable and\
    \ \nuser-friendly methods for screening diverse germplasm in order to accelerate\
    \ \nthe discovery of new genotypes that can tolerate severe climate conditions\
    \ \nunder sustainable cultivation. Such methods would be of considerable value\
    \ \nin Sweden’s highly diverse plant breeding sector. \n \n19 \n \n2. Background\
    \ \n2.1 Plant Breeding \n \nPlant breeding, which is also known as crop development,\
    \ cultivar \nimprovement, and seed improvement, is a science-based activity whose\
    \ \npractitioners seek to develop improved plant varieties that can adapt to \n\
    specific conditions and be cultivated economically in commercial cropping \nschemes\
    \ (Breseghello and Coelho, 2013). Breeding programs typically \nrequire rapid\
    \ and accurate testing of large numbers of crosses in diverse \nenvironments because\
    \ the likelihood of identifying the best progeny \nincreases with the number of\
    \ tests that are conducted (Araus and Cairns, \n2014). Its concept entails three\
    \ operations: \n \n \nDevelop genetically variable germplasm. \n \nIdentify\
    \ and select better genotypes with all of the desirable \ncharacteristics/traits\
    \ necessary for use in a production system. \n \nMultiply and stabilize these\
    \ desired genotypes and release them for \ncommercial production. \n \nPlant breeders\
    \ may work in either the private or the public sector. Private and \npublic sector\
    \ breeding programs mainly differ in terms of the time available \nfor variety\
    \ release, the cultivar types that are created, and prioritization of \ncharacter\
    \ selection criteria. For instance, private-sector breeders are likely to \nhave\
    \ a defined target of creating new lines as quickly as possible. Conversely, \n\
    public-sector breeders also have to develop new varieties and may have more \n\
    diverse responsibilities than their private-sector counterparts, including \n\
    duties relating to academic activities or extension services. However, it \nshould\
    \ be noted that this is a very generalized description of the situation, \nand\
    \ plant breeders in both sectors have wide-ranging responsibilities. In \nparticular,\
    \ they must be familiar with and manage work in diverse disciplines \nincluding\
    \ plant evolution, genetics, biology, botany, pathology, biometry, \nmolecular\
    \ biology, and food science in order to successfully develop \ngenotypes adapted\
    \ to adverse climate conditions (Brown and Caligari, 2011). \n \n20 \n \nHowever,\
    \ not all challenges facing breeders relate to knowledge \nrequirements or the\
    \ diversification of responsibilities. Because the global \npopulation is growing\
    \ rapidly, there is an urgent need to increase the \nefficiency of food production\
    \ to ensure food security, now and in the future. \nTherefore, improving multiple\
    \ traits of interest simultaneously is the main \nobjective of current plant breeding\
    \ efforts. This is difficult to achieve because \nphysical linkages between genes\
    \ controlling different traits of interest may \ngive rise to undesirable correlations\
    \ such that improvement with respect to \none trait is accompanied by poorer performance\
    \ with respect to another \n(Breseghello and Coelho, 2013). Crop selection is\
    \ typically performed on the \nbasis of empirical observations together with knowledge\
    \ of genetic \nbackgrounds and the products encoded by new genes. Information\
    \ on genetic \nbackgrounds and new gene products is typically gathered through\
    \ laboratory-\nbased studies whereas observations are typically acquired by using\
    \ plant \nphenotyping methods to characterize novel cultivars in trials conducted\
    \ \nunder controlled or field conditions. \n2.2 Plant phenotyping \n \nThe term\
    \ “phenotyping” was introduced by the Danish plant scientist \nWilhelm Johannsen\
    \ and has been commonly used since the 1960s. Johannsen \nstated that if an organism\
    \ can be discriminated from others of its species by \ndirect examination or by\
    \ more precise measurements of its anatomical, \nontogenetic, physiological, or\
    \ biochemical attributes, then it constitutes a \ndistinct phenotype (Walter et\
    \ al., 2015). These phenotypic attributes are \ngoverned by the interactions between\
    \ an organism’s genotypic background \nand the various micro- and mega-environments\
    \ it encounters in its lifetime \n(Fasoula et al., 2020). Phenotyping involves\
    \ the quantitative characterization \nof an organism's phenotypic attributes (Walter\
    \ et al., 2015), (Figure 1). In \ncrop science, plant phenotyping is an important\
    \ tool for understanding plant \nbehavior and optimizing crop management practices.\
    \ Consequently, many \nplant phenotyping studies have been and are being conducted\
    \ in order to \nimprove crop yields and develop new lines with improved adaptability\
    \ in the \nface of climate change. Some of these studies are conducted indoors,\
    \ in \ngreenhouses or controlled facilities, while others are conducted under\
    \ real (or \n \n21 \n \n“field”) conditions (Pieruschka and Schurr, 2019). These\
    \ two approaches \nhave different advantages, disadvantages, and bottlenecks,\
    \ but whichever \napproach is used, there are two central questions that must\
    \ be answered in \nany phenotyping study: what should be measured, and how should\
    \ it be \nmeasured?  \n \n \nFigure 1. The interaction of a genotype and an environment\
    \ to produce a phenotype.  \n2.3 Methods for plant phenotyping \n \nPlant phenotyping\
    \ methods can be classified as either low-throughput or \nhigh-throughput depending\
    \ on their throughput, spatial resolution, and \ndimensionality (Dhondt et al.,\
    \ 2013). The term \"throughput\" refers to the \nnumber of discrete units that\
    \ can be characterized with respect to a given set \nof plant traits (which may\
    \ be canopy-level traits or traits relating to other \norgans) in a given amount\
    \ of time. Spatial resolution refers to the scale at \nwhich plant traits can\
    \ be measured using a given technique; the most high-\nresolution techniques may\
    \ enable quantification of traits in individual cell \ncomponents (e.g., plastids\
    \ or cell walls), while techniques with coarser \nresolutions may only permit\
    \ quantification at the level of whole cells, tissues, \norgans, or even at the\
    \ level of entire fields. Finally, dimensionality refers to \nthe variety of traits\
    \ that can be evaluated in terms of categories and spatial \nand temporal resolutions.\
    \ In phenomics, the term dimensionality corresponds \nto the number of genotypes\
    \ and the diversity of environmental conditions \nthat can be included in an analysis\
    \ (Großkinsky et al., 2015). \n \n22 \n \n2.3.1 \nLow-throughput plant phenotyping\
    \ \n \nLow-throughput phenotyping refers to traditional or conventional methods\
    \ \nfor evaluating plant traits. These methods are popular because they are cost-\n\
    effective and can provide detailed information on specific traits, but they also\
    \ \ngenerally have low sample throughput and are time-consuming and labor-\nintensive,\
    \ making them unsuitable for use in large-scale studies (Araus et al., \n2018).\
    \ Notable low-throughput phenotyping techniques include visual \nassessment, gravimetric\
    \ measurements, and biochemical assays. \n \n \nVisual assessment: Visual assessment\
    \ involves using the naked eye to \nevaluate an individual’s observable characteristics.\
    \ These characteristics \nmay include plant morphology parameters such as the\
    \ height and number \nof leaves, color parameters such as the color of the leaves,\
    \ or visible \nsymptoms that might be caused by a bio-aggressor. \n \n \nGravimetric\
    \ measurements: Gravimetric measurement involves \nmeasuring the weight of whole\
    \ plants or specific plant parts such as fruit, \nleaves, or roots. \n \n \n\
    Biochemical assays: Biochemical assays are used to measure the \nconcentrations\
    \ of substances such as proteins, sugars, amino acids, and \nenzymes in plant\
    \ tissues and cells. For example, sugar content \nmeasurements are important indicators\
    \ of fruit quality. \n2.3.2 \nHigh-throughput plant phenotyping \n \nHigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping is a non-destructive approach in which \nautomated or semi-automated\
    \ methods are used to measure multiple traits in \nlarge populations of plants.\
    \ It uses technologies such as sensors, imaging \nsystems, and machine learning\
    \ algorithms to quickly and accurately process \nand analyze data. High-throughput\
    \ phenotyping is becoming increasingly \nimportant in plant breeding because it\
    \ can accelerate the breeding process by \nproviding insights into genotype-phenotype\
    \ interactions and the influence of \nenvironmental factors on phenotype (Araus\
    \ et al., 2018; Chawade et al., \n2019; Fu and Jiang, 2022). However, high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping is still a \n \n23 \n \ndeveloping field and faces several challenges\
    \ in areas including \nstandardization of methods, data management, and cost-effectiveness\
    \ \n(Chawade et al., 2019). High-throughput phenotyping methods may be \nsensor-based,\
    \ imaging-based, or robot-based. \n \n \nSensor-based phenotyping: This approach\
    \ uses sensors such as \nchlorophyll meters, fluorescence sensors, and thermal\
    \ cameras to \nmonitor physiological processes such as photosynthesis, water use,\
    \ and \nstress responses in real-time and to detect changes in plant physiology.\
    \ \nFor example, thermal cameras can detect changes in plant temperature \nthat\
    \ may indicate water stress. \n \n \nImaging-based phenotyping: This approach\
    \ uses imaging systems such \nas RGB, multispectral, and/or hyperspectral cameras\
    \ to capture images \nof plants, sometimes in conjunction with LiDAR (Light Detection\
    \ and \nRanging). These images can be analyzed to extract information on \nchanges\
    \ in traits such as biomass, leaf area, plant height, senescence, and \nearly\
    \ disease symptoms before they can be detected by the naked eye. \n \n \nRobot-based\
    \ phenotyping: This approach uses systems equipped with \nvarious sensors and\
    \ cameras to automate the measurement of plant traits. \nThese systems can move\
    \ through fields of crops or growth facilities and \ncan collect data on multiple\
    \ traits in real-time.  \n2.3.3 \nInstrumentation for plant phenotyping \n \n\
    Several sensing devices have been developed in recent decades and have \nbecome\
    \ essential tools for quick and accurate assessment of plant \ncharacteristics.\
    \ The main advantages of these instruments are their non-\ninvasive nature and\
    \ their ability to evaluate large numbers of genotypes to \nquickly identify those\
    \ tolerant of and susceptible to specific environments \n(Pieruschka and Schurr,\
    \ 2019).  Instruments commonly used for plant \nphenotyping include imaging systems\
    \ such as RGB, multi or hyperspectral, \nand fluorescence cameras as well as sensors\
    \ that measure plant height, \nbiomass, and leaf area. Remote sensing techniques\
    \ such as LiDAR and UAV-\nbased systems are also gaining popularity because they\
    \ can capture high-\n \n24 \n \nresolution data over large areas (Yang et al.,\
    \ 2013; Fahlgren et al., 2015; \nAraus et al., 2018). \n \n \nRemote sensors\
    \ are devices that can collect data from a distance without \ndirect physical\
    \ contact with the object or environment being measured. \nThey are used in diverse\
    \ applications, providing valuable information on \nenvironmental parameters such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, and \natmospheric conditions as well the location\
    \ and movement of objects \n(Chawade et al., 2019). Common types of remote sensors\
    \ include: \n \n- \nLiDAR sensors: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors\
    \ use \nlaser beams to measure the distance to an object or surface. They are\
    \ \ncommonly used in mapping, surveying, and geological applications. \n \n- \n\
    GPS sensors: GPS (Global Positioning System) sensors use satellite \nsignals to\
    \ determine the location and movement of objects. They are \ncommonly used in\
    \ navigation, mapping, and surveying applications. \n \n- \nUAV-based systems\
    \ (drones): UAV systems can capture high-\nresolution images and data over large\
    \ areas. They typically use an \nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with sensors\
    \ such as RGB \nor multispectral cameras, LiDAR, or thermal cameras to capture\
    \ \ndetailed images of plants from above for data extraction. \n \n \nHandheld\
    \ sensors are portable devices that can be used to measure \nvarious environmental\
    \ parameters. They are very popular due to their \nease of use, portability, and\
    \ affordability. Some common types of \nhandheld sensors are chlorophyll meters,\
    \ fluorometers, NDVI meters, \nspectrophotometers, and quantum yield meters (Chawade\
    \ et al., 2019)  \n \n- \nChlorophyll meters measure the chlorophyll content in\
    \ plant leaves, \nwhich can be used to estimate plant health, growth, and stress\
    \ levels.  \n \n- \nFluorometers measure the fluorescence emitted by chlorophyll\
    \ in \nresponse to light, which can be used to estimate photosynthetic \nactivity\
    \ and stress levels in plants.  \n \n25 \n \n- \nNDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index) meters measure \nthe amount of visible and near-infrared light reflected\
    \ by plants, \nwhich can be used to estimate plant biomass, growth, and stress\
    \ \nlevels.  \n \n- \nSpectrophotometers are used to measure a sample’s light\
    \ \nabsorption at specific wavelengths. They are commonly used in \nenvironmental\
    \ testing, water quality analysis, and food safety \ntesting. \n \n- \nQuantum\
    \ Yield meters measure the efficiency of photosynthesis in \nconverting light\
    \ energy into chemical energy, which can be used to \nestimate plant health and\
    \ stress levels.  \n \n \nOther sensors: \n \n- \nGas exchange meters measure\
    \ the exchange of gases such as carbon \ndioxide and oxygen, between a plant and\
    \ its environment. They can \nbe used to measure photosynthetic rates and water\
    \ use efficiency.  \n \n- \nSoil meters measure the soil’s physical and chemical\
    \ properties, \nincluding its moisture content, pH, and nutrient levels. They\
    \ can be \nused to determine the availability of nutrients and water to plants.\
    \  \n \nImaging systems is a term that may refer to any digital or electronic\
    \ \ninstrument that captures images of plants for analysis and measurement \n\
    of their physical and biological characteristics. This includes cameras \noperating\
    \ in different spectral domains and any other instrument that can \ncapture visual\
    \ information on an object. Examples include RGB, near-\ninfrared (NIR), thermal,\
    \ multispectral (MSI), and hyperspectral (HSI) \ncameras (Araus and Cairns, 2014).\
    \  \n \n- \nRGB cameras are commonly used and capture color images in the \nvisible\
    \ light spectrum. Such images can be used to analyze plant \ntraits such as leaf\
    \ area, plant height, and canopy cover.  \n \n26 \n \n- \nNIR cameras capture\
    \ images in the near-infrared range, which \nextends from 700 to 1400 nm and is\
    \ just below the wavelength range \nof visible light. This is useful in many applications\
    \ where visible \nlight cameras cannot capture useful information. NIR cameras\
    \ are \ncommonly used to study plant growth and health. \n \n- \nThermal cameras\
    \ capture images of plants based on the heat they \nemit, providing information\
    \ about temperature and stress responses.  \n \n- \nMSI cameras are specialized\
    \ instruments that capture images in \nmultiple wavelengths or spectral bands,\
    \ often in the visible and near-\ninfrared ranges. This allows them to capture\
    \ information beyond that \nvisible to the human eye, which can be used to analyze\
    \ objects or \nscenes in greater detail. MSI cameras have diverse applications\
    \ in \nagriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. \n \n- \nHSI\
    \ cameras are specialized imaging devices that can capture \ndetailed information\
    \ about a crop’s spectral properties by imaging in \nhundreds or even thousands\
    \ of narrow spectral bands across the \nelectromagnetic spectrum. This means that\
    \ they can capture very \ndetailed and precise spectral signatures of objects.\
    \ HSI imaging has \nmany practical applications, including identifying different\
    \ types of \nvegetation, mapping geological features, and detecting changes in\
    \ \nland use patterns. \n \n \nA) \nB) \nC) \nD) \nE) \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure\

    2.4 Abiotic and biotic stresses \n \nAbiotic and biotic stresses are the two major\
    \ types of environmental stresses \nthat can affect the growth, development, and\
    \ survival of plants, animals, and \nmicroorganisms. They can also interact with\
    \ one-another and with other \nenvironmental factors, which greatly complicates\
    \ their management in \nagriculture, forestry, and ecosystem conservation. \n\
    2.4.1 \nAbiotic stresses \n \nAbiotic stresses are stresses resulting from non-living\
    \ environmental factors \nsuch as temperature, drought, salinity, heavy metal\
    \ toxicity, radiation, and \natmospheric pollutants that can negatively impact\
    \ organisms’ physiology and \nmetabolism. For instance, high temperatures can\
    \ cause protein denaturation, \nmembrane lipid peroxidation, and oxidative damage,\
    \ leading to reduced \ngrowth and yield in plants (Wahid and Close, 2007). Similarly,\
    \ drought stress \ncan reduce photosynthesis, transpiration, and nutrient uptake,\
    \ resulting in \nstomatal closure, leaf wilting, and plant death (Chaves et al.,\
    \ 2003). \nMeanwhile, salinity stress can increase ion toxicity, osmotic stress,\
    \ and \nnutrient imbalance, leading to ion imbalance, water stress, and oxidative\
    \ \ndamage in plants (Munns and Tester, 2008). \n \n \nHeat stress occurs when\
    \ plants are exposed to high temperatures outside \ntheir optimal range for growth\
    \ and metabolism. Heat can cause a range \nof physiological and biochemical changes\
    \ in plants, resulting in damage \nto membranes, protein denaturation, and oxidative\
    \ stress. These changes \nmay in turn reduce photosynthesis, impair water uptake,\
    \ and reduce \nyield. Different plant species have different thresholds for heat\
    \ stress, \nwith some being more tolerant than others. However, even heat-tolerant\
    \ \nspecies may experience negative effects on growth and yield under \nprolonged\
    \ or extreme heat stress. Heat stress can be managed in various \nways, including\
    \ by breeding for heat tolerance, using shading or \nmulching to reduce temperature,\
    \ and regulating plant transpiration \nthrough irrigation management (Wahid and\
    \ Close, 2007). \n \n28 \n \n \nDrought stress occurs when plants experience\
    \ a lack of water or a \nshortage of available water in the soil. This can cause\
    \ plants to close their \nstomata to conserve water, which reduces photosynthesis\
    \ and growth. A \nlack of water can also damage cell membranes and proteins, leading\
    \ to \noxidative stress and reduced yield. Plants have evolved various \nmechanisms\
    \ to cope with drought stress, such as root growth, osmotic \nadjustment, and\
    \ stomatal regulation. These mechanisms can help plants \nmaintain water uptake\
    \ and reduce water loss. However, prolonged \ndrought stress can cause irreversible\
    \ damage to plants, leading to reduced \nyield and even death. Management strategies\
    \ for drought stress include \nselecting drought-tolerant crop varieties, using\
    \ drought-tolerant crop \nrotations, and optimizing irrigation and water management\
    \ practices \n(Chaves et al., 2003). \n \n \nNutrient stress occurs when plants\
    \ experience a deficiency or excess of \nessential nutrients such as nitrogen,\
    \ phosphorus, and potassium, or \nmicronutrients like iron or zinc. This can cause\
    \ reduced plant growth, \nstunted development, and yield losses. For example,\
    \ nitrogen deficiency \ncan cause chlorosis and reduced leaf size, while phosphorus\
    \ deficiency \ncan cause reduced root growth and poor fruit development. Excess\
    \ \nnutrients (particularly excess nitrogen or phosphorus) can also cause \nproblems\
    \ such as reduced root growth, increased disease susceptibility, \nand environmental\
    \ pollution resulting from leaching or runoff. Plants \nhave developed various\
    \ mechanisms to cope with nutrient stress, \nincluding root elongation, nutrient\
    \ uptake mechanisms, and nutrient \nstorage. Management strategies for nutrient\
    \ stress include selecting crop \nvarieties with better nutrient use efficiency,\
    \ optimizing fertilizer \ntreatments, and using integrated nutrient management\
    \ practices to reduce \nnutrient losses and improve nutrient uptake efficiency\
    \ (Kumari et al., \n2022). \n2.4.2 \nBiotic stresses  \n \nBiotic stresses are\
    \ stresses caused by living organisms such as pests, diseases, \nand weeds that\
    \ can cause damage or harm to other organisms. For example, \ninsects, mites,\
    \ nematodes, and rodents can feed on crops, causing physical \n \n29 \n \ndamage\
    \ and transmitting diseases that can reduce yield and quality (Koul et \nal.,\
    \ 2004). Fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens can infect plants, causing \n\
    necrosis, chlorosis, and defoliation, leading to plant death or yield loss \n\
    (Savary et al., 2019). Weeds can compete with crops for water, nutrients, and\
    \ \nlight, reducing crop yield and quality (Oerke, 2006). Some notable biotic\
    \ \nagents that threaten food production are Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) \naffecting\
    \ wheat, and Common Scab (CS), affecting potatoes. \n \n \nFusarium Head Blight\
    \ (FHB) is a devastating disease affecting wheat \ncaused by the fungus Fusarium\
    \ graminearum. FHB can cause significant \nyield losses and reduce grain quality\
    \ by producing mycotoxins that are \nhazardous to human and animal consumption.\
    \ The disease is \ncharacterized by the bleaching and shriveling of infected grain\
    \ heads, \nwhich can lead to significant yield loss. FHB is favored by warm and\
    \ \nhumid weather conditions during the flowering and grain development \nstages\
    \ of wheat growth. The fungus infects the wheat plant via the \nflowers and colonizes\
    \ the developing grain. It can also infect the stem \nand leaves of the wheat\
    \ plant, leading to additional damage. Once the \nfungus colonizes the grain,\
    \ it produces mycotoxins that can accumulate \nin the grain and reduce its quality.\
    \ The mycotoxin produced by FHB is \ncalled deoxynivalenol (DON) and can cause\
    \ several digestive issues in \nhumans and animals that consume contaminated grain\
    \ (Polak-Śliwińska \nand Paszczyk, 2021; Del Ponte et al., 2022). FHB management\
    \ measures \nfor wheat include planting resistant varieties, rotating crops with\
    \ non-\nhost crops, and applying fungicides. Some cultural practices such as \n\
    reducing plant density and avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilizer \napplication\
    \ can also reduce the incidence and severity of FHB (Gilbert \nand Haber, 2013).\
    \ \n \n \nCommon Scab (CS): is a disease of potatoes caused by the bacterium\
    \ in \nEurope Streptomyces turgidiscabies and S. europaeiscabiei. It is \ncharacterized\
    \ by the formation of rough, scabby lesions on the surface of \nthe potato tubers,\
    \ which can significantly reduce yield and quality. \nCommon Scab is favored by\
    \ alkaline soil conditions and dry weather \nduring tuber development. The bacterium\
    \ infects the potato tubers \nthrough wounds or natural openings and colonizes\
    \ the surface of the \ntuber. The scabby lesions that develop on the tuber can\
    \ reduce the \n \n30 \n \nmarketability of the potato and make it more susceptible\
    \ to other diseases \nand pests (Tsror et al., 1999; Oppenheim et al., 2019).\
    \ Common Scab \nmanagement practices for potatoes include planting resistant varieties,\
    \ \nreducing soil pH, and applying biological or chemical control measures. \n\
    Cultural practices such as avoiding excessive irrigation and applying \norganic\
    \ matter to the soil can also help to reduce its incidence and \nseverity (Al-Mughrabi\
    \ et al., 2016). \n2.5 Image Processing \n \nImage processing is the manipulation\
    \ of digital images using mathematical \nalgorithms and computer software to extract\
    \ information, enhance images, or \nconvert them into different formats. It is\
    \ an interdisciplinary field that \ncombines computer science, mathematics, and\
    \ engineering. Image \nprocessing has many applications in areas including medical\
    \ imaging, remote \nsensing, and computer vision. Some common techniques used\
    \ in image \nprocessing are filtering, segmentation, edge detection, image compression,\
    \ \nmorphological operators, feature extraction, and object recognition \n(Gonzalez,\
    \ 2009; Szeliski, 2010).  \n2.5.1 \nImage  \n \nAn image is a visual representation\
    \ of something. A digital image is created \nby dividing a two-dimensional image\
    \ into a grid of small squares, known as \npixels (short for \"picture elements\"\
    ), which are the basic units of digital \nimages. Each pixel is a tiny square\
    \ or dot that represents a single point in an \nimage and is characterized by\
    \ specifying its color, brightness, and location.  \n2.5.2 \nImage resolution\
    \ \n \nThe resolution of an image is measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots\
    \ per \ninch (DPI) and determines the image’s quality, sharpness, and level of\
    \ detail. \nA higher-resolution image contains more pixels per inch and appears\
    \ clearer \nand sharper than a lower-resolution one. Several image formats may\
    \ be used, \nincluding RAW, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, and TIFF. \n \n \n31 \n \n \n\
    RAW image files contain minimally processed data directly from a \ndigital camera's\
    \ image sensor. They include all information captured by \nthe camera's sensor,\
    \ including details such as brightness, contrast, color \ntemperature, and white\
    \ balance. \n \n \nJPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a common format\
    \ used \nfor photographs and other complex images. It uses compression to \nreduce\
    \ the file size while maintaining relatively high quality. \n \n \nPNG (Portable\
    \ Network Graphics) is used for images that require \ntransparency or higher quality\
    \ than JPEG can provide. It does not use \ncompression and can therefore give\
    \ rise to relatively large files.  \n \n \nGIF (Graphics Interchange Format)\
    \ is used for simple animations and \nimages with limited colors. It uses compression\
    \ and can support \ntransparency. \n \n \nBMP (Bitmap) is used for Windows-based\
    \ systems and does not use \ncompression. It supports both color and black-and-white\
    \ images. \n \n \nTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is commonly used in professional\
    \ \nphotography and printing. It supports high-quality images and can be \nused\
    \ for both color and black-and-white images. \n2.5.3 \nColor Spaces \n \nIn image\
    \ processing, a color space is a mathematical representation of colors \nthat\
    \ allows us to describe and manipulate the colors in an image. Several \ncolor\
    \ spaces are used in image processing, each of which has its own \ncharacteristics\
    \ and advantages (Gonzalez, 2009; Poynton, 2012). \n \n \nRGB (Red, Green, and\
    \ Blue) is the most commonly used color space \nin digital imaging. It represents\
    \ colors using a combination of red, green, \nand blue intensities, which are\
    \ typically represented as integer values \nranging from 0 to 255. RGB is an additive\
    \ color model, meaning that \ncolors are created by adding different intensities\
    \ of red, green, and blue \nlight. \n \n32 \n \n \nCMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow,\
    \ and Key/Black) is used primarily for \nprinting. It represents colors using\
    \ a combination of cyan, magenta, \nyellow, and black values. CMYK is a subtractive\
    \ color model, meaning \nthat the colors are created by subtracting different\
    \ amounts of cyan, \nmagenta, yellow, and black ink from a white background. \n\
    \ \n \nHSL (Hue, Saturation, and Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, \nand Value)\
    \ are based on the idea of a color wheel. They represent colors \nusing three\
    \ values: hue, saturation, and brightness. HSL and HSV are \noften used in image\
    \ editing software to adjust an image’s color balance \nand tone. \n \n \nLab\
    \ is a device-independent color space that is used to represent all \nvisible\
    \ colors. It separates color information into a luminance (L) \nchannel and two\
    \ color channels (‘a’ and ‘b’). The Lab color space is used \nin color correction\
    \ and color management applications. \n2.5.4 \nImage processing techniques \n\
    \ \n \nFiltering is the process of modifying or enhancing an image by applying\
    \ \na set of mathematical operations. Several different types of filters are \n\
    used in image processing, including spatial filters, frequency filters, and \n\
    time filters. \n \n \nSegmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple\
    \ segments \nor regions. It is used to identify objects or features in an image\
    \ and \nseparate them from the background. \n \n \nEdge detection is the process\
    \ of identifying the edges or boundaries of \nobjects in an image. It is used\
    \ to enhance the visual appearance of an \nimage or to identify the edges of objects\
    \ for further analysis. \n \n \nImage compression is the process of reducing\
    \ an image’s size without \nlosing important information. It is used to store\
    \ and transmit images \nefficiently. \n \n33 \n \n \nMorphological operations\
    \ are mathematical operations used to process \nimages based on their shape. They\
    \ are used to extract features or remove \nnoise from an image. \n \n \nFeature\
    \ extraction is the process of identifying and extracting relevant \ninformation\
    \ or features from an image. It is used in computer vision and \npattern recognition.\
    \ \n \n \nObject recognition is the process of identifying and classifying objects\
    \ \nin an image. It is used in many fields including robotics, surveillance, \n\
    and medical imaging. \n2.5.5 \nMachine learning and Deep learning \n \n \nMachine\
    \ learning (ML): is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that \ninvolves teaching\
    \ computers to learn from data without being explicitly \nprogrammed. This allows\
    \ computers to automatically improve their \nperformance at specific tasks by\
    \ learning from data. Machine learning \nhas greatly improved the efficiency and\
    \ accuracy of image-based plant \nphenotyping, which can help researchers better\
    \ understand plant growth \nand development, and ultimately contribute to improving\
    \ crop yields and \nfood security. Machine learning may be either supervised or\
    \ \nunsupervised (Bishop and Nasrabadi, 2006; Murphy, 2012; van Dijk et \nal.,\
    \ 2021). \n \n- \nUnsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which\
    \ the \nalgorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning that there are \n\
    no corresponding target variables. The goal of unsupervised learning \nis to find\
    \ patterns and structures in the data without using predefined \nlabels. For example,\
    \ in an unsupervised learning task involving \nclustering customers based on their\
    \ purchasing behavior, the \nalgorithm would be trained on a dataset of customer\
    \ purchases \nwithout labels indicating which customers belong to which cluster.\
    \ \nThe algorithm would then group customers into clusters based on \nsimilarities\
    \ in their purchasing behavior (Hinton and Sejnowski, \n1999; Celebi et al., 2013).\
    \ \n \n34 \n \n \n- \nSupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which\
    \ the \nalgorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each data \npoint\
    \ is associated with a corresponding label or target variable. The \ngoal of supervised\
    \ learning is to learn a mapping between the input \nfeatures (or independent\
    \ variables) and the target variable. This \nmapping can then be used to make\
    \ predictions based on previously \nunseen data. For example, in a supervised\
    \ learning task of predicting \nsymptoms of plant disease, the algorithm would\
    \ be trained on a \ndataset of symptoms with their corresponding features and\
    \ other \nrelevant features. It would then use this training data to learn a model\
    \ \nthat can predict the presence of disease in new material based on its \nfeatures\
    \ (Bishop and Nasrabadi, 2006; Murphy, 2012). \n \n \nDeep learning (DL): is\
    \ a subfield of machine learning that involves \ntraining artificial neural networks\
    \ with many layers to learn and make \npredictions from large amounts of data.\
    \ Deep learning algorithms are \nmodeled on the human brain, where interconnections\
    \ between neurons \nenable the processing and transmission of information. Some\
    \ of the most \npopular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch,\
    \ and \nKeras. Deep learning algorithms such as deep convolutional neural \nnetworks\
    \ (CNNs) have been used to automate and improve the accuracy \nof image processing\
    \ in plant phenotyping. For example, researchers have \ndeveloped CNN-based models\
    \ for detecting and segmenting plant leaves \nfrom images, and for predicting\
    \ plant growth and yield based on visual \ntraits. One study used a CNN-based\
    \ model to extract plant growth and \narchitecture traits from images of tomato\
    \ plants, achieving high accuracy \nin predicting yield-related traits. Another\
    \ study used a CNN-based model \nto detect and segment individual leaves from\
    \ images of maize plants, \nenabling accurate measurement of leaf area and plant\
    \ biomass (Pound et \nal., 2017; Ubbens and Stavness, 2017). \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n35 \n \n3. Objectives \n3.1 General objective  \n \nGlobal agricultural production\
    \ demand is growing in parallel with the \nworld’s population. Moreover, aggravating\
    \ factors including climate change, \nsoil degradation, and the increased virulence\
    \ and resistance of pathogens \nrepresent additional threats to food safety. According\
    \ to UNFAO, the \nproduction of energy food crops will have to double to meet\
    \ future demand. \nGermplasm phenotyping and the identification of efficient genotypes\
    \ under \nchanging climate scenarios will be essential for increasing crop yields\
    \ and \nclimate resilience to meet these demands. Conventional phenotyping based\
    \ \non visual or manual assessments provides insights into plant development for\
    \ \nthe characterization and selection of individuals with tolerance to biotic\
    \ and \nabiotic stress. However, these techniques suffer from subjectivity and\
    \ limited \nreproducibility, in addition to being labor-intensive and time-consuming.\
    \ \nThey also require expertise in sample evaluation, which limits the scale on\
    \ \nwhich experiments can be performed. Therefore, several methods have been \n\
    developed for evaluating plant characteristics using simple solutions with \n\
    RGB cameras or more advanced sensors in the VIS-NIR domain. \nUnfortunately, simpler\
    \ approaches can generate somewhat inconsistent \noutputs, while more advanced\
    \ ones are costly and often impractical or \nunsuitable for real-scale trials.\
    \ The main objective of this thesis is thus to \ndevelop affordable phenotyping\
    \ methods that avoid these problems and offer \nresearchers and plant breeders\
    \ cost-effective and reliable tools for monitoring \nand analyzing biotic and\
    \ abiotic stresses in diverse plant material under \ncontrolled environments.\
    \ New methods are presented for assessing important \ntraits in different species\
    \ (wheat, sugar beet, and potato), including biomass \n(wheat and sugar beet),\
    \ and chemical processes that affect plant composition \n(e.g., gluten content\
    \ and strength in wheat), providing valuable insights into \nplant development.\
    \ The thesis also introduces new methods for analyzing \nmorphological features\
    \ that can be used to evaluate quality traits and/or \ndisease severity (wheat\
    \ and potato) in order to facilitate the development of \nmore sustainable control\
    \ strategies. This is important because current disease \ncontrol strategies rely\
    \ heavily on unsustainable practices. These methods \n \n36 \n \ncould thus facilitate\
    \ and accelerate the characterization and selection of \ngenotypes by enabling\
    \ automated, non-destructive, low-cost, and high-\nthroughput phenotyping with\
    \ reliable and accurate results. \n3.2 Specific objectives \n \n1. Develop a low-cost,\
    \ automated, and user-friendly, phenotyping \nsystem adapted for indoor facilities\
    \ to monitor and measure \nimportant agronomic plant traits. (Paper I)  \n2. Compare\
    \ the performance of two cost-benefit seed image analysis \nmethods by assessing\
    \ morphological traits in wheat grain to predict \nFusarium head blight, (FHB).\
    \ (Paper II) \n3. Evaluate the potential of combining image analysis with gluten\
    \ \nprotein screening by size-exclusion high-performance liquid \nchromatography\
    \ (SE-HPLC) to identify genotypes that are stable \nunder and tolerant of adverse\
    \ growth conditions (Paper III). \n4. Develop an image processing approach combining\
    \ color-\nmorphology analysis with deep learning to estimate tuber quality \n\
    traits and common scab (CS) severity by analyzing color images. \n(Paper IV).\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n37 \n \n4.1 Phenocave: Automate indoor\
    \ phenotyping  \n4.1.1 \nPlant material \n \nIn the first part of the study, Phenocave\
    \ was tested by conducting two \nexperiments in a Biotron chamber, one focusing\
    \ on wheat and another \nexamining sugar beet. In the wheat experiment, spring\
    \ wheat plants of a \ngenotype provided by Lantmännen Lantbruk (Svalöv, Sweden)\
    \ were grown \nunder three environmental conditions: control (optimal conditions),\
    \ drought \nduring the stem-elongation and heading stage (no irrigation for five\
    \ days), \nand high nutrient stress during the heading stage (double dosage of\
    \ fertilizer). \nIn the sugar beet experiment, sugar beet seeds of a single genotype\
    \ were \ntreated with different enhancing agents developed by DLF Beet Seed AB\
    \ \n(then named MariboHilleshög; Landskrona, Sweden) and grown under \noptimal\
    \ conditions to evaluate plant development. The seeds were divided \ninto four\
    \ groups: untreated (control); primed to accelerate germination and \nearly seedling\
    \ growth; pelleted and coated to improve seed drilling \nperformance and establishment;\
    \ and treated with all agents via priming, \npelleting, and coating.  \n4.1.2\
    \ \nMethodology  \n \nPhenocave was custom-built for use in a Biotron chamber\
    \ of four square \nmeters. It consists of a gantry robot supplied by the Igus\
    \ Company (Cologne, \nGermany), mounted on an aluminum structure designed and\
    \ built by the \n4. Materials and Methods \n \n38 \n \nEltech Automation Company\
    \ (Lomma, Sweden). It supports three different \nimaging sensors, including digital\
    \ DLSR RGB (Canon EOS 1300D), MSI \n(MicaSense Altum), and HSI (Specim FX10) cameras.\
    \ The cameras have \nfree linear movement in the XY plane and the RGB and MSI\
    \ cameras can be \nused simultaneously or individually. The HSI camera, on the\
    \ other hand, can \nonly be used alone because it must be in constant motion when\
    \ scanning the \nworkplace. The system was tested by capturing RGB and thermal\
    \ images of \nindividual plant pots. Image analysis of digital biomass was performed\
    \ using \na pipeline written in the Java language, which was implemented as a\
    \ plugin \nfor ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Each image was segmented into\
    \ areas of \ninterest to extract projected green and yellow areas. The imaged\
    \ plants were \nthen collected for destructive measurement of their real biomass,\
    \ which was \ndone by weighing the fresh matter and the dry matter obtained after\
    \ oven \ndrying, and the empirical measurements were compared to the estimates\
    \ \nobtained by image analysis.  \n4.2 Prediction of FHB disease severity based\
    \ on seed \nmorphology  \n4.2.1 \nPlant material \n \nTo predict FHB disease in\
    \ wheat, wheat kernels with FHB infections of \ndiffering severity were studied\
    \ (Paper II). The kernels were collected from a \nprevious experiment (Zakieh\
    \ et al., 2021) using winter wheat genotypes from \ntwo different sources. One\
    \ source consisted of a breeding set of 338 \ngenotypes provided by the Swedish\
    \ agricultural cooperative Lantmännen \nLantbruk (Svalöv, Sweden). The second\
    \ source consisted of a genebank set \nof 181 germplasm genotypes provided by\
    \ the Nordic Genetic Resource \nCenter, Nordgen. This set represents highly diverse\
    \ plant material including \nold cultivars and landraces (Paper II). \n4.2.2 \n\
    Methodology \n \nTwo different grain phenotyping methods were used to measure\
    \ kernel \nmorphology parameters: the free software package SmartGrain (Tanabata\
    \ et \n \n39 \n \nal., 2012) and the Cgrain Value™ (Cgrain_AB) automated imaging\
    \ and cost-\nbenefit analysis system,  which includes both software and hardware.\
    \ \nFor SmartGrain, image capture was done using a low-cost protocol from a \n\
    top-view angle using an RGB digital camera (Canon EOS 1300D). Kernels \nof each\
    \ genotype were placed manually on a blue background alongside a \nscale tool.\
    \ Following an established protocol (Tanabata et al., 2012), seven \nmorphological\
    \ traits were extracted for each kernel: area seed (AS), \nperimeter length (PL),\
    \ length (L), width (W), length-to-width ratio (LWR), \nthe circularity of the\
    \ seed (CS), the distance between the intersection of \nlength and width, and\
    \ the center of gravity (DS). For Cgrain Value™, image \ncapture, and analysis\
    \ were done using the same instrument with the hardware \nand software supplied\
    \ by the manufacturer. The capture process generates a \n3D view of each kernel\
    \ by using a special mirror system that captures around \n90% of the kernel’s\
    \ surface. Nine morphological traits are then extracted for \nindividual kernels\
    \ and kernel groups (depending on the properties of the \nplaced in the instrument):\
    \ length (L), width (W), thickness (T), average width \n(AVG.W), volume (V), weight\
    \ (WT), and HSL color space values (hue, \nsaturation, and light). Three multiple\
    \ linear regression models were built \nusing the free software package R (R Development\
    \ Core Team, 2010), one \nfor each tool individually and one based on their combined\
    \ results.  \n4.3 Identification of climate stress (heat and drought) \ntolerant\
    \ genotypes for wheat breeding targeting \nstability by image processing and SE-HPLC\
    \ analysis  \n4.3.1 \nPlant material \n \nFor the third part of the study, eight\
    \ spring wheat genotypes (Diskett, Happy, \nBumble, SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4, and SW5)\
    \ provided by Lantmännen \nLantbruk (Svalöv, Sweden) were exposed to four environmental\
    \ conditions \nat the heading stage in the Biotron (Paper III): control (optimal\
    \ growth \nconditions), heat, drought (no irrigation for five days), and combined\
    \ heat \nand drought. The growing conditions including the temperature, humidity,\
    \ \nand day length (hours) were based on the five-year average (2016–2020) of\
    \ \nthe weather data for the growing period from the 22nd of April to the 11th\
    \ of \nAugust (Supplementary file S3, paper III) in Malmö, Sweden. Weather data\
    \ \n \n40 \n \nwere obtained from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological\
    \ Institute \n119 (SMHI) (www.smhi.se).  \n4.3.2 \nMethodology \n \nPlants were\
    \ placed in two different chambers to induce different stresses: one \nchamber\
    \ was used for the heat and heat plus drought treatments, while the \nsecond was\
    \ used for the drought and control treatments. Three different \nassessments were\
    \ then performed in each chamber - one to extract digital \nbiomass data based\
    \ on RGB image analysis, one designed to extract \nphenotypic trait data, and\
    \ one to extract gluten protein parameters based on \nSE-HPLC analysis. For the\
    \ first assessment, image acquisition was done \nusing a digital camera (Canon\
    \ EOS 1300D) by capturing views of the plant \npots from the top, front, back,\
    \ left, and right (Armoniene et al., 2018) before, \nduring, and after eight days\
    \ of stress treatment. The projected leaf area was \nautomatically extracted for\
    \ each view using the EasyLeaf software (Easlon \nand Bloom, 2014). The average\
    \ of the five views was then taken as the digital \nbiomass estimate for the pot.\
    \ In addition, seven phenotypic traits were \nmeasured: height, spike length,\
    \ spike width, number of spikes, fresh biomass \nweight (after harvesting), thousand\
    \ kernel weight (TKW), and grain yield. \nFinally, SE-HPLC was performed to assess\
    \ the gluten protein parameters of \nthe harvested grains. The following parameters\
    \ were determined following a \npreviously established protocol (Lama et al.,\
    \ 2022): total extractable protein \n(TOTE), total SDS-unextractable proteins\
    \ (TOTU), percentage of total \nunextractable polymeric proteins in total polymeric\
    \ proteins (%UPP), and \npercentage of large unextractable polymeric proteins\
    \ in total large polymeric \nproteins (%LUMP). Total polymeric proteins (TPP)\
    \ and total monomeric \nproteins (TMP) were also calculated. \n \n \n41 \n \n\
    4.4 Evaluation of CS disease severity using deep learning \nand estimation of\
    \ tuber quality based on morphological \ntraits \n4.4.1 \nPlant material \nTo\
    \ detect and quantify CS, artificially inoculated potato tubers were studied.\
    \ \nThe tubers with CS infections of differing severity were supplied by \nGraminor\
    \ (Ridabu-Norway). The samples were taken from the company’s \ncore collection\
    \ grown in field experiments from 2019 to 2022, and 2) from a \ngreenhouse inoculation\
    \ experiment (Paper IV). The material comprised red \nand yellow tubers and their\
    \ symptoms had emerged naturally in the field. For \nanalytical purposes, the\
    \ tubers were manually categorized into five classes of \nincreasing infection\
    \ severity, with class one comprising completely or mostly \nhealthy tubers and\
    \ class five representing the maximum severity. The \npercentages used for categorization\
    \ were based on data generated using a \nsemi-automated method. \n4.4.2 \nMethodology\
    \ \n \nBefore image acquisition, tubers were washed and manually placed on a blue\
    \ \nbackground in groups of six. Images were then captured using a digital \n\
    camera (Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II) and stored for further analysis. All \n\
    image analysis was performed using two software modules written in the \nPython\
    \ programming language: one for assessing morphological parameters \nand one for\
    \ estimating CS disease severity. Both modules were linked to a \ngraphical user\
    \ interface (GUI) (Shipman, 2013; Schimansky, 2022). \nMorphological parameters\
    \ for individual tubers were extracted by using the \nOpenCV package to assess\
    \ the length, width, area, length-to-width ratio, \ncircularity, and color values\
    \ (in the CIELab color space, for which the color \nvalues are lightness and a*\
    \ and b* chromaticity values for the green-red and \nyellow-blue axes, respectively).\
    \ The skin color of the tuber (red or yellow) \nwas then identified. For the analysis\
    \ of CS disease severity, a convolutional \nneural network (CNN) was built using\
    \ the Keras (Gulli and Pal, 2017) and \nTensorFlow (Developers, 2021) packages.\
    \ Initially, tubers were classified \ninto five categories according to the severity\
    \ of the symptoms visible on their \nsurfaces: healthy (category   1) and infected\
    \ (categories 2, 3, 4, and 5). Data \nwere obtained in a semi-automated way using\
    \ Trainable Weka Segmentation \n \n42 \n \n(TWS) (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017),\
    \ applying the default settings for a \nrandom-forest supervised classifier with\
    \ four classes (background, red tuber, \nyellow tuber, and scab). The results\
    \ obtained were percentage values \nrepresenting the extent of disease symptoms\
    \ on the tuber surface and were \nmanually validated. In some cases, corrections\
    \ were performed, after which \nthe tubers were categorized into the five previously\
    \ mentioned classes. Each \npotato detected in a previously segmented image was\
    \ automatically isolated \nand reduced to a tile size of 172*172 pixels for inclusion\
    \ in a training set. Six \ndeep learning architectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50V2,\
    \ ResNet 101V2, \nInceptionV3, and Xception) were then trained using this dataset,\
    \ applying \ntwo training strategies (transfer learning and fine-tuning) to identify\
    \ the \napproach with the best performance. The robustness of the resulting model\
    \ \nwas then tested using two standard metrics: loss and accuracy. \n \n43 \n\
    \ \n5.1 Phenocave: Automate indoor phenotyping \n \nAn affordable, automated,\
    \ and user-friendly system named Phenocave was \ndeveloped. Phenocave can be used\
    \ to monitor and evaluate plant \ncharacteristics with different imaging technologies\
    \ (Figure 3). The system \nwas tested by using it to measure wheat growth under\
    \ controlled conditions \nand when subjected to stresses resulting from drought\
    \ and a double dosage \nof fertilizer. The wheat plants in this experiment were\
    \ evaluated in three \ngroups, with the first group consisting of control plants\
    \ and the second \ncomprising those subjected to abiotic stresses. Growth development\
    \ was \nassessed from the seedling stage (seven days post-sowing) three times\
    \ per \nweek until the end of the grain-filling stage (58 days post-sowing), covering\
    \ \nall six growth stages. The digital biomass extracted from the images \ncorrelated\
    \ significantly and positively with the biomass measured using \nconventional\
    \ destructive methods involving measurement of fresh and dry \nweight (r = 0.96,\
    \ p < 0.01, r2 = 0.92 for dry weight; r = 0.97, p < 0.01, r2 = \n0.94 for fresh\
    \ weight). The groups subjected to drought stress during two \ngrowth stages were\
    \ evaluated with an RGB camera to extract digital biomass \nand with a thermal\
    \ camera to verify the stress by measuring canopy \ntemperatures. For the second\
    \ experiment using sugar beet, the speed of \ngermination was quantified by leaf\
    \ area projection for eighteen days. During \nthis period, seeds treated with\
    \ enhancing agents exhibited accelerated \ngrowth. Specifically, seeds enhanced\
    \ with priming agents in treatments B \nand D (primed, pelleted, and coated) exhibited\
    \ the fastest germination, \nemerging just four days of sowing. Conversely, seeds\
    \ not exposed to \n5. Results and Discussion \n \n44 \n \npriming, i.e., those\
    \ in treatments A (control) and C (pelleted and coated) \nexhibited delayed germination.\
    \  \nThese results show that the Phenocave system can be a useful tool for non-\n\
    destructively evaluating and monitoring diverse plant characteristics under \n\
    various growth conditions over extended periods of time. One limitation \nencountered\
    \ during this work is that the lens's proximity to the object made \nband alignment\
    \ of the multispectral camera impossible. This problem will be \nsolved as the\
    \ system is refined in the future.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3. The Phenocave system\
    \ installed in a Biotron chamber with two mounted \nimaging sensors: an RGB camera\
    \ (Canon EOS 1300D), and an MSI camera \n(MicaSense Altum). Image reproduced with\
    \ permission from (Leiva et al., 2021). \n \n \n45 \n \n5.2 Prediction of FHB\
    \ disease severity based on seed \nmorphology  \n \nTo determine how FHB affects\
    \ kernel morphology, the traits of five FHB-\ninfected susceptible and resistant\
    \ genotypes from breeding and genebank sets \nwere measured with the SmartGrain\
    \ and Cgrain Value TM systems. Based on \nthe severity of the symptoms visible\
    \ on the spikes, resistant genotypes were \nassigned visual scores of 0% (indicating\
    \ no visible evidence of infection) \nwhile susceptible genotypes were assigned\
    \ scores of 100% (unambiguous \nvisible evidence of infection). These results\
    \ showed that FHB affects the \nkernels of susceptible genotypes more severely\
    \ than resistant ones, as \nexpected. Analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) was\
    \ then used to identify \nmorphological traits significantly associated with disease\
    \ severity. This \nrevealed that length, width, thickness, and color parameters\
    \ including light, \nand hue were significantly (P< 0.001) associated with disease\
    \ severity, while \nvolume, CS, and saturation (P< 0.01) were also clearly associated\
    \ with FHB \nseverity. Other parameters that were not significantly associated\
    \ nevertheless \nexhibited differences between infected and non-infected kernels.\
    \ A principal \ncomponent analysis was also performed to investigate the responses\
    \ of the \nseed traits to infection and their correlations with one-another. The\
    \ hue and \nlight color parameters measured with Cgrain Value TM were found to\
    \ have a \nmoderate to high positive correlation (r = 0.65) and a low positive\
    \ correlation \n(r = 0.36), respectively. In addition, the length-to-width ratio\
    \ measured with \nSmartGrain had a low positive correlation (r = 0.27). Some negative\
    \ \ncorrelations of varying significance were also identified based on the visual\
    \ \nassessments of symptoms and other characteristics. Finally, to predict disease\
    \ \nseverity, a multiple linear regression model was generated to identify the\
    \ \ncontributions of the 16 different morphological traits measured by Cgrain\
    \ \nValue™ and SmartGrain. Good predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.58) was \nachieved\
    \ by combining the trait information provided by both tools. In \naddition, moderate\
    \ predictive accuracy was achieved using only trait \ninformation provided by\
    \ Cgrain Value™ (R2 = 0.52), while medium to low \naccuracy was achieved using\
    \ trait data obtained with SmartGrain (R2 = 0.30).  \nThese methods for predicting\
    \ FHB infection severity are proposed as \nalternatives to expensive and time-consuming\
    \ conventional analysis. This \nuse is supported by the good agreement between\
    \ the phenotype-genotype \nassociations predicted by both techniques and the traits\
    \ assigned based on \n \n46 \n \nvisual inspection. Moreover, previous studies\
    \ found a strong association \nbetween symptoms visible on wheat head spikes and\
    \ the frequency of kernel \ndamage (Góral et al., 2018). The methodology developed\
    \ in this work could \nthus be used to compare estimated visual disease severity\
    \ scores and identify \npossible associations between symptoms visible on wheat\
    \ head spikes and \ngrain traits. \nThis work focused on the characteristics of\
    \ whole spike kernels rather than \nthe damage to a small number of spikes caused\
    \ by Fusarium colonization at \nthe site of inoculation. This is expected to reduce\
    \ the cost, time, and labor \nneeded for disease resistance assessment. Additionally,\
    \ visual scorings of \nFHB disease severity based on discoloration, bleaching,\
    \ and spike stunting \n(Zakieh et al., 2021) were previously verified by the identification\
    \ of several \nloci in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Appendix 1 of paper\
    \ II). \nBecause the plant material examined in this work was identical to that\
    \ used \nin the GWAS study, the results presented here can also be considered\
    \ to be \nsupported by the GWAS findings.  \n5.3 Identification of climate stress\
    \ (heat and drought) \ntolerant genotypes for wheat breeding targeting \nstability\
    \ by image processing and SE-HPLC analysis  \n \nDigital biomass measurements\
    \ were used to evaluate the impact of different \nstresses on wheat plant development.\
    \ This revealed that combined heat-\ndrought stress had the most severe impact,\
    \ followed by drought stress alone; \nthe impact of heat stress alone was comparatively\
    \ modest. The results \nobtained under controlled conditions showed that the SW3\
    \ and SW4 \ngenotypes had the highest and lowest digital biomass production of\
    \ the \nstudied genotypes, respectively. Drought stress reduced digital biomass\
    \ in all \ngenotypes when compared to the control set. Heat stress had a mild\
    \ effect on \nall plants but its effect was strongest in the Bumble, SW2, and\
    \ SW5 \ngenotypes. Combined heat-drought stress significantly reduced digital\
    \ \nbiomass in all genotypes, but Happy was the most resistant genotype and \n\
    Diskett was the most susceptible. \nThe analysis of gluten protein parameters\
    \ revealed that the SW3 and Happy \ngenotypes gave the highest yield, SW1, and\
    \ Happy gave the highest TKW, \nSW2 and Bumble gave the highest %UPP, and Diskett\
    \ and SW1 gave the \n \n47 \n \nhighest protein concentration (TOTE) and were\
    \ thus most promising in terms \nof performance and stability under the studied\
    \ conditions. To identify genetic \nmaterial suitable for use in breeding programs\
    \ targeting extreme climate \nresistance, the superior performance of these genotypes\
    \ should be verified in \nfield trials including analyses of their phenotypic\
    \ and gluten protein \ncharacteristics using the advanced tools developed in this\
    \ work.  \nSignificant positive correlations were observed between grain yield\
    \ and \ndigital biomass under all stress treatments, and between yield and actual\
    \ \nbiomass under the heat and combined stress treatments. These results \nindicate\
    \ that RGB imaging is an effective tool for identifying stress indicators \nin\
    \ wheat plants. Drought stress also induced significant changes in gluten \nconcentration\
    \ (%UPP and %LUPP). The majority of the gluten protein \nparameters and the digital\
    \ grain biomass (biomass) were found to be \nnegatively correlated, indicating\
    \ that maintaining high wheat grain quality \nunder field conditions may be very\
    \ challenging. The spike number is a \nmeasure of yield and could thus be a useful\
    \ trait to monitor in addition to \ntraits directly related to gluten protein\
    \ quality when screening for high yield \nand gluten protein production under\
    \ climate change. \n5.4 Detection of CS disease severity using deep learning and\
    \ \nestimation of tuber quality based on morphological \ntraits  \n \nThe ScabNet\
    \ pipeline developed in this work proved to be a capable and \nreliable tool for\
    \ assessing tuber size characteristics such as length, width, \narea, length-to-width\
    \ ratio, circularity, and values of each channel in the HSL \ncolor space. The\
    \ morphological trait data obtained with ScabNet were \ncompared to manual measurements\
    \ and data obtained using a method \nimplemented in ImageJ, revealing a strong\
    \ association (r>0.83) with the \nmanual measurements and a strong correlation\
    \ (r>0.88) with the ImageJ \nresults. Six deep-learning model architectures were\
    \ evaluated to develop a \nmodule for CS detection. In all cases, the models exhibited\
    \ conventional \nlearning behavior characterized by increasing accuracy combined\
    \ with \ndecreasing loss at each epoch. The fine-tuning strategy achieved significantly\
    \ \nbetter performance than the transfer learning strategy for the ResNet, \n\
    Inception, and Xception architectures with both the training and validation \n\
    \ \n48 \n \ndatasets. Conversely, the simpler VGG networks performed better when\
    \ \nusing the fine-tuning strategy. Four of the six models generated using fine-\n\
    tuning (InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet50V2, and ResNet101V2) achieved \naccuracy\
    \ above 90%. However, only InceptionV3 and Xception provided \nconsistent outputs;\
    \ the behavior of ResNet when applied to the validation set \ndiffered significantly\
    \ from that seen with the training set. Similarly, \nInceptionV3 and Xception\
    \ achieved stable results in terms of validation \naccuracy and loss without overfitting\
    \ (for more detailed information, see \nAppendix 1, manuscript IV). The most accurate\
    \ and stable model was \nobtained using the Xception architecture with the fine-tuning\
    \ learning \nstrategy, so this model was selected for further evaluation. Xception\
    \ had a \nstable accuracy above 95% after 10 epochs and its accuracy improved\
    \ \nconsistently to a maximum of 99% when applied to the validation set. \nMoreover,\
    \ its loss values remained low, as shown by the confusion matrix \nincluded with\
    \ the test results. With the exception of InceptionV3 trained with \nthe fine-tuning\
    \ strategy, all other architectures delivered poor performance.  \nInstead of\
    \ basing classes on infected area categories, the model could be \nimproved by\
    \ aligning it with breeders' evaluation standards. Unfortunately, \nour results\
    \ cannot be compared to any literature data because to our \nknowledge, no other\
    \ studies have addressed the problem of scoring CS potato \ntubers using RGB image\
    \ analysis. However, methods based on spectrometric \ndata captured using hyperspectral\
    \ imaging have been reported (Dacal-Nieto \net al., 2011). Such approaches could\
    \ offer new perspectives on the disease's \ndevelopment or help identify early\
    \ symptoms before they appear but their \noutput cannot be directly compared to\
    \ the results presented here.  \nThe results obtained in this study show that\
    \ the ScabNet pipeline is a \npowerful and flexible tool for quickly and efficiently\
    \ analyzing images of \npotato tubers with a wide range of sizes, shapes, colors\
    \ (red and yellow), and \ndegrees of CS severity. Correlations with manual measurements\
    \ and (in the \ncase of morphological features) two other image analysis methods\
    \ showed \nthat the pipeline can reliably and accurately measure tuber length\
    \ and width. \nTo improve the precision and accuracy of tuber identification in\
    \ the future, \nthe deep learning element of the pipeline could be expanded to\
    \ include \nsemantic segmentation. \n \n \n49 \n \nThis thesis presents affordable\
    \ and user-friendly methods using RGB \nimaging to assist the process of HTPP.\
    \ The methods were developed to \nmaximize selection efficiency and accuracy and\
    \ thus represent a major step \ntowards practically useful methods that can be\
    \ used on large scales without \nexcessive cost, usage complexity, or manpower\
    \ requirements. As such, these \nmethods make state-of-the-art approaches accessible\
    \ in the context and at the \nscale of the breeding industry.  \nThe four methods\
    \ developed in this work successfully captured diverse plant \ncharacteristics\
    \ ranging from characteristics relating to growth and \ndevelopment to those important\
    \ for detecting and predicting disease.  \nThe Phenocave system automatically\
    \ collects image data in a user-friendly \nmanner under controlled conditions.\
    \ This makes it possible to rapidly gather \ndata on a wide range of key agronomic\
    \ traits under different growth \nconditions. Additionally, it is compatible with\
    \ or adaptable to many different \nimaging sensors including RGB, MSI, and HSI\
    \ cameras, enabling the \nevaluation of a very wide range of plant characteristics.\
    \ These findings \nindicate that Phenocave is a powerful tool for improving the\
    \ accuracy and \nconsistency of data collection for phenotyping.  \nThe combination\
    \ of image analysis with grain nutrient composition analysis \nrevealed the impact\
    \ of different stress factors on plant development while \nsimultaneously providing\
    \ insights into the metabolic changes occurring in \nplants in response to stress.\
    \ These results thus deepen our understanding of \nplant traits and their relationship\
    \ with abiotic stresses. \nThe ability to use imaging techniques to predict FHB\
    \ based on seed \nphenotyping is a promising development in plant disease detection\
    \ and \nprevention. FHB was shown to alter seeds’ morphological parameters such\
    \ \nas length and width. In addition, these changes correlated strongly with visual\
    \ \nscorings of wheat spikes. As such, this method could be used to identify and\
    \ \n6. Conclusions  \n \n50 \n \neliminate contaminated seeds, helping to prevent\
    \ the spread of the FHB and \nminimize crop losses.  \nThe deep learning-based\
    \ ScabNet pipeline was shown to be a reliable, \naccurate, and consistent tool\
    \ for diagnosing CS and measuring the resulting \ndisease lesion areas. Its predictions\
    \ were shown to correlate strongly with \nvisual scorings, indicating that ScabNet\
    \ could help to reduce economic losses \nby identifying genotypes that can tolerate\
    \ CS and thus produce tubers with \nhigh market value even when challenged by\
    \ this disease.  \nAlthough the methods presented here were evaluated using wheat,\
    \ sugar \nbeet, and potato as model plants, they could easily be adapted to other\
    \ crops. \nHowever, some challenges remain to be addressed in order to unleash\
    \ their \nfull potential. For instance, it would be very desirable to incorporate\
    \ \nadditional imaging sensors such as MSI and HSI to enable stress diagnosis\
    \ \nbefore the appearance of visible symptoms. It will also be important to \n\
    evaluate the performance of each method with a wider range of wheat and \npotato\
    \ varieties under diverse abiotic stresses to validate the accuracy and \nreliability\
    \ of their predictions. Both of these issues will be addressed in future \nwork.\
    \  \nOverall, these methods offer a wide range of ways to evaluate the effect\
    \ of \nbiotic and abiotic stress. In addition, they represent important steps\
    \ towards \nmore accessible, user-friendly, and affordable imaging technologies\
    \ for plant \nresearch and agriculture, which is especially important for users\
    \ who may \nlack the resources and expertise needed to implement advanced imaging\
    \ \ntechnologies. With careful planning and thoughtful execution, these methods\
    \ \ncould be a powerful tool for driving innovation and achieving outcomes that\
    \ \nwere previously beyond the reach of most breeding programs. As such, there\
    \ \nis a clear justification for further work to develop and refine these imaging\
    \ \nsystems in order to make them even more affordable, user-friendly, and \n\
    accessible to a wider range of users. \n \n51 \n \nThe methods presented in this\
    \ thesis were developed with the aim of \nincreasing the adoption of imaging-based\
    \ technology for plant phenotyping. \nWhile they already offer good performance,\
    \ they could be refined and \noptimized further to improve their accuracy, efficiency,\
    \ and applicability to \ndiverse plant species under other environmental conditions.\
    \  \nThe automated Phenocave imaging system for capturing plant trait data was\
    \ \ndeveloped to support regular and advanced imaging technologies, such as \n\
    RGB, MSI, and HSI cameras. However, evaluations were only performed \nusing the\
    \ RGB camera and the thermal infrared sensor of the MSI camera. \nTherefore, future\
    \ work on this system should investigate the use of MSI or \nHSI imaging to predict\
    \ numerous biophysical parameters including those \nrelated to photosynthetic\
    \ systems. In addition, there is a need to develop user-\nfriendly pipelines for\
    \ the analysis of the resulting data. This will make the \nPhenocave platform\
    \ even more robust and reliable for evaluating important \nagronomic traits that\
    \ could be relevant in genotype selection.   \nPlant responses to abiotic stresses\
    \ based on image and grain nutrient \ncomposition analysis were evaluated under\
    \ heat and drought stress, both \nindividually and in combination. To further\
    \ evaluate the benefits of the \nimaging-based approach, future studies could\
    \ examine its performance when \napplied to other abiotic stresses such as salinity\
    \ or flooding. In addition, the \nimage capture process could be adapted for compatibility\
    \ with Phenocave. \nThis would enable automatic image acquisition and the use\
    \ of other imaging \nsensors to provide a deeper understanding of plants' response\
    \ to stress and \nenable the evaluation of more agronomic traits.   \nLinear regression\
    \ analysis revealed that evaluations of grain morphology can \nbe powerful tools\
    \ for detecting and predicting FHB infection. However, it is \npossible that their\
    \ performance could be improved by developing more \nsophisticated models that\
    \ take into account a wider range of morphological \n7. Future perspectives \n\
    \ \n52 \n \nfeatures such as texture. Additionally, a system like Phenocave could\
    \ be \nadapted to capture high-resolution images that provide detailed information\
    \ \nabout the structure and composition of grains, which may be useful for \n\
    identifying other morphological traits associated with FHB resistance or \nsusceptibility.\
    \ \nCS infection severity in potato tubers was estimated using a deep learning-\n\
    based method. Although the results revealed a high correlation between the \n\
    predictions and the visual scores, only two potato varieties were studied. \n\
    Therefore, a larger study examining more potato varieties should be \nconducted\
    \ to verify the method’s potential for detecting and preventing this \ndisease.\
    \ In addition, instead of using individual tubers as tiles, semantic \nsegmentation\
    \ could be used to enable the identification of specific objects or \nregions\
    \ showing signs of CS infection.  \nOverall, the methods presented herein represent\
    \ important steps towards \nmore efficient, sustainable, and resilient agricultural\
    \ practices and could be \nadapted to other crops that may present similar symptoms\
    \ to those observed \nin this work. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \n \n \n \n59 \n \nPhenotyping, the process of measuring plants’ physical and\
    \ biochemical \ntraits, has become increasingly important in plant breeding and\
    \ agricultural \nresearch. Traditional phenotyping methods involve expensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming procedures. However, recent advances in digital imaging \n\
    technology have made it possible to perform cost-effective phenotyping \nusing\
    \ RGB (red, green, and blue) imaging.  \nRGB imaging uses a standard camera to\
    \ capture images of plants and extract \ndata on traits such as leaf area, shape,\
    \ and color. The images are then \nanalyzed using computer vision algorithms to\
    \ obtain quantitative \nmeasurements that can be used to identify desirable traits\
    \ and select plant \nvarieties tolerant of abiotic and biotic stresses. One advantage\
    \ of RGB \nimaging is its affordability compared to other phenotyping methods:\
    \ it \nrequires only a standard camera and basic image analysis software, making\
    \ \nit accessible to researchers with limited resources.  \nThe work in this thesis\
    \ started by developing an affordable imaging system \nto collect imaging data\
    \ with imaging sensors such as RGB, thermal, MSI, \nand HSI cameras to provide\
    \ a comprehensive understanding of plant health \nand performance. Paper I presents\
    \ a blueprint of this system and a pipeline \nfor analyzing the RGB and thermal\
    \ images. This may help researchers \ninterested in cost-efficiently monitoring\
    \ plant growth and complex traits such \nas drought tolerance, disease resistance,\
    \ and nutrient use efficiency. Paper III \nshows that affordable phenotyping based\
    \ on RGB imaging could also help \nimprove crop yield and quality because it was\
    \ successfully used in \nconjunction with analysis of gluten parameters to identify\
    \ wheat genotypes \nthat maintain stable gluten production when exposed to abiotic\
    \ stresses such \nas heat and drought. Finally, imaging-based evaluation of morphological\
    \ \nparameters was successfully used to predict FHB in kernels and measure \n\
    Popular science summary \n \n60 \n \nquality parameters in tubers (Papers II and\
    \ VI). The resulting morphological \ndata was used to build a training model to\
    \ estimate CS disease symptoms in \npotato tubers (Paper IV). This model is valuable\
    \ because it enables evaluation \nof disease symptoms without subjectivity or\
    \ the need for deep expertise. The \nmethods here presented could thus revolutionize\
    \ plant breeding and \nagricultural research by providing fast, accurate, and\
    \ cost-effective data on \nplant traits. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ processen att mäta växters fysiska och biokemiska egenskaper, \nhar blivit allt\
    \ viktigare inom växtförädling och jordbruksforskning. \nTraditionella fenotypningsmetoder\
    \ kan innebära dyra och tidskrävande \nprocedurer men de senaste framstegen inom\
    \ digital bildteknik har gjort det \nmöjligt att genomföra kostnadseffektiv fenotypering\
    \ med hjälp av RGB (röd, \ngrön och blå) bildtagning. \nInom RGB-bildtagning används\
    \ en vanlig kamera för att ta bilder av växter \noch extrahera data för egenskaper\
    \ som bladyta, form och färg. Bilderna \nanalyseras sedan med hjälp av datorseendealgoritmer\
    \ för att få kvantitativa \nmätningar som kan användas för att identifiera önskvärda\
    \ egenskaper och \nvälja växtvarianter som är toleranta mot abiotiska och biotiska\
    \ stressfaktorer. \nEn fördel med RGB-bildtagning är dess prisvärdhet jämfört\
    \ med andra \nfenotypningsmetoder: den kräver endast en vanlig kamera och \ngrundläggande\
    \ bildanalysprogram, vilket gör den tillgänglig för forskare \nmed begränsade\
    \ resurser. \nArbetet i denna avhandling inleddes med att utveckla ett prisvärt\
    \ bildsystem \nför att samla in bilddata med bildsensorer som RGB, termisk, MSI\
    \ och HSI-\nkameror för att ge en omfattande förståelse av växternas hälsa och\
    \ prestanda. \nArtikel I presenterar en översikt av detta system och en pipeline\
    \ för att \nanalysera RGB- och termiska bilder. Detta kan underlätta för forskare\
    \ som \när intresserade av kostnadseffektiv övervakning av växters tillväxt och\
    \ \nkomplexa \negenskaper \nsom \ntorktolerans, \nsjukdomsresistens \noch \nnäringsanvändningseffektivitet.\
    \ Artikel III visar att prisvärd fenotypning \nbaserad på RGB-bildtagning även\
    \ kan hjälpa till att förbättra grödans \navkastning och kvalitet då den framgångsrikt\
    \ användes i kombination med \nanalys av glutenparametrar för att identifiera\
    \ vete-genotyper som bibehåller \nPopulärvetenskaplig sammanfattning \n \n62 \n\
    \ \nstabil glutenproduktion när de utsätts för abiotiska stressfaktorer som värme\
    \ \noch torka. Slutligen användes bildbaserad utvärdering av morfologiska \nparametrar\
    \ för att förutsäga angrepp av svampsjukdomen Fusarium head \nblight (FHB) i vetekärnor\
    \ och för att mäta kvalitetsparametrar i potatisknölar \n(artikel II och VI).\
    \ Den morfologiska datan användes för att bygga en \nträningsmodell för att uppskatta\
    \ sjukdomssymptom för potatisskabb (CS) i \npotatisknölar (artikel IV). Modellen\
    \ är högst användbar då den möjliggör \nutvärdering av symptomen för potatisskabb\
    \ utan subjektivitet eller behov av \nexpertis inom området. De metoder som presenteras\
    \ här kan revolutionera \nväxtförädling och jordbruksforskning genom att tillhandahålla\
    \ snabb, \nnoggrann och kostnadseffektiv data om växtegenskaper som är kritiska\
    \ för \nframtida odlingsmöjligheter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n63 \n \nI would\

    \ the possibility to alter climate conditions affecting\nplant growth, such as\
    \ humidity, temperature, and light, allowing a better understanding of plant\n\
    responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. A bottleneck, however, is measuring\
    \ various aspects of\nplant growth regularly and non-destructively. Although several\
    \ high-throughput phenotyping\nfacilities have been built worldwide, further development\
    \ is required for smaller custom-made\naffordable systems for speciﬁc needs. Hence,\
    \ the main objective of this study was to develop\nan affordable, standalone and\
    \ automated phenotyping system called “Phenocave” for controlled\ngrowth facilities.\
    \ The system can be equipped with consumer-grade digital cameras and multispectral\n\
    cameras for imaging from the top view. The cameras are mounted on a gantry with\
    \ two linear\nactuators enabling XY motion, thereby enabling imaging of the entire\
    \ area of Phenocave. A blueprint\nfor constructing such a system is presented\
    \ and is evaluated with two case studies using wheat and\nsugar beet as model\
    \ plants. The wheat plants were treated with different irrigation regimes or high\n\
    nitrogen application at different developmental stages affecting their biomass\
    \ accumulation and\ngrowth rate. A signiﬁcant correlation was observed between\
    \ conventional measurements and digital\nbiomass at different time points. Post-harvest\
    \ analysis of grain protein content and composition\ncorresponded well with those\
    \ of previous studies. The results from the sugar beet study revealed that\nseed\
    \ treatment(s) before germination inﬂuences germination rates. Phenocave enables\
    \ automated\nphenotyping of plants under controlled conditions, and the protocols\
    \ and results from this study will\nallow others to build similar systems with\
    \ dimensions suitable for their custom needs.\nKeywords: affordable; phenotyping;\
    \ drought; image analysis; automated\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most important\
    \ factors in functional plant biology and growth analysis\nis plant biomass [1,2].\
    \ This parameter is the basis to obtain the net primary production\nand growth\
    \ rate in every crop at different growth stages [3,4]. Conventional methods for\n\
    estimating plant biomass, however, require destructive harvests and are labor-intensive\n\
    and expensive. Thus, conventional methods for variety evaluation are often based\
    \ on\nthe ﬁnal yield for replicated plots under different environments [5]. Since\
    \ conventional\nmethods to measure plant biomass are destructive, it is challenging\
    \ to assess the process\nof development of individual plants at different growth\
    \ stages. In addition, certain mea-\nsurements are generally obtained from individual\
    \ plants that are randomly selected from\na plot. Therefore, there is a need to\
    \ develop more efﬁcient, precise, and accurate methods to\nassess key agronomical\
    \ traits for crop monitoring [6]. Another type of seed study is “seed\npriming\
    \ and coating”, a pre-sowing technology to treat seeds with one or various agents\n\
    before germination [7]. These technologies help plants prepare their defense metabolism\n\
    against certain stress factors [8,9]. Thus, coating and priming can improve seed\
    \ perfor-\nmance, resulting in faster and better germination and improving plant\
    \ growth [10–12].\nPlants 2021, 10, 1817. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants10091817\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2021, 10, 1817\n2 of 19\nConventional\
    \ methods and X-ray analysis have been used to measure the growth rate in\nsugar\
    \ beet. However, a reliable, quick, and automated method to estimate the early\
    \ growth\nof seeds treated with different treatments would make it easier to evaluate\
    \ new treatments\nmore efﬁciently.\nThe current emergence of imaging techniques\
    \ and recent advances in technology\nhave contributed to further advances in plant\
    \ phenotyping for the ﬁeld and controlled\nconditions. These new image-based systems\
    \ evaluate genotype-environment interaction\nthrough tracking plant growth and\
    \ health performance in a non-destructive, automated,\nand high-throughput way\
    \ [13]. Another advantage of such systems is that they allow\nthe evaluation of\
    \ a large number of individuals over time, raising the possibility of identi-\n\
    fying traits that cannot be tracked by conventional measurements [14] and reducing\
    \ crop\nproduction losses [15,16].\nPlant phenotyping systems designed to analyze\
    \ projected leaf area or canopy biomass\nover plant development time using a single\
    \ camera in the visible light range (RGB) have\nproven to be helpful for the estimation\
    \ of growth rate, health status, drought or salinity\nstress, and early vigor\
    \ [17–21]. Other systems use more sophisticated commercial optical\nsensors like\
    \ hyperspectral or multispectral imaging [22]. Hundreds of images can be taken\n\
    within a short period and have proven to provide reliable information related\
    \ to foliar and\nmoisture nutrient content, plant health, water content composition\
    \ parameters for seeds,\nand leaf area index, applying different vegetation indexes\
    \ [3,15,23]. Other sensors, such as\nthermal and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, can\
    \ also be integrated to detect abiotic and biotic\nstresses and photosynthetic\
    \ performance [24–27]. The choice of optical sensors mainly\ndepends on the phenotypic\
    \ variation of interest and image acquisition conditions [26].\nSome examples\
    \ of high-throughput plant phenotyping platforms are the “WIWAM”\nplatforms in\
    \ Belgium [28], which are systems based on non-invasive automated imaging\nand\
    \ precise irrigation of plants. Another similar system is Plant PhenoLab in Denmark,\n\
    a fully automated high-throughput phenotyping robot that allows rotating, irrigation,\n\
    fertilization, weighing, and measuring plants, equipped with thermal and multispectral\n\
    cameras. In the same light, the National Plant Phenotyping Infrastructure NaPPI\
    \ in Finland\nis another example of an automated platform. Such infrastructure\
    \ enables studying a large\nnumber of plants for various agronomic traits. In\
    \ the category of systems using XY motion\nis Phenovator, a system for measuring\
    \ the photosynthesis, growth, and multispectral\nreﬂectance of small plants such\
    \ as Arabidopsis [29]. A more advanced system is presented\nby PSI (Photon Systems\
    \ Instruments, Brno, Czechia), named PlantScreenTM XYZ, which\nworks with small\
    \ and mid-size plants. Such platforms acquire RGB, kinetic chlorophyll\nﬂuorescence,\
    \ hyperspectral, and thermal data through XYZ motion of a robotic arm.\nPlatforms\
    \ that acquire images in closed stations require complex conveyor systems,\ntranslated\
    \ into great investments in facilities, hardware, and software. On the other hand,\n\
    platforms that acquire images in place usually have relatively low efﬁciency in\
    \ data acquisi-\ntion. Another limitation is the requirement of specialized knowledge\
    \ to control and monitor\nthe systems. Several custom-made affordable systems\
    \ have recently emerged, broadly\ncategorized based on the type of plant species\
    \ to study. For instance, “Phenotiki” [30] is an\naffordable system that analyzes\
    \ the growth, color, and leaf area of Arabidopsis plants based\non a Raspberry\
    \ Pi single-board computer. Another example is Phenoscope [31], a platform\nthat\
    \ provides watering and zenithal imaging to monitor plant size and expansion rate\n\
    during the vegetative stage. An image processing pipeline was also developed to\
    \ analyze\nrosette area modeling [32]. These approaches have been developed for\
    \ rosette-shaped\nplants, especially Arabidopsis. Other solutions of affordable\
    \ systems applied on different\nplant sizes are MVS-Pheno [33] and LCP lab [18],\
    \ which are portable, low-cost platforms for\nindividual plants. Both platforms\
    \ work with regular RGB cameras, obtaining a multiview\nimage using a rotatory\
    \ console. The analysis of data differs with the software; MVS-Pheno\ndeveloped\
    \ its software while LCP lab works with freely available software.\nImage acquisition\
    \ and processing are pivotal for the right estimation of plant traits.\nPlants\
    \ thus need to be segmented successfully from other objects, such as the back-\n\
    Plants 2021, 10, 1817\n3 of 19\nground [4,34,35]. However, many of the pipelines\
    \ available are developed for a narrow\nrange of plant species and, in some cases,\
    \ require manual work. Solutions are thus needed\nto enable the phenotypic evaluation\
    \ of different species under highly controlled conditions,\nsystems that are cost-effective,\
    \ automated, and that can improve the intensity and accuracy\nof germplasm selection\
    \ [3].\nIn this work, we propose an automated plant phenotyping system called\
    \ Phenocave\nbuilt for highly controlled plant growth conditions and regular greenhouses.\
    \ Instructions\nto build a similar system and image analysis protocols are provided.\
    \ The results obtained\nfrom the evaluation of Phenocave on wheat (Triticum aestivum\
    \ L.) and sugar beet (Beta\nvulgaris L.) are presented.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\

    \ positioning\nthe camera over the object of interest. It is based on a programmable\

    \ The system consists of a gantry\nrobot from Igus company (Cologne, Germany)\

    \ network with carrier system (Igus, e-chain Black Cable Chain), and\nan electronic\
    \ box mounted at the right side of the frame, which contains all the electronic\n\

    \ in the electronic box [36].\nTo determine the efﬁciency, reliability, and quality\
    \ of the obtained results, two case studies\nwere conducted, which included wheat\
    \ and sugar beet as model plants. The Phenocave\nparameters were set up based\
    \ on the position of pots with XY coordinates in mm, the motor\nspeed for image\
    \ acquisition, and the operating times were ﬁxed for the whole experiment.\n2.2.\
    \ Image Acquisition with Phenocave\nIndividual plant pot images were acquired\
    \ from top-view using three different imag-\ning sensors attached to the central\
    \ aluminum plate (Drylin W bearing and mounting plate)\nfrom 1.8 m above ground.\
    \ One RGB digital single-lens reﬂex (DSLR) camera, a Canon\nEOS 1300D (Canon U.S.A.\
    \ Inc., Huntington, NY, USA) with a resolution of 18 megapixels,\nwas mounted\
    \ with a Canon EF-S 50 mm f/1.8 STM lens. The optimal exposure settings\nfor imaging\
    \ based on the growth conditions were F-Stop 1/160, exposure time 1/10, AF\nAI-Servo,\
    \ and ISO 400. All pictures were saved in 5184 × 3456 pixel JPG format. The second\n\
    sensor was the MicaSense Altum multispectral camera (MicaSense Inc., Seattle,\
    \ WA, USA)\nwith an image resolution of 2064 × 1544 pixels and storage in TIF\
    \ format. The MicaSense\nAltum has one thermal and ﬁve multispectral bands (blue,\
    \ green, red, red edge, and NIR).\nAs the distance from the top of the plant to\
    \ the camera lens was less than two meters, it was\nnot possible to align the\
    \ ﬁve multispectral bands perfectly (personal communication with\nMicaSense support).\
    \ Thus only the thermal images from the MicaSense Altum were used\nfor analysis.\
    \ The third sensor was the Canon DSLR Rebel T6 NDVI conversion. Aiming to\navoid\
    \ light reﬂection and obtain a good background separation from the object of interest\n\
    (plant leaves) during image processing, a dark ﬂoor (interlocking rubber sheets\
    \ ﬂoor) was\nplaced over the original ﬂoor of the chamber. Pots were labeled with\
    \ two identiﬁer numbers\naccording to the position (i.e., row and column). Images\
    \ were taken every second day to\nfollow the growth conditions (Figure 1B).\n\
    2.3. Image Acquisition with LCP Lab (Comparative Method)\nThe results for the\
    \ wheat case study from Phenocave were compared with a previously\npublished LCP\
    \ lab system [18]. Pots were individually photographed at every time point\nfrom\
    \ one top-view angle and four side views using two DSLR cameras, Canon EOS 1300D\n\
    and the 18–55 mm kit lens. Both cameras were tethered to the software digiCamControl\
    \ [37]\nwith slightly different settings (side view: focal length of 35 mm, F-Stop\
    \ f/9, and top view:\nfocal length of 30 mm, F-Stop f/10, and both with ISO 400\
    \ and exposure time of 1/160 s).\nThe side-view camera was mounted on a tripod\
    \ 1.5 m away from the target (i.e., plant\npots), whereas the top-view camera\
    \ was maintained at the height of 1 m above the plants.\nPots were placed manually\
    \ on a top-quality Intelligent 360 Photography turntable platform\n(Shenzhen Comxim\
    \ Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, Guangdong, China).\n2.4. Image Processing\n\
    2.4.1. Color Images\nGreen leaf area projection of the plant color images obtained\
    \ from the Phenocave and the\nrotatory system was extracted using an image-processing\
    \ algorithm developed and written in\nJava as a plugin for ImageJ software (National\
    \ Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). First,\na region of interest ROI (plant\
    \ pot) was selected for each image, and everything outside of\nit was converted\
    \ to zero value pixels (black). This was done to minimize the overlapping\nand\
    \ non-plant objects in the images. Subsequently, the image was split into red,\
    \ green, and\nblue bands to apply a color difference mask obtained by subtracting\
    \ one color channel from\nanother [18]. For this case, two masks were created,\
    \ one by subtracting the red channel\nfrom the green channel (green minus red),\
    \ which contrasted most of the plant from other\nobjects. The other mask was obtained\
    \ by subtracting the green channel from the blue\nchannel (blue minus green) for\
    \ isolating the leaves missing in the ﬁrst mask. In both masks\nand for all time\
    \ points, a ﬁxed threshold was applied considering that the illumination was\n\
    always the same and even with values above the pixels belonging to the plant (threshold\n\
    Plants 2021, 10, 1817\n5 of 19\nvalues (30, 255) and (3, 255)) and discarding\
    \ the rest of the pixels. This threshold was\nselected using the option threshold\
    \ by default of ImageJ and manually adjusted until it\nreached the desired result.\
    \ Subsequently, a median ﬁlter from the ImageJ toolbox “Remove\nOutliers” was\
    \ applied, a ﬁlter that replaces a pixel if the median of the surrounding pixels\n\
    deviates from the median by more than one threshold value (radius = 10 threshold\
    \ = 50\nwhich = Bright). Finally, both created masks were joined by OR logical\
    \ operator to be used\nas a mask to the original image. The resulting image consisted\
    \ of data of green and yellow\nleaf pixels and, in some cases, soil. Therefore,\
    \ a K-means classiﬁer was applied. However,\nthe results were not satisfactory,\
    \ especially for wheat plants in the maturity stage. Thus, to\nsegment these areas\
    \ further, a Bayesian classiﬁer was implemented. This machine-learning\napproach\
    \ works with a training set of samples previously labeled (green leaves and yellow\n\
    leaves) which will be the different classes to classify. From them, it creates\
    \ probability\ndensity functions per class, and this way determines the belonging\
    \ of each new pixel to\nthe class previously deﬁned.\nThe resulting image is grayscale\
    \ with pixel values ‘0’ (black) for the background\nregions, ‘1’ (gray) for the\
    \ green leaves, and ‘2’ (white) for the yellow leaves. The number of\npixels of\
    \ the green leaves was extracted from the histogram. A work ﬂow is presented in\n\
    Figure 2. For the images of the rotatory method, the scale was selected for every\
    \ image\n(one top view and four side views) by using the reference calibration\
    \ (ruler 300 mm) and\ncalculating pixels/mm, to give a total green area of the\

    \ in 41 pots of 3 L (three seeds per pot) with 1.7 kg of soil (Exclusive Flower\
    \ and \nPlant Soil with Osmocote). Three treatments were set up with four replicates\
    \ in two different \ngroups. Group 1 consisted of the control set (28 pots, set\
    \ 1), while group 2 consisted of three \nsubsets with three types of treatments,\
    \ namely drought stress at stem elongation (4 pots, set \n2), drought stress at\
    \ the heading stage (4 pots, set 3), and high nitrogen at the heading stage (4\
    \ \npots, set 4). Plants were placed randomly in the 4 sq m area of the Phenocave\
    \ workspace. \nAll pots were supplied with 24.99 mg N dosage of ammonium nitrate\
    \ diluted in 100 mL \nof water (liquid fertilizer NH4NO3) before drought treatments\
    \ were induced. \nDigital biomass measurements were obtained across the different\

    \ different case studies on wheat and sugar beet.\n2.5.1. Case Study: Wheat\n\
    The experiment was conducted in the Biotron chamber at temperature 23 ◦C/19 ◦C\n\
    (day/night), humidity 50%, and 400 µmol m−2 s−1 of uniform light intensity with\
    \ LED\nlights. A total of 123 seeds of a single spring wheat genotype (provided\
    \ by Lantmännen\nLantbruk) were sown in 41 pots of 3 L (three seeds per pot) with\
    \ 1.7 kg of soil (Exclusive\nFlower and Plant Soil with Osmocote). Three treatments\
    \ were set up with four replicates in\ntwo different groups. Group 1 consisted\
    \ of the control set (28 pots, set 1), while group 2\nconsisted of three subsets\
    \ with three types of treatments, namely drought stress at stem\nelongation (4\
    \ pots, set 2), drought stress at the heading stage (4 pots, set 3), and high\n\
    nitrogen at the heading stage (4 pots, set 4). Plants were placed randomly in\
    \ the 4 sq m\narea of the Phenocave workspace. All pots were supplied with 24.99\
    \ mg N dosage of\nammonium nitrate diluted in 100 mL of water (liquid fertilizer\
    \ NH4NO3) before drought\ntreatments were induced.\nDigital biomass measurements\
    \ were obtained across the different growth stages,\nseedling, tillering, stem\
    \ elongation, booting, heading, and grain ﬁlling [39], in the control\nset (see\
    \ image processing section). At the end of each growth stage, four pots were randomly\n\
    selected (total 24 pots), ﬁrst to acquire images with the comparative rotatory\
    \ system (see\nimage acquisition section), then for the conventional process of\
    \ determining biomass. In\nthis process, shoots were cut and immediately weighed\
    \ using a precision balance (Sauter\nRE 3012). Thereafter, shoots were wrapped\
    \ in aluminum foil and oven-dried at 100 ◦C, for\na period of 24 h. Finally, the\
    \ dry matter was weighed using the same balance.\nDrought stress conditions in\
    \ sets 2 and 3 were induced by stopping the irrigation\nin eight pots at two different\
    \ time points, four pots at the stem elongation stage (D_SE),\n38 days after sowing\
    \ (set 2), and the other four at the beginning of the heading stage,\n45 days\
    \ after sowing (set 3). Finally, plants were re-watered in both cases after six\
    \ days\nof drought, days 44 and 51 after sowing, respectively. At the heading\
    \ stage, another four\npots (set 4) were supplied with 24.99 mg N dosage of ammonium\
    \ nitrate diluted in 100 mL\nof water (liquid fertilizer NH4NO3). The remaining\
    \ ﬁve pots from the control set were\nallowed to grow until the maturity stage\
    \ for grain yield determinations. Pots (not under\ndrought treatment) were irrigated\
    \ every second day with 500 mL of water until the tillering\nstage, and thereafter\
    \ the irrigation was increased to 1000 mL. Imaging was continued every\nPlants\
    \ 2021, 10, 1817\n7 of 19\nsecond day until the end of the maturity stage (grain\
    \ ﬁlling). Finally, the conventional\nmeasurement of biomass was performed for\
    \ all remaining plants.\n•\nPhenotyping with Handheld Sensors for Wheat\nHandheld\
    \ sensor phenotyping was done from the stem elongation stage (28 plants)\nuntil\
    \ the maturity stage (12 plants), by sampling three times per week and taking\
    \ three\nmeasurements per plant. NDVI measurements were taken with a PlantPen\
    \ NDVI-300\n(Photon Systems Instruments PSI, Drásov, Czech Republic) using three\
    \ leaves randomly\nselected from each plant. Then, chlorophyll concentration measurements\
    \ were taken on\nthe same leaves with an MC-100 chlorophyll concentration meter\
    \ (Apogee Instruments, Inc.,\nNorth Logan, UT, USA). Thereafter, QY (PSII Maximum\
    \ Quantum Efﬁciency, (Fv/Fm) mea-\nsurements were taken with a FluorPen FP 100-MAX\
    \ (Photon Systems Instruments PSI,\nDrásov, Czech Republic) with detachable blade\
    \ clips. On each one of the three leaves of\nthe plant, a clip was placed, creating\
    \ a dark adaptation for 15 min before measurement.\nPlant height and leaf area\
    \ were other parameters measured, but only in the ﬁnal\nmaturity stage of treatment\
    \ of plant sets (12 plants). Plant height was measured manually\nwith a ruler\
    \ from the surface of the soil to the tip of the plant spike. The leaf area was\n\
    measured in the ﬂag leaf using an LI-3000C Portable Leaf Area Meter (LI-COR Biosciences,\n\
    Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). In both cases, three measurements were performed for\
    \ each pot,\nand the average of them was considered the ﬁnal value.\n•\nAnalysis\
    \ of Grain Protein Concentration and Composition\nSimilarly, as in previous studies\
    \ [40], the grain protein concentration was evaluated\nthrough nitrogen combustion\
    \ using a nitrogen/carbon analyzer (Flash 2000NC Analyzer,\nThermo Scientiﬁc,\
    \ Waltham, MA, USA). The total protein content was calculated by multi-\nplying\
    \ the total nitrogen content by a conversion factor of 5.7 [41].\nQuality of the\
    \ wheat grain was evaluated following previously described methods [42],\ndetermining\
    \ %UPP (percentage of SDS-unextractable polymeric protein in total polymeric\n\
    protein) correlating with gluten strength, and TOTE (total SDS-extractable protein)\
    \ corre-\nlating with grain protein concentration [43,44]. Thus, the amount and\
    \ size distribution of\npolymeric and monomeric proteins were determined by size-exclusion\
    \ high-performance\nliquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) in a two-step extraction procedure\
    \ [45] with modiﬁ-\ncations by Johansson et al. [46], extracting SDS-extractable\
    \ proteins in the ﬁrst step, and\nSDS-unextractable proteins by sonication in\
    \ the second step. SE-HPLC analyses were\ncarried out with the Waters HPLC system\
    \ (Milford, NH, USA) with a Phenomenex BIOSEP\nSEC-4000 column (Torrance, CA,\
    \ USA). The area under the chromatogram was used to cal-\nculate %UPP and TOTE\
    \ following previous methodology [47–50]. Samples were extracted\nand run in triplicates.\n\
    2.5.2. Case Study: Sugar Beet\nThe trial was conducted using seeds of a single\
    \ sugar beet genotype (material provided\nby MariboHilleshög) exposed to different\
    \ treatments. As a control, one of the sets consisted\nof completely untreated\
    \ seeds (A), while a second set were naked seeds that had undergone\na priming\
    \ procedure (B) to accelerate germination. The proprietary priming process was\n\
    developed at MariboHilleshög with the speciﬁc purpose of enhancing germination\
    \ speed\nand early seedling growth. The third set of seeds was pelleted and coated\
    \ (C), which is\ncommon practice for commercially sold sugar beet seeds in most\
    \ markets. The pellets\nimprove seed drilling performance while the coating contains\
    \ fungicides and insecticides.\nThe last set of seeds were primed, pelleted, and\
    \ coated (D) with the purpose to have all\nthe treatments and beneﬁts in one.\n\
    The experiment was organized in a randomized complete block design with four\n\
    treatments and three replicates. Thirty-six seeds of each treatment (144 seeds)\
    \ were sown\nin plastic pots (5 × 5 and 10 cm high) ﬁlled with standard garden\
    \ soil. The 144 plants\nwere evenly distributed per treatment in 12 trays (3 trays\
    \ per treatment). Then, trays were\nplaced in the Phenocave workspace (4 sq m)\
    \ in four columns and three rows. Thereafter,\nPlants 2021, 10, 1817\n8 of 19\n\
    plants were allowed to grow in Biotron at 22 ◦C/18 ◦C (day/night) temperature,\
    \ humidity\n50%, 350 µmol m−2 s−1 of uniform light intensity with LED light conditions.\n\
    2.6. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using R [51], analyses\
    \ of Pearson’s correlations\nwere performed with the conventional biomass measurements\
    \ and the results obtained\nfrom Phenocave. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed\
    \ with post hoc Tukey’s\nhonest signiﬁcant difference (HSD) test (p-value < 0.05),\
    \ to evaluate the different effects of\ntreatments and traits measured. For HPLC\
    \ analysis, Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT)\nwas performed to estimate speciﬁc\
    \ differences between treatment means.\n3. Results\n3.1. Phenocave\nThe Phenocave\
    \ automated phenotyping platform comprises an aluminum gantry\nthat can be mounted\
    \ with various optical sensors as required. In addition, depending on\nthe number\
    \ of targets, the platform acquires top-view images sequentially with a speed\
    \ of\n0.5–1.5 m/s. Furthermore, it is possible to set up different positions on\
    \ the XY coordinate\nwith a precision of 0.5 mm in a single cycle per line. A\
    \ total of 25 pots of 3 L equally\ndistributed in the 2 × 2 m workspace, can take\
    \ 10 min for imaging and can be repeated\nin a loop. It is also possible that\
    \ the camera moves continuously on the x-axis, which can\nbe achieved by selecting\
    \ the home position and a target (used for hyperspectral imaging).\nThe images\
    \ are stored in the camera for further analysis.\nTo evaluate Phenocave, two case\
    \ studies were undertaken using spring wheat and\nsugar beet.\n3.1.1. Case Study:\
    \ Spring Wheat\nGroup 1\n•\nImage Analysis Results\nThe image acquisition started\
    \ when plants reached the seedling stage (seven days\npost-sowing) and continued\
    \ three times per week until the end of the grain-ﬁlling stage\n(58 days post-sowing),\
    \ i.e., during six growth stages, for a total of 360 images. Image\nsegmentation\
    \ was performed to separate the background and foreground (plant) pixels\nand\
    \ segment yellow and green plant material. The RGB images of the plants representing\n\
    the six time points are presented in Figure 4 and the biomass measurements from\
    \ digital\nand conventional methods are presented in Figure 5. There was a progressive\
    \ development\nof plants in the six growth stages. The grain ﬁlling growth stage\
    \ had the highest fresh and\ndry weight values. Whereas for the digital biomass\
    \ measurements, the highest canopy\ngreen cover was at the heading growth stage\
    \ and it decreased in the grain ﬁlling stage.\nThe digital biomass obtained during\
    \ the six growth stages was correlated with the con-\nventional biomass measurements\
    \ results (weight of fresh and dry matter), giving a signiﬁ-\ncant correlation\

    \ impact of the induced treatments on plant growth rates. As\nshown in Figure\
    \ 6, plants under control conditions grew well, showing a high level of\ngreen\
    \ canopy biomass compared to the plants under stress. Signiﬁcant improvements\n\
    were observed in plant performance after the second application of nitrogen fertilizer\n\
    at the heading stage (marked with a dark cyan arrow). Plants under drought treatment\n\
    showed lower growth once drought treatment was induced (marked with rose and dark\n\
    cyan arrows). Even though irrigation was withheld for the same amount of time\
    \ in\nthe two drought treatment sets, drought impacted differently during the\
    \ two growth stages.\nThere was a greater reduction in the plant biomass during\
    \ the drought at the heading\nstage compared to the stem elongation stage. Signiﬁcant\
    \ differences in canopy cover\nwere observed in the drought-stressed and control\
    \ plants also based on thermal imaging\n(Figure 7). The differences were reduced\
    \ once the plants were allowed to recover from\nstress. Likewise, signiﬁcant differences\

    \ for plant phenotyping, and once the pro-\ngram is set up, it requires minimal\
    \ human intervention. Image acquisition for differ-\nent types of plants is one\
    \ of the issues presented in some low-cost phenotyping plat-\nforms [30,31,34,52],\
    \ while Phenocave can be used with any type of plant size. In addition,\nthe acquisition\
    \ efﬁciency of the platform is another advantage over other similar platforms.\n\
    Approximately 10 min are required to acquire a set of 25 big plant images using\
    \ Phenocave\nand they can be analyzed in less than 15 min, whereas the semi-automated\
    \ LCP lab [18]\nrequires 30 min and labor to implement one of the suggested free\
    \ software packages.\nThe Phenocave system is user-friendly, which facilitates\
    \ its application for researchers with\ndifferent scientiﬁc expertise. Furthermore,\
    \ Phenocave can be set up in a controlled growth\nPlants 2021, 10, 1817\n15 of\
    \ 19\nenvironment. Nonetheless, a resulting limitation of Phenocave is that the\
    \ workspace is only\n2 × 2 m, allowing the assessment of up to 25 large plant\
    \ pots of 3 to 5 L and about 150 small\nones of less than 2 L. Despite the fact\
    \ that the workspace makes it difﬁcult to handle more\nthan 30 big plants, the\
    \ pots remain static without causing any possible mechanical damage\nto the plant\
    \ leaves or any secondary effect on the expression of the phenotype. Another\n\
    advantage of this setup is that plants can be analyzed by different sensors in\
    \ the same run,\nreducing the amount of time between data acquisition for the\
    \ same individual.\nExperiments carried out under controlled environments are\
    \ often difﬁcult to associate\nin terms of yield performance under ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ The ﬂexibility of speciﬁc environmen-\ntal conditions and the control of the\
    \ exposure of the plants by modifying those conditions\nis one of the biggest\
    \ advantages of growing plants under controlled environmental con-\nditions [53].\
    \ Many experiments in indoor controlled environments evaluate different\nparameters\
    \ of plant growth under different conditions. However, many of them imply high\n\
    costs, a lot of labor, specialized knowledge, and not all of them work for all\
    \ types of plants.\nThus, to improve the speed, accuracy, costs, and reliability\
    \ of this process Phenocave was\ndeveloped as an automated phenotyping system\
    \ to evaluate visual traits from top-view\nplant images. Phenocave provides easy\
    \ accessibility, especially because of its good cost-\nperformance ratio; moreover,\
    \ the pipeline developed is in ImageJ, an open-source software,\nand its architecture\
    \ is ﬂexible, which allows it to be unmounted and mounted in other\nindoor environments,\
    \ and the interface is user-friendly.\nPositive correlations were observed between\
    \ projected green area obtained from\nimaging and destructively harvested green\
    \ and yellow leaf biomass in all the growth stages\n(Table 1). The correlation\
    \ had a slight decrease at the stem elongation stage because of\nthe number of\
    \ overlapping leaves (Figure 4C). Plants with overlapping leaves evaluated\nwith\
    \ image analysis can cause underestimation of the projected area [54,55]. Despite\
    \ this\ncorrelation reduction, the results generally were highly correlated. Studies\
    \ in controlled\ngreenhouse conditions have found similar correlations between\
    \ areas estimated by image\nanalysis and harvested biomass [4,35,54,55] which\
    \ indicates the applicability of top imaging\nwith Phenocave for non-destructive\
    \ evaluation of germplasm.\nUnderstanding the impact of drought at different growth\
    \ stages contributes to the efﬁ-\nciency of breeding drought-tolerant wheat varieties.\
    \ Important factors such as the intensity\nand frequency of drought affect the\
    \ performance of any crop. The plant developmental\nstage at which drought events\
    \ occur is equally important [56]. While testing Phenocave\nto identify the response\
    \ of plants to drought at two growth stages, we found negative\neffects in wheat,\
    \ such as reduction of leaf biomass production and grain yield. Nonethe-\nless,\
    \ the duration, intensity, and timing of certain stresses differ in how and which\
    \ yield\ncomponents are affected [57–59]. In the present study, the stress was\
    \ imposed over six days\nof stopping the irrigation, resulting in visual differences\
    \ in shoot biomass in the plants\n(Figure 6). The occurrence of drought stress\
    \ at the stem elongation stage led to a signiﬁcant\nreduction in leaf biomass\
    \ and fewer spikes. Previous studies have shown that drought\nstress at the stem\
    \ elongation stage greatly decreased the grain yield compared to booting\nand\
    \ grain ﬁlling stages [60]. Results of drought stress at the heading stage showed\
    \ a signif-\nicant decrease in the number of grains per head, grain weight, and\
    \ leaf biomass which was\neven more severe than in the early stage.\nAs for the\
    \ wheat case study, the HPLC analysis revealed a low grain protein yield\n(7.7–13%)\
    \ compared to ﬁeld-grown wheat (normally 11–14% in Swedish ﬁeld conditions),\n\
    which indicates the need to fertilize wheat to a level around the high nitrogen\
    \ treat-\nment conditions used in the present experiment. Despite the generally\
    \ low grain protein\nconcentrations obtained here, the present results corresponded\
    \ with those previously re-\nported [61,62]; for example, that reduced green biomass\
    \ is a major effector on grain protein\nconcentration. Thus, a drought at heading\
    \ resulted in a severe decrease of plant biomass\nand thereby a reduction of carbohydrate\
    \ transportation to the grain, which resulted in\na high grain protein concentration.\
    \ The negative correlation between TOTE and %UPP\nreported in several studies\
    \ [43,44,50] was not seen for samples with different treatments\nPlants 2021,\
    \ 10, 1817\n16 of 19\nin the present study. The relatively high gluten strength,\
    \ veriﬁed by correlating %UPP\nvalues [43,44], found in the samples subjected\
    \ to drought at heading, is most likely due to\nan increase in hydrogen and disulﬁde\
    \ bond formation, previously reported as an outcome\nof decreased precipitation\
    \ and increased temperature [48,61,62].\nThe second case study was the effect\
    \ of sugar beet seed treatments on germination and\nplant growth. The results\
    \ indicated that seeds under priming treatment were positively\ninﬂuenced in terms\
    \ of germination ability and speed, especially during the ﬁrst four\ndays. This\
    \ is the effect of priming seeds, which causes an acceleration of germination\
    \ and\nthe acceleration of seedling growth [63]. On the other hand, pelleting\
    \ and coating treatment\nreduced germination rates, especially in the early stages.\
    \ The delayed seed germination\ncan be explained by the slow water ﬂow from the\
    \ germination medium through the pellet\nand pericarp to the seed [64]. Hence,\
    \ although necessary from an agricultural perspective,\npelleting and coating\
    \ may slightly delay germination, while priming may compensate for\nthis delay.\
    \ Previous research showed that primed seeds with a lower level of vigor showed\n\
    a faster and higher germination ability than non-primed seeds with higher vigor\
    \ [64].\nDespite this effect caused by both treatments, after 14 days of germination,\
    \ the differences\nin seed germination and plant growth development diminished.\n\
    An advantage of using Phenocave is the free choice of the use of the imaging sensors\n\
    supported by Phenocave (RGB, multispectral, NDVI, multispectral) and the space\
    \ (2 sq m)\nwithin which plants can be placed anywhere in the imaging region as\
    \ required by the exper-\nimental design. While the current setup of Phenocave\
    \ is limited to manual data transfer and\nmanual irrigation, this might be included\
    \ in the automatic system in future modiﬁcations.\nMultispectral bands from the\
    \ Micasense Altum sensor were not available in Phenocave\nsince the short distance\
    \ between the lens and the object was problematic for band align-\nment. Several\
    \ algorithms have been developed to identify keypoint feature descriptors for\n\
    band alignment [65]. Keypoint descriptors assist in better alignment when the\
    \ alignment\nbands have nearly uniform reﬂectance proﬁles and unique patterns\
    \ in the scene [66]. Thus,\nin future work, an automated work ﬂow will be developed\
    \ for the alignment of bands from\nthe Micasense Altum camera for pictures taken\
    \ in close range. An additional improvement\ncould be regular radiometric calibration\
    \ of the thermal sensor of the Micasense Altum\ncamera. A previous study showed\
    \ that radiometric calibration of thermal sensors produces\nmore accurate results\
    \ [67]. Thus, a similar calibration of sensors could be beneﬁcial for\nexperiments\
    \ requiring higher measurement accuracy. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates\n\
    that the Phenocave system is a useful tool for the non-destructive estimation\
    \ of plant shoot\nbiomass under different growth conditions and at various time\
    \ points.\n5. Conclusions\nIn order to adapt to climate change, unexpected agronomical\
    \ diseases, and other\nfactors that affect plant performance, it is of utmost\
    \ importance to assess plants under\ndifferent environmental conditions in a fast,\
    \ accurate, friendly, and affordable manner.\nPhenocave offers the opportunity\
    \ to assess the visual traits of the plants under highly\ncontrolled environments.\
    \ In addition, the platform reduces manual work for the users\nbecause of a high\
    \ level of automation. It moves in XY direction acquiring high-quality\nindividual\
    \ photographs of plants with different imaging sensors (RGB, thermal, NDVI,\n\
    and hyperspectral), which allows the extraction of different characteristics of\
    \ plants.\nOne of the advantages of Phenocave is that it evaluates small- to mid-size\
    \ plants, such\nas sugar beet and small-grain cereals. Besides, it can be unmounted\
    \ and mounted to be\nused in other environments. This study highlights the potential\
    \ of developing systems\nsimilar to Phenocave which promote work time efﬁciency,\
    \ cost efﬁciency, and ﬂexibility.\nIn future work, data transfer and management\
    \ will be further improved, and broader\napplications such as plant diseases and\
    \ automatic irrigation will be studied, which can\nfurther contribute to allowing\
    \ faster evaluation of plant responses to various treatments.\nPlants 2021, 10,\

    \ Several studies have\nevaluated the effectiveness of image analysis methods\

    \ 18 October 2022\nDOI 10.3389/fpls.2022.1010249\nIntroduction\nIn the countries\
    \ of the Baltic Sea region, the most widely\ncultivated crop is winter wheat (Triticum\
    \ aestivum L.), (Shiferaw\net al., 2013; Chawade et al., 2018). While efforts\
    \ are made to\nachieve sustainable intensiﬁcation of high grain yields in wheat\n\
    production, the emergence and increase in the virulence of plant\npathogens conversely\
    \ leave the nutritional integrity and\nproduction of wheat grains at risk (Castro\
    \ Aviles et al., 2020).\nThe decrease in grain quality and protein content negatively\n\
    impacts the use of the grains and therefore affects food security\nand safety\
    \ (Asseng et al., 2019). Fusarium head blight (FHB),\nmainly caused by the fungus\
    \ Fusarium graminearum Schwabe\n[teleomorph: Gibberella zeae (Schwein) Petch],\
    \ is one of the\nwheat diseases with a major impact on wheat grain yield and\n\
    quality. FHB can dramatically reduce grain quality and yield\nthrough the formation\
    \ of sterile and wizened ﬂorets. FHB-\ninfected grains suffer from major marketing,\
    \ consumption, and\nprocessing constraints, which is the buildup of mycotoxins—\n\
    mainly deoxynivalenol (DON) (Del Ponte et al., 2022). DON\ninhibits protein synthesis,\
    \ cutting off normal cell function, which\nis hazardous for the consumption of\
    \ humans and animals\n(Polak-Śliwiń ska and Paszczyk, 2021). FHB disease\nmanagement\
    \ strategies rely on integrating several cultural\npractices such as fungicide\
    \ treatment, crop rotation, mixed\nculture, and tillage (Gilbert and Haber, 2013).\
    \ However,\ngrowing FHB-resistant cultivars is seen as a more sustainable\nand\
    \ durable strategy for mitigating disease epidemics, thus\navoiding large economic\
    \ losses. Hence, identifying sources of\nnovel resistance is a key component in\
    \ pre-breeding activities\nthat can be introgressed to develop commercial FHB-\n\
    resistant cultivars.\nThe resistance components for FHB, commonly known as\nresistance\
    \ types, have been deﬁned into type I to type V\n(Mesterhazy, 2020): type I is\
    \ resistance to initial infection, type\nII is resistance to disease spread (Schroeder\
    \ and Christensen,\n1963), type III is resistance to damage of Fusarium-damaged\n\
    kernels (FDK), type IV is resistance to the buildup of DON\ntoxins, and type V\
    \ is tolerance. Traditionally, studies on FHB\nresistance have relied on measuring\
    \ the symptoms in spikes and\nkernels (resistance types II and III). Type II is\
    \ assessed by rating\nthe visual symptoms on the spikes, which appear as bleached,\n\
    yellowish or discolored, and stunted (Zakieh et al., 2021; Steed\net al., 2022).\
    \ FDK is quantiﬁed traditionally by estimating the\namount of visibly damaged\
    \ kernels, which appear smaller,\nshriveled, and in a range of colors from pale\
    \ pink to brown\n(Delwiche et al., 2010), according to a predetermined scale for\n\
    visual assessments or by employing manual tools (Ackerman\net al., 2022). Comparisons\
    \ between both types of resistance\n(resistance types II and III) have revealed\
    \ that it would be\nmore efﬁcient and consistent to estimate FHB than the degree\n\
    of colonization on the spike (Agostinelli, 2009; Balut et al., 2013;\nKhaeim et\
    \ al., 2019; Ackerman et al., 2022). However, screening\nby either manual or visual\
    \ assessments is a labor- and time-\nconsuming process for rating genotypes, is\
    \ biased due to the\nsubjectivity of visual assessments, and has low reproducibility\n\
    among experiments (Barbedo et al., 2015; Khaeim et al., 2019).\nAs a result of\
    \ the previously cited limitations, the use of image\nanalysis approaches has\
    \ been investigated to evaluate FDK,\nparticularly in estimating morphological\
    \ characteristics.\nHowever, the existing different imaging approaches have their\n\
    disadvantages and trade-off in terms of costs, time expenses,\nresolution, and\
    \ precision when considering an application\n(Saccon et al., 2017).\nAmong the\
    \ investigated methods, Iwata and Ukai (2002) and\nIwata et al. (2010) investigated\
    \ changes in grain shape using\nelliptic Fourier descriptors of two- and three-dimensional\n\
    features from vertically and horizontally located seed images.\nDespite the accuracy\
    \ reached, there are limitations in terms of\nimage resolution and regarding the\
    \ manual handling of samples\nduring the procedure. Menesatti et al. (2009) presented\
    \ a method\nto classify FHB in wheat-infected kernels—according to the\nshape\
    \ criteria—into the following groups: chalky, shriveled, or\nhealthy. The method\
    \ proved to be functional to categorize\nkernels as chalky or healthy, but not\
    \ for shriveled or gravely\naffected samples. Jirsa and Polišenská (2011) developed\
    \ a model\nfor the identiﬁcation of Fusarium-damaged wheat kernels using\nimage\
    \ analysis. The characterization of healthy or damaged\nkernels based on color\
    \ parameters revealed a high accuracy\ncompared with the shape and DON content\
    \ parameters.\nHowever, image processing was done with manual selections\nand\
    \ comparing only 40 kernels—either heavily damaged or\nhealthy—without considering\
    \ any halfway stage. Similarly, the\nuse of hyperspectral imaging for detecting\
    \ Fusarium sp. in seeds\nhas been previously investigated (Delwiche et al., 2010;\
    \ Shahin\nand Symons, 2011; Bauriegel and Herppich, 2014; Barbedo et al.,\n2015;\
    \ Femenias et al., 2022; Rangarajan et al., 2022; Yipeng et al.,\n2022). The methods\
    \ have been shown to be accurate and have\nidentiﬁed more factors involved in\
    \ FDK. A more advanced\ntechnique based on X-ray computed tomography has been\n\
    implemented for evaluating seed shape in ﬁner detail (Gomes\nand Duijn, 2017;\
    \ Liu et al., 2020). Nevertheless, inconsistencies\nbecause of specular reﬂection,\
    \ correct wavelength selection,\nkernel orientation, selection of reference parameter,\
    \ costs of\nacquisition devices, and the storage requirement for highly\ndimensional\
    \ and massive data sets may be limiting the\napplication of these methods (Dissing\
    \ et al., 2013; Lu\net al., 2020).\nIn the face of the constraints cited earlier,\
    \ automated and\nlight-weight free software for grain image analysis have been\n\
    developed (Wang et al., 2009; Komyshev et al., 2017; Colmer\net al., 2020; Zhu\
    \ et al., 2021); some examples of them are\nGrainScan (Whan et al., 2014), which\
    \ analyzes size and color\nfeatures, and SmartGrain (Tanabata et al., 2012), which\
    \ analyzes\nsize and shape features. Both software are instantaneous in\nimage\
    \ recognition despite the position, overlapping, or the\nLeiva et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2022.1010249\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nnumber of seeds. Alternatively,\
    \ commercially available imaging\ninstruments for grain image analysis combine\
    \ hardware and\nsoftware, including WinSEEDLE (Regent Instruments Inc.),\nSeed\
    \ Count (Next Instrument Pty Ltd.), Vibe QM3 Grain\nAnalyzer (VIBE), and Cgrain\
    \ Value™ (Cgrain AB). The\ninstruments use optical or ﬂatbed scanners to extract\
    \ features\nsuch as size, shape, and color in the color representation hue,\n\
    saturation, and light (HSL). However, SeedCount and Vibe QM3\nGrain Analyzer only\
    \ scan the top surface of the samples, thus\nomitting morphological characteristics\
    \ that are not in the\nviewing area. A more advanced instrument is Videometer\
    \ Lab\n(Videometer A/S, Denmark), which provides rapid color, shape,\nand texture\
    \ measurements. Videometer Lab is ideal to use in\nanalyzing kernel surfaces,\
    \ but it requires certain expertise and\nallows the analysis of only a few samples\
    \ at once.\nIn this context, this paper has three objectives; ﬁrst is to\ninvestigate\
    \ the applicability of low-cost digital image analysis\nto predict FHB infection\
    \ in harvested grains through\nmorphological traits. This will offer more insight\
    \ into the traits\nthat are correlated to the degree of FDK. The second objective\
    \ is\nto compare the applicability of the two methods used for grain\nimage analysis—SmartGrain,\
    \ and Cgrain Value™—in terms of\nconsistency and throughput. The third one is\
    \ to illustrate the\nprocessing chain and result interpretation with a descriptive\n\
    data analysis.\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material\nWheat kernel samples were\
    \ collected from an experiment\nunder accelerated indoor growth conditions (Zakieh\
    \ et al., 2021)\nusing winter wheat genotypes from two different sources. The\n\
    ﬁrst source consisted of 338 genotypes (breeding set) provided\nby the Swedish\
    \ agricultural cooperative (Lantmännen Lantbruk,\nSvalöv, Sweden). The second\
    \ source consisted of 181 germplasm\ngenotypes (genebank set) provided by the\
    \ Nordic Genetic\nResource Center (Nordgen), with highly diverse plant\nmaterials\
    \ including landraces and old cultivars.\nExperimental design/growth and\ninoculation\
    \ protocol\nPlants were grown following an augmented block design in a\nclimate-controlled\
    \ chamber. After germination, the plants were\nsubjected to a vernalization period\
    \ of 57 days at 3°C with 8 h of\ndaily light at medium–high light intensity (LI)\
    \ of 250 mmol m−2 s−1.\nAt the end of the vernalization period, the climatic conditions\
    \ were\nadjusted with a gradual increase in temperature and LI for the\nacclimatization\
    \ of the plants to the next phase of accelerated growth\nconditions. Once the\
    \ acclimatization period was concluded, the\nplants were left to grow at a constant\
    \ temperature of 22°C. The\naccelerated growth conditions were adapted by exposing\
    \ the plants\nto a prolonged daily light duration of 22 h, with LI at 400 mmol\
    \ m−2\ns−1 of uniform light intensity from LED light plates. Under these\naccelerated\
    \ growth conditions, the plants were watered daily and\nfertilized weekly using\
    \ ﬁrst a combination of a high-phosphate and\nhigh-nitrogen soluble fertilizer\
    \ SW-BOUYANT 7-1-5 + Mikro +\nKH2PO4, then only with a high-nitrogen fertilizer,\
    \ and ﬁnally with a\nhigh-potassium soluble fertilizer Yara Tera Kristalon NPK\
    \ 12-5-30\nwith S and Mikro.\nAfter completing the anthesis stage, at 33 days\
    \ post-\nacclimatization, the plants were moved to a glasshouse\nchamber with\
    \ relative humidity (rh) of 60% and a constant\ntemperature of 24°C for 24 h to\
    \ allow their adaptation to the new\ngrowth conditions prior to inoculation. Thereafter,\
    \ the winter\nwheat spikes were spray-inoculated with an inoculum\nsuspension\
    \ prepared from the harvested spore of F.\ngraminearum and F. culmorum, with a\
    \ concentration of 5 ×\n105 spore/ml. Subsequently, the plants were left to incubate\
    \ at\n90% rh with 16/8 h dark/light cycle at a constant temperature of\n24°C for\
    \ 48 h before adjusting the climatic conditions back to\n60% rh. The plants were\
    \ eventually left to grow under the latter\nconditions for 24 days before harvesting\
    \ the seeds. Eight isolates\nfrom F. graminearum and F. culmorum species were\
    \ used in\ninoculating the plants provided by the Swedish agricultural\ncooperative\
    \ Lantmännen Lantbruk. An inoculum preparation\nwas carried out by incubating\
    \ the fungal spores at 24°C for 4\ndays in dark conditions to allow for mycelial\
    \ growth on SNA\nmedia plates. Later, the fungal plates were exposed to near ultra-\n\
    violet UV radiation for 10 h to induce macroconidia formation.\nAfterward, the\
    \ fungal plates were incubated for 4 days at 24°C in\ndark conditions. Finally,\
    \ macroconidia spores were collected to\nmake the inoculation suspension with\
    \ the provided\nconcentration after adding the surfactant Tween®20 0.002%\n(v/v)\
    \ ﬁnal volume of the inoculum. A more detailed protocol\nis described in Zakieh\
    \ et al. (2021).\nFHB visual assessment\nIn order to evaluate FHB resistance on\
    \ a large number of\ngenotypes, a modiﬁed visual scoring of the FHB disease severity\n\
    method was adopted. The method took into account the incidence\nof all FHB symptoms\
    \ across the main tiller spike of each genotype.\nTherefore, disease severity\
    \ was assessed as the percentage score of\ninfected spikelets relative to all\
    \ spikes, regardless of symptom\ncontinuity on the same spike. FHB development\
    \ was scored at 6,\n8, 10, and 12-days post-inoculation (dpi) (Stack and McMullen,\n\
    1998). The FHB disease severity scores varied between 100 to 5% for\nthe most\
    \ susceptible phenotypes and the most resistant ones,\nrespectively. Finally,\
    \ the results of the visual scores were validated\nby association mapping, thus\
    \ identifying the quantitative trait loci of\nFHB resistance (Appendix 1).\nLeiva\

    03\nSeed shape parameters\nTwo different grain phenotyping methods were employed\
    \ in\nthis study: an automated imaging instrument with software and\nhardware\
    \ named Cgrain Value™ which is commercially\navailable (Cgrain AB) and the free\
    \ software named\nSmartGrain developed by Tanabata et al. (2012) and can be\n\
    downloaded from the Quantitative Plant website (Lobet, 2017).\nThe implementation\
    \ of both methods is described in the\nfollowing sections.\nSmartGrain\nFor image\
    \ acquisition, the seeds were captured with a low-cost\nimage protocol acquisition\
    \ from a top-view angle of 55 cm above\nthe seeds and placed manually on a ﬂat\
    \ surface using a digital single-\nlens reﬂex camera Canon EOS 1300D (Canon U.S.A.\
    \ Inc.,\nHuntington, NY, USA), which has a resolution of 18 megapixels,\nmounted\
    \ on a Kaiser RS-1 repro stand. The camera was tethered to\nthe software digiCamControl\
    \ (Istvan, 2014) with optimal exposure\nsettings based on the best seed view,\
    \ F-Stop 1/160, exposure time 1/\n10, and ISO 800. The seeds were placed manually\
    \ per genotype\nuniformly on a blue cardboard that was used as a background on\
    \ a\nstand aside from a 15-cm ruler for further analysis. Digital images\nwere\
    \ stored with 3,456 × 2,304-pixel resolution in JPEG format\n(Figure 1, top images).\n\
    The image analysis was thereafter carried out using\nSmartGrain software following\
    \ its default protocol (Tanabata\net al., 2012). Brieﬂy, the image scale was set\
    \ up by taking a known\nsample from the ruler and registering it on the software.\
    \ Then,\nthe segmentation method by color was chosen, the precision\nsensibility\
    \ was set at the minimum value of “1”, and the seed\ndetection intensity was at\
    \ a maximum value of “4” to obtain all\npossible shape details; the rest of the\
    \ parameters were set to\ndefault. Finally, all the processed images were saved\
    \ as TIFF ﬁles,\nand the results were saved in a CSV format. The software\nprovides\
    \ seven morphological characteristics: area seed (AS),\nperimeter length (PL),\
    \ length (L), width (W), length-to-width\nratio (LWR), circularity of the seed\
    \ (CS), distance between the\nintersection of length and width, and the center\
    \ of gravity (DS).\nAS corresponds to the total number of pixels of the segmented\n\
    seed, this parameter estimates the seed size. PL refers to the\nlength measurement\
    \ of the seed outline. L corresponds to the\nmajor length measurement in the axis\
    \ and W to the minor\nlength axis measurement. CS estimates how round the region\
    \ of\ninterest is (seed), and it is calculated as\n4\x01p\x01AS\nPL2\n. LWR is\n\
    calculated by\nL\nW, and it provides an idea of the seed shape\nbetween rectangular\
    \ and circular depending on the value. The\ndistance between the transverse axis\
    \ from the outline of the seed\n(IS) and the center of gravity (CG) is used to\
    \ estimate DS\n[described in detail by Tanabata et al. (2012)].\nCgrain Value™\n\
    For single kernel analysis, seeds were scanned with Cgrain\nValue™, which is an\
    \ analytical imaging instrument. The device\nA\nB\nD\nE\nF\nC\nFIGURE 1\nImages\
    \ of the different levels of Fusarium head blight severity on winter wheat seeds.\
    \ The rating of disease severity ranged from (A) 0 to (F)\n100%. Scoring was based\
    \ on the proportion of total infected spikes to the total amount of spikes. The\
    \ top images were obtained for the\nSmartGrain analysis, and the bottom images\
    \ were acquired using the Cgrain Value™ instrument.\nLeiva et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2022.1010249\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n04\ninspects each kernel through\
    \ a unique mirror design covering\nmore than 90% of the grains’ surfaces in every\
    \ image. The\nanalysis starts by pouring into the metal bowl of the Cgrain\nValue™\
    \ a batch of seeds per line and per genotype. The seeds\nrotate into the bowl\
    \ and then, one by one, are photographed and\nanalyzed simultaneously. After the\
    \ analysis is completed, three\ndifferent reports are created (result ﬁle, stat\
    \ ﬁle, and image ﬁle).\nThe result ﬁle consists of the morphological characteristics\
    \ for\neach batch of seeds (seed count, thousand kernels, etc.), the stat\nﬁle\
    \ provides data per individual seed of a group (length, width,\netc.), and the\
    \ image ﬁle corresponds to the single seed images\nacquired (Figure 1, bottom\
    \ images).\nThe instrument provides nine morphological attributes:\nlength (L),\
    \ width (W), thickness (T), average width (AVG.W),\nvolume (V), weight (WT), light,\
    \ hue, and saturation. Parameters\nsuch as L, W, and T are estimated by taking\
    \ the longitudinal\nmeasurement of the axis major, higher minor, and minor,\n\
    respectively. In the case of AVG.W, as the seed is received as a\nthree-dimensional\
    \ image, the measurement is referring to the\nmean of the average curvature. V\
    \ corresponds to the seed\nvolume obtained from the 3D image. For WT, the device\
    \ has\nan internal balance, so while acquiring the image, it also weighs\nthe\
    \ grain. Color parameters, hue, saturation, and light are also\ndetermined by\
    \ the instrument; it speciﬁes the color base of a\nsample, how saturated it is,\
    \ and how bright it is, respectively.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses\
    \ were conducted using R (Team, R. C,\n2013). The visual scorings of the last\
    \ time-point on infected\nspikes, including cultivars with zero symptoms, were\
    \ included in\na ﬁle together with the mean values per genotype of the results\n\
    given by Cgrain Value™ and SmartGrain. Each replicate of the\ndata set was ﬁltered\
    \ by missing data (NA). Those with NA along\nthe four replicates were removed\
    \ and those with presence in\nmore than one replicate were substituted using FactoMineR\
    \ (Lê\net al., 2008) and missMDA (Josse and Husson, 2016) packages.\nThen, using\
    \ the Agricolae R package (De Mendiburu, 2014), the\nchecks in each augmented\
    \ block were used to adjust the means\nfor each trait per replicate, the model\
    \ of which is as follows:\nyil = u + Gil + b1 + ϵil\nwhere yil corresponds to\
    \ the adjusted means of the ith wheat cultivar\nin the lth block, u is the general\
    \ mean value, Gil is the effect of the ith\nwheat genotype in the lth block, b1\
    \ is the lth block effect, and ϵil is the\nresidual. Subsequently, using the adjusted\
    \ means, the best linear\nunbiased estimates (BLUEs) was calculated using the\
    \ randomized\ncomplete block design option in META-R 6.04 (Alvarado et al.,\n\
    2015) based on the following model:\nyijm = u + Sj + Gijm + Rm + ϵijm\nwhere yijm\
    \ corresponds to the BLUE of the ith genotype from the jth\npopulation in the\
    \ mth replicate, u is the general mean value, Sj is the\neffect of the jth source\
    \ of material, Gijm is the effect of the ith genotype\nin the mth replicate, Rm\
    \ is the mth replicate of the effect, and ϵijm is\nthe residual effect. The source\
    \ of wheat genotypes Sj was considered\nthe grouping factor.\nThe BLUEs data previously\
    \ centered were used to predict\nFHB using a multiple regression model:\nyi =\
    \ b0 + b1xi1 + b2xi2 + … + bpxip + ϵ\nWhere for i=n observations: yi corresponds\
    \ to the dependent\nvariable, xi to the explanatory variables, b0 corresponds\
    \ to y-\nintercept (constant term), bp corresponds to the slope\ncoefﬁcients for\
    \ each explanatory variable, and ϵ corresponds to\nthe error of the model (also\
    \ known as the residuals). Three\nmodels were created using the morphological\
    \ traits provided by\nboth methods (Cgrain Value™ and SmartGrain) as independent\n\
    variables and visual scorings as the dependent variable. One\nmodel combines all\
    \ the traits, and two others use the traits\nprovided by each method. To build\
    \ each model, the data set was\npartitioned employing the function “createDataPartition”\
    \ of the\ncaret package (Kuhn et al., 2020) into 70% for model training\n(training\
    \ set) and the remaining 30% for evaluating model\nperformance (test set). Subsequently,\
    \ the model was ﬁtted to\nthe training set, and it predicted the responses using\
    \ the test set.\nTo evaluate the quality of the predictions and mitigate the\n\
    possibility of errors due to the random data partitioning, the\ncross-validation\
    \ was executed 100 times, which means\nresampling the data set, and the mean of\
    \ the criterion was\ntaken as the ﬁnal result.\nResults\nThis study examined a\
    \ total of 16 morphological traits,\nincluding size, color, and shape of winter\
    \ wheat grains from\nthe genebank and breeding sets with different levels of FHB\n\
    infection. Nine traits were obtained with the instrument Cgrain\nValue™ and seven\
    \ traits with the software SmarGrain. The\ndistribution of all the morphological\
    \ traits measured by the two\nmethods showed a Gaussian distribution (Figure 2).\
    \ In order to\nunderstand the association between these traits and FHB\nresistance,\
    \ a comparison with the traits measured of 80 FHB\nsusceptible and resistant genotypes\
    \ was performed. For this\npurpose, ﬁve genotypes per replicate (four replicates)\
    \ from\nboth sets, breeding and genebank, were selected based on the\nFHB severity\
    \ scores on the spikes, genotypes scored as 0%\n(visually non-infected or resistant),\
    \ and ones scored as 100%\n(visually infected or susceptible). Among the infected\
    \ and non-\ninfected selected groups, there was a 22.61% reduction in V and\n\
    11.32% in AS. Other parameters also showed a reduction, such\nas T_RAW at 10.60%,\
    \ W at 8.30% in both methods, and WT at\nLeiva et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2022.1010249\n\
    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n05\n22.63%. Additionally, L was reduced\
    \ according to the results by\n1.96% in Cgrain Value™ and 2.26% in SmartGrain.\
    \ Similarly,\nCS and PL showed a decrease, but in less proportions with 4.60\n\
    and 3.25%, respectively. The minimum seed L measured was\n4.59 mm for non-infected\
    \ and 4.50 mm for infected genotypes.\nOn the other hand, color parameters expressed\
    \ major changes\ncompared with all the other morphological traits. Hue and the\n\
    light increased with the infection by 19.91 and 8.28%,\nrespectively, while saturation\
    \ decreased at about 15.52%\n(Table 1). According to the analysis of variance\
    \ (two-way\nANOVA), the morphological traits L, W, T_RAW, light, and\nhue were\
    \ highly signiﬁcant (P< 0.001), likewise with V, CS, and\nsaturation (P< 0.01),\
    \ indicating a clear association with FHB\ndisease severity level. Meanwhile,\
    \ the parameters WT, AS, LWR,\nPL, and DS did not indicate any signiﬁcance but\
    \ still showed\nslight differences between infected and non-infected grains.\n\
    Additionally, a principal component analysis (Figure 3) was\nperformed to show\
    \ the response of all the seed traits studied\nregarding the disease infection\
    \ and how they correlate to each\nother. The proportion of total variance on the\
    \ two ﬁrst principal\nA\nB\nFIGURE 2\nFrequency distribution of the different\

    respectively, of the total variance. The LWR trait was shown to\nbe the higher\
    \ positive in the ﬁrst principal component; similarly,\nhue was shown to be positive\
    \ but in a lesser proportion. In the\nsame component but with negative loading,\
    \ we found CS as the\nvariable with the highest contribution; the traits W from\
    \ both\nmethods, AVG.W, and T_RAW were also projected onto this\ncomponent with\
    \ a loading of a slightly lesser norm. Although\nsaturation was also projected\
    \ onto this component, it was shown\nto be the smallest loading. On the other\
    \ hand, in the second\nprincipal component, the traits DS and L from both methods,\n\
    PL, AS, V, and WT showed a high positive loading with similar\nproportions, whereas\
    \ the trait light was the only one with a\nnegative loading into the second principal\
    \ component and the\none with less projection among all the traits. In general,\
    \ all the\nseed morphological traits assessed expressed variability and\ninﬂuence\
    \ in the two principal components. In addition, as can\nbe observed in the graph,\
    \ the variation of LWR has an opposite\nprojection to the CS trait, expressing\
    \ a good indicator to study\nthe deformation of the grains caused by the disease\
    \ infection.\nConsidering Table 1, the mean values for the same\nmorphological\
    \ traits measured by both methods (L and W)\nacross the two sets, genebank and\
    \ breeding, were similar. The\ndifference between infected and non-infected seeds\
    \ was 0.11 mm\nin L in both methods and between 0.21 and 0.25 mm in W and\nAVG_W.\
    \ Both methods provide important parameters for seed\nmorphology studies. Cgrain\
    \ Value™ provides V and WT values\nand color information. Although these are important\n\
    characteristics for different study purposes, mainly for\nidentifying FHB-infected\
    \ kernels, SmartGrain, in turn,\nprovides information such as PL, AS, and CS that\
    \ can show\nvariabilities between infected and non-infected seeds. Here the\n\
    BLUES for all the measured parameters were correlated with\neach other and in\
    \ association with the visual scorings on the\nspikes (Figure 4). A moderate to\
    \ high positive correlation was\nfound with the color parameter hue, and a low\
    \ positive\nTABLE 1 Descriptive statistics showing differences between the seed\

    \ Additionally, image capture\nand processing are instantaneous, thanks to the\
    \ hardware and\nsoftware combination. Conversely, image acquisition using the\n\
    SmartGrain system was carried out over a relatively long period,\nyet image processing\
    \ was done relatively fast. However,\ncompared with Cgrain Value™, the earlier\
    \ approach is\ncheaper considering the cost of the tools used in image\ncapture,\
    \ requiring a simple RGB camera, a static frame, and\nthe free software.\nOn the\
    \ other hand, the morphological traits, based on the\nstatistical analysis results,\
    \ that showed signiﬁcant correlations to\nthe visual scores were color traits\
    \ in the HSL color representation\nand thickness from Cgrain Value™, length and\
    \ width, from both\nmethods (Figures 5, 6). Although the other measured\nmorphological\
    \ traits were not signiﬁcantly correlated to the\nvisual scores, infected grains\
    \ still expressed differences in these\ntraits that may be ultimately informative\
    \ about seed health and\nreﬁne the prediction (Table 1). Nevertheless, DS was\
    \ not\ncorrelated and did not express signiﬁcant differences in\ninfected seeds\
    \ of FHB, but it could prove useful in\nother applications.\nThe evaluated visual\
    \ scores of the symptoms associated with\nFHB—bleached, yellowish or discolored,\
    \ and stunted spikes—\nwere previously validated by the identiﬁcation of several\
    \ loci by\ngenome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Appendix 1), in a\nprevious\
    \ study with the same plants and visual scorings (Zakieh\net al., 2021). The proposed\
    \ methods aim to replace costly and\nlabor-intensive genetic analysis.\nTherefore,\
    \ the prediction of both methods studied here\nappears to be consistent for FHB\
    \ with the assigned traits\nconcerning the phenotype–genotype association. Previous\n\
    investigations showed a high correlation between symptoms\nthat are present on\
    \ wheat heads and the rate of kernel damage\n(Góral et al., 2018). Therefore,\
    \ it is feasible to reference the\nestimated visual scores of disease severity\
    \ to establish similar\nresults of association/disassociation with the corresponding\n\
    assessments of grain traits following the methodology in\nthis study.\nAn important\
    \ aspect to highlight is that the percentage of\ndisease severity can be assessed,\
    \ where, in contrast to disease spread\nfrom the point of inoculation, it offers\
    \ less intensive labor by spray\ninoculation of a larger number of wheat genotypes.\
    \ Additionally,\nunlike point-inoculated wheat spikelets, spray-inoculated spikes\n\
    allow for evaluating the degree of damage caused by the disease\nto all kernels\
    \ of the infected spike. Within this work frame, whole\nspike kernels are investigated\
    \ for their characteristics rather than the\ndamage to a limited number of kernels\
    \ caused by Fusarium\ncolonization from the point of inoculation. This, in turn,\
    \ is\nexpected to shorten the period for disease resistance assessment,\nlower\
    \ its cost, and be less labor demanding.\nConclusion\nThe results indicated that\
    \ the traits with a higher correlation to\nFHB were length, width, thickness,\
    \ and especially color values in\nHSL color representation. Moreover, Cgrain Value™\
    \ was\nadvantageous to SmartGrain in terms of the time required for\nimage capture\
    \ and outperformed the latter when applied to a large\nnumber of samples, yet\
    \ SmartGrain processes samples fast and is\ncheaper in comparison to Cgrain Value™.\
    \ Although the disease\nprediction showed a low–moderate accuracy for SmartGrain\
    \ and a\nhigh–moderate accuracy for Cgrain Value™ and the results of both\nmethods\
    \ combined, this is attributed to the prediction reference,\nFIGURE 6\nSensitivity\

    Wheat production and end-use quality are severely threatened by drought and heat\
    \ stresses. This study \nevaluated stress impacts on phenotypic and gluten protein\
    \ characteristics of eight spring wheat \ngenotypes (Diskett, Happy, Bumble, SW1,\
    \ SW2, SW3, SW4, SW5) grown to maturity under controlled \nconditions (Biotron)\
    \ using RGB imaging and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography\
    \ \n(SE-HPLC). Among the stress treatments compared, combined heat-drought stress\
    \ had the most severe \nnegative impacts on biomass (real and digital), grain\
    \ yield, and thousand kernel weight (TKW). \nConversely, it had a positive effect\
    \ on most gluten parameters evaluated by SE-HPLC and resulted in \na positive\
    \ correlation between spike traits and gluten strength, expressed as unextractable\
    \ gluten \npolymer (%UPP), and large monomeric protein (%LUMP). The best performing\
    \ genotypes in terms of \nstability were Happy, Diskett, SW1, and SW2, which should\
    \ be further explored as attractive breeding \nmaterial for developing climate-resistant\
    \ genotypes with improved bread-making quality. RGB \nimaging in combination with\
    \ gluten protein screening by SE-HPLC could thus be a valuable approach \nfor\
    \ identifying climate stress-tolerant wheat genotypes.  \n \n1. Introduction \n\
    Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the third most \ncommon cereal produced worldwide,\
    \ with \nmore than 771 million tonnes harvested in 2021 \n(https://www.fao.org/faostat).\
    \ Wheat provides \napproximately 20% of global total human \ndietary calories\
    \ and 21% of daily protein \nconsumption (Shiferaw et al., 2013). With \nincreasing\
    \ \npopulation \nand \nurbanization, \nconsumption and associated demand for wheat-\n\
    based food products is increasing (Peña, 2007), \nso sustaining wheat production\
    \ and quality is \nimportant for ensuring food security. With \nongoing climate\
    \ change and global warming, \nextreme climate events and abiotic stresses are\
    \ \nbecoming more severe and unpredictable (Le \nGouis et al., 2020). Climate\
    \ events such as heat, \ndrought, \nexcessive \nrainfall, \nand \nhigh \natmospheric\
    \ concentrations of CO2 are already \naffecting production and quality of wheat\
    \ \nworld-wide (Yadav et al., 2020). The extent of \nthe losses depends on the\
    \ plant growth stage \naffected and the severity of the stress (Wahid et \nal.,\
    \ 2007; Lan et al., 2022). Therefore, \ndevelopment of wheat genotypes that are\
    \ \nresistant to various abiotic stresses is crucial for \nfood security under\
    \ ongoing climate change. \n \n2 \nAmong the abiotic stresses imposed by climate\
    \ \nchange, \nheat \nand \ndrought \nstresses \nare \nconsidered to cause the\
    \ most damage to wheat \ngrowth and development (Mamrutha et al., \n2020). Drought\
    \ during stem elongation and \nheat stress during the grain-filling stage have\
    \ \nbeen identified as particularly important \nenvironmental factors affecting\
    \ the yield and \nquality of wheat (Guzmán et al., 2016; Le \nGouis et al., 2020).\
    \ This is because drought and \nheat impair growth and development of \ndifferent\
    \ \nwheat \nplant \norgans, \nrate \nof \nphotosynthesis, fertility, number of\
    \ spikes, \ngrain-filling, and nutrient uptake by the plant \n(Hurkman and Wood,\
    \ 2011; Guzmán et al., \n2016; Lan et al., 2022). Yield losses due to \nindividual\
    \ or combined heat-drought stresses \nhave been observed in multiple countries\
    \ in \nEurope, including Finland, Sweden, France, \nBelgium, and Switzerland (Kumar\
    \ et al., 2020; \nLe Gouis et al., 2020; Lama et al., 2022). Areas \nsuch as the\
    \ Mediterranean and southern Europe \nare experiencing higher impacts of heat-\n\
    drought stress than other regions, causing major \neconomic and food production\
    \ losses (EEA, \n2020). A 1-3°C rise in mean global air \ntemperature is suggested\
    \ to decrease wheat \nproduction by up to 28% (Shew et al., 2020; \nZhang et al.,\
    \ 2022). In fact, in a previous study \nby our research group on field-grown wheat\
    \ in \nSweden, a yield reduction of up to 40% was \nobserved \nunder \ncombined\
    \ \nheat-drought \nconditions compared with rainy and cold \nconditions (Lama\
    \ et al., 2022).  \nWheat yield is generally the main focus in \nresearch, due\
    \ to its direct relationship to food \nsecurity (Asseng et al., 2019). However,\
    \ \nmanufacturers of different wheat-based food \nproducts, such as bread and\
    \ pasta, require wheat \nflours with a specific protein quality (Johansson \n\
    et al., 2020). Wheat quality is mainly \ndetermined by its major protein, gluten,\
    \ the \nquantity and quality of which are often \nnegatively impacted by heat\
    \ and drought. For \ninstance, the relatively high content of protein \nand strong\
    \ gluten required in wheat bread flour \n(Kuktaite et al., 2004) is severely affected\
    \ by \nintense heat and drought stresses (Lama et al., \n2022). Total protein\
    \ content and gluten content \nare reported to increase by 65% and 32%, \nrespectively\
    \ under combined heat-drought \nstress compared with control conditions (Sattar\
    \ \net al., 2020). In greenhouse studies, the relative \nproportions of different\
    \ types of proteins, such \nas high molecular weight (HMW) and low \nmolecular\
    \ weight (LMW) glutenins, and \nomega-, alfa/beta- and gamma-gliadins, have \n\
    been found to increase under heat stress (35°C \nday temperature) compared with\
    \ a control \nenvironment (Zhao et al., 2022).  \nThe susceptibility of wheat\
    \ plants to abiotic \nstresses depends mainly on the duration, \nfrequency, and\
    \ intensity of the stress conditions \nto which the plants are exposed (Barnabás\
    \ et al., \n2008; Farooq et al., 2009; Qaseem et al., 2019). \nDue \nto \nthe\
    \ \nadaptive \nmetabolic \nand \nphysiological mechanisms that wheat plants \n\
    have developed, physiological responses at \ndifferent developmental stages can\
    \ differ \nbetween genotypes (Rampino et al., 2006). \nPlants under drought stress\
    \ decrease their leaf \narea and increase canopy temperature in order \nto prevent\
    \ water loss (Anjum et al., 2011), \nalthough heat stress combined with appropriate\
    \ \nirrigation can increase transpiration rates and \ndecrease canopy temperature\
    \ (Singh et al., \n2007). In combined heat-drought stress, there is \nan extreme\
    \ effect on the physiological \nresponses of wheat plants at all growth and \n\
    reproductive stages (Rizhsky et al., 2002; \nPrasad et al., 2011). In combination,\
    \ these two \nstresses can have complex contradictory effects \ncompared with\
    \ when they occur separately \n(Zhou et al., 2017).  \nPhysiological traits of\
    \ wheat, such as growth \nand characteristics related to yield, are \ncommonly\
    \ assessed by visual or manual \nannotation methods, but these tend to be \nsubjective,\
    \ time-consuming, and laborious \n(Dhondt \net \nal., \n2013). Therefore non-\n\
    destructive remote and proximal phenotyping \ntechniques are becoming more popular\
    \ and \nmore widely used (Armoniené et al., 2018; \nLeiva et al., 2021; Tao et\
    \ al., 2022). Such \nmethods have been developed to extract data \n \n3 \nmainly\
    \ from images in the visual and \nelectromagnetic spectrum on several plant traits\
    \ \nwith high accuracy, reliability, and time \nresolution (Humplík et al., 2015;\
    \ Chawade et \nal., 2019; Reynolds et al., 2019). Cameras that \nprovide spectral\
    \ information for each pixel in \nan \nimage, \nsuch \nas \nmultispectral \nand\
    \ \nhyperspectral data, have proven to be a valuable \ntool for studying plants\
    \ under abiotic stresses \n(Cao et al., 2019). The main difference between \n\
    multispectral and hyperspectral data is the \nnumber of bands in the light spectrum\
    \ (5-10 \nbands and hundreds, respectively) (Sara et al., \n2021). However, these\
    \ cameras are expensive \nand require sophisticated statistical methods for \n\
    data processing (Zubler and Yoon, 2020). Low-\ncost digital RGB cameras can readily\
    \ estimate \nplant shoot biomass, development, and growth \nrate, and can be a\
    \ suitable tool for mapping \nplant responses under heat and drought (Blum \n\
    et al., 1997; Humplík et al., 2015).   \nPhenotypic traits such as plant growth\
    \ and yield \nand grain quality characteristics are important \nfor sustaining\
    \ the supply of wheat-based food \nproducts. Thus, a clear understanding of wheat\
    \ \nresponse mechanisms to heat, drought, and \ncombined heat-drought stresses\
    \ is essential. In \naddition, \nsince \nphenotypic \ntraits \n(e.g., \nyield/grain\
    \ weight) and wheat protein quality \nparameters are usually negatively related\
    \ \n(Daniel and Triboi, 2000; Johansson et al., \n2005), the stability of these\
    \ attributes under \nclimate change is complex and needs to be \ninvestigated.\
    \  \nThe aim of this study was to determine the \neffects of individual and combined\
    \ heat-\ndrought stresses on phenotypic plant growth \ncharacteristics, yield,\
    \ and gluten protein quality \nparameters of spring wheat genotypes grown in \n\
    highly controlled environments. Plant growth \nand development under heat, drought,\
    \ and \ncombined \nheat-drought \nstresses \nwere \nmonitored using RGB imaging,\
    \ and gluten \nprotein quality characteristics of wheat grain \nwere assessed\
    \ by SE-HPLC. The stability of \nyield and of gluten protein quality parameters\
    \ \nfor different spring wheat genotypes grown \nunder stress conditions was also\
    \ evaluated. \n2. Materials and Methods \n \n2.1. Plant material \nEight spring\
    \ wheat genotypes (Diskett, Happy, \nBumble, SW1, SW2, SW3, SW4, and SW5) \ndeveloped\
    \ in the breeding program at \nLantmännen Lantbruk, Svalöv, Sweden, were \nevaluated.\
    \ The selected genotypes represented \na range in gluten strength, as identified\
    \ when \ngrown in the field in our previous study (Lama \net al., 2022). Diskett,\
    \ Bumble, and SW3 \nrepresented genotypes with unstable gluten \nstrength (>5%\
    \ variation between years), while \nHappy, SW1, SW2, SW4, and SW5 represented\
    \ \ngenotypes with stable gluten strength (<5% \nvariation between years) (Lama\
    \ et al., 2022).  \n2.2. Experimental design and description \nof stress environments\
    \   \nThe spring wheat plants were grown in a \nrandomized complete block design\
    \ under three \nstress environments (heat, drought, combined \nheat-drought),\
    \ \nwhich \nwere \napplied \nsimultaneously. The plants were grown in \nplastic\
    \ pots (20 cm x 16 cm, volume 3.5 L) in \npeat-based soil, with three plants per\
    \ pot. Two \nweeks after emergence, a plant cone (61 x 25 \ncm) was inserted in\
    \ each pot to support the \ngrowing plants. Each pot was considered a \nbiological\
    \ replicate, and four biological \nreplicates were used per genotype. \nThe pots\
    \ containing the eight genotypes were \ngrown in two Biotron climate chambers\
    \ with \nartificial lighting from February to June 2020 at \nSLU, Alnarp, Sweden\
    \ (Tables S1 and S2, \nSupplementary Information (SI)). Growing \nconditions in\
    \ terms of temperature, humidity, \nand day length (hours) were based on mean\
    \ \nfive-year (2016-2020) weather data for the \ngrowing period in Malmö, Sweden\
    \ (22 April-\n11 August) obtained from the Swedish \nMeteorological and Hydrological\
    \ Institute \n(SMHI) (www.smhi.se). Daylight intensity of \n \n4 \n400 μmol m-2s-1,\
    \ produced with LED lights, \nwas provided during the growing period. Until \n\
    the start of the stress treatments, all plants were \nwatered every two days with\
    \ approximately \n500 mL water per pot. The drought, heat, and \ncombined \nheat-drought\
    \ \nstress \ntreatments \n(information below) were introduced at the \nbeginning\
    \ of heading stage (Zadoks 50), at \napproximately 56 days after sowing, and were\
    \ \napplied for five days, resulting in signs of stress \nin the plants (dry,\
    \ yellow leaves) (Figure 1a).  \nHeat. In this treatment, the temperature was\
    \ \nkept at 29°C during day and night for five days \nand the 56-day-old plants\
    \ were watered as in \nthe control (500 mL water/pot every two days) \n(Table\
    \ S1). After five days, the temperature was \nreturned to the control level (15°C)\
    \ (Table S1).  \nDrought. Plants assigned to the drought \ntreatment began heading\
    \ (Zadoks 50) slightly \nearlier than the plants in the other treatments. \nDrought\
    \ stress was thus applied to 51-day-old \nplants, by stopping all watering of\
    \ the plants for \nfive days. After five days, normal watering was \nresumed (500\
    \ mL water/pot every two days). \nCombined heat-drought stress. In this \ntreatment,\
    \ the 56-day-old plants received no \nwater for five days and the temperature\
    \ was \nmaintained at 29oC during day and night (Table \nS1). After five days\
    \ normal watering was \nresumed and the temperature was set to control \nconditions\
    \ (Tables S1 and S2). \nWheat plants still growing eight days after \nstopping\
    \ the stress treatments were considered \nrecovered plants. The digital biomass\
    \ of all \nplants was recorded at three time points (Tp1 = \nno stress, Tp2 =\
    \ after five days of stress \ntreatment, Tp3 = after eight days of recovery) \n\
    (Table 1). \n2.3. Image acquisition \nThe biomass of the wheat plants was assessed\
    \ \ndigitally from the top and side through RGB \nimaging in a laboratory with\
    \ LED light, using \ntwo Canon EOS 1300D DSLR cameras with an \n18-55 mm kit lens\
    \ (Armoniené et al., 2018). \nThe cameras were mounted on a SpaceArm \n(Tristar)\
    \ at 1 m for the top view and on a tripod \nat 1.5 m for the side view. Plant\
    \ pots were \nplaced manually on a top-quality Intelligent \n360 Photography turntable\
    \ platform (Shenzhen \nComxim Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, \nGuangdong, \n\
    China) \nand \nindividually \nphotographed \nusing \nthe \nDigiCamControl \nsoftware\
    \ (Istvan, 2014). During the side-view \nimaging, the plant pot was rotated by\
    \ 90° four \ntimes, to acquire four images (front, right, left, \nand back projections).\
    \ Shadows and light \ndifferences were adjusted by camera settings \nand exposure.\
    \ For both cameras, focal length \nwas set at 18 mm and ISO 1600, while light\
    \ \nexposure was set as F-Stop f/13 and exposure \ntime 1/60 s for the top-view\
    \ camera, and F-Stop \nf/8 and exposure time 1/40 for the side-view \ncamera.\
    \ The images obtained were stored in \nJPEG format, using resolution 3456 x 2304\
    \ \npixels for top projection and 5184 x 3456 pixels \nfor side projection. \n\
    2.4. Image processing  \nThe digital biomass of each plant was \nautomatically\
    \ extracted with EasyLeaf software \n(Easlon and Bloom, 2014). Since all images\
    \ \nwere acquired under the same light conditions, \nthe red and green thresholds\
    \ in the software and \nthe individual ratios of RGB values (green/red \n(G/R))\
    \ and green/blue (G/B)) were set using the \nfirst image of each measuring occasion\
    \ (Tp) \nand then processed in batch. Finally, projected \nleaf area (PLA) was\
    \ obtained from the average \nof the five plant images (top at 0° and four sides\
    \ \nat 90°) as: \n                                   \U0001D443\U0001D43F\U0001D434\
    \ = ∑ \U0001D45D\U0001D459\U0001D44E\n\U0001D45B\n1\n \n2.5. Phenotypic traits\
    \ \nThe height of all three plants in each pot was \nmeasured with a ruler as\
    \ the distance from the \nsoil surface to the tip of the spike, excluding the\
    \ \nawns. To measure the spike length (mm), the \n \n5 \ntallest spike of each\
    \ plant in the pot was \nselected and the length of the spikes was \nrecorded\
    \ from the base of the rachis to the tip \nof the terminal spikelet, excluding\
    \ the awns. \nSpike width (mm) was measured on these same \nspikes, at a point\
    \ halfway along the spike \nheight. Weight of fresh biomass (g), including \n\
    the weight of spikes (g), per pot was recorded. \nThousand kernel weight (TKW)\
    \ (g) was \ncalculated as described by Wu et al. (2018). \nNumber of spikes was\
    \ counted for each plant \nper pot and grain yield (g) was recorded per \nplant.\
    \ \n2.6. Gluten protein parameters in the \nflour \nSize \nexclusion-high-performance\
    \ \nliquid \nchromatography (SE-HPLC) was used to \nevaluate the gluten protein\
    \ characteristics of the \nharvested grain. Seeds from the different \ngenotypes\
    \ grown at different stresses and \ncontrol samples were milled into flour using\
    \ a \nhomogenizer (Mixer Mill MM 400, Retsch) for \n30 s at 30 Hz. The flours\
    \ were freeze-dried \n(Cool safe Pro, LaboGene) for 24 hours in order \nto remove\
    \ all moisture prior to SE-HPLC \nanalysis. A two-step gluten protein extraction\
    \ \nmethod was performed according to Lama et al. \n(2022), with some modifications\
    \ where \ncollected supernatant (after 1st and 2nd steps) \nin SE-HPLC vials was\
    \ heated at 80°C for 2 min \n(to inactivate proteases) in a water bath \naccording\
    \ to Islas-Rubio et al. (2006). Samples \nwere run on the SE-HPLC system in triplicate.\
    \ \nConcentrations of TOTE (SDS-extractable \nproteins), TOTU (SDS-unextractable\
    \ proteins), \n%UPP \n(percentage \nof \nSDS-unextracted \npolymeric proteins\
    \ in total polymeric proteins), \nand %LUMP (percentage of large SDS-\nunextracted\
    \ large monomeric proteins in total \nlarge monomeric proteins) were calculated\
    \ \naccording to Lama et al. (2022). Total \npolymeric proteins (TPP) and total\
    \ monomeric \nproteins \n(TMP) \nwere \ncalculated \nas \nLPP+SPP+LPPs+SPPs \n\
    and \nLMP+SMP+LMPs+SMPs, respectively, where \nLPP, SPP, LMP, and SMP are SDS-extractable\
    \ \nlarge polymeric proteins, small polymeric \nproteins, large monomeric proteins,\
    \ and small \nmonomeric proteins, respectively, and LPPs, \nSPPs, LMPs, and SMPs\
    \ are the corresponding \nSDS-unextractable form.  \n2.7. Statistical analysis\
    \ \nStatistical analyses were performed using the \nsoftware R (Team, 2013). Principal\
    \ component \nanalysis \n(PCA) \nusing \nthe \nR \npackages \nFactoMineR and two-way\
    \ analysis of variance \nwas conducted, with Tukey’s post hoc test \n(p<0.05),\
    \ to assess the effect of different \ntreatments on the gluten protein parameters\
    \ and \nphenotypic \ntraits. \nSpearman \ncorrelation \nanalysis (p<0.05) (R package\
    \ Corrplot) was \napplied for all gluten protein parameters and \nphenotypic traits\
    \ in plants in each treatment. \nGGE biplots analysis (R package Metan) was \n\
    performed to evaluate the stability of the \nstudied genotypes in the different\
    \ growing \nenvironments. The selected GGE tools were \n“mean vs. stability”,\
    \ “which-won-where view \nof the GGE biplots”, and “ranking genotypes”. \nThese\
    \ tools facilitate the identification of the \noptimal genotypes based on performance\
    \ and \nstability, identify the optimal genotype for each \ngrowing environment,\
    \ and rank them according \nto suitability for a growing environment. \n3. Results\
    \ \n3.1. Digital biomass assessment \nThe digital wheat biomass assessed by RGB\
    \ \nimaging at time points Tp1, Tp2, and Tp3 \ndiffered between the genotypes\
    \ for the different \nstress conditions tested (Figure 1). The greatest \ndifferences\
    \ in plant appearance were observed \nfor the genotype Diskett in the combined\
    \ heat-\ndrought stress treatment (Figure 1; at Tp2 and \nTp3). The impact of\
    \ drought was similar to that \nof combined heat-drought at Tp2 and Tp3, with\
    \ \nboth treatments resulting in semi-dry plants \n(Figure 1b, 1d). The heat stress\
    \ treatment had \nmild effects on the plants (Figure 1c). \nMean digital biomass\
    \ measured at flowering \n(anthesis) was similar for all genotypes at Tp1 \nand\
    \ decreased for all genotypes at both Tp2 and \n \n6 \nTp3. The greatest impact\
    \ of the stress \ntreatments was observed in the drought and \ncombined heat-drought\
    \ treatments, followed by \nheat (Figure 2). The greatest variation in mean \n\
    digital biomass between the different genotypes \nwas observed under drought and\
    \ combined \nheat-drought (Figure 2). \nUnder control conditions, rather similar\
    \ digital \nbiomasses at Tp1-Tp3 were observed for all \ngenotypes except SW1\
    \ and SW3 (Figure 3a). \nGenotype SW3 had relatively higher digital \nbiomass\
    \ at Tp2 and Tp3, while in SW1 it was \nsomewhat lower. Drought reduced the digital\
    \ \nbiomass of all genotypes compared with the \ncontrol, and especially that\
    \ of SW1 and SW4 \n(Figure 3b). Heat stress had almost no impact at \nTp1 and\
    \ Tp2, but some impact at Tp3, \nespecially for Bumble, SW2, and SW4 (Figure \n\
    3c). Diskett, SW1, and SW3 showed relatively \nsimilar digital biomass at Tp1-Tp3\
    \ in the heat \nstress treatment (Figure 3c). In the heat-drought \ntreatment,\
    \ the digital biomass was significantly \nreduced in all genotypes at Tp2 and\
    \ Tp3, \nalthough the reduction observed between Tp2 \nand Tp3 was somewhat smaller\
    \ for Happy \n(Figure 3d).  \n3.2. Effect of genotypes and stress \nconditions\
    \ \non \ngluten \nprotein \nparameters  \nThe impact of genotype (G) and stress\
    \ \nenvironment (E) on the protein parameters was \nsignificantly dominated by\
    \ individual effect, \nand not by G and E interaction (G x E) (Table \n2, Table\
    \ S3 in SI). A significant impact of G x \nE interaction was observed on Mon/pol\
    \ ratio \n(p<0.01) and TOTU (p<0.05) (Table 2). The G \nx E interaction had a\
    \ significant impact in \nparticular on unextractable gluten polymers \n(LPPs\
    \ and SPPs) and smaller monomeric \nproteins (SMP) (Table S3). \nEvaluation of\
    \ the effect of the different \ntreatments on the gluten protein parameters by\
    \ \nTukey’s post hoc test indicated a major impact \nof the combined heat-drought\
    \ stress conditions \non the gluten protein parameters, with \nsignificant effects\
    \ on TOTE, TOTU, TPP, \nTMP, and %UPP in comparison with the other \nenvironmental\
    \ conditions (Table 3).  \nA similar impact of heat-drought stress was \nobserved\
    \ on most gluten parameters studied \n(Table 3), and some impact of heat stress\
    \ on \nTMP, %LUPP, SPP, and LMPs (Table 3, Table \nS4 in SI) in comparison with\
    \ drought stress. \nSurprisingly, \nno \nsignificant \ndifferences \nbetween the\
    \ drought stress treatment and the \ncontrol were found for any of the gluten\
    \ protein \nparameters studied except %UPP and %LUPP \n(Table 3). Lower amounts\
    \ of %UPP and \n%LUPP (gluten strength) and, somewhat \nunexpectedly, a higher\
    \ amount of LPP was \nfound under the control environment compared \nwith the\
    \ drought and heat stress treatments \n(Tables 3 and S4). \n3.3. Relationship\
    \ \nbetween \ngenotypes, \nphenotypic \ntraits, \nand \ngluten \nparameters under\
    \ different stress \nenvironments  \nIn PCA plots, mean values of the phenotypic\
    \ \nand gluten protein characteristics for plants in \nthe four environments (treatments)\
    \ explained \n65.6% of the variation (PC1 52.9%, PC2 \n12.7%) (Figure 4). The\
    \ strongest impact on the \ngenotypes was observed in the combined heat-\ndrought\
    \ treatment, for genotypes Diskett and \nSW2 (Figure 4). Sensitivity to heat stress\
    \ and \nheat-drought stress was observed for genotype \nSW1 (Figure 4).  \nYield,\
    \ phenotypic characteristics, and gluten \nprotein parameters explained 52.8%\
    \ of the \nvariation in PCA (PC1 31.6%, PC2 21.2%) \n(Figure 5). The major contributors\
    \ to these two \nPCs were %UPP (control and drought), TOTU \n(heat, heat-drought,\
    \ and control), and spike \nlength (all treatments), which impacted SW4 \nand\
    \ SW2 most, further followed by Diskett. \nHappy, SW3, and SW5 showed a similar\
    \ low \nresponse to the stresses, together with grain \nyield (all treatments)\
    \ (Figure 5). Bumble \ndisplayed a similar response in spike width (all \nstress\
    \ treatments and control), %LUMP \n \n7 \n(control, heat, and heat-drought), and\
    \ %UPP \n(heat and heat-drought) (Figure 5). \nThe Spearman’s rank correlation\
    \ results \nindicated a significant impact of the treatments \non certain gluten\
    \ protein parameters, yield, and \nphenotypic traits (Figure 6). In the control\
    \ \n(unstressed) environment, a significant positive \ncorrelation was found between\
    \ grain yield and \ndigital biomass at all three time points (Tp1-\nTp3) (p<0.001),\
    \ and between grain yield and \nnumber of spikes (p<0.01) (Figure 6). \nExperimentally\
    \ measured biomass showed a \nsignificant positive correlation with digital \n\
    biomass at Tp1, Tp2, and Tp3 (p<0.001, \np<0.05, and p<0.001, respectively) (Figure\
    \ 6a). \nThe strongest significant negative correlations \nwere found between\
    \ TKW and the protein \nparameters (TOTE, TMP, TPP (p<0.001); \nTOTU (p<0.01))\
    \ (Figure 6a).  \nIn all stress treatments, grain yield was \nsignificantly positively\
    \ correlated with biomass \n(p<0.001), \nwhile \nsignificant \npositive \ncorrelations\
    \ were also found between grain \nyield and digital biomass under heat (p<0.01)\
    \ \nand under combined heat-drought stress \n(p<0.05) (Figure 6c and 6d).  \n\
    Under drought treatment, a negative significant \ncorrelation was found between\
    \ digital biomass \n(at Tp2) and most of the protein parameters \nstudied (TOTU,\
    \ TPP TMP and TOTE; \np<0.001) (Figure 6b). Additionally, TPP, TMP, \nand TOTE\
    \ showed a significant negative \ncorrelation with grain yield (Figure 6b). \n\
    Under individual drought and heat stresses, a \nsignificant negative correlation\
    \ between digital \nbiomass (at Tp3 and Tp2) and %UPP (p<0.01 \nand p<0.05, respectively)\
    \ was observed \n(Figures 6b and 6c). Under heat stress, only \nTKW was significantly\
    \ positively correlated \nwith plant height (p<0.05). \nIn combined heat-drought\
    \ stress conditions, a \nsignificant negative correlation was found \nbetween\
    \ grain yield and protein parameters \n(TOTE, TMP, and TPP; p<0.001) (Figure 6d).\
    \ \nTOTU showed significant positive correlations \nwith digital biomass at Tp1\
    \ (p<0.001) and with \nthe phenotypic traits spike length, number of \nspikes,\
    \ and TKW (p<0.05). In addition, number \nof spikes was significantly positively\
    \ correlated \nwith %UPP (p<0.001) and %LUMP (p<0.01) \n(Figure 6d). \nComparisons\
    \ of the impact of the stress \ntreatments on selected yield traits (grain yield\
    \ \nand TKW) and gluten parameters (%UPP, LPP, \nMon/pol, and TOTE) for individual\
    \ genotypes \nrevealed some variation (non-significant) \nbetween the genotypes\
    \ (Figure 7). Combined \nheat-drought stress decreased grain yield in \nmost genotypes\
    \ (Figure 7a). However, Bumble \nand SW1 in the combined heat-drought \ntreatment\
    \ showed similar grain yield as in the \ncontrol. Regarding TKW, no impact of\
    \ the \nstresses was observed for most genotypes, \nexcept a decrease due to combined\
    \ heat-\ndrought stress for SW3, SW4, and SW5 (Figure \n7a). \nIn terms of gluten\
    \ protein characteristics, a \nclear increase in both %UPP and LPPs (gluten \n\
    strength) was noted for SW2, which had the \nhighest %UPP (52.5%) of all genotypes\
    \ studied \n(Figure \n7b). \nConcerning \nMon/pol \nratio \n(describing \nextensibility\
    \ \nvs. \nstrength \ndistribution), no difference due to the stresses \nwas found\
    \ between the genotypes. Total \nextractable protein (TOTE), a strong indicator\
    \ \nof protein concentration, was found to be \nincreased most under combined\
    \ heat-drought \nstress in genotype SW2 (Figure 7b). \n3.4. Stability of yield\
    \ and protein quality \ntraits under stress  \nThe GGE biplots of PC1 and PC2\
    \ scores \nindicating stability and performance of the \nwheat genotypes in terms\
    \ of grain yield, TKW, \nTOTE, and %UPP in the different treatments \nare shown\
    \ in Figure 8. PC1 and PC2 together \nexplained 93.61% of the variation in grain\
    \ \nyield, 90.2% of the variation in TKW, 95.22% \nof the variation in %UPP (gluten\
    \ strength), and \n97.79% of the variation in TOTE (protein \n \n8 \nconcentration)\
    \ (Figure 8). To identify stable \ngenotypes, \nthe \nGGE \nbiplots \nof \nmean\
    \ \nperformance \nand \nstability \nacross \nthe \nenvironments were compared,\
    \ where 1, 2, 3, \nand 4 in Figure 8 correspond to control, \ndrought, heat, and\
    \ combined heat-drought, \nrespectively. \nThe grain yield (g/plant) plot for\
    \ ‘mean vs. \nstability’ \nrevealed \nthe \nmost \npromising \ngenotypes (Figure\
    \ 8a). SW3 showed the highest \nmean value for grain yield, followed by Happy,\
    \ \nwhile Diskett and SW4 showed the lowest grain \nyield in the studied environments\
    \ (Figure 8a). \nThe five connected points in the ‘which-won-\nwhere’ GGE biplots\
    \ showed that plants in the \ndrought, heat, and combined heat-drought \ntreatments\
    \ clustered close to each other and \nindicated that the genotypes Bumble, SW5,\
    \ \nHappy, and SW3 were the top performers in the \nstudied environments (Figure\
    \ 8b). Ranking the \ngenotypes according to their location in the \ncircles in\
    \ the GGE biplots confirmed that the \ngenotypes Happy and SW3 were the top \n\
    performers, i.e., located closest to the “ideal \nline” (Figure 8c). \nStability\
    \ in TKW appeared to be higher for the \ngenotype Happy (Figure 8d). The genotypes\
    \ \nBumble and SW3 showed the highest stability, \nbut the lowest mean values,\
    \ for TKW (Figure \n8d). The five connected points in the ‘which-\nwon-where’\
    \ GGE biplots showed that the \ncontrol, drought, and heat treatments (1, 2, 3,\
    \ \nrespectively) clustered in the same section, with \nHappy and SW4 indicated\
    \ as the top performers \n(Figure 8e). For the combined heat-drought \nenvironment,\
    \ the top performer in terms of \nTKW was Diskett (Figure 8e). Based on its \n\
    location in the inner circle and position near the \n“ideal line”, Happy was identified\
    \ as the top-\nranking genotype (Figure 8f).  \nThe GGE biplots indicated that\
    \ stability in \n%UPP among the genotypes in the studied \nenvironments was highest\
    \ in terms of mean \nvalue for SW2, followed by Bumble (Figure \n8g). The ‘which-won-where’\
    \ GGE biplots \nindicated that SW2 was the top performer in the \ncontrol, drought,\
    \ and combined heat-drought \ntreatments, while Bumble was the top \nperformer\
    \ in the heat and combined heat-\ndrought treatments (Figure 8h). The highest\
    \ \nranking genotypes in all four environments \nwere SW2 and Bumble (Figure 8i).\
    \  \nStability evaluation of TOTE in the GGE \nbiplots showed that the highest\
    \ mean values \nacross the studied environments were for \nDiskett and SW1 (Figure\
    \ 8j). Based on the \n‘which-won-where’ GGE biplots, Diskett was a \ntop performer\
    \ in all four environments, while \nSW1 was a top performer in the control, \n\
    drought, and heat treatments (Figure 8k). SW2 \nand SW5 were the top performers\
    \ in the \ncombined heat-drought treatment (Figure 8k). \nTo conclude, the top-ranked\
    \ genotypes in all \nenvironments for TOTE were Diskett and SW1 \n(Figure 8l).\
    \ \n4. Discussion  \nAccurate tools for evaluating the yield, \nphenotypic traits,\
    \ and quality traits of wheat \ngenotypes under changing climate conditions \n\
    are important when selecting new cultivars. \nAmong the abiotic stresses to which\
    \ plants are \nsubjected, drought, heat, and combined heat-\ndrought are major\
    \ limiting factors affecting \nwheat plant development. In this study, \ncombined\
    \ heat-drought stress had the greatest \nimpact on digital biomass (assessed by\
    \ RGB \nimaging) in the eight wheat genotypes studied. \nThe drought treatment\
    \ also significantly \nreduced the digital biomass, whereas the heat \nstress\
    \ treatment had a relatively mild impact \n(Figures 1 and 2). A similar pattern\
    \ has been \nobserved previously under combined heat-\ndrought stress conditions\
    \ for Nordic wheat \ngrown in controlled conditions and Lithuanian \nwinter wheat\
    \ grown in the field (Statkevičiūtė \net al., 2022). These observations suggest\
    \ that \nthe combined stress affects physiological plant \ntraits such as stomatal\
    \ closure, which leads to \ndecreased CO2 assimilation and lower TKW \n(Abdelhakim\
    \ et al., 2021; Statkevičiūtė et al., \n2022). The magnitude of the reduction\
    \ in \nbiomass is known to depend on the duration and \n \n9 \nintensity of the\
    \ stress and when the stress is \nimposed (Barnabás et al., 2008; Farooq et al.,\
    \ \n2009; Qaseem et al., 2019). \nIn this study, wheat plants were exposed to\
    \ the \ndifferent five-day stress treatments during \nanthesis, which is known\
    \ to be one of the most \ncritical growth stages, explaining the strong \nimpact\
    \ of the treatments involving drought. \nApplying heat stress alone had a mild\
    \ impact on \nplant development characteristics and biomass \nof individual genotypes,\
    \ so it was not possible \nto evaluate plant response mechanisms to this \nstress.\
    \ The chosen heat stress temperature \n(29°C) was based on findings in previous\
    \ \nstudies that a temperature of 27-30°C or higher \nprior to and during anthesis\
    \ can substantially \nreduce grain size, numbers, and yield (Tashiro \net al.,\
    \ 1989; Wheeler et al., 1996; Porter et al., \n2005; Semenov and Shewry, 2011).\
    \  \nAs expected, drought and combined heat-\ndrought stress decreased biomass\
    \ accumulation \n(Figure 3). The lack of impact of heat stress \nalone on biomass\
    \ was most likely insufficiently \nhigh temperature and short treatment time \n\
    resulting in little damage to photo-system II and \nthus to photosynthetic capacity\
    \ (Sharkey, \n2005), as seen for Bumble and SW2 at Tp2 \n(Figure 3c). For example,\
    \ Diskett plants \nresponded less to heat than to drought or \ncombined heat-drought\
    \ stress, despite the PCA \nresults indicating some sensitivity of this \ngenotype\
    \ to heat stress (Figure 4). This can be \nexplained by a different response mechanism\
    \ of \nDiskett to heat and heat-drought stresses, as \nreferred to our previous\
    \ study (Lama et al \n2022). For detailed examination of the heat \nresponse of\
    \ Diskett, field studies under heat \nstress conditions are needed. \nThe digital\
    \ tools used in this study to measure \ndigital biomass showed good ability to\
    \ evaluate \nwheat plants under severe drought and \ncombined heat-drought stress\
    \ conditions. The \ncorrelations observed between digital and \nmeasured \nbiomass,\
    \ \ne.g., \nunder \ndrought \nconditions (at Tp3) and combined heat-drought \n\
    conditions (at Tp2), revealed strong potential of \nRGB imaging to identify even\
    \ small differences \ninduced by stresses and to detect symptoms of \nthe genotypes\
    \ under the different environments. \nUnder heat stress, the genotypes SW1 and\
    \ SW3 \nwere least affected (Figure 3c), while under \ncombined heat-drought stress\
    \ Happy and SW3 \nwere the least affected genotypes (Figure 3d), \nsuggesting\
    \ somewhat different stress coping \nmechanisms. \nIn the control (no stress)\
    \ growing environment, \nmost gluten parameters (TOTE, etc.) showed a \nnegative\
    \ correlation with grain yield, TKW, \nbiomass, plant height, and spike width\
    \ (Figure \n6a), as also observed previously (Bogard et al., \n2011; Wang et al.,\
    \ 2018).  Thousand kernel \nweight and grain yield are closely associated \n(Li\
    \ et al., 2021) and are linked with starch \naccumulation. High accumulation of\
    \ starch \nunder the control conditions can dilute the \ngluten protein concentrations\
    \ in wheat grain \n(Koga et al., 2015), which may be one \nexplanation for the\
    \ negative correlations \nbetween gluten proteins and yield-related \nparameters\
    \ in this study.   \nThis study examined the impact of stress factors \non \n\
    the \nmost \nimportant \ngluten \nquality \nparameters, e.g., gluten strength,\
    \ based on the \nconcentrations of polymeric proteins. Under \nindividual drought\
    \ and heat stress, a negative \ncorrelation between %UPP and digital biomass \n\
    (Tp2-Tp3) was observed. There was also a clear \nimpact of stress on the %UPP\
    \ and %LUPP \nfractions (Table 3), suggesting that these \nenvironmental stresses\
    \ trigger mechanisms \nrelated \nto \ngluten \npolymer \naccumulation/regulation.\
    \ In the presence of \nsevere \nstress \n(combined \nheat-drought \ntreatment),\
    \ the wheat plants seemed still able to \nproduce spikes, as number of spikes\
    \ correlated \npositively with %UPP.  \nSpike length is a strong indicator of\
    \ yield (Lan \net al., 2022) and is directly related to starch \naccumulation,\
    \ suggesting that wheat yield and \nprotein polymerization are in some way related.\
    \ \nUnder stress conditions, gluten polymerization \nis triggered via formation\
    \ of interchain \n \n10 \ndisulfide bonds (SS)  between HMW and LMW \nglutenins\
    \ and certain gliadins (alpha, beta, \ngamma) (Branlard et al., 2020). These gluten\
    \ \nproteins form %UPP most likely at the expense \nof starch. Previous studies\
    \ have found that, in \nparticular, large polymeric protein fractions \n(e.g.,\
    \ uLPP and uSPP) increase at 12-18 days \nafter anthesis (Johansson et al., 2005).\
    \ Under \ncombined heat-drought stress conditions in the \npresent \nstudy, \n\
    yield \nwas \nsignificantly \nnegatively \ncorrelated \nwith \nprotein \nconcentration,\
    \ confirming findings in previous \nstudies in the field and greenhouse (Triboi\
    \ et \nal., 2006; Malik et al., 2012).  \nA positive effect of abiotic stress\
    \ on gluten \nprotein polymerization has also been observed \nin previous studies\
    \ performed in the field \n(Johansson, 2002; Johansson et al., 2002; Lama \net\
    \ al., 2022) and greenhouse (Malik et al., 2011; \nLeiva et al., 2021). The positive\
    \ effect of heat \nstress on protein polymerization is known to \noccur at high\
    \ temperatures (up to 30°C) during \ngrain development stage (Johansson et al.,\
    \ \n2002; Malik et al., 2011). The nature of the \neffect of drought stress on\
    \ polymerization \ndepends on the timing of the drought (Leiva et \nal., 2021;\
    \ Lan et al., 2022). For example, a \ngreenhouse study found a positive effect\
    \ of \ndrought at heading, which increased %UPP \ncompared with drought at stem\
    \ elongation stage \n(Leiva et al., 2021). Late drought (during ear \nemergence)\
    \ is reported to have a stronger \npositive effect on %UPP than early drought\
    \ \n(during tillering) (Lan et al., 2022). Among the \nthree stress treatments\
    \ tested in this study, \ncombined heat-drought stress had the greatest \neffect\
    \ on gluten protein polymerization.  \nThe results obtained with the imaging tools\
    \ \nemployed to measure digital biomass at \ndifferent stress time points (Tp1,\
    \ Tp2, Tp3) in \nthis study were significantly and positively \ncorrelated with\
    \ grain yield and with actual \nmeasured biomass, suggesting that RGB \nimaging\
    \ could be a useful method for \nevaluating the impacts of plant stresses on \n\
    phenotypic characteristics, such as grain yield.  \nNo significant effect was\
    \ found for the \ninteraction between genotype and environment \n(G x E) on gluten\
    \ protein parameters (except for \nMon/pol), contradicting findings in previous\
    \ \nstudies in the greenhouse (Malik et al., 2013) \nand in the field (Hernandez-Espinosa\
    \ et al., \n2018; Lama et al., 2022). This lack of effect \nmay have been due\
    \ to insufficiently challenging \nenvironmental background in this study.  \n\
    Among the eight genotypes compared, Happy \nwas the most promising in terms of\
    \ stability of \ngrain yield, TKW, %UPP, and TOTE in \nstressful growing environments.\
    \ Happy also \nshowed greater digital biomass in the combined \nheat-drought stress\
    \ treatment. The breeding line \nSW2 showed lower digital biomass and yield \n\
    under stress, but also the highest stability and \nmean gluten strength (%UPP)\
    \ in the control and \nin all three stress treatments, supporting \nprevious findings\
    \ (Lama et al., 2022). \nGenotype SW3 showed the highest stability in \nTKW and\
    \ higher grain yield than the other \ngenotypes. Diskett, SW5, and SW1 appeared\
    \ to \nbe the most sensitive genotypes in terms of \nmost parameters studied (yield,\
    \ TKW, %UPP, \netc.). \n5. Conclusions  \nAssessing \nand \ncontrolling \nimportant\
    \ \nphenotypic and grain quality-related traits in \nwheat is important for success\
    \ in breeding \nprograms seeking to produce desirable wheat \nmaterial for use\
    \ under future climate change. \nThis study revealed significant impacts of \n\
    combined \nheat-drought \nstress \non \nplant \nphenotypic characteristics and\
    \ gluten protein \nquality traits in eight spring wheat genotypes, \nwhile drought\
    \ stress alone also had negative \nimpacts. However, heat stress (29°C) had only\
    \ \nmild \neffects \non \nyield \nand \nphenotypic \ncharacteristics, although\
    \ in field conditions the \nimpact of heat stress could be much more \nsevere.\
    \  \nThere were significant positive correlations \nbetween grain yield and digital\
    \ biomass, and \nbetween digital biomass and actual measured \n \n11 \nbiomass,\
    \ in all stress treatments tested, \nindicating that RGB imaging can be a valuable\
    \ \ntool in assessing stress in wheat plants.  \nIndividual \ndrought \nand \n\
    heat \nstresses \nsignificantly affected gluten strength (%UPP \nand %LUPP). There\
    \ was a negative correlation \nbetween digital biomass and most gluten \nprotein\
    \ parameters analyzed, although Mon/pol \nratio was not affected by the experimental\
    \ \nstresses studied. \nA surprising finding was that number of spikes \nwas significantly\
    \ positively correlated with \nboth %UPP and %LUMP under combined heat-\ndrought\
    \ stress, suggesting a correlation not only \nwith polymeric glutenins (HMW and\
    \ LMW) \nbut also with large monomeric proteins (e.g., \ngliadin types). Number\
    \ of spikes is an indicator \nof yield and, together with gluten protein \nquality\
    \ traits, could potentially be explored in \nscreening for high yield and gluten\
    \ protein \nquality in wheat under climate stress.  \nThe most promising genotypes\
    \ in terms of \nperformance and stability in the stress \nenvironments tested\
    \ were SW3 and Happy for \nhigh yield, SW1 and Happy for high TKW, \nSW2 and Bumble\
    \ for high %UPP, and Diskett \nand SW1 for high protein concentration \n(TOTE).\
    \ In order to meet plant breeding targets \nfor extreme climate resistance, these\
    \ top-\nperforming genotypes need to be further tested \nin field studies where\
    \ their phenotypic and \ngluten protein characteristics are evaluated \nusing\
    \ the combination of tools tested in this \nstudy. \nConflict of Interest \nThe\

    \ Sueciae\nDoctoral Thesis No. 2023:25\nPlant phenotyping is a pivotal tool for\
    \ understanding the physiological \nand genetic basis of plant growth and development.\
    \ However, \nphenotyping methods can be expensive and time-consuming, limiting\
    \ \ntheir widespread adoption. This thesis presents the development and \nevaluation\
    \ of affordable phenotyping methods that can be used to \nstudy a wide range of\
    \ plant traits. These methods have the potential to \nincrease the accessibility\
    \ of plant phenotyping to researchers around \nthe world, facilitating advances\
    \ in plant breeding and physiology.\nFernanda Leiva-Sandoval received her doctoral\
    \ education at the \nDepartment of Plant Breeding, Swedish University of Agricultural\
    \ \nSciences, Alnarp. She received her BSc in Electronics Engineering from \n\
    the University of Ibague, Colombia.\n"

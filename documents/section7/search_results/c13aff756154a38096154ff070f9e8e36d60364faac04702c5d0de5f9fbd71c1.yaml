    1 Introduction Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the
    increasing demand for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation
    have proven to be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The
    concept of aquaponics, a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an
    alternative solution to sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system
    where fish and plants are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic
    relationship where the waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and
    the plants clean the water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates
    by bacteria present in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants.
    This system also provides the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply
    as compared to traditional irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic
    way of irrigation conserves as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional
    irrigation systems. It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system
    because nutrients are readily available to them and they do not have to expend
    energy searching for them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment
    of an aquaponics system provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making
    it a superior option for growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples
    of tap water as well as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity,
    and water temperature. The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on
    various factors such as the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life,
    and the weather conditions. In general, lake water can have a lower or higher
    pH level than tap water, depending on the lake''s distinctive characteristics
    and the way the local area''s tap water is treated. For instance, tap water is
    usually treated to have a pH level between 6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe
    for human consumption and does not cause corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring
    presence of suspended particles like silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause
    it to have a greater turbidity level than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware
    design of one system [1] includes various components such as sensors, actuators,
    relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino, and routers. The monitoring of temperature
    and humidity is accomplished using an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield,
    an FC-28 humidity sensor, and a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized
    to connect the Arduino Ethernet to a server. The relay module functions as a control
    switch for various actuators, which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic
    box contains several actuators, such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker,
    a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept
    track of numerous environmental factors, and over time it would be able to control
    how the farm operated and create a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes),
    brokers (local servers), and subscribers (local servers) all communicated via
    the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use of any data type. Monitoring can also
    be done with the help of a GUI program, a communication network, and [3] wireless
    sensors. A graphical user interface is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned
    issues. Farmers can get real-time notifications and advice about water quality
    even when they are not there by using AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT
    technology. When compared to the conventional approach, the introduction of the
    AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics system has shown substantial gains.
    Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate many characteristics observed
    by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics. A ZigBee module [5] can be
    used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the data gathered by the Arduino
    while also displaying the values on the LCD without performing any control actions.
    A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that simulates the sun''s rays for
    plant growth make up the aquaponics system described in [6]. The fish waste provides
    nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive water from the fish tank as a filter.
    The system makes use of actuators to operate the water pump, light panel, heater,
    and oxygen provider as well as sensors to monitor and control pH levels, temperature,
    and humidity. To direct the actual citrus production process, nutrient monitoring
    [7] in citrus plants can also be done in real time according to the soil situation.
    Another method that primarily focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies
    in image processing [8] in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional
    deficiencies. A Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid
    valves make up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method
    can help in the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing
    many sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level
    [9]. Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

  description: This paper proposes an IoT-enabled soil monitoring system using wireless
    sensor network for automatic irrigation in agricultural applications, especially
    for lemongrass plants, where an automated control system is required for irrigation
    applications. This can solve the problem of the water crisis, which is faced by
    the farmers during the cultivation of the crop in the field. This controls the
    water supply in the irrigation process using an IoT communication system. A system
    architecture for soil monitoring and controlling irrigation using IoT technique
    is designed where the different sensors and actuators like humidity, soil moisture,
    temperature, pump, and so forth are connected with a node microcontrol unit and
    message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol for enhancing communication
    capabilities. This wireless sensor network gives feedback to the system. This
    provides automation by the on/off pump system during drip irrigation. The sensor
    data are displayed on a PC or mobile phone through wireless communication and
    an IoT cloud platform. An experimental testing setup is developed and the experimental
    performance of a soil monitoring system using IoT technique for automatic drip
    irrigation has been carried out and soil moisture data are also stored in a cloud
    server for analytics. The performance shows that the MQTT protocol sends data
    within 48 s to the IoT cloud so that the data can be acquired in a faster manner.
    This shows that this kind of soil monitoring system is suitable for automatic
    drip irrigation, which enhances the farming process and overcomes the water crises
    in the agricultural system by reducing the wastage of water.

    an IoT-enabled soil monitoring system using wireless sensor network for automatic
    irrigation in agricultural applications, especially for lemongrass plants, where
    an automated control system is required for irrigation applications. This can
    solve the problem of the water crisis, which is faced by the farmers during the
    cultivation of the crop in the field. This controls the water supply in the irrigation
    process using an IoT communication system. A system architecture for soil monitoring
    and controlling irrigation using IoT technique is designed where the different
    sensors and actuators like humidity, soil moisture, temperature, pump, and so
    forth are connected with a node microcontrol unit and message queuing telemetry
    transport (MQTT) protocol for enhancing communication capabilities. This wireless
    sensor network gives feedback to the system. This provides automation by the on/off
    pump system during drip irrigation. The sensor data are displayed on a PC or mobile
    phone through wireless communication and an IoT cloud platform. An experimental
    testing setup is developed and the experimental performance of a soil monitoring
    system using IoT technique for automatic drip irrigation has been carried out
    and soil moisture data are also stored in a cloud server for analytics. The performance
    shows that the MQTT protocol sends data within 48 s to the IoT cloud so that the
    data can be acquired in a faster manner. This shows that this kind of soil monitoring
    system is suitable for automatic drip irrigation, which enhances the farming process
    and overcomes the water crises in the agricultural system by reducing the wastage
    of water. 1 INTRODUCTION Nowadays, a smart farming process is necessary as the
    need for food production is estimated to enhance by approximately 70% by 2050.1,
    2 The rapidly rising world population will thus cause an equivalent rise in food
    demand. Thus, to have an optimal farm system that uses optimal water and energy,
    the sights specific farming with the precision of water and energy used is provided
    to the farmers, which helps them to take better decisions and improve the quality,
    and quantity, in turn increasing productivity. The advancement in technology with
    the modernization of farming through automation is important for the efficient
    use of water, which supports plant growth and the monitoring of environmental
    data and also reduces the need for manual (conventional) irrigation.3, 4 Therefore,
    smart farming will be performed effectively using an automatic irrigation system,
    which can reduce the cost of irrigation and crop cultivation. This can also handle
    optimal usage of water and electrical energy, which can emphasize long-term sustainable
    solutions through automation of the agricultural irrigation process. The process
    of automatic irrigation can be executed using the acquired data through sensors
    which can be integrated through a sensor network system. These sensors can automatically
    evaluate environmental conditions such as air humidity, soil moisture, and air
    temperature for effective utilization of irrigation systems. To build a sustainable
    soil monitoring system using wireless sensor network (WSN), the Internet of Things
    (IoT) can also play an essential role in automating the watering process and collecting
    information from the environment. Nowadays, saving water is also a top priority
    because optimal utilization of water will save water resources effectively for
    reducing drought. The challenges are addressed during the implementation of WSN
    for monitoring the field and estimating irrigation requirements with the help
    of gathered data as reported by Garcia et al.5 Further, a review has been reported
    by Akhtar et al6 on how edge computing techniques can help to store and process
    the data in the cloud. To cover large areas and optimize the soil moisture conditions,
    Liang et al7 have applied an adaptive Cauchy variant butterfly optimization algorithm
    in a WSN. Further, Chai et al8 have proposed strategies for soil moisture sensor
    deployment using a data-driven method which can help in the estimation of evapotranspiration
    of environment. IoT cloud platform can also help in analytics where a lot of data
    can be stored and analyzed for the futuristic requirement to manage the plants
    so that automated irrigation systems will effectively solve the problem of water
    crisis based on said sensor values. The data are represented to the users in a
    user-friendly manner. Considering these aspects, the objective of this paper is
    to design and develop a soil monitoring system using a WSN for an automatic irrigation
    system where IoT technique is applied to monitor and control the soil condition
    so that the appropriate amount of water can be given to the crop during cultivation,
    which can save water, time, and money for the cultivation of the crop. The aim
    of this paper is envisaged in the following points: A soil monitoring system using
    WSN is built where the IoT technique is applied for communication between different
    nodes. The different protocols, such as hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and
    message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocols, are attempted to obtain
    faster communication as compared to HTTP protocol. Remote monitoring and controlling
    capabilities using WSN have been demonstrated where a mobile app is also developed.
    This sends the different sensor data such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature
    conditions. The different conditions are analyzed so that the farmers can take
    the decision for the automatic irrigation system. The different experimental trials
    are conducted, and data are stored in the cloud using a mobile app that can help
    in crop cultivation, especially lemongrass crops. This paper is structured as
    follows: A brief state-of-the-art report on a different irrigation system and
    its applications is presented in Section 2. A novel IoT-based smart soil monitoring
    system using WSN with the application of MQTT protocol for automatic drip irrigation
    where soil conditions are monitored using a WSN is proposed in Section 6. The
    system architecture is discussed in Section 12. An experimental testing setup
    is also built for implementing and monitoring the soil conditions, which is discussed
    in Section 16. The summary is concluded in Section 17. 2 BRIEF STATE-OF-ART REPORT

    of this work. The different conditions of plants are examined for monitoring the
    crops. 3 IOT-ENABLED COMMUNICATION METHODOLOGY OF SMART SOIL MONITORING SYSTEM
    DESIGN To design an IoT-based smart soil monitoring system, a sensor network system
    is designed as shown in Figure 1. The following subsections are considered. FIGURE
    1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic diagram of the automatic irrigation
    system using WSN and IoT. 3.1 Sensors node The four sensor nodes are taken where
    the system consists of one node microcontrol unit (MCU) controller as a master
    node and the other three sensor nodes act as slave nodes. Each sensor node has
    one soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and one node MCU
    microcontroller. The node MCU is supported with ESP8266 for Wi-Fi communication,
    integrated general purpose input/output (GPIO), pulse width modulation (PWM),
    inter-integrated circuit (I2C), and analog–digital card (ADC) all within one board
    for faster communications. A USB-TTL cable is included and open-source programming
    is written using an integrated development environment (IDE) for integrating the
    entire hardware. 3.2 Sensors Each node consists of the soil moisture sensor, humidity
    sensor, and temperature sensor. The soil moisture sensor (Model: Robotbana) is
    used with digital output and soil hygrometer. The output of moisture can be measured
    in terms of volumetric content. Humidity and temperature sensor (DHT22) is used,
    which is a polymer capacitor type sensor. The operating range is 0%–100% RH, temperature
    measuring range is 0°C–80°C, accuracy is ±2%RH and a maximum of up to ±5%RH and
    temperature accuracy is ±0.5°C, resolution or sensitivity of humidity is 0.1%RH
    and temperature sensitivity is 0.1°C, repeatability of humidity is ±1%RH and repeatability
    of temperature is 0.2°C, and sensing period average is 2 s. 3.3 Actuators AC water
    pump (0.5 hp) is used for supplying the water to the plantations from water resources.
    For regulating the flow of water, a solenoid valve (operated through 24 voltage
    direct current [VDC]) is utilized so that the pump can be automatically ON/OFF.
    3.4 Communication routers The router is used for a wide area network (WAN) for
    wireless communications so that sensor data can be sent in the pocket. This can
    be forwarded to the internet by assigning an internet protocol (IP) address. 3.5
    Protocols The two protocols (HTTP and MQTT) are applied for analyzing the proper
    communications in the IoT cloud. A Thingspeak IoT platform is used, which has
    Android application open-source programming capabilities. As per the requirement
    of soil condition, the water pump is operated automatically by activating each
    sensor node. In this system, data are collected from all the sensor nodes at the
    same time, and data are sent to the cloud. NodeMCU microcontroller controls the
    entire setup where an ESP8266 Wi-Fi inbuilt module is used for transmitting and
    receiving data wirelessly. To assemble the data simultaneously from more than
    one node, the MQTT protocol is applied. Different environmental sensors are used
    to collect the soil moisture, soil temperature, and humidity information of the
    environment. A water pump is connected to the controller node for supplying water
    in the field. The data sent by the sensor nodes are analyzed in the cloud and
    a decision is taken in the cloud on whether the soil needs water or not. Therefore,
    the command is sent to the master for further action. The master turns the ON
    or OFF pump according to the command. It is helpful for farmers since the water
    requirement of the soil can be monitored worldwide. The sensor nodes are powered
    with the help of a solar panel. This system is designed for wireless monitoring
    and control of agricultural land from anywhere using a mobile Android device.
    The application user can monitor and control the irrigation process, cultivate
    crop performance, collect soil data and send alerts to the user, and store them
    for analytics. Therefore, the WSN system is applied for irrigation operations
    on the entire field and IoT-enabled communication methodology is shown in Figure
    2. This system can allow the farmers to monitor and control the fields 24/7 throughout
    the whole year. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Communication methodology

    the designing of the hardware system. V. Solenoid valve55 A solenoid valve is
    utilized for regulating the flow of water so that the pump can be automatically
    ON/OFF. VI. DC power supply56 A DC power supply is also used for giving the DC
    electrical power to sensor nodes, which can drive the sensors, microcontrollers,
    and so forth. VII. Router57 The router is utilized for WAN connections, which
    can send data in small pockets, properly. By connecting to the internet, data
    can be forwarded using the IoT method. VIII. Relay (double channel)58 The relay
    (double channel) is used for switching the appropriate action during the ON/OFF
    operation of the automatic irrigation system. IX Android studio59 Android Studio
    is used which has the inbuilt capability for an integrated development environment
    (IDE). The code can be written in Java developer tools. X. ThingSpeak IoT cloud
    platform60 The ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform is utilized for storing and processing
    data. This can be shown in a massively scalable real-time event processing engine.
    The user can register in the ThingSpeak cloud by creating a login user account.
    Further, new channels can be created for visualization of sensor data of the particular
    field where two types of application programming interface (API) keys such as
    READ API keys and WRITE API keys are used for read and write purposes so that
    the thing speaks IoT cloud platform is used operation of automatic irrigation
    systems. 4 FLOW PROCESS OF MQTT PROTOCOL FOR IOT-ENABLED COMMUNICATION METHODOLOGY
    The soil monitoring system for smart irrigation is designed using a water pump,
    soil moisture, humidity and temperature, and MQTT communication protocol along
    with NodeMCU. This microcontroller has a Wi-Fi facility, and MQTT protocol is
    used for receiving the signal and transmitting the message from sensors. This
    provides the information on soil and NodeMCU allows to operate the water pump
    accordingly through a web page where the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is integrated. The
    major advantages of the MQTT protocol are that it is cost-effective and provides
    communication in a faster manner. The flow process of the MQTT protocol for IoT-enabled
    communication methodology is shown in Figure 3. The soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity sensors are connected to the NodeMCU microcontroller, which sends
    data to the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The Tx and Rx pin of ESP8266 is connected to
    data respective transmitting and receiving pins in NodeMCU. It should be ensured
    that the input voltage of ESP8266 must be 3.0 VDC. Further, Afterward, the data
    are massaged to MQTT again through the ThingSpeak IoT platform for visualization
    and storage of data for analytics. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow
    process for MQTT protocol for IoT-enabled communication methodology. During the
    development of the testing setup, there are four NodeMCU devices acting as slaves,
    and each slave is connected to a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, as well
    as a moisture sensor. The circuit diagram is shown in Figure 4. Additionally,
    there is one master NodeMCU connected to a relay and a pump. The master and slave
    devices are connected to the cloud. Here is a description of the connection. FIGURE
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Circuit diagram of the proposed system. 4.1
    Slave NodeMCUs There are four NodeMCU devices acting as slaves in the system.
    Each slave NodeMCU is connected to a DHT11 sensor and a moisture sensor. The DHT11
    sensor measures temperature and humidity, while the moisture sensor detects the
    moisture level in a particular area. Each slave NodeMCU is responsible for reading
    the data from its respective sensors and sending that data to the master NodeMCU.
    The slaves can communicate with the master NodeMCU over the network, typically
    using protocols like MQTT and HTTP. 4.2 Master NodeMCU There is one NodeMCU device
    acting as the master in the system. The master NodeMCU is connected to a relay
    and a pump. It receives data from the slave NodeMCUs, which includes temperature,
    humidity, and moisture readings from the sensors. Based on the received data,
    the master NodeMCU can make decisions and control the relay and pump accordingly.
    For example, if the moisture level is low, indicating a need for watering, the
    master NodeMCU can activate the relay to turn on the pump and water the plants.
    4.3 Cloud connection Both the master and slave NodeMCUs are connected to the cloud.
    Cloud connectivity allows the devices to communicate with each other over the
    internet, even if they are physically located in different places. The connection
    to the cloud can be established using various protocols like MQTT and HTTP and
    other IoT-specific protocols. 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS To develop a smart IoT-enabled
    drip irrigation system, a small pilot project plant for the cultivation of lemongrass
    is being developed as shown in Figure 5. The environmental sensors like soil,
    humidity, and temperatures are installed as per requirement. These sensors are
    integrated with a NodeMCU microcontroller and support items in a control box unit,
    which send the signal by operating voltage of 5 VDC. A 0.5 hp AC pump is also
    installed for supplying the water as per requirement from the storage water source.
    The water supply to cultivated land through the drip pipe system. During the operation
    of the pump, the sensors acquire the soil, temperature, and humidity data, which
    are processed to the IoT cloud using the ThingSpeak platform via a web server.
    A web application is also intended to use an Android application for monitoring
    and controlling the smart automatic drip irrigation system especially lemongrass
    so that all data can be monitored and control processes can also be done accordingly.
    AC pump is attached to a water pond arrangement for supplying the appropriate
    amount of water from the natural pond. The water pump will automatically begin
    and start to send water to the agricultural estate as per the soil conditions.
    The soil condition is identified using the different sensors which are inserted
    in soil closer to lemongrass plants where the threshold value of soil condition
    according to the environment is adjusted in NodeMCU microcontroller through programming.
    Therefore, the water pump operates as per necessity from time to time automatically.
    The information about the soil and environmental conditions is collected from
    different sensors like soil moisture, humidity, and temperature in the cloud.
    The information is processed and accordingly, the microcontroller, via the IoT
    cloud operates the water pump through a relay. The soil moisture sensors sense
    the soil condition using two coated metal rods that can be inserted into the grassland.
    Further, the web application is linked with the NodeMCU microcontroller for obtaining
    the soil and other parameters. These signals are identified using the Android
    application which supports the computer user interface. This IoT-enabled automatic
    drip irrigation system is developed by combining the hardware and software linked
    together with serial communication ports via the NodeMCU microcontrollers to transmit
    data from one device to another wirelessly and monitoring can be done. For operating
    the system, a program is written in Arduino Software (IDE) and the flow chart
    is shown in Figure 6. At first, all nodes are physically connected to the hardware.
    An internet connection is also provided. For connecting in an IoT environment,
    the MQTT protocol is applied. The sensor soil moisture, humidity, and temperature
    sensors read the soil conditions and humidity and temperature at all four node
    points then it is sent to the IoT cloud through MQTT protocols. Here, the threshold
    value for each sensor case is set at 1024 m3 m−3. This process will be continued
    until the whole crop land gets enough water. Further, these data will be uploaded
    to the IoT cloud using the ThingSpeak platform, which is stored for establishing
    the analytics. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Testing setup for automatic

    Flowchart of the automatic irrigation system. For building the web application
    app, an Android/web page is deliberated using a ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform
    as shown in Figure 7. The ThingSpeak is a viable IoT cloud platform that can be
    utilized for the progression of the data, visualization, storage, and analysis
    of real-time data. This can also provide messages to user mobile via web server
    management. During operation, the data are sent using NodeMCU in the web server.
    A login page is also designed within the web page, which is integrated with the
    Uniform Resource Locator (URL), and it opens by providing the appropriate credentials.
    After identifying the credentials, the operation of the smart drip irrigation
    page is opened, and sensor data can be visualized after proper activation via
    NodeMCU and gateways. As per the user instructions, an Android app is handled
    where the user/client can operate and control the water pump operation and handle
    the smart automatic drip irrigation system as per the requirement remotely. The
    data can be visualized accordingly. As a result, smart automatic drip irrigation
    systems can remotely be handled through an Android phone from anywhere. FIGURE

    Experimental performance of each soil moisture sensor. Further, the experimental
    performance of each soil moisture sensor node is also analyzed as shown in Figures
    9-11–12. From this analysis, it is found that each soil moisture sensor covers
    wetness in said respective marked area as green color by soil moisture sensor
    1 (as Figure 9), yellow color by soil moisture sensor 2 (as Figure 10), blue color
    by soil moisture sensor 3 (as Figure 11) and magenta color by soil moisture sensor
    4 (as Figure 12) after the operating the pump automatically. FIGURE 9 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor 1 covers wetness in the said green
    color marked area. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor
    2 covers wetness in the said yellow color marked area. FIGURE 11 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor 3 covers wetness in the said blue color
    marked area. FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture sensor 4
    covers wetness in the said purple color marked area. Testing has been done for
    8 h, and data are added and graphs are plotted again from Figures 8–12. From Figure
    8, it is envisaged that the behavior for soil condition shows repeated behavior
    after 4 h because the moisture content is less as compared to the required condition.
    Therefore, the pump will be “on.” Further, after 4 h, the pump will be again “on.”
    This behavior will repeat as per requirement. Figures 9-12 show that soil content
    is present for 8 h (which means a full day) so that the lemongrass crop acquires
    sufficient water for growth in the field. In Figure 10, the temperature behavior
    is plotted for 8 h, which shows the temperature rises from 27°C to 41°C up to
    the afternoon. At the end of the day, the temperature is around 31°C. During the
    operation of the water pump, the temperatures are also recorded as shown in Figure
    13. The temperature of the environments shows that it is also increased range
    from 27°C to 40°C because this is recorded in the month of April in the afternoon.
    FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Temperature of the environments during
    pump operations. The experimental data for IoT-based network signal is obtained
    from Master NodeMCU and plotted as shown in Figure 14. This shows that the master
    NodeMCU continuously monitors the network signal in dBm where the network signal
    is measured in terms of the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value in
    dBm from each slave node to assess the quality of their signal connections. This
    RSSI is a parameter used to measure the signal strength between devices in a wireless
    network. This value also represents the strength of the Wi-Fi signal it receives
    from the access point and each slave NodeMCU device. FIGURE 14 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Performance of IoT-based network signal for soil monitoring
    toward automatic drip irrigation. Further, a comparison between MQTT and HTTP
    protocol while sending the data is carried out as given in Table 4. The performance
    shows that the MQTT protocol sends data within 48 s to the IoT cloud so that the
    data can be acquired in a faster manner. TABLE 4. Comparison between MQTT and
    HTTP protocols. S. no. Protocol Processing time (s) Node 1 Node 2 Node 3 Node
    4 1. MQTT 15 16 31 48 2. HTTP 20 241 363 495 From these experimental performances,
    it is envisaged that a WSN using NodeMCU is developed where NodeMCU can help in
    establishing wireless communications by creating different nodes. By applying
    different protocols (MQTT and HTTP), it is observed that each node can acquire
    a communication range between 15 and 48 s, which is faster as compared to the
    HTTP protocol. Therefore, the soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, and temperature
    sensor are easily transmitted in the cloud using the ThingSpeak IoT platform where
    the experimental data are stored. The automation of irrigation is done using a
    user-friendly mobile app for monitoring and controlling crop fields from anywhere.
    The novelty of this paper is highlighted point-wise. A soil monitoring system
    using WSN is developed where the different protocols such as HTTP and MQTT protocols
    are applied with the application of IoT technique where MQTT protocol provides
    the faster response as compared to HTTP protocol. Remote monitoring and controlling
    capabilities using WSN have been demonstrated where the soil moisture, humidity,
    and temperature conditions are obtained at different conditions, which can help
    the farmers with automatic irrigation systems. By conducting different experimental
    trials, the soil conditions are analyzed at different conditions which can help
    in crop cultivation, especially lemongrass crops. For comparison with currently
    published works, Pereira et al61 have reported on IoT-enabled smart drip irrigation
    systems using the ESP32 Wi-Fi communication module, whereas our work is carried
    out using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi communication module. The major advantages of our
    work are that the ESP8266 Wi-Fi communication module can communicate in a faster
    manner, with low cost and less energy consumption as compared to the ESP32 Wi-Fi
    communication module. As well, my previous work focused only on the HTTP protocol
    for sending the data through the data fusion method.62 During sending data, the
    time was taken more, whereas this paper is attempted on different protocols such
    as HTTP and MQTT protocols with multiple nodes through WSN. The major advantages
    of the proposed method are that faster communication can be obtained and data
    are also stored in the IoT cloud easily for data analytics. This is also part
    of the novelty of this paper. 6 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a novel soil monitoring
    system using a WSN for automatic irrigation systems is designed where an IoT technique
    is applied for sending and storing data in the IoT cloud. The node MCU microcontroller
    is used for wireless cloud network systems where communications have been done
    wirelessly using the MQTT protocol. This provides a faster response while uploading
    the data. During experimentation, the soil sensor data are successfully uploaded
    to the IoT cloud which is remotely accessed using a mobile phone. An appropriate
    quantity of water is supplied to the lemongrass plants of the agricultural field
    using a pump automation process. The health of lemongrass plants is observed from
    anywhere using an Android mobile phone. This offers an affordable solution for
    supplying a sufficient amount of water to manage agricultural cultivation land
    effectively. By developing the testing prototype, it is demonstrated that the
    use of such network systems/applications can facilitate a variety of plant harvesting
    processes. This kind of system can be employed in a variety of small land, open
    space cultivation, different plantations, crop cultivation, and so forth. Hence,
    it is concluded that soil monitoring using WSNs and IoT techniques can be effectively
    used for automatic irrigation systems which is a promising technique in the precision
    agriculture field. The futuristic work will be focused on the measurement of the
    pH value of soil and the measurement of soil nutrition condition using NPK sensors
    so that fertilization of soil can be done to enhance crop health. The mapping
    can be done for the uniform growth of plants in the field. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Salem, India SECTION I. Introduction Farming
    is the largest consumer of water resources globally, accounting for a significant
    portion of total freshwater usage. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to
    irrigation is often inefficient, low-value, and heavily subsidized by governments
    and donors. This has led to a reevaluation of the economic, social, and environmental
    impacts of publicly funded irrigation projects. In the past, domestic irrigation
    dominated agricultural budgets worldwide, but in today''s world, farming faces
    stiff competition for limited water resources. As such, the future of irrigation
    and agriculture lies in finding innovative ways to use water more efficiently
    and sustainably. Such practices will not only benefit the farmers but also help
    to reduce the economic, social, and environmental impact of agriculture on the
    world. Smart irrigation or automated irrigation systems have gained popularity
    recently. Smart irrigation is a technique for conserving water in irrigation by
    utilizing science and technology. It has multiple controls, soil sensors, and
    weather sensors. The sensor keeps track of the real ground humidity and the current
    weather conditions, and the controller decides whether to open or shut the water
    valve. Scientific assessment is used in automated irrigation to determine the
    amount, timing, and need of water. It is appropriate for managing water-saving
    practices in lawns, agricultural land, landscapes, and other regions. These kinds
    of works contribute towards saving water resources. Considering the rise in global
    temperatures over the last decade, water has become a particularly valuable resource
    for the industry of farming. In addition to that, the unfavorable weather conditions
    tend to affect plants and crops in agricultural fields. Even, smart irrigation
    systems do not protect the plants and crops from harsh weather conditions. The
    conventional periodic watering methods still dominate the farming landscape, leading
    to wastage of the valuable resource like water and exposing plants to harsh weather
    conditions. To address this problem, this proposed method aims to implement an
    analysis of the field based on factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture content. The proposed work also follows Precision Irrigation system where
    plants are grown only under monitored conditions with grow lights. The grow lights
    are high power LEDs which produces light with appropriate wavelength which is
    suitable for plant''s growth. This work aims to address the challenges facing
    modern agriculture by utilizing smart technologies to optimize water usage and
    improve crop yields. By monitoring key environmental factors like temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content, the system ensures that plants receive the
    right amount of water and nutrients to thrive. Additionally, plants are protected
    even in harsh weather conditions due to artificial farming. Additionally, by using
    high-power LED grow lights that mimic natural sunlight, can provide plants with
    the ideal spectrum and intensity of light for their growth and development. By
    combining these innovative technologies, this work contributes to the ongoing
    efforts to make agriculture more sustainable and efficient for farmers and communities
    around the world. The ease of use of the technique proposed by this study is followed:
    Automated process: The system follows automated process for farming ranging from
    measuring the necessary parameters to irrigation of the plants. It allows users
    to easily interact with the system, view the parameters of the plants, and irrigation
    is done as and when required. This can help reduce the manual intervention and
    automate the irrigation process. Real-time performance: The system should be designed
    to achieve real-time performance, so that it can irrigate the plants as when needed
    in real time. This can help farmers to grow crops efficiently without the wastage
    of resources and also improves the efficiency of the plant''s growth. High accuracy:
    The system should be designed to achieve high accuracy and robustness under varying
    conditions, so that users can rely on the system to make accurate farming and
    monitoring. This can help to reduce the wastage of resources like water and improve
    the growth process of plants. LoRa Integration with artificial farming: The Precision
    Irrigation is designed to integrate with LoRa based farming system, so that the
    farming process is not only automated but also increases its efficiency through
    artificial grow lights. This can help to improve the method of farming, its monitoring
    and plant''s growth. By considering these factors, a system for LoRa based Precision
    Irrigation and monitoring can be designed to be easy to use, efficient, and effective
    for improving the farming method as well as the growth of the plants. This introduction
    briefly describes the research question and its importance. To further contextualize
    the topic, let us turn to a literature review, followed by methodology and system
    architecture, experimental design, experimental results, conclusions, future improvements,
    and references. SECTION II. Literature Survey The LoRa-based wireless smart irrigation
    system that aims to improve water usage efficiency in agriculture. The system
    utilizes LoRa technology for communication between the nodes, which provides a
    long-range, low-power, and low-cost communication solution. The authors developed
    a prototype that integrates sensors for measuring soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity, and a water pump for irrigation. The system is designed to operate
    autonomously and allows for remote monitoring and control through a web interface.
    The proposed system is an improvement on traditional irrigation systems that are
    often inefficient and consume large amounts of water. By using sensor data to
    provide precise and targeted irrigation, the system reduces water consumption
    while maintaining plant health. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of
    their system through experimental testing and reported significant water savings.
    Although the system provides an efficient solution for irrigation, it lacks the
    ability to control other environmental factors that affect plant growth, such
    as light. In contrast, this study incorporates the use of grow lights that can
    be controlled to provide artificial light conditions to plants, enabling year-round
    indoor farming and increased crop yield. Additionally, the system includes precision
    irrigation that not only saves water but also provides targeted fertilization
    to optimize plant growth. These unique features make this study a valuable contribution
    to the field of precision agriculture. [1] The study presents the design and development
    of a low-cost smart irrigation system using an Arduino microcontroller and a soil
    moisture sensor. The system is equipped with a water pump that is controlled by
    the microcontroller based on the readings from the soil moisture sensor. The authors
    also developed a mobile application that allows farmers to remotely monitor and
    control the irrigation process. The study highlights the advantages of using IoT-based
    smart irrigation systems, such as the ability to reduce water wastage, increase
    crop yield, and reduce labor costs. The authors conducted experiments to evaluate
    the system''s performance in terms of water consumption and crop yield. The results
    showed that the system was effective in reducing water consumption and improving
    crop yield. Overall, the study provides an insightful overview of the development
    and implementation of a smart irrigation system for precision farming. However,
    the study does not discuss any specific features that supports or protects the
    growth of plants which was implemented in the proposed system. [2] The research
    study titled “A Feasible IoT-Based System for Precision Agriculture” presents
    a feasible IoT-based system for precision agriculture. The authors discuss the
    current challenges in precision agriculture such as the lack of real-time monitoring
    and decision-making systems. The proposed system uses various sensors to monitor
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. The
    data is then transmitted to a cloud-based platform for storage and analysis. The
    system also includes a mobile application for farmers to access real-time information
    and make informed decisions. The authors provide experimental results that demonstrate
    the effectiveness of the proposed system. The study contributes to the field of
    precision agriculture by providing a feasible IoT-based solution that can help
    farmers improve crop yield and reduce resource usage. [3] The proposed study “Sensors
    and Communication Protocols for Precision Agriculture” by Nelson José Chapungo
    and Octavian Postolache presents an overview of the state-of-the-art in sensors
    and communication protocols used in precision agriculture. The authors begin by
    describing the main challenges faced in modern agriculture, including the need
    to increase productivity while minimizing the impact on the environment. The authors
    then present a comprehensive review of the different types of sensors used in
    precision agriculture, including soil moisture, temperature, and pH sensors, as
    well as crop growth and health sensors. The authors also discuss different wireless
    communication protocols, such as ZigBee and LoRa, that can be used to transmit
    sensor data in real-time. [4] In this study, the authors present a study on IoT-enabled
    intelligent irrigation systems for precision agriculture using deep learning neural
    networks. The proposed system is designed to monitor and control the irrigation
    process based on the soil moisture level and weather conditions. The authors propose
    a two-layer neural network model for predicting the optimal irrigation time and
    duration. The system includes various sensors for monitoring the soil moisture
    level, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. The authors also
    propose a cloud-based IoT platform for real-time data processing and analysis.
    The proposed system is expected to reduce water consumption and increase crop
    yield, making it an efficient and cost-effective solution for precision agriculture.
    The study demonstrates the potential of deep learning neural networks in improving
    the accuracy and efficiency of precision agriculture systems. [5] This research
    study presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture that uses low-power
    wide area network technology for high-tech agriculture. By leveraging this WSN,
    farmers can collect essential data related to soil moisture, air temperature,
    and humidity. The WSN comprises two wireless sensor nodes, a gateway, a cloud
    server, and a smartphone app. The researchers evaluated data transmission in two
    different zones, namely zone 1 at a distance of 500m and zone 2 (urban environments
    with fewer barriers) at a distance of 1,500m and 1,700m. The system collects and
    updates the data every 15 minutes, providing farmers with real-time information
    throughout the day. According to the findings, the LoRa server received data updates
    continuously, and no data packet loss was observed in the WSN system. Moreover,
    the researchers examined the power consumption of sensor nodes and gateways in
    transmitting, receiving, and turning off modes, showcasing the benefits of LoRa
    technology in creating wireless sensor networks. The long transmission range and
    low power requirements of LoRa technology make it a promising solution for the
    agriculture industry. [6] In this study, the system is built on a LoRaWAn network,
    which enables long-distance and low-power data transfer from sensor nodes to cloud
    services. The cloud service system uses data streams for analytics, making it
    extremely scalable. The proposed system has been demonstrated in a case study
    involving a grape farm, where early findings were presented. By using this system,
    farmers can easily monitor environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture to ensure optimal crop growth. This allows them to make informed
    decisions and adjustments, leading to higher crop yields and reduced resource
    waste. Furthermore, the scalability and flexibility of the proposed system make
    it suitable for implementation in various agricultural settings, paving the way
    for more efficient and sustainable agriculture practices in the future. [7] This
    study proposed an intelligent agriculture service platform using LoRa-based wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs). The proposed platform aims to provide real-time monitoring
    of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light
    intensity to help farmers make informed decisions for crop management. The system
    is composed of two main components: the wireless sensor nodes and the server.
    The wireless sensor nodes use LoRaWAn technology to transmit data to the server,
    where the data is processed and analyzed. The proposed platform also includes
    a mobile application that allows farmers to remotely access and monitor the data
    collected by the sensors. The authors conducted experiments to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed system and showed that it provides accurate and timely information
    to farmers, thus enabling them to take proactive measures for crop management.
    [8] This study proposes an automatic plant irrigation system using the Arduino
    microcontroller. The system comprises a soil moisture sensor that detects the
    moisture level in the soil and triggers the irrigation process accordingly. The
    Arduino microcontroller receives data from the sensor and activates the water
    pump to irrigate the plants. The system is designed to operate at specific time
    intervals, allowing for controlled irrigation of the plants. The authors conducted
    experiments to test the system''s performance under different soil moisture conditions
    and evaluated the system''s effectiveness in maintaining appropriate moisture
    levels in the soil. The findings demonstrated that the proposed system is efficient,
    cost-effective, and can be easily implemented to automate plant irrigation processes.
    The system is particularly useful in areas where water is scarce or expensive,
    enabling farmers to use water resources more efficiently and increase crop yield.
    This study highlights the potential of using low-cost microcontrollers, such as
    the Arduino, in developing automated plant irrigation systems for precision agriculture.
    [9] In this study, the system is designed to monitor the moisture level of the
    soil and activate the irrigation process when the moisture level falls below a
    certain threshold. The system is composed of a moisture sensor, a microcontroller,
    a motor pump, and a water tank. The moisture sensor is used to measure the moisture
    level of the soil, and the microcontroller is used to control the irrigation process
    based on the moisture level readings. The motor pump is used to draw water from
    the water tank and irrigate the plants. This system is highly efficient and it
    eliminates the need for manual irrigation. The authors have tested the system
    and demonstrated its effectiveness in ensuring proper plant growth and development.
    Overall, this proposed study provides a valuable contribution to the field of
    automatic plant irrigation systems and presents a practical solution for efficient
    plant irrigation. [10] As part of the precision farming movement, the usage of
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs)in farming has gained prominence. Every farm in
    the future will have many WSN systems installed. For farming to be more efficient
    and sustainable, accurate and timely analysis of the data provided by these technologies
    will become essential. Analyzing monitoring data is typically done remotely since
    it is seen to be outside the scope of WSNs. However, the complexity of the activities
    carried out by WSNs has been steadily rising in recent years. Modern wireless
    sensors have enough processing power to provide some data analytics functions.
    The authors of this study examine the difficulties and possible advantages of
    WSN-based analytics in the context of precision farming while providing an overview
    of contemporary WSN functionality that includes a certain amount of intelligence.
    [11] This study describes about the active process of smart agriculture aids farmers
    in obtaining an overall yield. The yield depends on a variety of conditions, including
    soil moisture and humidity, temperature, and carbon monoxide in the top layer
    of the soil. This initiative is being carried out to assist farmers in boosting
    the output and profit. The node where the LoRa module and Arduino are located
    receives the measured values from the sensors, such as temperature, moisture,
    carbon, and others, and passes them on. These data are used whenever necessary
    and saved in the cloud. A water pump is simultaneously linked, and depending on
    the crop, the water is pushed using monitored values. The amount of CO in the
    soil''s top layer is the key determinant of how much water can be pumped. If there
    is an excess, the water overflows and removes the CO that is unnecessary on the
    soil''s top layer. In parallel, soil testing facilities use the measured data
    that are saved in the cloud to help farmers with their problems. This helps farmers
    achieve high yields and profits by reducing water consumption by around 50%. [12]
    This study presents the impact of climate change on the irrigation. The earth''s
    resources, particularly water, which is essential to life as it is known, are
    seriously impacted by climate change. Natural resource depletion, biodiversity
    loss, and biosphere changes are all detrimental to human health and quality of
    life. India will likely suffer warming that is greater than the world average
    during the twenty-first century. A greater seasonal variance in temperature will
    also start to affect, with winters warming up more than summers. With rising nighttime
    temperatures and hotter days in recent years, heat waves have lasted longer, and
    this tendency is predicted to continue. These heat waves will cause the summer
    monsoon precipitation to be more variable, which will have a significant impact
    on India''s agriculture industry. Global temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2)
    concentration are expected to gradually increase, according to climate models.
    However, these models struggle to accurately anticipate how the local weather
    will evolve in the future. As long as plant diseases can be managed, local meteorological
    factors like rain, temperature, sunlight, and wind, along with regionally appropriate
    plant types, cropping patterns, and soil conditions, can enhance food production.
    [13] This study proposes a wireless drip irrigation system that is based on linear
    programming to determine the optimal water quantity to be supplied to the plants.
    The system is equipped with sensors that measure the soil moisture content and
    temperature, which are then used to determine the water requirement of the plants.
    The system is designed to provide the required amount of water to the plants while
    minimizing water waste. The authors have used linear programming to optimize the
    irrigation process, which ensures that the plants receive the required amount
    of water while reducing water usage. The proposed system is an improvement over
    the traditional drip irrigation systems, which require manual intervention and
    do not provide real-time feedback. The authors have also tested the system in
    a real-world scenario and have reported positive results. However, this system
    does not have the capability of adjusting the light intensity for the plants,
    which is a unique feature of the proposed smart irrigation system. [14] The research
    study presents an innovative wireless sensor network (WSN) based irrigation system.
    The authors address the issues with traditional irrigation methods such as overwatering,
    underwatering, and uneven distribution of water to crops. The researchers propose
    a closed-loop automatic irrigation system that is controlled by a microcontroller.
    The system uses soil moisture sensors to collect data on soil moisture levels
    and determines when to irrigate crops based on these readings. The authors also
    discuss the communication protocol used in the WSN, which enables the system to
    send data to a central control unit for monitoring and control. The system''s
    design is optimized for power consumption, and the authors present experimental
    results showing that the system reduces water consumption while increasing crop
    yield. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the development of WSN-based
    irrigation systems and highlights their potential for improving agricultural practices.
    [15] SECTION III. Methodology and System Architecture LoRa based Precision Irrigation
    and monitoring system involves the use of several components. Here are some brief
    descriptions about them and the system architecture: A. Lora (long Range Radio
    technology) LoRa is a wireless communication protocol that operates in the sub-gigahertz
    frequency range (169 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz, or 915 MHz), offering long-range,
    low-power communication suitable for IoT applications. It operates in the unlicensed
    radio frequency bands and offers a long-range of communication up to several kilometers,
    making it ideal for IoT applications. LoRa technology provides a highly reliable
    and secure communication network that can be used for remote monitoring and control
    of various devices, including sensors, actuators, and other IoT devices. It uses
    a spread spectrum modulation technique to enable low-power, long-range communication,
    making it an ideal choice for low-power IoT devices. LoRa uses a star topology
    network architecture, where one central device (gateway) communicates with multiple
    end devices (nodes) over the air. LoRa devices can transmit data at various data
    rates ranging from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, depending on the range and data payload
    requirements. LoRaWAN, which is a protocol built on top of LoRa, provides additional
    features such as encryption, authentication, and network management, making it
    suitable for large-scale IoT deployments. B. Nodemcu The NodeMCU is a powerful
    and versatile microcontroller board that is designed for Internet of Things (IoT)
    applications. It is based on the ESP8266 system-on-a-chip (SoC) and comes with
    built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, making it an ideal choice for IoT applications that
    require wireless connectivity. The NodeMCU board features a 32-bit RISC processor,
    which runs at speeds of up to 80 MHz, and is capable of handling complex tasks
    such as networking and data processing. It also comes with a variety of input/output
    (I/O) pins, including digital input/output (GPIO) pins, analog-to-digital converter
    (ADC) pins, and pulse-width modulation (PWM) pins, making it easy to interface
    with various sensors and actuators. The NodeMCU board can be programmed using
    the Arduino IDE, which provides an easy-to-use development environment for building
    IoT applications. Additionally, the NodeMCU board supports Lua scripting language,
    which allows for easy integration with cloud-based services and platforms. Overall,
    the NodeMCU board is a powerful and versatile platform that is well-suited for
    a wide range of IoT applications. C. Moisture Sensor A moisture sensor, also known
    as a soil moisture sensor, is an electronic device that measures the amount of
    water content in the soil. It is a crucial component of many agricultural and
    horticultural applications, including irrigation systems, plant growth monitoring
    systems, and hydroponics setups. The sensor works by measuring the electrical
    conductivity between two or more probes inserted into the soil. When the soil
    is dry, it has a high resistance to electrical current, whereas when it is wet,
    the resistance decreases. The sensor provides an analog or digital output that
    can be used to determine the soil moisture level and control the irrigation system
    or other related devices. The accuracy and reliability of the sensor are essential
    for proper plant growth and water management. Proper calibration and maintenance
    of the sensor are also necessary to ensure accurate and consistent readings over
    time. D. DHT11 (Digital Humidity and Temperature) Sensor The DHT11 sensor is a
    low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor that is widely used in various
    applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is a single-wire
    sensor that communicates through a digital signal and provides accurate temperature
    and humidity measurements. The sensor has a range of -20 to 60°C for temperature
    measurement with an accuracy of ±2°C, and a humidity range of 20% to 90% with
    an accuracy of ±5%. It operates at a voltage of 3-5V DC and consumes very low
    power, making it ideal for battery-powered applications. The DHT11 sensor is widely
    available and easy to use, making it a popular choice for DIY electronics projects
    and IoT applications. E. Water Pump A water pump is an electronic device that
    is commonly used in IoT projects for transferring water from one place to another.
    The 5V DC water pump is a type of water pump that is designed to be compatible
    with low voltage systems such as those used in IoT projects. This type of pump
    typically operates at a low voltage and consumes minimal power, making it an ideal
    choice for use in low-power applications. The water pump typically contains a
    small motor that rotates an impeller, which creates a flow of water through the
    pump. The flow rate and pressure of the water can be adjusted based on the specific
    requirements of the application. The 5V DC water pump is commonly used in smart
    irrigation systems, aquaponics, and hydroponics projects to circulate water and
    deliver nutrients to plants. F. Grow Lights Grow lights, also known as high power
    LEDs, are a critical component for indoor plant growth in controlled environments.
    These lights emit a spectrum of light that is tailored to support plant growth,
    making them an essential tool for indoor gardening, hydroponic systems, and other
    applications where natural light is not available or inadequate. High power LEDs
    are known for their efficiency and low energy consumption, making them an ideal
    choice for use in IoT projects. These lights are available in a range of sizes
    and colors, including red, green, blue, and pink, which can be mixed to create
    a custom spectrum of light. Grow lights are typically used in conjunction with
    other sensors and devices to create a complete indoor plant growth system. In
    addition to supporting plant growth, these systems can also be used to control
    the timing and intensity of light exposure, allowing for precise control over
    plant growth cycles. G. Thingspeak ThingSpeak is an open-source IoT analytics
    platform that allows users to collect, store, analyze, visualize, and act on data
    from various IoT devices. It offers a highly scalable and flexible cloud infrastructure
    for IoT data management, making it an ideal choice for IoT applications. With
    ThingSpeak, users can easily create IoT applications and dashboards to monitor
    and control various IoT devices. It supports various communication protocols,
    including HTTP, HTTPS, MQTT, and TCP, making it compatible with a wide range of
    IoT devices. ThingSpeak also provides various APIs and tools for data analysis
    and visualization, allowing users to gain insights from their IoT data. The system
    architecture for LoRa based Precision Irrigation and Monitoring system can be
    divided into two nodes and several phases The LoRa based Precision Irrigation
    and monitoring system makes use of the sensors such as the soil moisture sensor,
    DHT11 sensor for measuring the necessary parameters for irrigating plants. The
    LoRa is responsible for the transmission of data from one node to another. The
    NodeMCU processes the parameters and decides if the condition is suitable for
    irrigation. So, when plants need water the NodeMCU on the sprinkler node sprinkles
    the water and it turns on the grow light when needed. Therefore, the farming system
    is fully automated and improves the growth efficiency of the plants. Fig 1: Transmitter
    node Show All Fig 2: Receiver node Show All The explanation of block diagram is
    followed Monitoring phase: The first phase involves monitoring the plant parameters
    such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, etc. Various sensors are used such
    as the Moisture sensor for measuring the effective moisture present in the soil.
    The DHT11 sensor measures the humidity and temperature. So, the sensor node takes
    care of the monitoring phase where are the necessary plant parameters are measured
    for accurate monitoring and farming. Transmission phase: In this phase, the parameters
    that are measured in the sensor node are processed on the NodeMCU and are transmitted
    using LoRa module present in the sensor node. The LoRa module which present in
    the sprinkler node receives these measurements and parameters of plants. The NodeMCU
    in the sprinkler node is now responsible for sprinkling water and lighting based
    on the received parameters of the plant. Irrigation phase: In this phase, the
    NodeMCU present in the sprinkler node looks into the parameters of the plant and
    it decides whether the condition to water the plants is attained or not. Therefore,
    based on the program, the NodeMCU checks on to the parameters and it waters the
    plants using the sprinkler and turns on the grow light as and when required. This
    automates the process of irrigation and also leads to artificial farming. Analyzing
    phase: In this phase, the growth progress of the plants is noted. Based on the
    measurements such plant''s height, enlargement of plant leaves, the plant''s growth
    is measured using various sensors. All the parameters, measurements, growth progress
    are displayed into the system through which the growth progress of the plants
    can be monitored. The experimental setup of LoRa based Precision Irrigation and
    Monitoring system consists of two nodes. These nodes are: SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup Transmitter node Receiver node The software setup involves the usage of
    following setup: PushingBox PushBullet ThingSpeak First, the range of plants are
    selected for irrigation. Different plants grow on different kind of soil. Therefore,
    a particular type of soil is selected based on the type of plant that is selected.
    Mostly floral crops or plants are used for artificial farming. Therefore, plants
    like Hibiscus, Peace lily, Rose can be grown artificially under grow lights. Then,
    sensors are positioned in the appropriate manner to monitor the plant parameters.
    The soil moisture sensor is dipped in over the soil in order to monitor the effective
    moisture present in the soil. The DHT11 sensor is held in the atmosphere near
    the plant in order to measure the humidity and temperature. The IR sensor is held
    close to the plant which can be used to detect any changes in the plant such as
    plant height or growth, etc. Once the transmitter node is connected and compiled
    in Arduino IDE. It starts detecting the plant parameters and it waits for the
    receiving end to transmit the collected data. When receiver end is connected and
    compiled to the Arduino IDE, the LoRa on the transmitter side transmits the data
    that is stored in the NodeMCU to the LoRa on the receiver side. NodeMCU 8266 was
    used for its built-in Wi-Fi module and GPIO pins that can be programmed for input/output
    operations and other functionalities. It acts as a receiver module to control
    the sensors, water pump, and grow lights in the LoRa-based farming system project.
    The received data is processed and analyzed to determine the optimal time to water
    the field and the NodeMCU board controls the water pump and artificial grow lights
    accordingly. The sensor data is transferred to ThingSpeak IoT Cloud platform for
    remote monitoring and analysis. When the data is received in the NodeMCU of the
    receiver side, the controller looks into the parameters and check the condition
    for irrigation and artificial lights. The Artificial grow lights are held facing
    the plants. And water pipe is held near the surface of the soil. When the condition
    is very dry, the pump is turned on and the grow lights are turned on with maximum
    intensity. The process is continued based on the plant''s requirements. And the
    water pump and lights are turned off when the plant is sufficiently irrigated.
    The NodeMCU on the receiver end reads the sensor data and sends it to the LoRa
    transceiver. The LoRa transceiver transmits the data wirelessly to the LoRa transceiver
    on the transmitter end. The NodeMCU on the transmitter end receives the sensor
    data and sends it to the ThingSpeak IoT Cloud platform using the ThingSpeak library
    in Arduino IDE. The ThingSpeak platform receives the data and stores it in a channel,
    which is essentially a TSDB database called Time-Series Database. Each channel
    has a unique ID and can store up to 8 fields of data. The stored data can be accessed
    through the ThingSpeak website or mobile app, where it is displayed in a graphical
    format. Users can view real-time and historical data and set up alerts based on
    specific conditions. The PushingBox API is used to enable push notifications for
    the ThingSpeak channel. Pushbullet app is used in both PC and mobile to get desktop
    and mobile notification about the plant''s growth or changes. This allows users
    to receive alerts on their desktop or mobile devices when specific conditions
    are met, such as when the soil moisture drops below a certain threshold. In summary,
    the sensor data is transmitted wirelessly from the field to the ThingSpeak IoT
    Cloud platform, where it is stored and displayed in a graphical format. Push notifications
    can be set up to alert users when specific conditions are met, allowing for remote
    monitoring of the field in real-time. Therefore, this experimental setup helps
    to automate the irrigation process, improves plant''s growth through artificial
    grow lights and monitors the plant parameters in real-time. SECTION V. Experimental
    Result In this proposed study, the measurement of plant parameters and changes
    in the plant''s growth are shown. In this, an IoT Cloud platform called ThingSpeak
    is used for storing and analysis of plant data. These are real-time data which
    helps to monitor the plant in live and the user can keep track of the plant''s
    growth and parameters. The below-mentioned picture shows the sample output of
    the real-time parameters. Fig 3: Measurement of plant parameters Show All Fig
    4: Real-time Monitoring of parameters in ThingSpeak Show All The above figures
    are ThingSpeak output shown in graphical representation of the data collected
    from the moisture sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, and growth changes
    of plants. The x-axis of each graph shows the timestamp when the data was recorded,
    and the y-axis shows the corresponding values of the sensors. The graphs provide
    an easy-to-understand visualization of the data, making it simple to track the
    plant''s growth and environmental conditions over time. The first graph shows
    the moisture level of the soil in which the plant is growing. It shows how the
    moisture level changes with time, which can help to determine whether the plant
    is receiving adequate water or not. If the moisture level is consistently low,
    it may indicate that the plant is not receiving enough water. The second graph
    shows the temperature readings from the temperature sensor. This can help to monitor
    the temperature conditions of the plant''s surroundings. If the temperature is
    consistently too high or too low, it may indicate that the plant is not in an
    ideal environment for growth. The third graph shows the humidity levels of the
    plant''s surroundings. This is important to monitor as it can affect the growth
    of the plant. If the humidity is consistently too low or too high, it may indicate
    that the plant is not in an optimal environment. Finally, the last graph shows
    the growth changes of the plant. This can provide insight into how the plant is
    responding to the conditions in which it is growing. By monitoring the growth
    of the plant over time, it can help to determine whether the environmental conditions
    are ideal or need to be adjusted. Overall, the ThingSpeak output in graphical
    format is an important tool to monitor the environmental conditions of the plant
    and track its growth progress over time. Some advantages are. Effective irrigation:
    The whole process of farming in the LoRa based Precision Irrigation and monitoring
    system is automated with the usage of sensors where plant''s parameters such as
    moisture, temperature, humidity, etc. are monitored. And based on the needs of
    the plants the resources like water and light are provided by the sprinkler node.
    This leads to effective irrigation because, there is no need for any manual intervention
    for the irrigation process and the plant is grown under favorable conditions artificially.
    Reduces the wastage of resources: Since, all the necessary parameters of the plants
    are measured, the lora system provides adequate amount of water and light as needed
    by the plants. This saves the water for future which can be used for further irrigation
    as needed by the plant. Automated system: System uses sensors for measuring the
    plant parameters and there is a separate sprinkler node which waters and light
    the plants based on the measured parameters. Therefore, there is no manual intervention
    needed for monitoring and farming the plants. The whole system is automated through
    sensors, sprinklers and grow lights. Therefore, this reduces the labour cost which
    is cost effective. Accuracy: The sensors such as the soil moisture sensor, DHT11
    sensor gives the accurate measurements of effective moisture present in the soil,
    humidity, and the temperature of the plants. This helps to properly irrigate plants
    based on the measured parameters which leads to efficient farming method. Also,
    this helps to monitor the growth progress of the plants. Wide range and coverage:
    Since, LoRa is a long-range radio communication technology. Thus, the system can
    work over wide range such as over 10 Km of distance and provides a seamless connectivity.
    Therefore, the system could work automatically for large scale farming without
    manual intervention. Increased efficiency through grow lights: The grow lights
    are the artificial electric lights which resembles the light spectrum of sunlight.
    But it is more effective than the natural sunlight for the photosynthesis process.
    The photoperiod necessary for the plant''s growth cycle is regulated. Depending
    on the type of plant, different spectrum ranges, luminous efficacy, and color
    temperatures are preferred to achieve optimal growth and yield. Using the LoRa
    based Precision Irrigation and monitoring system the user or farmer can easily
    do farming without any manual intervention, because the whole system is automated
    from monitoring to Precision Irrigation of plants. Therefore, the system doesn''t
    only focus on irrigation but also increases the growth efficiency of the plants
    SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Enhancement The LoRa based Precision Irrigation
    and monitoring system have two significant applications of technology in the field
    of farming and agriculture. The LoRa based farming system is used to monitor the
    parameters of the plants such as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, etc. using
    various sensors. The LoRa module is used to transmit the monitored data or parameters
    to the sprinkler nodes. The ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller guides the sensor
    and sprinkler node. When NodeMCU monitors the parameters and determines whether
    the plant needs water or not. When there is a need the NodeMCU on the sprinkler
    node turns on the water grow light as needed by the plants. This automates the
    process of irrigation and also monitors the growth of the plant. The Precision
    Irrigation system makes sure grow lights which are artificial electric lights
    that is comparable to the natural sunlight. However, the light from the grow light
    is more efficient in inducing the photosynthesis process faster than natural sunlight.
    This is because, the photoperiod necessary for the plant''s growth cycle is regulated.
    Depending on the type of plant, different spectrum ranges, luminous efficacy,
    and color temperatures are preferred to achieve optimal growth and yield. Therefore,
    the system not only automates the irrigation process but also improves the growth
    efficiency of the plants. Therefore, the proposed IoT-based smart grow light irrigation
    system provides an efficient solution to indoor gardening, ensuring healthy plant
    growth by providing optimal lighting conditions. The system incorporates NodeMCU
    that integrates with various sensors and a cloud platform to monitor and control
    the lighting and environmental parameters of the plants. The system has been tested
    and evaluated, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in
    providing optimal growth conditions for the plants. Thus, the LoRa based Precision
    Irrigation and monitoring system are significant technological advancements in
    the field of farming that could greatly enhance the quality of life. The future
    enhancements are as follow: Increased accuracy: This systems'' accuracy is a major
    area for development. Additional sensors can be used to monitor the external factors
    for the agricultural fields in order to avoid any discrepancy or deterioration
    in the measurement of parameters. This will improve the reading and measurement
    of plant parameters which can result in accurate data that can be used for proper
    irrigation of the plants. Increased compatibility: The proposed system can be
    extended to support more plant species and optimized lighting conditions for each
    plant type. The integration of more advanced sensors and algorithms can improve
    the efficiency of the system and further automate the process of plant growth
    monitoring and control. The system can also be integrated with other smart home
    devices, providing a complete smart home gardening solution. Additionally, the
    system''s cloud platform can be enhanced to provide more comprehensive data analytics
    and insights for better decision-making in indoor gardening. Integration with
    Agri-bots: Agri-bots are IoT robots that are used for agriculture. The whole process
    of agriculture can be automated, ranging from seeding the plants, weeding unwanted
    pests from the plants, irrigating, watering, harvesting, and monitoring the crops,
    etc. This might make the project expensive but it will be helpful for the large-scale
    farming where the process must be fully automated. Anomaly detection: This feature
    will be helpful when there occurs any anomaly in the agricultural fields. Such
    as sometimes the crops might be destroyed by animals such as cattle, and insects
    like bees, wasps might affect the plant''s growth. Therefore, any anomaly in the
    process of the agriculture is intimated to the farmers so that they can investigate
    it. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Gsm based solar

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Gharuan, India SECTION I. Introduction Hydroponics
    is a type of cultivation in which plants were grown on nutrient solution also
    known as organic solution thus use of soil can be eliminated. Plants will be cultivated
    in a vertically shaped pipe utilising hydroponics and also aquaponics technologies
    in the system, which is a smart vertical farm. Throughout the system, IoT enabled
    sensors are used to continuously monitor the temperature and humidity of the plants.
    Plants will be cultivated utilizing hydroponics in vertical pipe arrangement.
    Using a DHT11 sensor, the temperature and moisture content in the setup are regularly
    monitored and fed to the NodeMCU microcontroller. The quantity of nutrients present
    in the container is measured using ultrasonic sensors. A fertilizer dosing system
    is also developed, LED and photodiode are used to detect the presence of algae.
    The coming generations can make use of hydroponics techniques with the use of
    nutrients and water by eliminating the presence of the soil. No harm is done to
    the environment or crop quality by this system. The main objective is growing
    crops to protect land, improve crop quality also eliminate the overuse of pesticides
    and boost crop efficiency. SECTION II Related Works The most cutting-edge agriculture
    practices in the industry are hydroponic and aquaponic farming. No soil generated
    infection, reduced insect disease and pathogens use in the monitoring system lower
    the toxicity, and hydroponically produced crops are grown in less time than conventionally
    grown crops. Finally, only plants get access to the nutrients [1]. An Internet
    of Things (IoT) link was created to enhance dependability. Remote sensing and
    control are made possible. Data analysis was done using the Domoitcz tool. A system
    can be used to monitor the water and greenhouse environments as well as the outdoor
    environment for breeding purposes using wireless sensor networking and distributed
    sensor monitoring [3]. A smart hydroponic system has been made intelligent by
    using the Random Forest algorithm to assist in identifying the environmental parameter
    that should be controlled depending on priority. One crucial aspect of the suggested
    system is its capacity to control nutrient content [4]. Big data analytics, determine
    which plants, vegetables, and fruits will be grown based on the climate. [5].
    An automated IoT-based soilless plant system is created using deep neural networking.
    5000 real-time data sets were gathered from the system about the acidity, temperature,
    moisture, intensities, and level of water in the hydroponic container where the
    crop is grown [6]. Bayesian network model used to automate the crop-growing process
    in hydroponic farms enhance the farm’s characteristics, including intensity of
    light, acidity, electrical conductivity, temperature, and moisture, which are
    monitored and controlled by sensors and actuators [7]. An innovative, bilingual,
    fuzzy logic-controlled, Internet of Things based software application for plant
    production in hydroponics system deals with the issue of global warming. As a
    result, growing crops in a greenhouse while managing numerous crucial elements
    with handheld IoT devices will result in higher yields at lower costs [8]. Various
    barley genotypes were grown in hydroponic chamber to assess impact of Endophytic
    T Harzanium. Air circulation was employed to maintain the ideal temperature and
    humidity for the purpose of barley grain sprouting. Fluorescent lighting tubes
    were also a part of the lighting system, and they were positioned both vertically
    and horizontally [9]. A versatile platform capable of handling the requirements
    of cultivation within greenhouses with complete recirculation and controlled saltiness
    developed with ultraviolet therapy of disinfection mechanism to remove microbial
    content and hence minimize the appearance of diseases [10]. SECTION III. Proposed
    Hydroponic Methodology A. Block Diagram Figure 1. Schematic diagram for hydroponic
    system using IoT Show All The flow of data in the hydroponics hardware system
    is shown in the schematic diagram of hydroponic system. (figure 1). Node MCU controls
    all components in hydroponic system. The temperature and moisture content (humidity)
    is measured via DHT11 sensors. Ultrasonic sensors were used for evaluating the
    level of nutrient solution in the container. The presence of algae in the hydroponic
    solution was detected using LDR by passing light from coloured LEDs (red, blue,
    green, amber) through the solution. The data collected from ultrasonic sensor
    determines when to switch on the motor pump that supplies nutrient solution into
    the container. When the presence of algae is detected, another motor pump is used
    to spill out the solution from the container and supply it with fresh nutrient
    rich solution automatically in the absence of a farmer. The data assembled from
    the sensors are sent to the ThingSpeak server application for remote analysis
    of the condition of the crops by the farmers. This helps in the effective surveillance
    and yield enhancement of plants. B. Flow Chart Figure 2: Flow chart of the hydroponic
    system Show All Figure 2 illustrates the entire system flowchart. Firstly, the
    system gathers the data from sensors (DHT11, Ultrasonic, LDR) into Node MCU. The
    data collected by the microcontroller is sent to the ThingSpeak server application.
    The ideal level of nutrient solution was set as 3 cm as per the experimental requirement.
    The microcontroller activates the motor pump to work in order to refill the container
    with nutrient solution to the appropriate levels if the level of the solution
    falls below the set-point. When algae are identified in the solution, the pump
    activates to clear out the present solution and refill it with new nutrient compound.
    A. Experimental Setup for a spinach hydroponic system The experimental setup is
    illustrated in figure 3. A hydroponic setup was created using a plastic bottle
    with one cup holder with holes at bottom layer inserted within. Sponge and straw
    were used to form a base layer inside the cup. Nutrient compound was filled such
    that it touches the sponge layer. In this study, spinach was cultivated in the
    hydroponic setup. The sample of the solution was pumped into a test tube placed
    inside a cardboard box. LDR and LED were attached on opposite sides of the box
    to find the presence of cyanobacteria. Figure 3: Hydroponic prototype for Spinach
    Show All SECTION IV. Results and Discussion The ideal values of parameters needed
    for healthy growth of plants in a hydroponic setup is tabulated as above in table
    1. Feasible temperature range is found out to be 28 to 30-degree Celsius. Similarly,
    the humidity necessary for efficient plant growth obtained was around 40 to 60
    percentage. Table 1 Data Aggregation From Iot Enabled Sensors In this study, the
    exact nutrient level required is 3cm. The voltage level of different LEDs (Green,
    Blue, Red) detected by the light dependent resistor was acquired between 4 to
    4.8V indicating the absence of algae in the solution. The hydroponic farming technique
    adopted in this activity was able to strengthen the sprout within a period of
    1 week in which the experiment was carried out. Figure 4: Observed temperature
    variation in cloud platform Show All Figure 5: Observed humidity variation in
    cloud platform Show All Figure 4 and 5 show the temperature and humidity values
    recorded in real time in ThingSpeak server. The experiment was carried out for
    a week and the data was uploaded to the server. Figure 6: Real-time sensor values
    from the hydroponic setup Show All Arduino IDE was used as a compiler tool for
    integrating all the sensors with Node MCU, thus enabling to monitor the data acquired
    from sensors in real time. SECTION V. Conclusion The concept of hydroponic farming
    is well-established nowadays. Large-scale development and results from numerous
    nations across the world have demonstrated the feasibility and significant advantages
    this technology has over traditional crop growing techniques. In locations where
    gardening is not viable, soilless culture and vertical hydroponics can be used.
    Thus, it is not just a sound strategy, but also one that has greatly benefited
    humanity. People without a plot of land can indeed develop a tiny garden kitchen
    indoors using hydroponics. However, there are situations when the conditions required
    for growth may not be adequate, in which case it is necessary to inform users
    of the requirements. Additionally, due to their busy schedules, they won’t be
    available at home, therefore automatically providing the solution will be more
    practical for them. Particularly, we can observe that due to nutrient deficiency
    in the soil, not all crops will thrive everywhere. In these situations, hydroponics
    ought to be a preferable choice to provide the plant with the necessary minerals.
    Thus, people can consume fresh fruits and vegetables. SECTION VI. Future Work
    By including various nutrients and pH levels, more diverse varieties of vegetables
    can be cultivated in addition to green leafy ones. As a future work, the functionality
    of the system can be enhanced by creating a mobile application using which the
    farmers can schedule the supply of nutrients, detection of algae (once or twice
    a week) etc. The application can also include the general maintenance characteristics
    and safety measures of well-known plants that will be recommended in comparison
    to specific parametric values. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Any accomplishment, whether academic

  description: The demand for food is increasing every day because of the growing
    population. However, the proportional growth in the production of crops is not
    happening. This problem can be addressed using information technology in the agricultural
    process. In this paper, an Internet of Things-based (IoT) system has been designed
    and developed to monitor soil health. The chemical and physical properties of
    the soil can be evaluated by measuring different parameters contained in the soil
    such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, moisture, and
    salinity as well as electrical conductivity. Three sensor nodes are developed
    using NodeMCU ESP8266, NPK sensor, EC sensor, soil moisture, and temperature sensor.
    First, the data obtained from the procured sensors have been tested and validated
    in the laboratory by adding different amounts of urea and water. These sensor
    nodes, which are powered by solar, are placed at some desired location in the
    agricultural fields to collect the soil data. All the sensor data are then sent
    to the cloud over a Wi-Fi network using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
    protocol for monitoring, further analysis, and decision-making. The data of the
    soil parameters are stored in a cloud platform, which will allow monitoring of
    the data in graphical and numerical formats. An android application is developed
    for real-time monitoring of the data.

    Quality Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Agricultural practices are closely associated
    with the production of essential crops and are the main source of income for most
    developing countries. Agriculture plays a major role in the economic growth of
    developing countries like India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. A nation’s food
    security is ensured by the agricultural sector. Agriculture is the backbone of
    the country''s economic system, about 70% of the people rely on it. There is a
    high demand for food, but a low supply. In comparison to population growth, agricultural
    production is insufficient. A primary cause of this decrease in agricultural production
    is the use of old conventional methods by farmers. Due to continuous changes in
    the weather, soil conditions, and climatic conditions, and a lack of knowledge
    and technology, it is very difficult for farmers to keep track of all these records,
    analyze, and harvest crops appropriately. To address this problem, an IoT-based
    (Internet of Things) soil health monitoring system is proposed; this will enable
    users to determine the health of the soil to maximize crop productivity. A brief
    background study on sensor-based soil monitoring systems is discussed below. The
    paper [1] presented a system where the data from the soil sensors are delivered
    to the MCP3204 ADC (Analog-to-digital converter), which then sends it to the cloud
    through Raspberry Pi, and the information may be accessed via mobile phones and
    personal computers (PCs). The study in [2] consists of an electronic device that
    can detect macronutrients using three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a light
    source and one light-dependent resistor (LDR) as a light detector. Light converts
    the remaining light reflected by the reflector into an electric current. The system
    uses a microcontroller to collect the data, so the output of the converter is
    converted to reading on a digital display. The research in paper [3] helps farmers
    to receive suggestions for sulfur and lime based on the pH value of the soil.
    A t-test showed that there was no significant difference between the calculated
    data and the recorded data in the laboratory, confirming the proposed approach,
    and from the proposed system agriculture scientists, farmers, IoT experts and
    agriculture professionals, will be benefited. The proposed system in [4], the
    soil health monitoring unit (SHMU), is photovoltaic and can be installed in the
    field for long periods. Using LoRaWAN wireless technology, each SHMU wirelessly
    sends soil temperature, humidity, conductivity, CO, and geographic location data
    and uses a dashboard to analyze soil health measurements for soil. The research
    in [5] describes a soil sensing methodology that uses a nitrogen phosphorus potassium
    (NPK) testing kit and other traditional methods to measure digitally using a cloud-based
    prognostic technique that helps increase crop output with minimal water and fertilizer
    use. The author of the paper [6] used IoT technology to detect and control devices
    remotely via an access network, allowing numerous physical objects to be directly
    connected to a computer system. They use temperature sensors, pressure sensors,
    and humidity sensors, and Lora is used as a wireless communication system, which
    is a low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technology. The paper [7] attempts to
    introduce an embedded soil monitoring system that measures soil moisture and performs
    automatic irrigation, ambient temperature, and humidity. Use the PHP (Hypertext
    preprocessor) Web site to change the configuration data for watering timing and
    soil water content lower and upper limits, and monitor real-time soil water changes
    in charts. The paper [8] describes a low-cost system that can obtain up-to-date
    information on crop surroundings and farm issues and proposes the best crop needs
    based on data from sensors. The proposed system is an IoT-based crop monitoring
    system using Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) technology. The paper
    [9] presents an overview of various soil sensors used to measure temperature,
    moisture, and humidity. Information from the sensors on the ground is displayed
    in the android app which is very helpful in making cultivation recommendations
    to farmers for better agriculture. The proposed IoT-based soil health monitoring
    system helps to monitor real-time soil moisture content and electrical conductivity
    of the soil water. It detects the nutrient values of the soil like phosphorus,
    nitrogen, and potassium. It is low cost and powered by solar systems. The data
    can be monitored using a smartphone or laptop/desktop. 2 IoT-Based Soil Health
    Monitoring An IoT-based soil health monitoring system has been proposed. This
    helps to monitor various soil parameters and to make appropriate decisions regarding
    the use of the right amount of water and fertilizer. This monitoring system will
    also help to maintain all these soil parameters at their desired level. Some soil
    physicochemical properties, such as water content, temperature, soil nitrogen,
    phosphorus, and potassium levels, have a significant impact on crop yields. The
    proposed system consists primarily of various sensors for monitoring soil conditions
    and NodeMCU ESP8266 for data acquisition and sending it to the cloud for monitoring
    and further analysis. The solar power bank has been used to power the sensor nodes.
    Three sensors track and monitor soil moisture, soil nutrient levels, and soil
    electrical conductivity. The sensors detect the soil parameters data and send
    it to the Thingspeak cloud platform using the MQTT communication protocol. 3 Hardware
    Used It is an IoT-based soil health monitoring system that monitors various soil
    parameters to improve crop yields. Various sensors are used to determine soil
    parameters and monitor soil health. Three sensors are used here: EC sensor, soil
    moisture sensor, and NPK sensor. These sensors are attached to a microcontroller
    NodeMCU ESP8266, and data are sent from the microcontroller to the cloud server
    using the MQTT communication protocol. 3.1 NPK Sensor The soil NPK sensor can
    detect the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. It aids
    in examining soil health quality, enabling a much more systematic assessment of
    soil condition. A Modbus module is required to read the NPK data. The Modbus module
    communicates with the microcontroller and the sensor. 3.2 Electric Conductivity
    Sensor (EC) EC sensor measures the electrical conductivity of a solution. It is
    a low-cost system having a satisfactory high accuracy rate of conductivity of
    electricity. Direct measurement of soil water can be captured in the field using
    EC water conductivity test equipment. A voltage is applied between the electrodes
    by the sensor placed into the soil water sample. The resistance of water is calculated
    from the voltage drop, which is converted to conductivity. Conductivity is inversely
    proportional to resistance and is expressed as the amount of conductance over
    a given area. If the EC value is too low, it indicates that the soil is deficient
    in nutrients, and if the EC value is too high, it indicates that the soil is rich
    in nutrients. 3.3 Soil Moisture Sensor It is normally used to estimate the soil
    water content. This sensor is made up of 2 probes that measure the content of
    the water. If there is more water, it conducts more electricity, resulting in
    much less resistance; as a result, the moisture content is higher and vice-versa.
    Less than 500 is too wet, 500–750 is the target range, and greater than 750 are
    dry enough to be watered. 3.4 Microcontroller (NodeMCU ESP8266) NodeMCU ESP8266
    is an open-source platform that connects devices and enables transferring of data
    using Wi-Fi protocol. It is compatible with Arduino IDE and is very easy to use.
    Multiple sensors are directly connected to it for measuring and monitoring the
    soil health parameters. NodeMCU along with smart sensors measures the quality
    (moisture, nutrition, conductivity) and effectiveness of soil. The controller
    uses sensors to access the monitored information. The measured data will be sent
    and displayed on the cloud platform. This experimental result monitors the soil
    quality in real time. 4 System Architecture The structure, behavior, and viewpoints
    of a system are defined by the system architecture, which is a conceptual model.
    An architecture description is a formal specification and representation of a
    system that is organized in a way that makes thinking about the system''s structures
    and behaviors easier. The block diagrammatic representation of the proposed system
    is given (Fig. 1). The electronics circuit diagram of a sample sensor node is
    given in Fig. 2. The three solar-powered sensor nodes installed in agricultural
    fields are given in Fig. 3. Fig. 1 System block diagram Full size image Fig. 2
    Circuit diagram of the sensor node system Full size image Fig. 3 Connections of
    the three different solar-powered sensor nodes installed at the agricultural field
    Full size image 4.1 Communication Protocol (MQTT) The proposed model uses the
    Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to connect various IoT remote
    devices with the server with minimal network bandwidth. MQTT (in Fig. 4) is an
    Internet of Things communication protocol that has been certified by Organization
    for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). It is designed
    as a very lightweight subscribe/publish messaging transport which is ideal for
    connecting remote devices. Although MQTT is most commonly used with transmission
    control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), it is used with any network protocol
    that enables lossless, ordered, bidirectional communications. A message broker
    and clients are the two sorts of network entities defined by the MQTT protocol.
    The MQTT broker is a server that accepts all messages from clients and forward
    them to the target client. The MQTT client is a device that runs the MQTT library
    and connects to the MQTT broker over the network. MQTT clients use the “Topic”
    subject line instead of the intended recipient''s direct connection address. Anyone
    who subscribes to a topic receives a copy of all messages related to that topic.
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is used by MQTT, and connections are
    protected. The data are collected using sensors connected to a microcontroller
    and transferred to the cloud using the MQTT communication protocol, which will
    be routed through an MQTT broker in real time. The information will be sent to
    a cloud server (ThingSpeak) and can view it all on the PC or mobile device. It
    is important to note that the sensor will continue to communicate new data to
    the cloud server without waiting for a response. The Web server will issue a request
    to retrieve messages/data sent by the sensors. MQTT is ideal in the field of IoT
    since the entire message sending process is an example of asynchronous communication.
    Fig. 4 MQTT protocol Full size image 4.2 Client and Server Interaction The user
    initiates a request, which is then accepted by the cloud server. The server acts
    as a channel between the user''s request and the server''s response. The request
    is then accepted by the server, and the user is given access to the account. The
    user may observe, monitor, and analyze the soil''s many parameters. A block diagram
    representation of the client and server interaction is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5
    Client and server interaction diagram Full size image 5 Monitoring of Data The
    user can remotely monitor the various soil parameters from any remote place by
    using our application “Farmdoc.” It is an android application that is used to
    monitor soil data in real time. This application is built using MIT app inventor.
    The application consists of a splash screen that displays the app name, and a
    homepage where the soil data will be displayed in the form of graphs. The soil
    data are fetched from the cloud server, i.e., the ThingSpeak server, and the application
    shows all the relevant data. It displays various soil parameters like potassium
    content, moisture content, phosphorus content, electrical conductivity, nitrogen
    content, and salinity level of soil in graphical format (in Fig. 7). The flowchart
    of the proposed system is given (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Flowchart of the health monitoring
    system Full size image Fig. 7 Various soil property data displayed in the developed
    application Full size image 6 Results and Discussion In this paper, a soil health
    monitoring system is developed that is used to monitor electrical conductivity,
    nitrogen content, phosphorus content, potassium content, and soil moisture content
    of the soil in the agricultural field. Three different sensors are used to monitor
    these parameters. At first, these sensors are calibrated and validated in a laboratory
    setup to test the variation in the sensor’s reading with changes in soil condition.
    One of the most important parameters in determining soil health is NPK values.
    When the NPK values are low, then urea is added to the soil. If the NPK values
    are very high, then any particular type of crop may not be cultivated there. The
    reading obtained from the NPK sensor has been tested by adding varying amounts
    of urea to a soil sample. 1 kg of a soil sample is taken and divided into two
    parts—Soil Sample-1 and Soil Sample-2. The nitrogen content of Soil Sample-1,
    i.e., plain soil without urea using an NPK sensor is measured. Then, 5 pieces
    of diluted urea are added to Soil Sample-1, and then again, the nitrogen content
    is measured using the NPK sensor. There is a very slight increase in NPK level.
    After taking the NPK reading, the percentage difference of the Soil Sample-1 without
    (n1) and with (n2) urea using the formula ((n1 − n2)/n1) *100 is calculated. The
    percentage difference ranges from 2 to 5%. The nitrogen content of Soil Sample-2,
    i.e., plain soil without urea (n3) is measured using an NPK sensor. Then, 10 pieces
    of diluted urea are added to Soil Sample-2 (n4), and then again, the nitrogen
    content is measured using the NPK sensor. There is a large increase in NPK levels.
    After taking the NPK reading, the percentage difference of the Soil Sample-2 without
    and with urea ((n3 − n4)/n3) *100 is calculated. The percentage difference ranges
    from 38 to 41%. This test can provide an idea of how much urea should be added
    to the field for a particular type of crop in presence of reference data. The
    NPK values are recorded and monitored through the mobile application as shown
    in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 NPK sensor data displayed on the cloud Full size image When
    EC exceeds the desired level, soil fertility decreases. To test the EC and salt
    content of the soil, a 1 kg soil sample is taken. Electrical conductivity and
    salinity of soil sample without water are measured using an EC sensor. It is observed
    that the values for EC and salinity are the same. When 100 ml of water is added
    to the soil, there is a slight change in the values of EC and salinity. First,
    the values increase then decrease, and finally, they become equal when the water
    dries up. Then, 200 ml of water is added to the soil; there is a large change
    in the values of EC and salinity. First, the values increase then decrease, and
    finally, they become equal when the water dries up. When the value of electrical
    conductivity is high, it needs to be reduced, and this can be done with the process
    of leaching where water needs to be added to the soil so that the amount of salt
    can be reduced from the soil. It is observed that if less amount of water is added,
    then the values of EC and salinity are less. If more amount of water is added,
    then the value will be more. The data of EC and salinity of soil can be monitored
    from the user device as shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 EC sensor data displayed on the
    cloud Full size image To test the moisture of the soil, a 1 kg soil sample is
    taken. The soil moisture sensor data are recorded by gradually increasing the
    amount of added water in the soil sample. It is observed that moisture content
    increases as the water content of the soil increases. First, adding 50 ml of water
    will increase the moisture content of the soil, which will become constant after
    a while. Then, 100 ml of water is added; there is a slight increase in the moisture
    content of the soil, and after some time, moisture content becomes constant. The
    moisture sensor data as displayed in the user device are shown in Fig. 10. Initial
    obstacles faced are the issue of power supply in the field which is solved using
    the solar power. Fig. 10 Soil moisture sensor data displayed on the cloud Full
    size image 7 Conclusion The proposed solar-powered soil health monitoring system
    is a cost-effective solution to the problem of the farmers. They can access and
    monitor the soil parameters from anywhere in the world at any time; it makes their
    lives easier. The data collected by the sensors are continuously sent by NodeMCU
    microcontroller using MQTT to the cloud server wirelessly in real time so that
    the farmers can take necessary steps according to the change of soil parameters
    for better crop yield. It would help the farmer to use the right amount of fertilizer
    and water depending on the requirement of any particular type of crop. The future
    scope of this proposed system is to monitor soil parameters in a more detailed
    way with utmost precision and to provide accurate suggestions after analyzing
    the soil health report of the particular field. The suggestion would help the
    farmer to take the necessary steps for better growth of crops at all times irrespective
    of their knowledge about the agricultural sector. References Manickam S (2020)

    autonomous 1. Introduction Water resources are one of the most important resources
    on Earth but are uneven in both time and space distribution. Agriculture, as the
    foundation of human society, is by far the biggest consumer of water. Therefore,
    the use of water resources with high efficiency is an important research field
    in agricultural development. Multiple technologies have been developed to improve
    water utilization, such as soil-less culture [1], sprinkling irrigation [2], [3],
    and trickle irrigations [4]. Although recent advances in agriculture have dramatically
    improved water use efficiency, there is still a high demand for saving water to
    further improve water utilization in some dry areas. Irrigation systems have been
    effectively used in agriculture for many years. A conventional irrigation system
    requires many wires to collect sensor signals and transmit commands to control
    the solenoid valves. The high cost of cables and various accessories makes the
    entire system expensive and complex, limiting the scale of deployment. Emerging
    communication technologies, such as general packet radio service (GPRS) cellular
    networks [5], [6], ZigBee [6], [7], and Bluetooth [8], enable wireless coverage
    for farmland. However, they also have some limitations. For instance, the devices
    using GPRS always consume power, which increases the maintenance workload of battery
    replacement. In addition, they rely on the cellular network provided by telecom
    operators, which is not reliable in some rural areas. As to the solutions with
    ZigBee or Bluetooth, the communication distance is not long enough to cover the
    large area of farmland, although the low power performance of the devices can
    be guaranteed. Recently, multiple low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies
    have emerged, such as NB-IoT, SigFox, and long range (LoRa) radio technique. The
    key features of LPWAN technology include a long-distance communication, low power
    consumption, high capacity, and low cost. The LPWAN overcomes the limitations
    of conventional wireless technologies. Combined with energy harvesting, it makes
    energy-autonomous IoT nodes possible. Consequently, it is a promising technology
    to be used in wireless irrigation systems. In recent years, several IoT-enabled
    water management solutions have been developed for precision agriculture. However,
    most of them are sensing-based solutions, and the watering schedule is a predefined
    offline system. Few solutions consider the user’s experience, knowledge, and long-term
    environmental variables. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), the long short-term
    memory network (LSTM), was introduced in the field of precision agriculture [9].
    As a special type of neural network, the LSTM is especially helpful for the time
    series analysis [10]. It inspires us to use LSTM to analyze the relationship between
    weather changes and irrigation needs set by farmers and gardeners. Further, the
    acquired models can predict the future irrigation needs for common users. In order
    to achieve the goal, an intelligent water irrigation system is proposed. The novelty
    of the work is that an intelligent irrigation system with data fusion is proposed.
    The data fusion model considers the history of local weather, irrigation logs,
    weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data; analyzes their internal relationships;
    and then forms a big data fusion system to improve water-saving efficiency. This
    article presents an intelligent irrigation system based on a LoRa network and
    a data fusion model. The following are the technical contributions of this work.
    • We explore the method of data fusion to realize intelligent irrigation. Unlike
    the conventional predefined offline system, the proposed system combines history
    logs, weather forecasts, and real-time data to predict the proper water demand
    for future irrigation. By loading knowledge from different domains, the data fusion
    model is expected to extend to more IoT application scenarios. • We implement
    a self-powered wide-area network using LoRa to facilitate multiple IoT scenarios,
    owing to its long-range communication and low-power feature. The waterflow-based
    energy harvesting scheme is designed and implemented by integrating the micro
    hydro generator. The scheme can achieve maintenance-free of battery replacement
    in the whole life cycle. The rest of the article is organized as follows. The
    related work is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the architecture
    and implementation of the proposed system. Section 4 provides the details of the
    experimental results. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5. 2. Related
    works 2.1. IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation The rapid development of the IoT
    has enabled irrigation systems with more new features that can effectively improve
    watering efficiency. In recent years, a variety of wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    irrigation systems have been proposed. With sensors deployed, multiple types of
    environment information can be monitored. The irrigation system can determine
    watering actions based on the sensor data and the preset threshold by users [5],
    [7], [11], [12]. For example, Roy et al. [6] designed a real-time automated irrigation
    system for crop fields. The system sets up the WSN to sense the parameters of
    the environment using ZigBee. More recently, LoRa was introduced for various IoT
    applications [13], [14]. Zhao et al. [15] designed and implemented a smart irrigation
    system based on LoRa. The system can cover up to 8 km, while the node is self-powered
    with a water turbocharge mechanism. Another widely used water-saving technique
    is evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation. The concept of ET is to calculate
    the evaporation from the soil surface and the transpiration through plant canopies
    [16]. The ET-based intelligent watering controller calculates the watering demand
    based on the value of ET [17], [18]. Klein et al. [19] demonstrated a closed loop
    irrigation system that calculates the water requirement from satellite images
    and local daily weather. It achieved a 26% yield increase and a 16% increase in
    water-use efficiency. Munoz et al. [20] proposed a cloud platform for greenhouse
    crop production. It provides forecasting based on models for the climate, crop
    production, and irrigation processes, which makes it more flexible than traditional
    hard-coded approaches. The ET-certified controller usually costs a few hundred
    dollars on the market. In addition, the parameter setting is complicated, requiring
    professional weather and agronomy knowledge. In recent years, AI has emerged as
    a new technology introduced in agriculture [21]. Specifically, in the field of
    water conservation, multiple machine learning algorithms have been proposed to
    simulate the water-balancing model and predict the water demand [22], [23], [24],
    [25]. Goap et al. [22] proposed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the difference
    and changes in soil moisture due to weather conditions. Chang et al. [23] proposed
    a machine-learning-based smart irrigation system with a LoRa P2P network that
    can automatically learn the irrigation experiences from expert farmers for greenhouse
    crops. Moghadas et al. [24] proposed an algorithm for accurate characterization
    of the soil moisture from electromagnetic induction data using Bayesian inference
    and a neural network. Nie et al. [25] presented the prediction result of soil
    moisture by employing different machine learning models. 2.2. Data fusion With
    the development of the IoT and big data, the explosive growth of various types
    of data has brought great challenges to data processing and utilization. Data
    fusion, which can be explained as the process of fusing multiple records representing
    the same real-world object into a single, consistent, and clean representation,
    is used to integrate huge amounts of data from heterogeneous information systems
    [26]. Data fusion was first applied in the military [27]. It is extremely important
    to obtain all kinds of useful sensor information on the battlefield, for example,
    by evaluating battlefield situation and threats and providing tactical and strategic
    decision-making assistance for the combat forces. With the continuous development
    of data fusion, it gradually expanded to many other areas, such as cyber–physical–social
    systems [28], human activity detection and health monitoring [29], sentiment analysis
    of educational big data [30], and industrial fault detection and identification
    [31]. Multiple methodologies for cross-domain data fusion have been proposed [32].
    Dragos et al. [33] presented a method to combine soft and sensor data to create
    enhanced situation assessment for a track-and-detect application. Chen et al.
    [34] proposed a ternary data fusion model based on reinforcement learning in the
    production process of hot rolling. By merging the ternary data, faster and better
    decisions can be made. Zhao et al. [35] developed a positioning system using big
    sensor data preprocessing in multi-source fusion. The fusion technique can reduce
    the data collection amount significantly. Data fusion has also been further extended
    to the field of precision agriculture. In 2014, Mouazen et al. [36] presented
    a data fusion approach for the delineation of water-holding capacity zones for
    site-specific irrigation based on multiple sensors. More recently, Viani et al.
    [37] proposed a low-cost wireless monitoring and decision support system for water
    conservation in agriculture. The system contains a fuzzy logic theory that integrates
    the farmers’ experience, irrigation practices, soil conditions, and crop models,
    providing improved water conservation compared to the conventional threshold-based
    technique. In summary, the existing automatic irrigation systems are mostly sensing-based
    solutions. The watering demand algorithms are usually threshold-trigged, timer-based,
    soil–water balancing schemes, and ET-based, which lack the ability to dynamically
    adjust in time according to weather changes. To the best of our knowledge, few
    studies have focused on AI-based systems with data fusion. In this article, we
    propose a knowledge-based data fusion model based on big data, that is, the history
    of local weather, irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data.
    The model can achieve optimization for the future watering schedule to improve
    water-saving efficiency. In addition, as we load the knowledge from different
    domains into the proposed model, the system can be extended to more IoT application
    scenarios. Download : Download high-res image (563KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Architecture of the intelligent irrigation system. 3. System architecture
    and implementation The architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists
    of three phases, devices, cloud, and user. Various LoRa nodes are deployed in
    multiple scenarios, such as landscape watering, dust removal, and agriculture
    irrigation. The LoRa gateways are deployed as a data hub, in which the data from
    LoRa nodes are preliminarily processed and transmitted to the cloud platform.
    The IoT cloud platform hosts the LoRa network and provides services for each function
    block. The data fusion model deployed in the cloud platform optimizes the watering
    scheduler. Different domains of knowledge can be selected and input to the data
    fusion model to fit the corresponding application scenarios. Moreover, users can
    access the irrigation system either from a mobile application or a web interface
    to check and control the watering schedule remotely. 3.1. Hardware design 3.1.1.
    Gateway The LoRa gateway is the core of the LoRa network and acts as a relay between
    the LoRa nodes and the cloud platform. For irrigation in farmland, the gateway
    is usually deployed on the top of a tower or a building. It can provide signal
    coverage over the whole farmland, usually dozens of square kilometers. As for
    landscape watering in a garden, the gateway can be mounted on the wall of a house,
    depending on the ease of installation and electrical connection. Further, the
    whole LoRa gateway is packaged in a plastic box with IP-68 standards to provide
    waterproof capability. Download : Download high-res image (432KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Design of the LoRa gateway and nodes. (a) LoRa gateway.
    (b) Valve node. (c) Sensing node. (d) Micro hydro generator integration. The gateway
    consists of a microprocessor and multiple modules to realize communication, execution,
    display, and other functions. An ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller is selected as
    the core of the gateway. It can provide high performance calculation with low
    power consumption. It has rich communication interfaces such as USART, I2C, and
    SPI, which are sufficient to interact with other modules. A 2-Kb electrically
    erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) is used as external memory to
    backup data and configurations in case of power loss. The gateway provides both
    wired and wireless connections to the valve nodes. For the wired access, the interface
    of the 12-zone 24-V AC output is designed through optoisolators. The AC output
    can connect directly to the valve nodes, controlling their working states. A programmable
    logic controller (PLC) interface is also integrated into the board, providing
    an alternative method of node connection. For wireless access, a LoRa module is
    customized based on sx1268 from Semtech. The communication distance can be as
    far as 8 km. The module supports a LoRa network with up to 72 nodes. To interact
    with the cloud platform, the gateway supports multiple communication modules for
    facilitating different scenarios, including Wi-Fi (USR-WIFI232), LTE cat −1 (WH-GM5),
    and Ethernet. Also, a 480 × 320 LCD touch screen is used to set local configurations
    and display the basic information of the gateway. The printed circuit board (PCB)
    of the LoRa gateway is depicted in Fig. 2(a). 3.1.2. LoRa node The LoRa nodes,
    both the valve node (Fig. 2(b)) and sensing node (Fig. 2(c)) are deployed in the
    farmland far away from the gateway, controlling the solenoid valves or collecting
    environment information. An ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller operating at 32 MHz
    is selected. It has 8 Kb of RAM and 64 Kb of Flash, which are sufficient for the
    program running on the LoRa node. Compared with the gateway, the peripheral modules
    are simplified. A LoRa module is integrated for communication with the gateway.
    The power-management module performs the power conversion from the battery. The
    LCD is designed for local debugging and configuration and is tiny and power efficient.
    It can be disabled after deployment. There is a slight difference between the
    two types of nodes. The valve node supports a two-zone output to switch the valve
    on and off. The output signal is a 9-V 120 ms pulse, so a power conversion circuit
    with large capacity is carefully designed to store enough power to drive the valve.
    As to the sensing node, an RS485 interface is implemented instead of the DC output.
    The RS485 module provides an interface for multiple sensors. Unlike the gateway,
    the nodes are usually in a power-constrained environment with limited access to
    electricity. For both the valve node and sensing node, a 2200-mAh Li-ion battery
    is selected to provide the power supply. In addition, a micro hydro generator
    is integrated with the valve node, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The water pipe is divided
    into two branches: One is for the irrigation and another is for electricity generation.
    This structure successfully avoids the decrease of water flow velocity caused
    by the generator. The charging current is between 200 mA and 300 mA at a fixed
    5-V output, which is much higher than that consumed by the node every day. Therefore,
    the valve node can be self-powered, forming an energy-autonomous system. The PCB
    of the node and the battery is packaged inside an IP-68 waterproof plastic box,
    with dimension of 90 mm  × 50 mm × 42 mm. The antenna, made from flexible material
    is attached to the inner side of the box, which makes the node compact. 3.2. Software
    design 3.2.1. Cloud platform A cloud platform is designed and implemented. Considering
    the high availability and load balancing, an HTTP-MQ architecture is designed
    and deployed. The core of the cloud platform is the clustered servers, in which
    RabbitMQ is installed as the middleware of the message queue. The servers provide
    both the RabbitMQ application program interface (API) and hypertext transport
    protocol (HTTP) API for different types of connections. The LoRa gateways and
    mobile applications connect to the servers through the HAProxy server via the
    message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. Moreover, the web client
    connects the servers through the Nginx server, where HTTP requests are distributed.
    Benefiting from such an architecture, the mobile application can connect to the
    devices through the shared memory message queue. Therefore, the latency is significantly
    reduced compared with the HTTP request mechanism. To meet the requirement of storing
    heterogeneous data, a MySQL database and a backup database are implemented. 3.2.2.
    Mobile application A mobile application is developed to provide an application
    software and an interface for the users, as shown in Fig. 3. The menu interface
    (Fig. 3(a)) contains manual watering, irrigation schedule, real-time sensor display,
    system settings, smart watering, and history records. The watering time of each
    valve can be set in the manual watering interface (Fig. 3(b)). A timer-based scheduler
    (Fig. 3(c)) is available for the user to set the watering time and frequency for
    a whole week. The offset of sensitivity can be set according to the user’s experience.
    The real-time sensor data, such as soil temperature and moisture, air temperature
    and humidity, and water flow, provide online monitoring for users, as shown in
    Fig. 3(d). The data are also uploaded to the cloud platform as feedback for the
    intelligent irrigation model. The history records depict the daily and monthly
    water consumption for the user, as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(f) shows the
    smart watering interface. Once it is enabled, the data fusion model is activated.
    It provides the watering adjustment by combining multi-source data. As a result,
    the watering schedule is optimized automatically. Download : Download high-res

    (e) History records. (f) Local weather information. 3.3. Data fusion model For
    conventional irrigation systems, the valve controllers are deployed in each zone
    of the garden or farmland. The controllers are usually timer-based. The users
    usually roughly set the daily watering schedule in advance according to their
    experiences. However, such a setting is inconvenient in daily life and inflexible
    for dynamic adjustment. Various factors affect the watering schedule. For example,
    the watering amount can be reduced if there is a thundershower just before watering.
    Therefore, an intelligent irrigation with watering schedule optimization is needed.
    To solve the problem, a data fusion model based on the LSTM network is implemented
    and deployed on the cloud platform, as shown in Fig. 4. The historical weather
    data and the irrigation logs are sourced from the last two years. The weather
    forecast for the next few days is also ported to the model through the API from
    the website. The real-time environment information is collected from the sensing
    nodes for feedback. Thus, the data from the past, present, and future are used
    together as the input parameters to the model. Through the fusion of multi-source
    data, the model learns the users’ irrigation experiences in the past few years,
    and then outputs the optimized irrigation schedule. Download : Download high-res
    image (198KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Data fusion framework.
    The historical weather data and user irrigation logs are exported from the database
    online. It covers as much climate information as possible in the past 2 years
    to ensure the generalization ability of the model. The 13 types of weather information
    in an hourly interval are used, including temperature, daytime, wind speed, wind
    direction, weather code, precipitation, humidity, visibility, pressure, cloud
    cover, heat index, dew point, and wind gust speed. The irrigation logs of each
    zone are also combined as an input of the network. Therefore, the whole dataset
    is a matrix with 13+2 × columns. The first 13 columns represent the weather information,
    the following columns represent the preset watering schedule of zones, and the
    last columns are the actual watering results which are set by professional gardeners.
    Each row shows the timestamps in hourly intervals. The data in each column are
    standardized to have zero mean and unit variance. An LSTM network composed of
    six layers is implemented to estimate the proper watering schedule. The sequence
    input layer receives the data in hourly intervals. Then the LSTM layer with 200
    hidden units learns the correlation of time series and the watering schedule.
    A dropout layer is used with a dropout probability of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
    Also, two fully connected layers are added to achieve the conversion of different
    dimensions. Finally, the regression layer outputs the estimated results for the
    watering schedule. The action commands are sent to the valves through the watering
    scheduler. In this scenario, the online monitoring data are further used as feedback
    for the watering scheduler. Thus the closed loop of the irrigation system is built.
    It monitors the irrigation process conditions, such as the soil moisture content,
    to avoid any unexpected over-irrigation. 4. System evaluation and analysis Three
    scenarios of intelligent irrigation are deployed in this work. The first is a
    signal coverage test in an urban area. The second is the irrigation of apple seeding
    in a greenhouse located in Shaan Xi Province, China. In this scenario, the mist
    spray in the greenhouses is frequently switched on/off every few tens of seconds
    to maintain the optimal air humidity for apple seeding. Thus, the system’s real-time
    performance is assessed. The final scenario is landscape watering in a private
    home garden where we pay more attention to intelligent irrigation as well as low
    power consumption. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    rate: 2.4k bps. 4.1. Case I: Urban signal coverage The signal coverage test is
    conducted in an urban area. The LoRa gateway is placed on top of a building. The
    detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. During the test, the LoRa node is placed
    on a moving car and slowly moved far away from the gateway. The position and received
    signal strength indication (RSSI) are recorded and displayed on the map, as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Two types of tests with different transmission speeds are carried out.
    For the baud rate of 50.78 bps, the communication distance is as far as 8 km,
    and the receiving sensitivity can be lower than −120 dBm. For the baud rate of
    2.4 kbps, the communication distance is a bit lower, around 5.6 km. The results
    show that the signal coverage decreases with the increase of the transmission
    rate, which is a tradeoff during deployment. Download : Download high-res image

    (b) Node. 4.2. Case II: Greenhouse mist spray 4.2.1. System latency The LoRa network
    is deployed on farmland composed of several greenhouses. The gateway is installed
    in a metal box (Fig. 6(a)). The LoRa nodes are placed in the greenhouses, connected
    to the valves and sensors (Fig. 6(b)). The distance between the gateway and each
    node is less than 1.5 km. Also, there is no obvious obstruction for the radio
    transmission, so, the signal coverage can be well guaranteed. Download : Download

    40 m Antenna Isotropic, 3 dBi Baud rate 50.78 bps/ 2.4 kbps Packet length 15 Bytes
    Moving speed <10 km/h The system latency is a critical issue in this scenario,
    as the valves should be controlled in real-time. An experiment on the transmission
    latency between the LoRa gateway and the LoRa nodes is conducted. The gateway
    broadcasts the packet with 10 bytes periodically. The system latency is recorded
    as soon as the packet is received by the node. As illustrated in Fig. 7, with
    the increase of the transmission speed, the receiving latency is significantly
    reduced. The curve flattens out when the transmission speed exceeds 10 kbps. To
    ensure a latency meets real-time demands, a transmission speed of at least 2.4
    kbps is required, and then, the latency can be less than 300 ms. 4.3. Case III:
    Landscape watering We also deploy a LoRa network at a private garden, in Mission
    Viejo, California, USA. The garden is divided into four zones. A valve node is
    deployed in each zone to control the watering. Unlike the greenhouse, the low-power
    and smart watering performance is of greater concern in this scenario. Download

    The battery-powered nodes are deployed in the garden. The wireless solution can
    reduce the cost of deployment compared with the wired controllers, in which the
    power cable accounts for a large proportion. A detailed analysis of energy consumption
    is carried out. The analysis is assumed in a daily use scenario. The irrigation
    system works once a day, and the valve is switched on for 1 min. The LoRa module
    consumes a considerable amount of current; so an experiment is conducted to observe
    the power consumption under different conditions. The module is configured in
    sleep state. It wakes up at regular intervals to listen for any packets to receive.
    The experiment result is shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious that with the increase
    of the wake-up interval, the average current decreases significantly, especially
    when the wake-up time is less than 2500 ms. Besides, a lower speed transmission
    rate consumes more current, as it takes more time for the RF module to transmit
    the same length of data. Considering the balance between power consumption and
    response time, as well as the signal coverage, a wake-up period of 2 s is selected
    with a transmission speed of 2.4 kbps. The total power consumption of the LoRa
    node consists of five parts in different working states. For each state the current
    is carefully measured, as shown in Table 2. Then, the amount of battery power
    consumed is determined using the following equations: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) where:
    is the power consumption of the main board in sleeping mode; is the power consumption
    of the LoRa module in standby mode; is the power consumption of the main board
    in working mode; is the power consumption of the LoRa module in data transmitting
    mode; and is the power consumed to switch the valve on and off. hence, the energy
    consumed everyday can be calculated as follows: (6) The number of days can be
    obtained as follows: (7) In this sense, a battery-powered valve node can work
    for approximately 18 months at a frequency of switching valve eight times every
    day. In some real deployment environments, the frequency of valve action is lower
    than the calculated assumption, so, the battery life cycle can be further extended.
    In addition, the microhydro generator is integrated in some application scenarios.
    In this case, the battery is charged when the valve is on. According to the previous
    assumption, the valve is switched on four times for 1 min each time. The generated
    electricity is determined by using the following equation: (8) It is obvious that
    can cover the energy consumption, . This indicates that an average of 1 min of
    charging can fulfill the node’s daily energy consumption. In fact, the irrigation
    time can be larger in some actual deployments. Therefore, the node can be self-powered,
    achieving an energy-autonomous system. 4.3.2. Intelligent watering performance
    There is a dry season and a rainy season in Mission Viejo, California, as shown
    in Fig. 9. From June to October, there is almost no rain (less than 5 mm). The
    rainy season is from November to April, in which the rainfall is always larger
    than 60 mm. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between the local weather
    and watering amount. For the sake of sightseeing, it is necessary to ensure the
    normal growth of flowers and grass. Owing to the lack of water, the use of a smart
    controller is incentivized by law to avoid over-irrigation in California, especially
    as rainfall is abundant some days. Download : Download high-res image (357KB)

    the proposed data fusion system, the predicted results are compared with the watering
    records of gardeners, as shown in Fig. 10. The predicted results from the model
    are similar to the manual watering schedules in all zones. Table 3 lists the output
    of data fusion model in terms of the total watering amount, average amount, and
    root-mean-square error (RMSE). The RMSE of all zones is close to zero, indicating
    that the deviation between the predicted results of the model and the actual watering
    amount is small. Therefore, it is believed that the model learns the user experience
    from the multiple input data sets. A case study on general users followed, and
    30 days’ data were selected independently of the training samples. The predicted
    watering amount was delivered to the valve nodes to replace the original timer-based
    watering schedule. As shown in Fig. 11, the predicted values are dynamically adjusted
    according to the changes of weather conditions. The predicted value is slightly
    lower in zone 1, zone 3, and zone 4. For zone 2, there are approximately 100 s
    longer than the original watering schedule, which is still acceptable in the daily
    watering. The detailed results of each zone are presented in Table 4. The landscapes
    in the four zones are grow well during this month; so, we believe that the predicted
    watering schedule generated by the LSTM network is reasonable. The watering efficiency,
    defined by the predicted value over the scheduled value, is 94.74% within the
    last 30 days. The advantages of the intelligent irrigation model over other approaches
    are its simple deployment and self-learning capability. Conventional irrigation
    devices, such as timer-based or ET-based devices always require complicated parameter
    setting, which requires professional weather and agronomy knowledge. As to the
    proposed system, it can learn the user’s watering experience and provide optimizations;
    so, it is more user-friendly and convenient for deployment. 5. Conclusion In this
    article, we have presented an intelligent irrigation system based on data fusion.
    The system explores LPWAN techniques, which provide a wireless, low-power, low-cost,
    easy-to-deploy, and intelligent solution over conventional irrigation systems.
    The cloud platform provides a data fusion model that combines multiple types of
    information, enabling an optimized decision for the watering schedule. The user-friendly
    mobile application allows users to set watering schedules remotely, as well as
    check the real-time sensor data for monitoring. Table 5 presents the comparison
    of the proposed work with other state-of-the-art systems. Our work has demonstrated
    a promising IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture.

    will be considered. Computation-resource-consuming tasks, such as data processing,
    and model training can be run on the cloud platform. Moreover, the pre-trained
    model can be offloaded to the edge devices, such as the LoRa gateways. Leveraging

    Agriculture Monitoring System Using IoT Chapter © 2024 23.1 Introduction Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a system of heterogeneous things such as mechanical and electrical
    computing devices, objects, animals and people. These things are used to connect
    each other to collect, send and act on to acquire data without human intervention.
    IoT architecture consists of four stages as shown in Fig. 23.1. In the first stage,
    sensor and actuators are used to collect the information from the environment.
    These can be wired or wireless devices. Second stage consists of gateways and
    data acquisition systems which are used to collect data from multiple sensor and
    control of devices. The third stage consists of an edge IoT which is used to pre-process
    the data received from second stage to analyze it. The fourth stage deals with
    storage of data received from the third stage in cloud. Further, the data analytics
    at cloud is used by various applications like smart grid, business intelligence,
    etc. Many researchers have been used IoT-based monitoring system in various applications
    as shown in Fig. 23.2. IoT-based smart city was developed to monitor water pollution,
    street lighting, video surveillance and electricity management [1]. Fig. 23.1
    IoT architecture Full size image Fig. 23.2 IoT applications Full size image Slope
    stability monitoring was done using zigbee-based wireless data acquisition system
    in opencast coal mine in south India [2]. IoT-based smart medical service system
    was developed to improve the efficiency of diagnosis process and resources utilization
    in medical field [3]. IoT-based smart energy-efficient home automation system
    was developed to control the home appliances [4]. Intrusion detection system was
    developed to monitor malicious activities based on IoT and genetic algorithm [5].
    Dummy projects have demonstrated in IoT [6]. A detailed survey has provided on
    architecture, protocols and the enabling technologies for an urban IoT [7]. IoT
    application are not limited to one particular field. It has shown the significant
    contribution from small-scale applications to the large-scale applications such
    as e-commerce [8], coal mine [9], wearable device [10] and smart grid [11]. Agriculture
    is one of the most important sectors which occupies major share in Indian economy
    growth. Its 80% population depends on agriculture as their source of livelihood.
    The global population is going to reach around 9 billion mark by 2050, and traditional
    farming methods will not be sufficient to feed the fast growth of population throughout
    the world [12]. To meet the requirements of such a large population, countries
    throughout the world must adopt smart farming [13]. Smart farming is IoT-based
    modern agriculture concept to increase the production and improve the farming
    conditions. In this paper, an investigation has taken up to reduce the usage of
    water in traditional method of farming with the concept of smart farming based
    on IoT. A prototype of smart water management system is developed to reduce the
    usage of water in the crop field. 23.2 Proposed System In this study, a prototype
    of irrigation system based on IoT is developed. It consists of three units such
    as sensing unit, controller unit and data processing unit as shown in Fig. 23.3.
    Fig. 23.3 IoT-based water management system in agriculture Full size image Sensing
    unit consists of soil moisture and DHT11 sensors which are used to sense the crop
    environmental data such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity. Soil moisture
    sensor is a device which senses the moisture content in soil in the crop field
    and sends to the microcontroller unit which is shown in Fig. 23.4. The moisture
    data is used to control the water pump ON/OFF. DHT11 sensor is used to monitor
    the humidity and temperature and send the data to the controller unit which is
    shown in Fig. 23.5. Fig. 23.4 Soil moisture sensor Full size image Fig. 23.5 Temperature
    and humidity (DHT11) sensor Full size image Microcontroller unit is heart of the
    system and used to act as bridge between sensing unit and processing unit. ESP8266E
    module is an integrated with low-power microcontroller unit with inbuilt Wi-Fi
    support as shown in Fig. 23.6. It consists of a 10-bit A/D converter and TCP/IP
    protocol stack. It is used for the integration of sensing unit and read the sensors
    data and convert the data to the required format using analog-to-digital (A/D)
    converter. The data is sent to cloud for further analysis. Relay and water motor
    are connected to microcontroller. Relay is used to control water pump. Fig. 23.6
    Block diagram of ESP8266 Full size image ThingSpeak is an open-source IoT platform
    which is used to visualize, process and analyses the live data received from microcontroller
    unit and sensing unit. 23.3 Experimental Work A prototype of smart water management
    is developed as shown in Fig. 23.7. Soil moisture is installed to find moisture
    quantity in soil and send to the ESP8266NodeMCU. It is an analog sensor, and an
    ADC is used to convert its values into digital form. Fig. 23.7 Deployment of prototype
    of smart water management Full size image Moisture data is visualized, processed
    and analyzed in ThingSpeak cloud platform. If moisture value is above threshold
    level, relay is used to switch OFF the water motor. If moisture value is below
    the threshold level, then water motor automatically switched ON by relay. DHT11
    is a digital sensor which is connected to ESP8266. It is used to sense the temperature
    and humidity of field area and send to the cloud for further processing. The graphical
    representation of collected temperature data by DT11 sensor on daily basis can
    be visualized using ThingSpeak platform which is shown in Fig. 23.8. Fig. 23.8
    DHT11 sensor data in ThingSpeak Full size image 23.4 Conclusion In this paper,
    an IoT-based smart water management system is developed to sense the soil moisture,
    temperature and humidity level to utilize the resources such as water and human
    intervention in the crop field effectively. All these sensor values are sent to
    the ThingSpeak cloud platform using Wi-Fi. This system is used to save the water
    by controlling the water motor. The sensor values can be seen from anywhere from
    the world using ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform. Declaration We have taken permission

  description: Today, the world is rising in the field of technology and the basic
    need of human being is food, home, and cloths, which are directly or indirectly
    fulfilled by agriculture. Incorporation of technology with agriculture will increase
    the production and automation of process and reduce human intervention and efforts.
    There are lots of technologies that are helping us to improve the methods of agriculture
    such as intelligent system for weather forecasting and microcontroller-based equipment
    for automation of process and many more. These technologies have their advantages
    and also improving the production.Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology
    that incorporates intelligent system, cloud computing, and microcontroller itself.
    In this chapter, we will go through a deep drive about the things (sensors and
    actuators) that are connected with cloud system and the cloud computing platforms
    that are suitable to use for IoT projects with their features. In agricultural
    revolution, information technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, big data, and
    machine learning are playing a vital role. Different sensor modules such as soil
    sensor, moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and many other sensors
    are useful for agri-culture science that measures the environment variables and
    water pump, pesticide sprinkler, cold/hot air blower, and temperature control
    units are the actuators for different types of indoor and outdoor crops. Microcontroller
    selection is the main challenge for implementation of IoT-based system. In this
    chapter, we will also cover different micro-controller and there uses as per application
    scope, power consumption, storage, and network connectivity and will implement
    IoT module on basil plant and collect the threshold data. There are different
    levels of IoT appli-cations and development methodology and IoT project design
    reference model. Depending on the levels of IoT application, we decide the location
    for storage unit and computational unit, and the design reference model is used
    make plan and prepare resources before developing and deploying an IoT system.
    Sensors and actuators are connected with microcontroller, sensor collects the
    environment data and sends to microcontroller that uses the network routers to
    transmit the data to the cloud through gateway nodes and then computational unit
    is responsible for triggering the action using actuator devices. Communication
    between microcontroller to storage and computational unit can be wired or wireless.
    There are a number of cloud platforms developed for IoT-based systems. Using cloud
    we connect the end user via mobile application, web application, or hardware controller.
    These applications provide user interface for monitoring the sensor data and also
    can trigger the actuators to perform action.

  description: The scarcity of water is getting increased day to day almost 70% urban
    cities depend on the Municipal water which passes from one place to other through
    the tunnels. Nowadays it is identified in the news that water is the major problem
    faced by the people of the country. The ideal aim is to monitor the water in the
    flowing tunnel with the help of sensors which monitors the flow speed and the
    flow rate of the water in the tunnel and the sensor data is pushed to the cloud
    and stream analytics is visualized in the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. When
    there is a leak the particular place is identified and the problem could be analyzed
    within minutes. By this approach, some gallons of water could be prevented from
    leakage and be wasted. The experimental result in this paper gave a positive result
    with variation in water and the Objective of this paper is to safely transfer
    the water in a tunnel without leakage and which carries gallons of water from
    one place to another place.

    IEEE Conference Location: Lombok, Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction Internet of
    Things (IoT) is a concept where a number of devices are able to communicate among
    each other with various protocol [6]. The growth of Internet of Things constantly
    supported by a concept of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). WSN is a type of network
    which consists of smart sensor nodes that connected to each other by wireless
    network [8]. One of the services that can be developed with technology based on
    IoT and WSN is a smart aquaculture [13]. In this type of service, sensor nodes
    are equipped with some sort of sensors to observe a number of parameters which
    can affect the successful rate in aquaculture, such as water quality and physical
    air condition. The result of observation will be processed so that the system
    can recommend the best treatment to breeders, as well as doing an automatic treatment
    to the pond itself. In order to establish the smart aquaculture service, previous
    research have developed a sensor node to observe physical parameter of the water
    in an aquaculture pond [1]. The sensor node device was packed with three primary
    components, which are microprocessor, sensor, and communication module. A sensor
    node periodically takes observation data of physical condition of water such as
    acidity level (pH), dissolved oxygen, temperature, and water brightness with the
    attached sensors. As a result of testing, it has been discovered that the devices
    capable to do an acquisition to physical water parameter accurately. But over
    time, sensor data that have to be stored and processed by sink node are increased
    beyond the capacity and capability of device. Because both sensor node and sink
    node devices have limited computation resource, a cloud-based system is needed
    to do a large-scale data management [3], [7]. To realize the integration between
    IoT and cloud system, there are some challenges that have to be solved [11]. In
    communication aspect, besides having some advantages such as low power consumption
    and wide-area coverage, LoRa technology still has limitation so that it still
    can''t send data directly to cloud devices. Communication protocol that were being
    used by LoRa is radio, so the system should have a device that act as a connector
    to send data to data center. That way, data acquisition result from sensor node
    can be managed and processed in cloud device. Because of that, intermediary system
    to integrate LoRa communication to cloud is needed, and later the system is referred
    as a gateway. Previous research that have been done by Chang-le Zhong [4] in the
    publication titled “Study on IoT Architecture and Gateway Technology”, stated
    that in general, gateway can connect different communication protocol. In other
    words, gateway can be used as a protocol converter. To connect gateway and data
    center, a communication protocol that is used to exchange information is needed.
    One of available protocol options to manage messages is MQTT. MQTT protocol is
    used because of reliability in terms of data sending and characteristics to support
    IoT such as low power consumption and minimum bandwidth used. This protocol works
    above TCP protocol and use publish-subscribe model. Publish-subscribe model was
    designed to be easy to implement, and qualified as open-source [12], [2]. Fig.
    1: General system architecture. Show All In this paper, researchers develop a
    gateway as an intermediary node to send data from sensor node to server in cloud
    platform. Sensor node will send data to gateway by utilizing a LoRa communication
    module. Then, gateway will receive data from sensor node and forward it to server
    by using MQTT with publish-subscribe model. Gateway and sensor node will utilize
    microcomputer called Raspberry Pi because it has better computation among other
    microcontrollers. Testing parameter which will be conducted is gateway successful
    rate in terms of receiving and forwarding data to data center with distance, packet
    size, and time interval as variables. SECTION II. Design of Proposed LoRa-MQTT
    Gateway A. General System Architecture Fig. 1 shows the general architecture considered
    in the system with four main actors: sensor node acting as data producer which
    transmit the aquaculture related sensor data to gateway device using LoRa protocol.
    sensor-to-cloud gateway acting as intermediary node that relay message from LoRa
    based sensor node to the cloud entity. In the MQTT perspective, this actor is
    acting as message publisher. cloud based broker. data storage server which receive
    published sensor data and store it to the database. In the MQTT perspective, this
    actor is acting as message subscriber. The data flow considered in the system
    is illustrated in Fig. 2. At first, sensor node equipped with embedded computing
    device, various water monitoring sensors and LoRa communication module periodically
    collect several water physical information including pH, temperature, and dissolved
    oxygen. Upon collection, the sensor node sends those data to the gateway through
    LoRa protocol. In the other side, while receiving those sensor data, the gateway
    extract its structural data and build a JSON based message and send them to the
    broker. At the final step, broker relay those messages to all subscriber based
    on the topic similarity. B. Sensor Node The design of sensor node has some components
    that are used such as the LoRa communication module, sensor, and Raspberry Pi
    microcomputer. The design as illustrated in Fig. 3 that describes the system architecture
    on the sensor node side. There is a Arduino microcontroller acting as the brain
    of the system that used to run logic code of sensor node. The other is a component
    of the LoRa communication module that is used as a transceiver module between
    sensor node and gateway as well as several sensors which is employed to measure
    several water physical parameters including: dissolved oxygen sensor to measure
    dissolved oxygen level. Number Function Result 1 Sensor node can retrieve sensor
    data Succeed 2 Sensor node can send the data to gateway Succeed 3 Gateway can
    receive data from sensor node Succeed 4 Gateway can forward data from sensor node
    to server Succeed 5 Server can receive data from sensor node Succeed water temperature
    sensor to measure water temperature. pH sensor to measure water acidity level.
    turbidity sensor to measure water clearness. C. Gateway Device Gateway has the
    main role in this research, which is as an intermediary for communication with
    sensor node and forwarding to the server. Therefore, it needs good design as the
    sensor node design can be seen in Fig. 4 that describes the system architectures
    on the gateway. There is a Raspberry Pi microcomputer as the brain of the system
    that used to run program code in python language in this architecture. Then, there
    is LoRa communication module that is used by gateway to be able to receiver data
    from then sensor node. 802.11 communication protocol is a network that used to
    send data to a server. SECTION III. System Testing A. Functional Testing Functional
    testing was carried out to confirm the accuracy between functions created and
    system goals. The result of functional testing is shown in Table 1 below. B. Performance
    Testing Testing was carried out in an area that could support the system, such
    as a field with minimum population and houses. In that area, sensor node and gateway
    have been placed at a height of 1.5 meters above earth surface, so that it could
    be easier to receive or send the data. Performance testing focused on the successful
    rate of the gateway to forward received data from node sensor to destination.
    This parameter tested with 200 meters and 400 meters as distance variants; 44

    result graphic that shows performance in time interval of 0.5 seconds in successful
    rate parameter. Difference in successful rate parameter of gateway to receive
    and forward packets to server in time interval 0.5 seconds at distance of 200
    meters is 72% with packet size as long as 44 Bytes and 56 Bytes. In case of the
    packet size is 80 Bytes, successful rate decreased as much as 12% and when packet
    size is 128 Bytes, successful rate is 49%. Tests in distance of 400 meters show
    that successful rate is 38% with packet size of 44 Bytes and increased to 90%
    when packet size is 56 Bytes. But if packet size becomes 80 Bytes, successful
    rate decreased significantly to 0% and back up to 45% when packet size is 128
    Bytes. Fig. 6 is a testing result graphic that shows performance in time interval
    of 1 second in successful rate parameter. The difference that shown in Figure
    6 is a representation of variations in packet size, distance, and result of successful
    rate. At the distance of 200 meters and packet size of 44 Bytes, there were 72%
    of packets received and forwarded successfully to server by gateway. Successful
    rate increased to 89% if packet size of 56 Bytes were sent by sensor node. After
    that, the successful rate stayed in 33% for packet size of 80 Bytes and 128 Bytes.
    At the distance of 400 meters, result of successful rate is fairly stable at 100%
    to 99% when packet size of 44 Bytes, 56 Bytes, and 80 Bytes were sent. However
    successful rate decreased as much as 23% when packet size is 128 Bytes. Fig. 6:
    Successful transmission rate for time interval of 1 second. Show All Fig. 7: Successful
    transmission rate for time interval of 1 second. Show All Fig. 7 shows a graphic
    that represent the result of testing in successful rate parameter at time interval
    of 5 seconds. The successful rate of gateway to receive and forward packets to
    server at distance of 200 meters is 37% when 44 Bytes packets were sent. If packet
    size changed to 56 Bytes, successful rate advanced as much as 15%, so it is become
    52%. But the successful rate go down to 8% when packet size is 80 Bytes and 6%
    when packet size is 128 Bytes. Next, the result is improved at distance of 400
    meters. Successful rate reached 94% with packet size of 44 Bytes and 78% when
    packet size of 80 Bytes were sent. However, when packet size is 56 Bytes, successful
    rate achieved 100%, as well as when packet size of 128 Bytes were sent. SECTION
    IV. Conclusion This research proposed the design of LoRa-MQTT gateway device for
    supporting the sensor-to-cloud data transmission in smart aquaculture IoT application.
    In its main functionality, the gateway device receives collected sensor from sensor
    device using LoRa communication module, build a message and transmit them to the
    cloud based data storage server using MQTT protocol. From the functional and performance
    testing, the gateway can perform as a communication connector between sensor nodes
    and cloud based entity using both LoRa and MQTT protocols with reasonable performance.

  description: This paper presents a novel application of cloud computing enabled
    by Internet of Things (IoT) in monitoring parameters affecting cerebral blood
    flow (CBF) which is the movement of blood through the network of cerebral arteries
    and veins supplying the brain. The example design implemented in this proposal
    can be easily replaced with similar applications to generalize the concept offered
    by our work. This enables healthcare professionals have ubiquitous access to the
    processed medical data (in this case cerebral blood flow) of patients during their

    Abstract This paper presents a novel application of cloud computing enabled by
    Internet of Things (IoT) in monitoring parameters affecting cerebral blood flow
    (CBF) which is the movement of blood through the network of cerebral arteries
    and veins supplying the brain. The example design implemented in this proposal
    can be easily replaced with similar applications to generalize the concept offered
    by our work. This enables healthcare professionals have ubiquitous access to the
    processed medical data (in this case cerebral blood flow) of patients during their
    treatment process. Using cloud computing, accessing data from multiple locations

    would become the core of the internet. Presently, there are cost constraints stemming
    from the need to do higher quality work with fewer and more costly resources.
    Expectations for higher quality treatment from the healthcare services increase
    the need for point-of-care access to medical data and adoption of mobile devices;
    both for medical staff and patients; are forcing the need for internet technology
    (IT) systems to adapt [1]. Furthermore, the significant increase in digitization
    of medical records and the increasing prevalence of digital outputs from scanning
    and monitoring devices, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed
    axial tomography scan (CT-SCAN) maximize the potential benefit of cloud solutions.
    In this paper, attention is given to possible implementation of cloud computing
    technology in the medical field. The following is the contribution of this paper:
    Replacing traditional healthcare mechanisms with digital options by leveraging
    cloud computing technology. Exploiting Cloud Computing and IoT technologies to
    accelerate the accrual of real time medical knowledge and data to healthcare professionals
    and research community for the purpose of practice improvement and remote care.
    Presenting a new productive and cost effective business model, and more efficient
    healthcare systems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents
    the background to our implementation that includes an introduction to cerebral
    circulation and the parameters of interests. Furthermore, it covers the basics
    of cloud computing, its general architecture, and cloud computing web services
    and tools. Section 3 expounds the design flow and development of the cloud application.
    Section 4 discusses the user interface application development. Finally, we will
    conclude the paper in Section 5 and elaborate on future work. 2 Background 2.1
    Cerebral Circulation and Related Work Brain is a unique organ of the body that
    totally depends on the blood supply for its survival. Cerebral circulation is
    the movement of blood through the network of cerebral arteries and veins supplying
    the brain as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Cerebral blood flow. Full size image Alterations
    in cerebral blood flow (CBF) can lead to several neurological disorders including
    stroke. Hence it is vital to monitor the CBF for the diagnostic and therapeutic
    purposes. Human skull can be considered as a bony box of fixed volume that contains
    brain, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Unlike other body parts, brain can
    withstand very short periods of lack of blood supply for about 3 to 8 min [2].
    Therefore, CBF must be maintained to ensure a constant delivery of oxygen and
    substrates and to remove the waste products of metabolism. Consequently, there
    is considerable interest in monitoring CBF in patients with different brain diseases
    such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). CBF is dependent on several factors that
    can be broadly divided into two categories: (a) Those affecting cerebral perfusion
    pressure (b) Those affecting the radius of cerebral blood vessels This relationship
    can be described by the Hagen-Poiseuille law [3] which describes the streamlined
    flow of a uniformly viscous fluid through a cylindrical tube: $$ Q = \\frac{\\text{dV}}{\\rm{dt}}
    = \\frac{{\\Delta {\\text{P}} \\pi {\\text{R}}^{4} }}{{8 \\eta {\\text{L}}}} $$
    (1) In our case, Q is the CBF, ΔP is the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) or
    pressure drop along the vessel, R is the radius of the blood vessel, η is the
    viscosity of the blood, and L is the length of the blood vessel. CBF ranges from
    20 ml/100 g/min to 70 ml/100 g/min for human brain [2]. CPP is dependent on the
    pressure gradient between the arteries and the veins where arteries carry oxygenated
    blood and veins carry deoxygenated blood. This is the difference between the mean
    arterial blood pressure (MAP) and the mean cerebral venous pressure. The latter
    is difficult to measure and approximates to the more easily measured intracranial
    pressure (ICP) [2]. $$ {\\text{CPP}} = {\\text{MAP}} - {\\text{ICP}} $$ (2) CPP
    can be affected by anything that changes the MAP or ICP. The effect of decrease
    in MAP and increase in ICP simultaneously can be catastrophic with the risk of
    brain ischemia. For instance, blood loss causes reduction in MAP while an intracerebral
    hematoma will increase ICP which can result in losing consciousness. In a normal
    brain, despite the potential for changes in MAP, CBF remains constant over a wide
    range of CPPs achieved by a process called auto-regulation. CPP is related to
    CBF and is modifiable through its relationship with MAP and ICP [4]. As a result,
    CPP has been the subject of significant research efforts as a factor influencing
    outcomes in several brain pathologies, most notably TBI. Numerous retrospective
    series and data bank studies have favored the invasive ICP monitoring technique
    [6, 7]. Wilson et al. [8] illustrate how different types of ICP sensors can be
    inserted into brain in an invasive procedure. Kang et al. [9] report materials,
    device architectures, integration strategies, and in vivo demonstrations in rats
    of implantable, multifunctional silicon sensors for the brain, for which all the
    constituent materials naturally resorb via hydrolysis and/or metabolic action,
    eliminating the need for extraction. In their experiments, insulated percutaneous
    wires connect to an externally mounted, miniaturized wireless potentiostat for
    data transmission where continuous monitoring of ICP and temperature illustrates
    functionality essential to the treatment of TBI. This paper presents a method
    based on cloud computing to capture medical data from the sensor using Raspberry
    Pi and push data to the cloud to perform analysis and finally broadcast the result
    to medical professionals via an Android application in real time. There are several
    methods to determine the cerebral circulation. Doppler’s principle is the most
    common principle applied by the existing biometric sensors [12]. They have an
    advantage of generating high frequency signal; however, the signal is easily used
    and can be used for flow velocity assessment only. Yet another commonly used technology
    is measurement of absorbance of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin. The only
    drawback in this method would be uncertain intracranial contribution to signal.
    For more precise measurements, thermal diffusion principle is used. A Doppler
    sensor can be integrated to a wireless communication protocol such as XBEE or
    NFC (Near Field Communication). These modules can be configured to determine the
    MAP and ICP algorithm. 2.2 Cloud Computing Basics Cloud Computing is a model of
    accessing a shared pool of computing resources such as storage, services, networks,
    and applications on demand, without worrying about how these resources are made
    available. These resources can be dynamically configured depending on the need
    or the rate of consumption and released when not needed. This allows organizations
    to avoid up-front infrastructure costs. Furthermore, it enables firms to focus
    on their core businesses. Figure 2 shows a typical cloud architecture. The cloud
    architecture typically consists of a front end platform or client such as mobile
    devices or internet browsers, back end platforms such as servers, a cloud based
    delivery, and a network such as internet. Fig. 2. A typical cloud computing architecture.
    Full size image Cloud client can be a computer hardware or software. Users can
    access the data stored in cloud using network enabled devices such as tablets
    or smart phones. These cloud clients rely on cloud computing for all or majority
    of their applications. Cerebral circulation data is pushed to the cloud using
    Raspberry Pi microcontroller and is stored in a cloud database to be processed
    and analyzed. The result of the analysis is available to medical professionals
    via mobile application. Typical stages of high level data flow are shown in Fig.
    3. Initially we push the raw medical data to cloud. Data will be analyzed and
    processed afterwards and results will be available to medical personnel and the
    patient. Several medical algorithms can be incorporated in the cloud to monitor
    the pattern of circulation. These algorithms can be used to determine the risk
    involved in the patient developing neurological disorders. If the risk is above
    a certain threshold, the doctor is immediately notified by the cloud service by
    sending text messages or invoking SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to generate
    a customized e-mail with vital medical information. Fig. 3. High level data flow
    push, process and pull with cloud. Full size image Data at first stage is raw
    meaning it needs further processing to transform into information, knowledge and
    later wisdom. Figure 4 demonstrates Ackoff’s DIKW [13] (Data/Information/Knowledge/Wisdom)
    pyramid. This figure describes the process required till raw data transforms to
    some meaningful and applicable wisdom. Fig. 4. Ackoff’s DIKW pyramid. Full size
    image In earlier schemes of IoT systems, processing data was performed after collecting
    data by the sensors and the result was sent to the cloud. Advanced analytical
    algorithms were applied on raw data to extract meaning and context out of raw
    data. However due to advancement in cloud computing technology in modern systems
    and high level of integration of processing units into sensors, these steps can
    vary in order, offering more system performance and flexibility. This will let
    the developers perform some of the data processing at later stages in the cloud
    after data is transmitted to the higher levels of network. Using this method,
    a higher level of knowledge can be transmitted to the hub for post-processing.
    Figure 5 compares these two schemes. While in central scheme data interpretation
    is done in the last level; e.g. cloud; distributed scheme tends to refine data
    before transmitting it to the cloud. This would offer higher flexibility and simpler
    hardware within sensor nodes or hubs. Fig. 5. Central (top) vs. distributed (bottom)
    interpretation. Full size image 2.3 Big Data Frameworks and Processing Medical
    institutions, scientific research labs and hospitals are moving to big data analytics
    to alleviate healthcare costs, predicting epidemics and enhancing the quality
    of human life by altering the models of treatment delivery. With the increase
    in the number of health records of millions of people to tens of billions, computing
    technology and infrastructure need to render a cost efficient implementation of
    data processing model. The new model has to provide storage for billions and trillions
    of unstructured data sets, fault tolerance along with high availability of the
    system. Hadoop technology [14] is successful meeting these challenges by offering
    the capability to process thousands of terabytes of data. By the end of 2017 in
    collaboration with the American Biotechnology firm Illumina and Genomics England
    targets to map 100,000 human genomes to develop personalized medication for cancer
    patients [14]. In our development, continuous monitor, store and analyses of blood
    flow in veins and arteries of brain is achieved by collecting the data from sensors
    and pushing them to the cloud via Raspberry Pi using Wi-Fi. Rapid alerts can be
    sent to medical professionals was successfully achieved by using Hadoop ecosystem
    components, Apache Spark, Apache Hive and Storage Tools S3, DynamoDB, EMR and
    EC2. Section D elaborates how these tools and web services are used in our implementation.
    2.4 Web Services and Tools It is critical to understand the design flow in this
    section before elaborating the tools used in our implementation. Our approach
    is inspired by Amazon SBS [10]; a cloud-connected kegerator; that sends sensor
    data (beer flow and in our case cerebral circulation data flow) to AWS [5]. SBS
    publishes sensor data collected by an IoT enabled device (Raspberry Pi) to an
    AWS application program interface (API) gateway over HTTPS. For our project, we
    propose the Raspberry Pi model B+ developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation [11] for
    interfacing with the cerebral data collection sensors. It leverages an ARM processor,
    provides an SD card for storage, and exposes several dozen GPIO pins to interface
    with sensors as well as Ethernet port. Figure 6 shows the high level design flow
    incorporated into our proposed scheme using AWS and tools for cloud computing
    applications. The Python code running on the Pi polls the sensors and collects
    the result into a JSON (Javascript Object Notation); a minimal readable format
    used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application. It is then
    transmitted to Amazon API Gateway by using EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) instance.
    EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
    By associating the created EC2 instance to a static IP address we are going to
    enable communication with the internet. API gateway is used to create, publish,
    maintain, monitor, and secure APIs and fits perfectly with IoT cases such as our
    experiment. Fig. 6. CBF monitoring IoT enabled cloud architecture. Full size image
    From API Gateway, the payload can take two different paths: intermittent and speed.
    Since this is critical data we choose speed path. AWS Lambda function [5] facilitates
    the speed path and pushes and stores data into a table hosted by Amazon DynamoDB.
    DynamoDB is a low latency non SQL (noSQL) based cloud database that provides a
    mechanism for storage and retrieval of data modeled in means other than the tabular
    relations used by relational SQL based databases. In order to prepare the data
    for further processing, data from DynamoDB tables should be exported to Simple
    Storage Service (S3) bucket. S3 [7] is used for object storage with a basic web
    service interface to store and retrieve any quantity of data from anywhere on
    the internet. Detail of this process will be elaborated in Section III. During
    this process, Amazon Elastic Map Reducer (EMR) [6] is used which manages the cluster
    platform by running big data frameworks such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark
    on AWS to process and analyze vast amount of data. Amazon EMR maintains Apache
    Hadoop which is an open source; Java based programming framework that supports
    processing and storage of large data sets in a distributed computing environment.
    Using EMR, we can also run the distributed framework such as Apache Spark and
    interact with data storages such as S3 and DynamoDB. Apache Spark is an open-source,
    distributed processing platform used for big data workloads that supports general
    batch processing proper for operations such as streaming analytics and graph databases
    used in our experiment. Finally, in order to perform mathematical calculations
    on data, we need to send the data to Apache Zeppelin notebook, a web based notebook
    that enables interactive analytics with using languages such as Scala, SQL, or
    IPython. The latter was used in our application. 3 Design Flow Figure 7 shows
    the detail of our design flow with a summary of the tasks to be implemented at
    each step. Initially medical data (i.e. medical data such as MAP and ICP collected
    by the sensors connected to patient) will be pushed from Raspberry Pi via WiFi
    to the cloud by creating Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) [5] instance that
    provides a scalable computing capacity associated to our application. This connects
    our instance from Raspberry Pi and stores the data to the database table hosted
    by Amazon DynamoDB database. In order to process the data in the cloud including
    mathematical calculations, we need to send the data to Apache Zeppelin notebook
    to perform interactive analytics. We can transfer the data from DynamoDB to Apache
    Zeppelin via Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). At first, we will migrate data
    from DynamoDB database to S3 and store the input data into a S3 bucket. To be
    able to perform this process, Amazon DynamoDB integrates Amazon EMR. Amazon EMR
    lets us create tables that can store data natively in an EMR cluster or they can
    be mapped to data stored externally such as in DynamoDB and S3. Using EMR, we
    can export DynamoDB table data into S3 bucket or load data from S3 bucket to a
    DynamoDB table. This can be advantageous as complex queries and data mining can
    be efficiently implemented on the native data. Fig. 7. CBF monitoring cloud computing
    design flowchart. Full size image The process of exporting data from DynamoDB
    table to S3 bucket starts by creating two external hive tables as shown in Fig.
    8. Fig. 8. Export/import process to/from Dynamo DB/S3. Full size image One of
    the external hive tables maps to the DynamoDB table and the other will map to
    S3 bucket where data is stored. We use Apache Hive to process data stored in a
    DynamoDB table, S3 table, etc. Hive is a data warehouse application for Hadoop
    that allows processing and analyzing data from multiple sources. Hive provides
    a SQL like language; HiveQL; that allows working with data stored locally in the
    Amazon EMR cluster or in an external data source such as DynamoDB or S3. Data
    is first delivered from DynamoDB to external hive table and then it will be sent
    to native hive table and from there to another external hive table and finally
    gets stored in S3 bucket. After copying the data to S3, we will create another
    cluster known as Apache Spark. With this cluster, we can use Apache Zeppelin to
    create a notebook. We used IPython in Zeppelin notebook to transfer the data from
    the S3 bucket to notebook. Now data processing including mathematical calculations
    can be performed and the results can be transferred back to DynamoDB through S3
    bucket and hives using Zeppelin notebook again. Using this scheme, data can be
    exported/imported to/from S3/DynamoDB frequently. Furthermore, uploading periodic
    bulk of data from another application can be done this way using scripts and schedules.
    In our proposed scheme, constraints can be added to DynamoDB tables to check if
    there are any changes in the patterns of CBF over a period of time or if a specific
    threshold limit has been crossed. In that case, proper alert messages can be sent
    to medical professionals via Android mobile application which is also developed
    by the authors. Graph charts of corresponding parameters such as CBF, MAP, and
    ICP can be displayed on mobile screens for better clarity. 4 Android Application
    Development The user interface for the proposed design would be an application
    running on Android platform. The application was developed using Android Studio
    integrated development environment (IDE). To integrate AWS with Android Studio,
    we used AWS software development kit (SDK) for Android. We used ProGuard that
    has built-in support for cloud platforms, enabling the user with Firebase Cloud
    Messaging (FCM). The processed medical data in the cloud can be pulled by the
    Android application by creating an API. Developing a mobile based platform application
    would not just allow users to easily access the medical information but also cuts
    down the expense involved in manufacturing the biometric device. The primary functionality
    of the mobile application is to establish a secure connection with the cloud and
    obtain the transmitted sensor values. The application takes advantage of the GSM
    (Global System for Mobile) communication module present in the mobile device to
    send messages and make phone calls directly from the application itself. The developed
    user interface (UI) is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9. Android emulator developed to
    display CPP data. Full size image As it can be seen in the application screenshot,
    the MAP and ICP values are captured by the sensors and pushed to the cloud using
    Raspberry Pi. CPP value can be calculated using our cloud computing algorithm
    and the results can be displayed on Android mobile device. Anomalies can be detected
    by checking constraints deployed in the algorithm in the cloud. Once detected,
    the alert notification can be sent to medical professionals by forwarding the
    values through text messages or phone calls. The developed code running on smart
    device can establish the connection with the cloud to read the data (result of
    the analysis) from the network and route it to the target device/s. Figure 10
    shows the detailed of the application developed. Fig. 10. Android application
    flowchart. Full size image 5 Future Work and Conclusion This paper presented a
    novel application for cloud computing enabled by IoT through innovative schemes
    to monitor CBF which is critical in monitoring patients with serious brain damage.
    The proposed scheme in this paper covers the cloud computing implementation as
    well as Android application development as UI while the front end of the design
    (interface with sensor using Raspberry Pi) remains as future work. The cloud computing
    and application components were verified with test data. The cerebral circulation
    data has been stored in the cloud without any errors and the cloud computing algorithm
    running in the cloud was implemented. Furthermore, the developed UI found to send
    messages effectively and immediately to the medical professionals using smart
    devices when an anomaly is detected. Throughout this implementation, various parameters
    of cerebral circulation such as MAP, ICP, and CPP have been monitored and measured.

    Food production takes up almost half of the planets land surface. About 40% of
    the earths land is now given over to agriculture, and it consumes 85% of available
    fresh water. Due to globalization and population growth this figure of water conservation
    has been increasing every year. So it became a major challenge to every nation
    for reducing the farm water consumption. For better irrigation system, it is very
    crucial to measure the soil moisture for agriculture application, so that it will
    help farmers to manage their farm land more effectively. IOT is the technology
    that enhance the Internet connectivity from digital devices to physical objects
    and establishes communication between them. The data collected are stored and
    managed at the cloud as well as shared between person to person, machine to machine,
    or person to machine. The invent of loT would discover the new ways that put full
    potential of agriculture yield and mitigate the challenges that hinders the growth
    of crops. With the lOT, the monitoring of weather forecast, soil temperature and
    humidity, soil moisture level, remote water valves, pest control could be connected
    and information gathered from the sensors is exchanged to the farmers via mobile
    phones. Soil moisture is an important component on a small agriculture scale as
    well as large agriculture scale modeling. Vegetation and crops mainly depends
    on the root level of moisture present in the soil. Knowledge of degree of soil
    wetness helps farmers to understand the condition of field and accordingly they
    react on it. Soil moisture determines the measure of soil water content which
    defines its expression in terms of mass or volume of water content of the soil.
    On the basis of mass, soil water content is expressed in the gravimetric soil
    moisture content θ g [9] is given by: θg=Mwater/Msoil, (1) View Source where Mwater
    is the mass of the water in the soil, and Msoil is the mass of the dry soil present
    in the field. The volumetric soil moisture content of a soil θv , is defined by:
    θv=Vwater/Vsample (2) View Source where Vwater is the volume of water content
    in the soil and Vsample is the total volume of dry soil +water+ air present in
    the sample of field. Both the values θg and θv are usually expressed in percent.
    The relationship between the gravimetric soil moisture content and volumetric
    soil moisture content is: θv=θg(ρb/ρw) (3) View Source where ρb is the dry soil
    bulk density and ρw is the soil water density. Over irrigation of the plants may
    perish the plants roots of oxygen and causes them to putrefy and it leads to soil
    fungal diseases [3]. Research has been done that about 80% of the crop is destroyed
    due to over irrigation, which reduces the growth of crops yield. On the other
    hand, sometimes due to scarcity of water, field become dry and the plants will
    not receive enough nutrients for the growth of crops. To satisfy the increasing
    demand for determining the soil moisture status, lOT and use cases play a vital
    role in the field of agriculture industry. One of use case we implemented and
    tested by deploying moisture sensor in the sample of pot. The sensor data feeds
    to the Losant cloud platform interface to help the intended persons make timely
    decisions. Data is available instantly in the App to view the moisture level anytime
    or anywhere in the world. SECTION II. Literature Survey Monitoring of volumetric
    soil moisture content of the field is a significant factor for the pavement performance.
    Understanding the effects of the soil moisture on performance is crucial. This
    paper [1] proposed a system for monitoring the soil moisture using homemade soil
    moisture sensor and Arduino Uno board. The eminent feature of this system is to
    measure the soil moisture along the depth which can determine the time of water
    supply to reach the crop roots. This improves the cost efficiency and water resources
    management. This paper[2] shows the analysis of different types of moisture sensor
    compared to the different types of soil. It includes sensors like commercialized
    soil moisture sensor, galvanized steel nails and gypsum block and soils taken
    in experimentation were silt oil, clay soil, sandy soil. After analysis it describes
    that for real or actual implementations the combination of these three types of
    soil with different proportion ratio of each soil is best soil for plant growth.
    Nowadays, many garden centres uses a timer-controlled sprinkler which automatically
    supply the water to the plants irrespective of the content of moisture present
    in the soil that leads to over irrigation of plants. This paper[3] present a system
    that is capable of measuring the soil moisture of the soil. It uses a Teensy 2.0
    micro-controller with a dual output tap timer. Thus the plant will supply water
    whenever the content of moisture in the soil becomes low. Watering is the most
    important aspect in the growth of plants. Thus water should be supply at the right
    time whenever required by the plants. This paper[4] proposed an automatic plant
    watering system by using sprinkler systems, pipes and a nozzle. For the control
    of the whole system an ATmega328 micro-controller is used and it programmed in
    such a way that it sense the moisture level and water according to them. So conservation
    of water is possible by this approach. This approach[5], [6] design a wireless
    sensor network using an arduino with a grove moisture sensor and water flow sensor.
    It uses a zigbee protocol for the communication among them and the status of the
    system will be displayed on web portal. The intimation about the water flow will
    also sent to the users phone using GSM. The approach given in this paper[7] is
    to developed a system for monitoring the soil moisture content of soil by using
    lOT, mobile computing technology and cloud computing. CC3200 launch pad is interfaced
    with a soil moisture sensor and data is stored in the AT&T M2X cloud technology
    and blynk application is used in android phone by the user to check the status
    anywhere and make timely decision. SECTION III. Design and Implementation The
    overview architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 3. In this system
    nodemcu board which acts like a client publishes the sensor data into the Losant
    Message Broker using the MQTT protocol on to the topic losant/DEVICE_ID/state.
    In order to understand the messages of losant, a defined json-based payload must
    be followed. The published data will automatically store in the losant and make
    it available in visualization tool of losant platform. In order to subscribe the
    stored data from the losant MQTT broker the client must subscribe to the commands
    that are initiated using losant workflow on to the topic Losant/DEVICE_ID/commands.
    Fig. 1. Block diagram of soil monitoring system Show All A. NodeMCU V1.0 NodeMCU
    V1.0 is an open source loT platform with ESP8266-12E chips. It is low-cost, breadboard
    friendly, integrate a USB to serial chip, and a simple USB to micro USB cable
    can be used to powered this board. This modules aimed for developing ESP8266 based
    Lua loT applications and it includes firmware that runs on the ESP8266 wifi SoC
    from Espressif system. This development board provides access to the GPIO(General
    purpose Input/Output) subsystem. Based on ESP8266 there are jungle of available
    modules and every module has certain advantages and disadvantages, depending on
    the targeted application. The following table gives the comparison of some of
    the ESP8266 modules: Fig. 2. NodeMCU board Show All B. Moisture Sensor Soil moisture
    sensor is used for measuring the volumetric water content of the soil and loss
    of moisture which occurs due to evaporation and plant uptake. For survival of
    all plants, water is the most important factor. This soil moisture sensor determines
    the amount of water required for irrigation of plants. This module consists of
    LM393 comparator with a potentiometer included in it for adjusting the soil wet/dry
    detection sensitivity according to the requirements of plants. There are two types
    of soil moisture sensor: Frequency domain sensor and neutron moisture gauze. Frequency
    domain sensor has an oscillating circuit which measures the soil water content.
    The basic principle is that it measures the soils dielectric constant which determines
    the velocity of electromagnetic wave through the soil. When the soils water content
    increases, the dielectric of soil also increases which can be used to estimate
    how much amount of water the soil holds. Other one is neutron moisture gauze,
    that works on the moderator properties of water for neutrons. The basic principle
    is that fast neutrons are emitted from the decaying radioactive source, and when
    the collision occurs between neutrons and protons, they slow down dramatically.
    By measuring the density of slowed-down neutrons around the probes of moisture
    sensor can estimate the volumetric content of water the soil holds. Fig. 3. Moisture
    sensor Show All Table I Technical specification of wemos 1) LM393 Driver LM393
    comparator is used to compare the soil moisture level with the preset threshold
    value. This device consists of two independent low voltage comparators which is
    designed specifically to operate over a wide range of voltages from a single power
    supply. The unique characteristics of these comparators is that the input common
    mode voltage range includes ground even though operation is done from the single
    power supply voltage. It is available in DIP8, SO-8, TSSOP8, miniSO-8, and DFNB
    2*2mm packages. Some features of this device is given in Table III: Table II Pin
    definition Table III Technical specification SECTION IV. Losant Losant is a simple
    and powerful IOT cloud platform that makes building real-time connected solutions
    a breeze. It provides connectivity from one to billions of devices by using open
    communication standard like MQTT and REST and help in turn raw data into insight.
    The data are fully encrypted using the industry standard TLS(Transport Layer Security)
    encryption protocol. Losant provides robust data collection, aggregation, visualization
    and graph our path with real time device states and sensors data. Losants drag
    and drop workflow editor allows us to trigger actions, notification and M2M communication
    without using programming. MQTT is a lightweight preferred communication protocol
    that easily wrap up the communication between our devices and the Losant platform.
    The core concept of MQTT protocol is publishing and subscribing to topics by the
    clients via the central service called message broker. Clients can publish any
    data they prefer to any topics they select. Others clients then subscribe to those
    topics to retrieve that data. In order to support existing MQTT implementations,
    Losant provides an MQTT message broker that will be open for all the clients and
    it is responsible for properly routing messages to the subscribers. Losant message
    broker can be reached using several transport protocol like TCP, TLS, Websockets,
    Secure Websockets. Losant provides an opinionated MQTT implementation for further
    features of Losant like data collection, visualization, and workflow. Connecting
    with Losant platform is very easy and it took 4 simple steps which are as follows:
    Create an Application: An application is created by some meaningful name which
    contains all the devices and workflow that makes us convenient to connect us with
    the real world. Add a Device: In Losant a device is a single thing or widget.
    It could be anything from a simple car, smart devices, thermostat to any kind
    of custom gadgets. Create a Workflow: Complex interactions between our devices
    and 3rd party system can be easily build by simply using drag and drop workflow
    editor. Its output can also be used to track data by storing it in virtual device.
    Create a Dashboard: Losant platform provide a flexible and powerful way to visualize
    and analyze the data we stored in our device. This dashboard generator is used
    to display the information relevant to our specific connected solutions. Fig.

    Realization Moisture Sensor Kit is realized using NodeMCU development board having
    an ESP8266 WiFi module mounted on it and a pre-wired soil moisture sensor module.
    The soil moisture sensor module connected with LM393 comparator, gives an active-high(H)
    level output when the soil is dry. This digital output (dry soil-H / wet soil-L)
    is routed to one of the I/O terminal (AO) of the nodeMCU micro-controller. Based
    on this input (at AO) nodeMCU gives an active-low output through D1 when the soil
    is wet, and an active-high input when the soil is dry. Using male-to-female jumper
    wires connections can be established. Wiring diagram is shown in the fig: 8. A
    micro USB cable is used in nodeMCU board for power supply. In Losant platform
    while creating a new device, the device ID is generated. This ID is required in
    software part. For the authentication of our device against the Losant platform
    some security keys need to generate that provides access to all the devices in
    our application. This keys are also required in programming. Fig. 6. Creating
    workflow Show All Fig. 7. Creating dashboard Show All Table IV Soil condition
    with its LED status SECTION VI. Software Realization For all Losant IoT developer
    kits an environmental setup must be done before flashing the firmware into the
    device. An USB drivers is installed in the Arduino IDE. For this workshop a few
    libraries require to be installed. The required libraries are PubSubClient, ArduinoJson
    and Losant Arduino MQTT Client. After the environmental setup a Moisture Sensor
    firmware will be flashing to the device. In the kit source code few things need
    to be modified such as WIFI_SSID, wifi_pass, Losant_Device_ID, Losant_access_Key,
    Losant access secret. Now upload the firmware to the device and after every 60
    seconds the firmware is publishing the state of moisture value to the losant.
    The moisture values varies between 0-1024 that the micro-controller ADC is providing.
    Higher values means less moisture and lower values means more moisture. Fig. 8.
    Circuit connection. Show All SECTION VII. Testing and Results The complete hardware
    and software setup have been done to monitor the soil moisture of the field. We
    have tested in a small scale by inserting a moisture sensor and visualize the
    readings. In order to view the results in Losant platform, a dashboard is created
    named desk plant. A gauze block and a time series graph is being customized to
    view the moisture level over time as shown in fig:. We have import workflow in
    Losant platform to setup an alerts via SMS or an email to the intended person.
    This alerts will be active whenever the moisture level of the plants will be less
    and we are being notified by SMS or email as shown in fig: 10 as well as the board
    will subscribe to the commands back from the losant to turn on the LED if the
    percentage of moisture in the soil is below the threshold value. Fig. 9. Screenshot

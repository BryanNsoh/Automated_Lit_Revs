    agricultural producers using modern data collection tools have several thousand
    data collection points in the fields. However, the difficulties arising in the

    of the most promising areas of increasing the productivity of agrophytocenoses
    associated with increasing soil fertility, resource conservation and compliance
    with environmental standards is the use of digital technologies and intelligent
    decision support systems within the framework of programmable management of agricultural
    production based on neural networks. The development of deep machine learning
    methods and algorithms has made it possible to widely implement artificial intelligence
    systems in various sectors of the national economy, including agriculture. According
    to the “Strategy of Scientific and Technological development of the Russian Federation”
    and within the framework of the implementation of the program “Digital Agriculture”
    in the coming years, one of the priority areas of development is the transition
    to highly productive agro-agricultural farming. At the present stage, modern agricultural
    techniques are used in the practice of precision farming, including continuous
    provision of irrigation areas with water throughout the growing season, which
    causes a significant overestimation of irrigation standards. At the same time,
    obtaining the maximum amount of production per unit of water used is not taken
    into account as a basic requirement for irrigation regime, optimization of water
    supply of all crops is irrigated crop rotation and prevention of negative environmental
    consequences. Modern economic, social and natural-economic conditions of irrigation
    are characterized by increased requirements for the rational use of available,
    often limited, resources and the prevention of negative impact on the environment.
    Under such circumstances, it is necessary to plan irrigation of agricultural crops
    on new methodological bases focused on achieving maximum efficiency of agricultural
    systems, which can be achieved only with operational irrigation planning [1, 2,
    8]. Precision agriculture in the global understanding of relationships is a complex
    dynamic natural and technical system with nonlinear dependencies. Therefore, traditional
    approaches based only on physical modeling of natural and technical processes
    and relationships often make it difficult to find effective solutions. Technological
    advances that stimulate unprecedented data growth, rapid extraction of meaningful
    information from the modern data stream, can improve the efficiency of solutions
    in agriculture [10,11,12]. Along with this, new tools for data mining and deep
    learning provide increased accuracy due to the resolution of complex relationships
    in large volumes of natural and synthetic parameters and have great potential.
    In recent years, a large number of foreign studies have focused on the application
    of data mining and deep learning methods to improve the efficiency of irrigated
    agriculture [13, 14]. An intelligent cotton irrigation management system, decision
    support systems for irrigation management have been developed, new approaches
    and tools for intelligent forecasting of climatic parameters have been proposed
    [3,4,5,6,7, 9]. Classical approaches to solving problems of data processing, computer
    vision, image analysis and segmentation, based on deep machine learning using
    computerized systems, were considered in the works of Wiener N. [8], Hebb D. O.
    [9], Rosenblatt F. [10]. Modern approaches to program control in precision farming
    using intelligent technologies were studied by Solovyov D. A. [11], Cheng G. and
    Bian, X. [12, 13], Trukhachev V.I. [14] Aksenov A. G. [15], Mohammed Abbas Kadhim
    [8], etc. The aim of the study is the design and software implementation of a
    neural network system for managing the productivity of agrophytocenoses, in particular,
    the development of a computer program for the analysis and visualization of problem
    areas of agricultural fields of various nature using a convolutional network based
    on remote monitoring data. 2 Objectives of Studies The purpose of the article
    is to monitor and manage agrophytocenosis productivity based on deep neural network
    algorithms. 3 Data and Methods Data Mining methods solve many problems of data
    analysis: classification, regression, search for associative rules and clustering.
    Below is a brief description of each task: 1. The task of classification is to
    determine the class of an object by its characteristics. 2. The regression task
    is to determine the value of some of its parameters by the known characteristics
    of the object. 3. Search for associative rules – finding frequent dependencies
    between objects or events. The task of clustering is to search for independent
    groups and their characteristics in the entire set of analyzed data. Finding models
    in the data that cannot be found by traditional methods is the goal of Data Mining.
    There are two types of such models: predictive and descriptive. One of these models
    is neural networks, a class of models based on a biological analogy with the human
    brain. After passing the training stage on the prepared data, the neural network
    is able to solve a variety of data analysis tasks. In the process of planning
    the use of neural networks, the question of choosing a specific network architecture
    first appears. The size and structure of the network should correspond to the
    nature of the phenomenon under study. But at the start of the analysis, the essence
    of the phenomenon is usually poorly known, then the choice of network architecture
    often becomes a difficult task and in most cases is associated with a long process
    of testing a certain network architecture on a specific task. After choosing the
    architecture and building, the network goes through the training procedure. At
    this stage, each neuron of the network iteratively processes the input data and
    changes its weights so that the network forecasts are as accurate as possible.
    And after all these stages, the network is ready to work and can be used for forecasting.
    Due to the increased interest in neural networks, more and more new types of their
    architecture are emerging. The most of the existing types of neural networks.
    From the point of view of topology, there are three main types of neural networks:
    networks with direct connections; feedback networks; regular (competing) networks.
    The first type of neural networks is characterized by the propagation of signals
    in the forward direction – from inputs to outputs. The biologically motivated
    model “Neocognitron” created in 1980, designed to solve the problems of translationally
    invariant image processing, predetermined the popularity of the use of CNN in
    the field of computer vision [8,9,10,11,12]. Convolutional Neural Networks of
    classical architecture are a multi-stage cascade of direct distribution networks,
    the structure of which includes convolutional layers, integration layers and layers
    of direct distribution with training. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
    deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) are very different from other types
    of networks. They are usually used for image processing, less often for audio.
    For example, if you have a 200×200 image, you won''t process all 40,000 pixels
    at once. Instead, the network counts a 20×20 square (usually from the upper-left
    corner), then moves 1 pixel and counts a new square, etc. These inputs are then
    passed through convolutional layers in which not all nodes are interconnected.
    These layers tend to shrink with depth, and degrees of two are often used: 32,
    16, 8, 4, 2, 1. In practice, FFNN is attached to the end of the CNN for further
    data processing. Such networks are called deep networks (DCNN). The main element
    of a neural network is a neuron representing the simplest analog converting element,
    as well as modeling the basic concepts of the work of a living neuron. Artificial
    neural networks are parallel computing devices consisting of many interacting
    simple processors. The choice of a convolutional neural network is due to the
    fact that at the moment this type of neural networks has one of the best algorithms
    for image recognition and classification. Compared to a fully connected neural
    network, it has a much smaller number of configurable weights. The main feature
    of a convolutional neural network is “convolution”. The process of “convolution”
    is a reduction in the size of the matrix of features of the input image. To obtain
    a matrix cell of a reduced size, the elements of the original matrix in a certain
    area are multiplied by weight, followed by summation of all elements in this area.
    To get the next cell of the reduced matrix, the area is shifted and the same actions
    are performed. At the moment, one of the best algorithms for solving computer
    vision problems in the framework of image recognition and classification is implemented
    in a convolutional neural network model. The key feature of the convolutional
    model is the implementation of the “convolution” procedure to optimize the size
    of the matrix of features of the input image [9,10,11]: $$ \\left( {I * K} \\right)
    = \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{h} {\\sum\\nolimits_{j = 1}^{w} {{\\text{K}}_{ij} \\times
    I_{x + i - 1,y + k - 1} } } $$ where I - is the initial feature matrix, K - is
    the weight matrix, x, y - are the indices of the selected block, h, w - are the
    height and width. An example of the implementation of the “convolution” procedure
    of an image entering the input is shown in Fig. 1. Convolutional neural networks
    of deep learning (deep learning CNN), thanks to the large capacity of the network
    and the dynamic filling of image datasets, have demonstrated great capabilities
    in solving problems of processing high-resolution images obtained from satellite
    monitoring and remote sensing data [12]. Fig. 1. Block diagram of the process
    of classification of images of agricultural crops and localization of extracted
    plots Full size image Mathematical formalization of an artificial neuron – the
    adder equation: \\({\\text{S}}_{k} = \\sum\\nolimits_{j = 1}^{n} {W_{j,k} *} x_{j}
    + b_{k}\\) and the activation block equation yk = φ(Sk), where for the к-neuron:
    x1, x2,…, xn – are input signals, w1,k, w2,k…, wn,k – are synoptic weights, bk
    – is the level of the reference signal, sk – is the output of the linear adder,
    φ(Sk) – is the conversion function of the activation unit, yк – is the output
    signal. 4 Results and Discussion The developed structure of an intelligent system
    for increasing the productivity of agrophytocenoses based on a deep neural network
    is shown in the Fig. 2. Fig.2. Class diagram of the designed system Full size
    image The software implementation of one of the software modules for recognizing
    dry soil areas of the developed intelligent system is based on a framework using
    the Python language with an integrated OpenCV library. Fig. 3. Class diagram Full
    size image The intelligent system is designed for recognition, processing and
    analysis as objects of identification of aerial photographs of agricultural crops
    based on the use of a multi-layer neural network of deep learning with the allocation
    of drained areas. The use of the software tool is possible for research and study
    of the peculiarities of cultivation in conditions of irrigation and differentiated
    placement. The result of segmentation of aerial photographs of agricultural crops
    with the allocation of drained areas is shown in Fig. 4. The software package
    developed by the authors, which includes the computer module “Analysis and visualization
    of problem areas of agricultural fields by a neural network” is designed for recognition,
    processing and analysis, as objects of identification, aerial, photo and satellite
    images of crops based on the use of convolutional neural networks. Deep learning
    networks with identification of problem areas of various nature. The result of
    recognition, processing and analysis of satellite images with their subsequent
    segmentation and identification of problem areas of various nature is shown in
    Fig. 4. Fig. 4. The results of processing aerial photographs of agricultural crops
    with the allocation of drained and defective areas of various nature Full size
    image The convolutional neural network used for training was tested on a specific
    sample at each of the training epochs. The training of the neural network was
    completed when the result of guessing on a manually selected set of images for
    testing reached 90%. Figures 5 a, b below show graphs of the losses and accuracy
    of the trained neural network at each epoch. Fig. 5 a. Graph of losses during
    neural network training b. Graph of neural network accuracy during training Full
    size image For the validation sample, 10% of the total sample used in training
    was used. For the test sample, images that are not included in the training set
    of images were used. They were manually labeled and transmitted to the network
    in order to approximately evaluate its behavior in real conditions when the transmitted
    images do not match those on which the network was trained. As can be seen from
    the graphs presented, the percentage of correctly recognized images in the validation
    sample is higher than in the test sample. This is explained by the fact that at
    each epoch, the validation sample was randomly selected from the total set of
    images. Therefore, the image entering it in previous epochs passed through the
    network and directly affected its weights, while the test sample did not affect
    the training of the network. After the 10th epoch, it was decided to stop the
    learning process, since the percentage of guessing on the test sample began to
    decrease, which indicates that the network has retrained. 5 Conclusion ensuring

    in the fields of electronic communication, data processing, and internet technologies
    enable easy access to and interaction with a variety of physical devices throughout
    the globe. Our whole world is enveloped by a blanket of innumerable smart devices
    equipped with the sensors and actuators. Extensive research on the Internet of
    things (IoT) with cloud technologies, make it possible to accumulate tremendous
    data created from this heterogeneous environment and transform it into precious
    knowledge by utilizing data mining technologies. Furthermore, this generated knowledge

    industries all over the globe are vigorously pursuing research and contributing
    a lot in lifeless objects (things) to make them live and work smartly. The global
    giants including Apple, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Cisco, Siemens, Huawei and Research
    communities including Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Computing (MC), Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), Machine to Machine communication (M2M), Pervasive Computing
    (PC), Cyber-Physical System (CPS) etc., around the globe, are working persistently
    for the formation of new Concepts and Standards to create Smart environment (Stankovic,
    2014, Kravchenko, et al., 2017, Miorandi et al., 2012). The basic idea of Internet
    of Things is that the things/ objects can be connected to the internet. They should
    have a unique identity, should be identified automatically, and should communicate
    with each other and the humans. They should make decision by themselves or follow
    the human commands (Tsai et al., 2014). So it’s not wrong if we say, in IoT, internet
    can be considered as a global platform which powers machines and smart things
    to communicate, compute, make decisions and coordinate with the humans globally(Miorandi
    et al., 2012, Bandyopadhyay and Sen, 2011). The question now arises that why Research
    communities and Industries around the globe have a sudden interest in the Internet
    of Things? Researchers around the world hold a view that the cities and world
    itself will be overlaid with the sensing and actuation devices in the next 5–10
    Years. The density of sensing and actuating devices will increase many more times
    than the population of the world. Ericsson and Cisco predicted that “50 billion
    of small embedded sensors and actuators will be connected to the internet by the
    end of year 2020 and Internet of Things will create 14.4 Trillion dollars of value
    at stake for industries in the next decade” (Google, 2017). So we can say, an
    ultra large number of connected heterogeneous devices will form the Internet of
    Things environment (Stankovic, 2014, Kravchenko, et al., 2017, Miorandi et al.,
    2012, Uusitola, 2006, Ortiz et al., 2014: Bijarbooneh et al., 2006, Yue et al.,
    2014). The heterogeneous smart IoT environments generate enormous amount of data.
    This data is initially a raw data that needs to be processed to be of any use.
    This raw data either belongs to the Infrastructure i.e. it is an infrastructure
    centric data containing devices and network related information; or the data belongs
    to the environmental parameters of IoT constructed environment (Tsai et al., 2014)
    i.e. it contains sensor – recorded outputs, actuator actions etc. Both types of
    data here are inherently heterogeneous in nature. If processed well with an appropriate
    data mining algorithm, one can dig out valuable knowledge from it (Chen et al.,
    2015). A challenging part of any IoT enabled smart environment is to select or
    synthesize the most appropriate data mining algorithm. Such an algorithm should
    produce valuable analytics, predict future events precisely and manage the network
    and services efficiently within all constrains. To understand this in depth, observe
    Fig. 1. The figure depicts several IoT applications ranging from small to large
    scale. Each block represents an IoT application that performs a particular task.
    For e.g., Ambient Assistant Living (AAL) (Youngblood and Cook, 2007, Samarah et
    al., 2017, Joergschmalenstroeer, 2010) where we provide technologically supported
    smart environment, such as healthcare assistant, in home itself. AAL utilizes
    number of smart sensors, actuators, wearable’s, smart gadgets, CCTV cameras and
    communication devices with inter-network connectivity. The devices in AAL environment
    have different capabilities and limitations. They are connected to each other
    via a variety of communication mediums (like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc.). The raw data
    produced from these devices also differ in characteristics. Converting this raw
    data into semantically meaningful corresponding activities so as to identify the
    user’s present state, requires data mining. Therefore, when we process this new
    sort of data with the traditional data mining algorithms, it does not provide
    an accurate insight. And, our system may not establish an intelligent and responsive
    environment. Discussion of this single IoT application highlights the diversity
    of devices and their respective data. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. IoT Applications: from Small scale
    to Large scale. If move diagonally up from left side lower corner in Fig. 1, we
    find IoT applications that comprise of several other small scale applications.
    For example, the smart home envelopes four applications viz. the smart metering,
    the smart environment control, the AAL, and the security. A multistoried smart
    building may have in it: multiple smart apartments, smart offices, a library,
    classrooms, a waste management system, a surveillance system, a smart lift and
    a fire safety and access control management (Pacheco et al., 2019). So a smart
    building can be defined as a fusion of technologies which give thinking capability
    to the building so as to provide a convenient, comfortable, efficient and healthy
    environment to its habitants. Smart transport and healthcare Application has a
    number of smart buildings (residential, hospital, commercial, schools and colleges)
    along with the other applications such as smart vehicles, real-time traffic control,
    metro-train sevices, emergency corridors, disease diagnostics and healthcare being
    operated together for improved quality of living. Last one in Fig. 1 is the smart
    city application that envelops all: smart home, smart building, smart transport,
    smart healthcare and the other essential applications viz. environmental monitoring,
    weather prediction, disaster management, IoT network management, smart grid, urban
    farming, smart watering, smart warehouse, supply chain and logistics, and importantly,
    the device, network privacy and security control management. Smart objects like
    sensors, actuators and embedded devices, in this complex environment of IoT applications,
    produce and consume huge amount of data. Hence, the knowledge extraction (Data
    Mining) mechanism can be considered as the heart of the complete system. Better
    information extraction provides efficient value-added services to the end users.
    Huge numbers of devices, with basic to advanced features, are being connected
    in small to large scale application environments. In such a scenario, it is possible
    that a single device may serve more than one applications. Such situations require
    a centralized middleware so as to ease the development process, create useful
    analytics, provide privacy, security and trust mechanism as well asto support
    interoperability within diverse applications and services (Razzaque et al., 2016).
    Consequently, we predicted astronomically huge heterogeneous network of IoT devices
    with data mining algorithms to subsist as a seamless fabric, covering and synthesizing
    the intelligent environment (Miorandi, et al., 2012). 1.1. Characteristics and
    challenges There are several characteristics of IoT infrastructure and IoT data
    mining algorithms/technologies. These include unique identification of each device,
    ultra large scale network of things, devices and network level heterogeneity,
    ubiquitous integration, interaction and interoperability, robust data and devices
    management, dynamic entry and exiting of devices to the network at very fast rate,
    service oriented computing, Real-Time/Resource-constrained devices and privacy,
    security and trust management (Razzaque et al., 2016, Xu and Helal, 2016, Kantarci
    and Mouftah, 2014, Stojmenovic, 2014). All these characteristics are converting
    research and development of the diverse applications and services into newer challenges:
    Unique Identification of each device • IoT infrastructure: Identification is the
    basic need to establish communication between smart objects. Generation and management
    of unique Id’s globally for trillions of devices is a very challenging task. From
    internet perspective, IPV6 may be helpful but what about the devices communicating
    via alternate mediums like Bluetooth, NFC, Zigbee and many others? Can RFIDs,
    QR codes or similar IDs be the solution? Or should we adopt name centric network
    architecture instead of host centric? Robust naming protocols are lacking and
    are required globally. • IoT data mining: From IoT data mining perspective too,
    unique identification play a very crucial role. Better understanding of data related
    to infrastructure (like unique id, device features etc.) can result in better
    actuation control from derived knowledge. Acquiring, storing and managing unique
    id of trillions of devices and related features is another big challenge. Ultra
    large scale network of things • IoT infrastructure: The blanket of IoT infrastructure
    is fabricated with ultra large scale of sensors, actuators and embedded devices
    where they serve human needs intelligently. To develop a mechanism that supports
    globally unique identification, authenticate access during operation, maintenance,
    and protective utilization on such an ultra large scale are creating several challenges.
    There are even more issues that need to be addressed while dealing with massive
    scaling are the longitudinal studies for the deployment of smart devices, environment
    changes over the time, and self- management/automation with maximum service utilization
    of resource constraint devices (Stankovic, 2014, Kravchenko, et al., 2017, Miorandi
    et al., 2012). • IoT data mining: The huge network of devices generates a new
    type of data known as the IoT big data. The biggest challenge in today’s data
    mining world comes with several issues like data storage, management, privacy,
    security, and processing limitations such as real-time/streaming data. Instead
    of gathering all data in the servers, the data pre-processing techniques like
    the data filtering, dimension reduction, feature selection, pattern reduction
    play crucial role. Devices and network level heterogeneity • IoT infrastructure:
    IoT is a network of versatile devices, where the devices from very few features,
    basic computing, low memory, low power and energy consumption (like RFID, QR codes,
    nano-sensors and actuators, MEMS etc.) to the devices having advanced features,
    extraordinary processing capabilities and larger memories are internetworked and
    slog together for a specific or multiple purposes. In many applications, sensor
    nodes, devices and machines are interconnected using limited communication mode
    (for e.g. Bluetooth and NFC) that make network cluster, and any one higher end
    device of that cluster, connect to a global network. Therefore, IoT is a highly
    dynamic and radically distributed network of things. Synthesizing the robust architectures
    and protocols support and accommodate heterogeneity. How to provide better management
    at all level of technologies, services and applications, is a new challenge for
    the future research. Concurrent and massive access communication between machines
    over radio access networks (i.e. 5G networks) may cause subsequent performance
    degradation, including service unavailability, intolerable delay, and packet loss
    (Oh et al., 2015). Ubiquitous parallel computing and storage with improved existing
    techniques and algorithms seem to be the feasible solutions here. • IoT data mining:
    Compared to the data mining results of traditional huge data set, heterogeneous
    IoT big data mining maximize overall potential with finer knowledge and insight
    of targeted application area. Thais creates series of new opportunity and challenges.
    It an obligation not option, that one has to deal with the structured, the semi-structured
    and the unstructured data all together. Applying data mining in sensor networking
    and device management yield superior results for resource constraint environment
    (e.g. LEACH (Ankerst et al., 1999), DataCloud (Yue et al., 2014)). But yet, it
    is limited to only particular applications and hence is one of the biggest challenges.
    Heterogeneous network here not only access or extract information from larger
    scale data, but it also needs to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and incomplete
    data. Ubiquitous integration, interaction and interoperability • IoT infrastructure:
    The ubiquitous embedded sensors/actuators with highly versatile characteristics
    and protocols participate, and, are shared among many applications in an IoT environment.
    The distinctly critical part is to make automated device integration at immensely
    large scale, and to ensure interoperability among them. Research is needed to
    incorporate a centralized middleware core that can resolve dependencies across
    the applications; support trans-coding between the assorted protocols; perform
    efficient interaction among the devices; and dynamically create and provide innovative
    services. • IoT data mining: Human to human, human to machine and machine to machine
    are the three type of interactions that normally happen in an IoT network. The
    data from the same device may have different meaning according to the type of
    interaction, application and service. Secondly, the same type of data from various
    devices, applications and services may also not pose exactly the same meaning.
    And there is not a single device or application, it’s a huge network. Creating
    the data mining algorithm for such a huge environment is highly critical. Algorithm
    should have the capability to extract knowledge as per the specific service and
    application needs, so that the keen interaction and interoperability can be fabricated.
    Service oriented intelligence • IoT infrastructure: Always ON responsive services
    are the inherent property of IoT environment. It supports every day user needs.
    There are cases where number of devices are either mobile or battery powered that
    may leave and rejoin network many times or they may even randomly join network
    for a specific purpose. In this ubiquitous ever-changing environment, IoT infrastructure
    also sometimes demand ad-hoc applications and services which can be composes,
    executed and demolished in runtime irrespective of whether they have been considered
    while architecting the system. • IoT data mining: The IoT applications environment
    equipped and deployed with a lot of IoT sensors, utilizes tremendous services
    viz. real-time interaction among connected devices, system management, ad-hoc
    applications management, privacy and security management and many more. The management
    of flexible, dynamic and open ad-hoc IoT services becomes possible due to highly
    precise data mining algorithm. Incorporating dynamic knowledge synthesizing capability
    for a randomly originated ad-hoc services is one of the most challenging part
    of an IoT data mining algorithm. Privacy, security and trust management • IoT
    infrastructure: Privacy, security and trust should be integrated at all levels
    in a system. Many IoT applications like healthcare, emergency systems, Physical
    access control and many more are serving human in critical conditions. If someone
    hacks the devices and network, it will be a big threat for many lives. Not only
    the security but maintaining privacy and trust is equally important. Let us take
    example of a smart phone; that has number of apps installed including banking,
    social media, healthcare, entertainment along with other personal data. Wearable
    sensor, healthcare gadgets, smart appliances and other devices are connected to
    this phone via variety of mediums. The phone is maintaining not only one’s privacy
    and security, but is also sharing many important details with the network connected
    devices for uninterrupted smart environment services. Now, if any of the devices
    has leakage, the person’s data will no more remain private (Pacheco et al., 2019,
    Qiu et al., 2019). Developing an interface that can detect attacks and enforce
    privacy, trust and security in this diverse environment is a challenging task.
    • IoT data mining: As the privacy and security mechanisms are designed for a certain
    amount of data with specific characteristic. IoT systems with huge data also poses
    highly divers features set. It contains larger features set of our private data.
    The data mining algorithms are applied over input data that can extract several
    useful and personal information too. This can enable the attacker to weaponize
    the data. Ad-hoc services in web based systems are one of the major threats for
    privacy and security applications which can be resolved using deep learning for
    data mining (Pacheco et al., 2019). Consecutively, one needs to address this issue
    at each level in a distributed manner with adequate mining and management solutions.
    Therefore with the specified characteristics, IoT infrastructure and Machine Learning
    creates robust intelligence i.e. the capability to perceive, reason, decide, perform
    actions, learn and interact (Youngblood and Cook, 2007). Research communities
    and industries are persistently diligent in making this possible in the real world.
    Often, researchers around the world find some good implementable ideas, but these
    ideas are tested on small/limited problems or simulated on virtual platforms which
    do not scale appropriately for the larger and complex real-world problem (Yue
    et al., 2014, Joergschmalenstroeer, 2010, Rashidi et al., 2011, Saives et al.,
    2015, Zdravevski et al., 2017, Virone et al., 2008). Also, the research on IoT
    is highly fragmented and so thinking of global solution may not be achievable.
    We require some standards that should be stated globally to lead researches in
    particular direction. 1.2. Literature review and contribution Numerous good surveys
    over IoT and its data have been presented from different perspectives. Stankovic
    (2014) highlighted the vision and characteristics of IoT from a global perspective
    with strong and a very informative discussion over eight research areas. It also
    suggested an architectural approach for IoT to borrow from Smart-Phone world i.e.
    enabling App-Store like environment to ace the development, authentication, installing
    and uninstalling applications and services. (Miorandi et al., 2012) and (Bandyopadhyay
    and sen, 2011) presented the survey from the viewpoint of technologies utilized
    in IoT with the possible research and applications. Reference (Bandyopadhyay and
    sen, 2011) also presented generic five-layer architecture for IoT system design.
    Five layers from bottom to up include edge technology, an access gateway, Internet,
    Middleware and application, whereas in (Razzaque et al., 2016), the survey is
    dedicated to IoT middleware. It focuses on computing, interoperability and communication
    within the heterogeneous environment of applications and services. Dai et al.
    (2019), have investigated the integration of Blockchain technology into IoT Architecture.
    They introduced in-depth, the blockchain technologies with IoT and also presented
    Blockchain of things (BCoT) architecture with several benefits of 5G connectivity
    environment. Phuttharak and Loke (2019) imparted an extensive survey on mobile
    crowd sourcing research, highlighting the aspects of implementation needs during
    the development, architectures, and key considerations for their development.
    All abovementioned surveys are centered on architectural challenges of IoT infrastructure,
    with not much concern about the data mining algorithms. There are several more
    researches that surveyed the convergence of data mining with IoT. References (Tsai
    et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2015, Marjani, et al., 2017, Mohammadi et al., 2018)
    presented a strong and systematic review of data mining algorithms from IoT perspective.
    Considering IoT environment, Tsai et al. (2014) introduced core data mining algorithms
    from “data about things” and “data generated by things” perspective with a unified
    framework that included scan, construct and update functions. Chen et al. (2015)
    presented knowledge, technical and application view. A one step forward, (Marjani,
    et al., 2017, Mohammadi et al., 2018, Nahar et al., 2019) discussed the upcoming
    research challenges due to a new type of big data i.e. the heterogeneous and devices
    engendered IoT big data. Marjani et al. (2017) investigated the Power of IoT big
    data analytics in IoT applications. With the discussion of IoT big data analytics,
    method and techniques, they also presented a cloud oriented IoT big data architecture.
    (Marjani, et al., 2017, Mohammadi et al., 2018) carried out survey on IoT real
    time big data streams and provided an in-depth overview of deep learning algorithms
    and architectures that foster better analytics and learning. In (Mohammadi et
    al., 2018), authors also summarized in detail the major research attempts that
    leveraged deep learning and the approaches supported by Fog and cloud in an IoT
    application environment. Although the above surveys on the IoT and data mining
    are strong enough and provide anin-depth learning and utilization of data mining
    in IoT, they have highlighted the IoT applications part only briefly. Because
    of fragmented research on IoT, the solutions developed while considering one application
    environment may not support other. Therefore, there are diverse survey papers
    presented on IoT and data mining from the perspective of multiple applications.
    The few are: • M. Rashid et al. (2020) discussed and critically analyzed the existing
    behavioral pattern mining algorithms. They also proposed knowledge based framework
    for real-time stream data of numerous sensors in WSN and IoT. • Qolomany et al.
    (2019) conducted a very knowledgeable survey on smart building from the viewpoints
    of applications, data analytics, and machine learning. • Qi Chen et al. (2019)
    provided technical-oriented and application-oriented review of smart city convergence
    with the deep learning. • References (Shu et al., 2018, Pacheco et al., 2019)
    surveyed big data mining and machine learning integrated healthcare and large
    scale petrochemical plant applications, respectively. • Pacheco et al. (2019)
    conducted a systematic survey to explore the deployment of machine learning techniques
    to achieve the network traffic classification. • As most of the knowledge extracted
    contains highly private data of any user, Qiu et al. (2019) attempted survey in
    the field of access control for search engines of IoT environment data from security
    perspective. Survey papers mentioned above pursue effective and knowledge generating
    research. Most of the research is technology, knowledge extraction or analytics
    oriented. Some presented the applications view also, but were specific to a particular
    application viz. smart vehicle or smart city. As we discussed, a wide range of
    applications are fortified by IoT. Many large scale applications may comprise
    lots of small scale applications within it. Therefore, this paper presents an
    application-oriented systematic and detailed review of various Data mining algorithms
    and their variants that are well utilized in an IoT environment. In this application-oriented
    survey, the major contributions of our research work are: • The article explores
    the numerous IoT applications environments and identifies their potential integration
    with diverse data mining algorithms. • In the introduction part, we present edinter-correlation
    of IoT applications for better understanding of the convergence of IoT and data
    mining. Here we have also highlighted the characteristics and its associated challenges.
    • We propose an IoT big data mining system that provides an overview of overall
    complex intellective environment for applications ranging from data extraction
    to the processing and then service execution. • Introduction to key data mining
    algorithms with their variants and their utilization for assisting several intelligent
    operations related to the applications like Smart Home, Ambient Assistant Living,
    and Smart Healthcare, Smart Grid, Industrial IoT, Smart Manufacturing, Smart Agriculture
    and Smart transportation. • Lastly, we summarize the applications environment
    and related open research issues with suggestions for the research aspects of
    data mining and IoT with application perspective. The remaining part of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an IoT big data mining system overview
    containing six layers viz. sensing and actuation, Gateways or pre-processors,
    Internet, decentralized data centers, decentralized data processing and control
    (knowledge discovery), and centralized processing and control. Section 3 discusses
    the key data mining algorithms with simple examples. Section 4 provides an in-depth
    survey of IoT Applications including Smart Home, Ambient Assistant Living, and
    Smart Healthcare, Smart Grid, Industrial IoT and Smart Manufacturing, Smart Agriculture
    and Smart transportation with data mining perspective. Section 5 summarizes all
    in tabular form with open research issues and finally the paper is concluded in
    Section 6. 2. IoT big data mining system overview Billions of devices in smart
    environments can interact and communicate with devices all around and humans as
    well. This engenders a plethora of heterogeneous data. As very well explain in
    (Tsai et al., 2014), the knowledge extracted from this raw data can be categorized
    as the data of IoT infrastructure (i.e. unique ID, type of device, limitations,
    location, connectivity and mobility etc.) and the data measured by the IoT environment
    (i.e. measured external parameters, device to device and device to human intercommunication,
    data interchange and data use logs etc.). The knowledge extracted from both type
    of data, are equally important as the former if optimized properly can drastically
    improve the performance whereas the later qualitatively enhance the services of
    IoT infrastructure (Tsai et al., 2014). So the most paramount question that arises
    now is how to extract higher-level useful information from raw data. Representations
    of these raw data as Machine interpretable and human understandable information
    become the need for current IoT infrastructure (Ganz et al., 2015). For constructing
    knowledge from the raw data we require various data mining and knowledge discovery
    algorithms. As the data is heterogeneous by nature, it demands more than one processing
    (data mining and knowledge discovery) algorithms to work in parallel. In this
    section, we present IoT big data mining system architecture. There are a number
    of architectures already been proposed from different IoT domain perspectives
    (Bandyopadhyay and Sen, 2011, Dai et al., 2019, Marjani, et al., 2017, Mohammadi
    et al., 2018, Rashid et al., 2020). For example, Dai et al. (2019) presented Blockchain
    of things (BCoT) architecture where they introduced Blockchain chain composite
    layer between the network layer and application layer with benefits of 5G connectivity
    environment. Marjani et al. (2017) presented a cloud oriented IoT big data five
    layer architecture (from bottom to up IoT devices, network devices, gateway, cloud
    and data analytics) that investigated the Power of IoT big data analytics in IoT
    applications. By considering above references in our big data mining system architecture
    we undertake relationship among various applications like Smart home, Ambient
    Assisted living, Smart healthcare, Smart Traffic and Parking systems, Industrial
    IoT, Smart Agriculture as the key contribution areas of IoT to shape the Smart
    world. Fig. 2 shows a cloud-assisted system architectural overview for the IoT
    infrastructure. The lowest layer of system architecture comprises of various sensing
    and actuation devices. It includes sensors, actuators, a camera and several small
    embedded systems for home automation, healthcare, traffic, parking, automobile,
    Industries and Agriculture, serving various applications to perform intellectively.
    The raw data produced from various devices like time-series data and sequence
    of events detected, visual and audio data etc. was accumulated by gateway layer
    and pre-processed to remove noise. Repeated sequence/events use various types
    of Gateway processing unit’s viz. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or ZigBee routers with other
    electronic devices like smartphones and small scale embedded systems. Even the
    local server can be a gateway. Other than noise removal, the heterogeneous data
    of IoT environment requires feature extraction and data fusion and projection
    to be performed by the gateway layer. Download : Download high-res image (593KB)

    to the new challenge - known as Big IoT data. The inherent characteristics of
    such raw data are large volume, heterogeneity, velocity of generation and fast
    changing data (GGL, 2017). IoT Big data have time as an integral dimension i.e.
    it should be processed in real time or in particular short period of time otherwise
    after a certain deadline, the result of processing will of no use (Che et al.,
    2013). After gateways, the pre-processed data is sent to decentralized data centers
    via internet. Decentralized processing and controlling stations then extract knowledge
    by putting into service the diverse data mining algorithms and the machine learning
    mechanism at their respective ends. This is the most important part, as the single
    applications are many times composed of several other applications and services.
    The knowledge extraction and analytics generation can vary according to the task.
    If the applications or the services are known beforehand, a well-defined existing
    mining algorithm can extract the knowledge. But in the case of ad-hoc applications
    or services, the system should have dynamic machine learning capabilities that
    can handle outliers, do modification in the model and select appropriate algorithm
    or a set of algorithms to extract knowledge and prepare relevant analytics. After
    knowledge extraction and analytics creation, the decentralized units provide services
    and perform required intelligent actions in their own restricted environment.
    At-last, the extracted higher-level useful data of IoT infrastructure is converted
    into Machine interpretable and human understandable information by Centralized
    Processing and Controlling station in coordination with the Decentralized Data
    processing and control servers and, if required, can be adapted to make sensible
    decisions to optimize performance and the quality of services for the IoT applications
    and its infrastructure. The Centralized Processing and Controlling station with
    the Decentralized data processing and control servers can amend the Privacy and
    Security. As the number of smart devices (like wearables) connect to the network
    through various other higher end devices (like smart phones), to establish initial
    communication lots of data is shared among all. Lee et al. (2018) have performed
    research on several smart gadgets and found that the huge private information
    was being shared among devices. Therefore, there can be a big threat for the privacy.
    Other than this, several ad-hoc services need to be served. The search engines
    can generate numerous queries and tasks. Not only the device data, but also our
    social network and healthcare data is accumulated and processed. In cloud based
    system architecture, the complete data is collected and processed centrally. This
    can invite abuse of the information collected and of the concentrated web servers
    (Tian et al., 2020a, Tian et al., 2020b). The large scale enterprises also require
    a robust access control mechanism to manage physical access (Geepalla et al.,
    2013). Therefore, high security and privacy should be maintained in hybrid fashion
    at each level. Tian et al., 2020a, Tian et al., 2020b propose the web attack detection
    system that utilized distributed deep learning mechanism. Inspired by (Tian et
    al., 2020a, Tian et al., 2020b) in our system architecture also we proposed a
    cloud based centralize management in coordination with decentralized control of
    privacy, security and services (Tian et al., 2020a, Tian et al., 2020b, Geepalla
    et al., 2013, Lee et al., 2018). Concluding this section, several research groups
    around the globe are vigorously pursuing research to invent smarter knowledge
    discovery techniques that will extract higher-level useful information from the
    big IoT data. 3. KeyData mining methods The environment around us is filled with
    a plethora of heterogeneous data. It does seem infeasible to make this environment
    keenly intellective without appropriately utilizing the data mining technologies.
    Data mining can be a supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning with automation
    today. The computer-assisted learning grows more precisely when performed in multiple
    layers in a hierarchical manner. This automatic feature extraction through supervised
    or unsupervised learning in a hierarchical manner is known as Machine Learning
    (ML). Che et al. (2013) survey for big data mining brings focus on the challenges
    like variety, heterogeneity, scalability, velocity, accuracy, trust, provenance,
    privacy crises, instructiveness and most importantly on garbage mining. The necessity
    of applying data mining is consequential not only for knowledge discovery but
    also for the Garbage elimination from the internet. Ganz et al. (2015) suggested
    Data Abstraction as one of the appropriate methods. They reviewed various Abstraction
    techniques and proposed a piece of advice to preserve only abstracted results
    instead of whole data in the data centers. Data mining is an integral part of
    knowledge discovery, as shown in Fig. 3. Data accumulated from various IoT devices
    are first sent to a pre-processing unit where several actions (like feature selection
    and extraction, noise abstraction, Normalization dimension reduction etc.) take
    place to mold raw data into the appropriate format for analysis. Formatted data
    is then sent to Data Mining unit where various data mining techniques perform
    their task to extract higher-level useful information. The combination of both
    i.e. data pre-processing and Data mining units come under a single box of DL.
    Further, the output of DL is evaluated and represented into machine interpretable
    and human understandable knowledge which is utilized further by the IoT infrastructure

    of Things environment. 3.1. Classification Classification is a process of assigning
    the objects to previously defined categories. It aims at predicting accurately
    the destination class for each object of data (Kesavaraj and Sukumaran, 2013).
    As the targeted labels are assumed to be known before processing, it is a supervised
    learning process (Han et al., 2007, Tan et al., 2006, Kesavaraj and Sukumaran,
    2013, Liu, 2011). The prediction function (classifier) in classification requires
    training before being used to classify unlabeled or unknown objects/data. And
    so, one can use labeled or known data to train prediction function. For example
    in a certain medical care centre, there are data related to patients suffering
    from a disease having three stages as primary, moderate, critical with three specific
    methods to cure them as Treatment_p, Treatment_m and Treatment_c respectively.
    First, the classifier/prediction function is constructed from a set of rules defined
    by a medical researcher or by data recorded previously during the treatment. The
    data available is divided into two parts i.e. Training set (labeled) and testing
    set (unlabeled). The training set first constructs the classifier and then the
    test set validates it. After that, the classifier analyzes the patient data (unlabeled
    data) to put them into classes (Treatment_p, m or c) according to a stage identified
    by the constructed classifier. Most algorithms are classified in two steps: first
    compute the probability of item belonging to the particular class. Second, compare
    it to the cutoff value and classify accordingly. Performance evaluation (Tan et
    al., 2006) of the classification model is defined based on the number of instances
    that are assigned to the right category (i.e. Accuracy) and assigned to the false
    category (i.e. Error rate) given as: (1) (2) There are also alternate Accuracy
    measures of classification algorithm results i.e. precision: defined as the probability
    that a randomly selected result is relevant and Recall: defined as the probability
    that a randomly selected relevant object is retrieved. This can be mathematically
    described as: (3) (4) where Tp, Tn, Fp, Fn can be defined using below confusion
    matrix: Empty Cell Prediction Class = 0 Prediction Class = 0 Actual Class = 0
    True Negative (Tn) False Positive (Fp) Actual Class = 1 False Negative (Tn) True
    Positive (Tp) On the basis of Precision and Recall, the overall classification
    results are described by F-score, given as: (5) There are many classification
    models available to classify data into various classes depending on data characteristics
    and situations viz. Decision Tree Induction, Bayesian classification, Rule-based
    classification, classification by Backpropagation, Support vector machine, k-Nearest
    Neighbor, Deep Neural Network and Ensemble methods. A set of classifier can also
    deploy the fusion of various classification techniques for complex large scale
    IoT Application problems (Chen et al., 2015, Marjani, et al., 2017, Han et al.,
    2007, Tan et al., 2006, Kesavaraj and Sukumaran, 2013, Liu, 2011, Alsabti et al.,
    1998). Some majorly used top-rated classification methods include C4.5 (Alsabti
    et al. 1998), a descendant of CLS and ID3. It engenders classifier in the form
    of a more comprehensible set of rules. C4.5 was then superseded by C5.0 with much-improved
    efficiency, scalability and boosted performance by overcoming the disadvantages
    like large CPU Time and Memory requirement (Tsai et al., 2014). Rule-based classification,
    Support vector machine, Association rule analysis based classification type models
    of classification are highly suited for today''s IoT environment. In references
    (Lai et al., 2013, Fleury et al., 2010, Brdiczka et al., 2007, Li et al., 2017a,
    Li et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2017c), researchers use Classification models with
    frequent data mining techniques like Hidden Markov Model for creating a more keenly
    intellective and responsive environment. The Naive Bayes, Gaussian naive Bayes,
    Bayesian belief network, Bayesian network, Artificial Neural Network and Ensemble
    methods are used over various sensors and actuators data in the applications majorly
    related to Biomedical, Environmental Prediction, smart building access controlling
    and user activity recognition, improving Sensor network Efficiency, Optimization,
    and Artificial Intelligence (Misgeld et al., 2016, Rad et al., 2017, Wu, 2009,
    Abedin et al., 2017, Rad et al., 2014, Perera and Dias, 2011). 3.2. Clustering
    A cluster is represented as a group of like objects. Clustering algorithm classifies
    the collected objects into certain numbers of clusters where the objects in a
    particular cluster pose similar features. Unlike Classification, Clustering is
    an unsupervised learning technique (Yue et al., 2014, Tsai et al., 2014) i.e.
    it will not require prior knowledge to guide the partitioning process (Han et
    al., 2007, Tan et al., 2006). For example in certain medical care centre, it is
    found that a number of patients are suffering from an unknown disease. The medical
    researchers have the data available only about the observed symptoms and the progress
    made by the patient after pursuing numbers of treatments. In this kind of situation,
    the clustering will help through classifying the patients into a number of groups
    for proper treatment as per recognized symptoms and past treatment data available.
    The output of the clustering is represented by the set of centroids (cn) and quality
    of clustering measures in Sum of the Squared Error (SSE) as given below (Han et
    al., 2007): (6) (7) where x is an object, Cn is an nth cluster, cn is a centroid
    of the nth cluster, mn is the number of objects in nth cluster, K is a number
    of clusters and dist is the standard Euclidean distance between two objects. Most
    of the clustering methods like k-mean, K-Nearest Neighbor (Dhillon et al., 2004,
    Jin et al., 2006), k-medoids (Li et al., 2017a, Li et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2017c),Hierarchical
    clustering (CURE (Guha et al., 1998), SVD (Berry and Browne, 2005), ROCK (Guha
    et al., 1999), BIRCH (Zhang et al., 1997)), Density based clustering (DBSCAN (Ester
    et al., 1996), OPTICS (Ankerst et al., 1999), DENCLUE (Hinneburg and Keim, 1998)),
    Grid based clustering (STRING (Wang et al., 1997), WaveCluster (Sheikholeslami
    et al., 1998)), are designed from a single system perspective where centralized
    data more or less belong to certain characteristics. With the advancement in sensor
    technologies, IoT and WSN formulate the user environment to be smart enough to
    detect user activities and act accordingly. References (Samarah et al., 2017,
    Rashidi et al., 2011, Brdiczka et al., 2007, Saives et al., 2015, Li et al., 2017a,
    Li et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2017c, Zdravevski et al., 2017, Virone et al., 2008)
    used clustering as a core technology to classify numerous features that identify
    an individual’s daily activities and automate their tasks to increase comfort
    and security. In an environment such as IoT and WSN, cloud-based distributed clustering
    is more important than centralized clustering as the data and the devices are
    highly heterogeneous and hence may require different processing techniques (Younis
    and Fahmy, 2004, Uckelmann et al., 2011, Heinzelman et al., 2000). Saives et al.
    (2015) proposed model to discover activity and to detect behavior deviation. They
    perform activity discovery by binary sensor events data and then cluster the activities
    into original final state models using Extended Finite Automation for further
    activity recognition. Li et al., 2017a, Li et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2017c offered
    sequential behavioral pattern discovery with frequent episode mining (FEM). Here
    FEM adapted both categorical and numerical data to mine with DBSCAN clustering
    algorithm. Clustering can also be applied in IoT and WSN to make sensor network
    even more energy efficient, optimized (Bijarbooneh et al., 2006, Xu and Helal,
    2016, Heinzelman et al., 2000) and to reduce transmission distance (Choi et al.,
    2004, Lanzisera et al., 2014). 3.3. Association analysis or frequent pattern mining
    A data object or a set of data objects or a sequences of events that appear repeatedly
    in a system are known as frequent patterns (Qiu et al., 2019, Che et al., 2013).
    Mining of these frequent patterns give a good analytical understanding of the
    user’s activity in a felicitous environment. Recognition of pattern plays a critical
    role in promoting business maneuvers by mining association, correlation and other
    relationships among the data (Agrawal et al., 1993, Huang et al., 2004). Association
    Rule mining has comprehensive applications in the market basket like situations,
    where after analysis, one can predict the purchase pattern of the customer which
    can further boost the business or the user experience (Han et al., 2007, Tan et
    al., 2006). In the frequent pattern mining, order of events detected, matter as
    well. Patterns observed with specific order are called Sequential patterns and
    mining the same is called Sequential pattern mining (Zhao and Bhowmick, 2003).
    Agrawal and Srikant (1995) introduced sequential mining problem for the first
    time, based on the customer purchase sequence of transactions. Sequential pattern
    mining is preferred over Frequent pattern mining in the sensor environment as
    the sequence of events are observed in particular time span frequently for activity
    discovery and recognition (Wren and Munguia-Tapia, 2006), MavHome (Cook et al.,
    2003), GreaterTech smart house (Helal et al., 2005). Technological revolution
    enables frequent pattern mining in environments like medical care centers or smart
    homes to assist in diagnosing diseases at an early stage. For example, no disease
    is developed in human body instantly. Rather, they spread gradually. And, the
    symptoms of the same can be identified by means of daily data recorded by the
    sensors events, the visuals or the routine check-up. Frequent pattern mining can
    extract useful pattern/ sequential information from the daily activities or the
    routine check-up data. It can thus find the deviation in user behavior and health.
    For e.g. if mining data for few days of an inhabitant can detect nausea, vomiting,
    fatigue, weakness, sleep problems, changes in urine cycle, decreased mental sharpness,
    muscle twitches and cramps, persistent itching, shortness of breath, high blood
    pressure problems, then, it will calculate the minimum Support and Confidence
    level to indicate that the inhabitant may be suffering from some Kidney disease
    (Han et al., 2007). Tsai et al. (2014) defined support and confidence as given
    in Eqs. (5), (6) for Items set I = {i1, i2… ,im} and Transactions set T = {t1,
    t2,…, tn}. (8) (9) where number of transactions T that contain ψ is denoted by
    (ψ), i.e., ψ = A ∪ B or ψ = A. denotes the total number of transactions. Till
    now, we have witnessed some of the examples showing effective applications of
    frequent pattern mining. There are many more applications possible and served
    by various frequent pattern mining algorithms. A simplest well-known algorithm
    was proposed by Agrawal and Srikant (1994) for mining frequent patterns for Boolean
    association rule i.e. Apriori Algorithms. As the name itself says one should have
    a set of prior knowledge before applying the Apriori Algorithm. Later on, many
    variations of Apriori Algorithms (Park, et al., 1995, Huang and Chang, 2008) were
    proposed to improve efficiency. Apriori achieves good performance gain but suffers
    when a huge number of candidate set are generated and thus increase the processing
    load. So, alternate methods (like FP growth, CLOSET + etc.) are proposed in (Park,
    et al., 1995, Huang and Chang, 2008). Lee and Bang (2013) propose a track-and-trace-based
    anti-counterfeiting solution to discover a valid supply chain pattern for detecting
    counterfeit products. They first constructed a sequence tree from a trace record
    of EPCIS events and then applied alternative frequent pattern mining to discover
    valid supply chain patterns and classification to detect counterfeiting. Shukla
    et al. (2017) developed a system for Emotion Extractions from the text, independent
    of any type of dataset. They employed Class sequential rule mining which is a
    special case of association rule mining to extract emotions from the text. Gole
    and Tidke (2015) proposed hybrid method ClustBigFIMa modified version of BigFIM
    (Moens et al., 2013) algorithm for extracting meaningful information of association,
    emerging patterns, sequential pattern, correlations and other significant data
    mining tasks with scalability and speed. ClustBigFIM algorithm uses K-mean (Dhillon
    et al., 2004, Jin et al., 2006) and Apriori (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994) for generating
    frequent item sets and Eclat (Zaki et al., 2013) for finding potential extensions.
    3.4. Other mining methods Sometimes, exceptions faced by data mining methods are
    due to the unexpected useful information present in raw data known as anomalous
    objects or outliers (Han et al., 2007). Outlier data objects possess properties
    that are much different from the typical data objects. These properties may provide
    a good insight into some interesting inherent features. IoT applications like
    smart home, smart agriculture, smart traffic and parking systems, healthcare etc.
    benefited a lot by deviation/ outlier detection. Variety of outlier detection
    approaches are characterized into four categories (Tan et al., 2006) viz. Statistical
    Distribution-based outlier detection (Barnett and Lewis, 1994), Distance-based
    outlier detection (Knorr and Ng, 1997, Knorr and Ng, 1998), Density-based local
    outlier detection (Lee and Bang, 2013) and Deviation-based outlier detection (Knorr
    and Ng, 1997). Biswas and Misra (2015) presented a prototype of an e-health monitoring
    system, where they use biometric sensors and Arduino UNO board to measure and
    collect vital health parameters of individuals. Then they applied outlier detection
    mining to extract any anomalous information for health care emergencies. Yu et
    al. (2017) proposed outlier detection with accuracy and redundant sensor data
    aggregation in there cluster-based data analysis framework. They used recursive
    principal component analysis (R-PCA) to improve the effectiveness of IoT based
    systems. Zhang et al. (2018) designed a decentralized approach based on Network
    anomaly detection to reduce the communication overhead and achieve much faster
    convergence. Furthermore, mining patterns require some other sophisticated methods
    too, like mining streams of data and time-series data i.e. the collection of temporal
    sequences. Real-time systems, communication device networks, micro-sensors devices,
    telemetry devices and online transactions generate streams and time series data
    in Exabyte volume, containing sequences of events obtained over repeated measurement
    of time with very fast varying update rate (Che et al., 2013). So, it is necessary
    for an algorithm to have one time scan, multilevel, multi-dimensional parallel
    real-time stream processing and analysis capability (Kesavaraj and Sukumaran,
    2013). Researchers (Babcock et al., 2002, Xie et al., 2008, Roddick et al., 2002,
    Jensen et al., 2017) presented some good surveys on streams data mining and Time
    series data mining respectively. Time series data mining belongs to a Sequential
    Mining category which is already discussed in frequent pattern mining and sequential
    pattern mining section. 4. I IOT and data mining applications 4.1. J. Smart Home,
    Ambient Assistant Living and smart healthcare United Nation report foretold that
    by the year 2050, 66% of total world population will get accommodated in an urban
    area (United Nation, 2014). Another study by the World Health Organization predicted
    that the people with age 60 and more will increase from 12% in 2015 to 22% by
    2050 of the total world population (Facts and The, 2017). With increase in age,
    health issues increase as well, demanding more healthcare facilities and significantly
    increased health expenses. As the major population of the world belongs to the
    urban region, the best solution possible in technology geeky urban region can
    be a smart home and an Ambient Assistant Living (AAL) (Youngblood and Cook, 2007).
    Smart home and AAL, are the popular and emerging applications of IoT in the recent
    times. These make individual lives easier, technology friendly and even more comfortable,
    curable and healthier by fabricating an alive and caring environment from smart
    objects. Objects with embedded technologies can interact simultaneously with the
    other objects, individuals, internal servers and external environment (Kravchenko
    et al., 2017). Human beings usually work in a cycle of 24 h. One can discover
    and then recognize activities and can automate them. Youngblood and Cook (2007)
    designed the ProPHeT decision-learning algorithm that learns strategy and controls
    the smart environment. They use Episode Discovery sequential pattern mining to
    observe activities, Active LeZi algorithm to predict upcoming action and automatically
    constructed hierarchical hidden Markov model that learn an action policy for the
    smart environment. Researchers in ref. (Samarah et al., 2017) proposed framework
    for wireless sensor network with spatio-temporal mining technique for activity
    recognition and micro-aggregation approach to enhance the privacy of user data.
    References (Joergschmalenstroeer, 2010, Rashidi et al., 2011) constructed a system
    that recognizes and tracks user activities of daily living for a smart environment.
    Latter one used audio data from series of a microphone with online Diarization
    capability and face identification from visual data of the camera. Whereas, former
    introduced an unsupervised Discontinuous varied-order Sequential Miner for activity
    discovery and then clustered them in groups and recognized them by a boosted version
    of hidden Markov model. Likewise, the references (Brdiczka et al., 2007, Kasteren
    and Krose, 2007) used Naïve Bayes Classifier for activity recognition. This classifier
    yields good accuracy when data is in enormous volume with greatest probabilities
    to the observed values and conditional independence of the features. Li et al.,
    2017a, Li et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2017c pointed towards the ill-suited data
    collection methodologies used for activity recognition and so in their research,
    they developed a self-constrained, scalable and energy-efficient bespoke WSN with
    a compact data format for episode mining to overcome this obstacle. So far, we
    have discussed activity recognition and tracking in the smart environment for
    creating individual life easier and maximizing the comfort. This everyday activity
    recognition and discovery can be utilized in behavior deviation and predictions
    for the individuals who need medically monitored patients and healthcare emergency
    (Zdravevski et al., 2017, Virone et al., 2008, Yassine et al., 2017). Saives et
    al. (2015) proposed a binary sensor-equipped smart home to improve the autonomy
    of the medically monitored patient. The approach contains two sections, first
    uses Sequence Pattern Mining with Extended Finite Automation to model user Activities
    and second detects behavior deviation using residual method for any healthcare
    emergency. Reference (Zdravevski et al., 2017) used variety of sensor data that
    was segmented with sliding window, extracted time and frequency domain features
    with first deviation, Delta series and Fast Fourier transformation, then reduced
    features by Diversified Forward-Backward Feature selection and finally generate
    classification model with machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression,
    Extended Randomize Tree and SVM with Gaussian kernel. Similarly, references (Virone
    et al., 2008, Yassine et al., 2017) extracted behavior deviation information for
    healthcare facilities in a smart environment. Where latter develop their own pattern
    mining software SAMCAD to mine wireless passive sensor data streams and former
    utilized FP-growth and k-mean mining for pattern recognition and clustering respectively
    and then predicted activities using Bayesian network. All the above discussion
    is carried out for activity detection and deviation with respect to an individual.
    References (Gu et al., 2011, Alam et al., 2016) proposed systems that considered
    multiple individuals. Gu et al. (2011) designed a scalable and noise-resistant
    Emerging Pattern-based Multiuser Activity Recognizer (epMAR) with Activity Model
    included Emerging Pattern, Activity Correlation, Sliding window coverage. Alam
    et al. (2016) designed a Constraints and Correlation mining Engine (CACE) with
    loosely-coupled Hierarchical Dynamic Bayesian Network and data mining approach
    to discover key spatiotemporal constrain to prune the overall state space of coupled
    model. References (Li et al., 2017a, Li et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2017c, Rosslin
    and Tai-hoon, 2010) used smart home environment for helping and caring Dementia
    and Alzheimer patients respectively. Data mining techniques with sensors and smart
    equipment data can also fulfill the emerging trend towards smart energy management
    (Silva, 2016, Eibl et al., 2015). Silva (2016) presented unsupervised and probabilistic
    IPCL data fusion technique for multi-source smart home energy management. References
    (Angelis et al., 2013, Anvari-Moghaddam et al., 2015) proposed a Mixed-integer
    linear programming approach towards optimization of energy consumption as a cost
    reduction mechanism and to create the balance between consumption and comfort.
    Eibl et al. (2015) studied the impact of time granularity on edge detection methods
    with low-frequency Nonintrusive Appliance Load Monitoring Analyzes (NIALM) from
    the user privacy viewpoint. 4.2. Smart grid Ubiquitous technological advancement
    due to sensor and actuator equipped embedded devices and machine dependent modern
    style of living has inflated the electric power demands. British Petroleum Energy
    Outlook 2017 (Dudley, 2017) predicted 30% increase in global energy demand by
    2035 whereas United State Energy Information Administration Annual Energy Outlook
    2018 (U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook, 2018) predicted
    for the U.S. an average of 0.4% increases in energy demand every year till 2050.
    This continuous inflated electric power demands, engenders huge difficulties and
    unbalanced situations for traditional power grid due to their characteristics.
    With the technological revolution, the ambient environment with Internet connectivity
    and communication capabilities becomes more intelligent and, thus, can measure
    and control power consumption interactively. This intelligence and smartness were
    limited to small scale applications but now can also be seen in large scale application
    like Smart Grid. Smart Grid can be defined as globally existent digital grid architecture
    integrated with the enormous number of embedded devices that can perform a variety
    of digital computing task with a faster rate, precision and efficiency. The characteristics
    like bidirectional real-time communication, intelligently utilizing distributed
    power generations, distributed automatic monitoring, controlling and recovering
    from emergencies in real-time are integral part of it. Tuballa and Abundo (2016)
    presented their review from development and technological perspective, Bayindir
    et al. (2016) presented their review from technology and application perspective
    whereas Park et al. (2017) reviewed key dynamic characteristics that play a crucial
    role in the acceptance of smart grid technology. With the help of information
    and communication technology enabled architecture, the smart grid can intelligently
    manage the Demand and Response of electric power. Marah and Hibaoui (2018) proposed
    two algorithms, first algorithm paired with branch and bound algorithm to manage
    domestic appliances energy consumptions as per consumer priority and regulate
    consumption peak to utilize it at the best. The second algorithm manages the power
    transmission and distribution. Rahim et al. (2018) with Hybrid Bacteria Harmony
    algorithm focus on demand-side management and encourage consumer with Session
    Time of use tariff to change consumption pattern that reduces cost and peak to
    average ratio. Reference (Jindal et al., 2018) introduced smart devices data-oriented
    consumption aware Data Analytical Demand Response management scheme for peak load
    reduction of residential power. Based on the demand–supply theory of economics,
    reference (Ferdous et al., 2017) developed an optimal dynamic pricing mechanism
    for trading-off between consumer utility and profit. Using this, a smart grid
    operator can purchase power from distributed sources and can encourage consumers
    with dynamic pricing. To predict power usage of the user, they applied error-back-propagation
    artificial neural network with feed-forward multilayer perception model. The distributed
    variety of smart devices in the smart grid generates data that possess variety,
    velocity and volume as the inherent characteristics. This real-time big data of
    smart grid if utilized properly, with various big data mining methodology, can
    yield an efficient, reliable, sustainable and intelligent real-time monitoring
    and controlling. Tu et al., 2017 presented a good comprehensive big data analytic
    techniques and applications oriented survey on smart grid. Reference (Munshi et
    al., 2017) developed a cloud-supported open source Hadoop based big data framework
    for smart grid analytics, whereas, in (Shah et al., 2015, Yaghmaee et al., 2018)
    and [1 4 0] developed a summarization paradigm and Fog-Based Internet of Energy
    Architecture with real-time energy consumption pattern monitoring and transactive
    energy management respectively. This can be later used for various applications
    including demand-side management, Direct load control, smart pricing etc. The
    massive data induced from the network of the smart device demand more precise
    and intelligent communication technologies. Communication infrastructure is the
    key factor of smart grid and this knocks the door of next-generation technologies
    like low power wide area network (LPWAN) enabled 5th generation mobile technology,
    ZigBee, WiMAX etc. or wired fiber optic, hybrid power line communication/ wireless
    channel (HPWC) based communication. References (Li et al., 2017a, Li et al., 2017b,
    Li et al., 2017c, Dib et al., 2018) presented a survey from both quantitative
    and qualitative perspective of key wireless and wired communication technologies
    respectively. Reference (Dib et al., 2018) suggested a Narrow Band IoT whereas
    in (Li et al., 2017a, Li et al., 2017b, Li et al., 2017c) suggested HPWC as the
    best solution. References (Kaur et al., 2018, Guo et all., 2017) proposed various
    schemes and methods to support and manage proper smart grid communication. For
    the sake of intelligence, the smart meter and devices data are accessed by various
    algorithms of smart grid infrastructure. This available data can be misused by
    numerous physical and cyber-attacks, therefore, it demands security and privacy
    preservation at all levels. References (Mahmood et al., 2017, Lyu et al., 2018,
    Otuoze et al., 2017, Sushmitaruj, 2013, Brunner et al., 2017) discussed and presented
    security and privacy requirements and solutions with highlighted problems. 4.3.
    Industrial IOT and smart manufacturing The industrial revolution began in the
    18th century when steam powered the industrial machines (Industry 1.0). Then came
    electric energy powered mass production in the 19th century (Industry 2.0) based
    on electronic and information technology. Industrial automation brings Industry
    3.0 in the 20th century. With the advancement in Information and communication
    technologies, Industry 4.0 introduces machines that can connect to the network,
    can communicate with each other and can make decisions. Research communities like
    IoT, CPS, M2M communication, Additive Manufacturing and many more are persistently
    involved in engendering incipient standards, protocols and system architectures
    to destroy obstacles and empower industries in this new era of Smart Manufacturing
    (SM). Global economic powers like USA, Germany, Korea and China have already developed
    a strategic roadmap for future SM (Commission, 2010, The State Council, 2015).
    Properties required to achieve SM goal are Ubiquitous distributed Intelligence,
    uninterrupted connectivity and deeply integrated networks, Real-time knowledge
    creation and decision making, service-oriented standards, protocols and system
    architectures and knowledge oriented reconfigurable production line (Lee et al.,
    2014, Zhang et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018, Ding and Jiang, 2018, Yuan et al.,
    2017, Thibaud et al., 2018, Alam et al., 2015a, Alam et al., 2015b, Alam and El
    Saddik, 2017). Authors in (Da et al., 2014, Ahuett-Garza and Kurfess, 2018, Kang
    et al., 2016) presented some good research reviews from various perspectives.
    They highlighted the key enabling technologies behind SM including identification
    and Tracking Technologies (RFID, smart sensors and hologram with WSN), physical
    wireless communication technologies (IEEE802.11x, Bluetooth, IEEE802.15.4, ZigBee
    and IEEE1451.5, IPv6, 4G/5G), Industrial Hardware control technologies (Distributed
    Control Systems, Industrial Robotics, Smart camera and imaging system, Product
    life cycle Management systems, Manufacturing Execution Systems and SCADA), Machine
    or Deep Learning, Cloudlets, Cloud manufacturing, edge computing, fog computing,
    Additive manufacturing, Cyber-Physical Systems, IoT and Service-oriented architectures
    (Alam et al., 2015a, Alam et al., 2015b, Alam and El Saddik, 2017). To achieve
    SM, Chen et al. (2017) proposed a 4 layer hierarchical architecture for the smart
    factory. Four layers combine Physical Resource Layer, Network layer, Cloud Application
    Layer and Terminal Layer from bottom to up. Whereas, Schuh et al. (2014) deduced
    basic collaboration mechanism reference system on the basis of contributor enabler’s
    analysis to empower productivity in Industry 4.0 context. The massive attempts
    made by machines while communication (especially in radio access networks) will
    lead to an intolerable delay, packet loss, and even service unavailability. To
    address the performance degradation due to concurrent and massive access attempts
    in 5G network environment, (Oh et al., 2015) proposed a joint optimal Physical
    Random Access Channel (PRACH) resource allocation and access control mechanism.
    The communication and interoperability between the heterogeneous machines plays
    an important role as well. Cloud based Cyber Physical Systems (C2PS) can help
    a lot from this aspect. The features like scalable storage, interoperability,
    heterogeneous computation and communication can excellently compensate by C2PS
    (Alam et al., 2015a, Alam et al., 2015b, Alam and El Saddik, 2017). Alam and El
    Saddik, 2017, Alam et al., 2015a, Alam et al., 2015b proposed the C2PS architectures
    for IoT. They designed an interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network
    that dynamically considers current contexts and also a fuzzy logic rule base Bayes
    network composition for enabling reconfiguration capability. Knowledge discovery
    in big data algorithms and techniques for industrial environment play the key
    role to transform manufacturing into smart manufacturing. Authors in reference
    (Lee et al., 2014) reviewed the latest trends of manufacturing for sustainable
    innovative services in big data environment and also show big data management
    with the smart predictive tool like “smart remote machinery maintenance systems
    with Komatsu”. In ref. (Wang et al., 2018), authors submitted a comprehensive
    survey of commonly used deep learning algorithms. Whereas (Zhang et al., 2018)
    proposed big data feature learning of industrial IoT as adaptive dropout deep
    computational model with crowd sourcing to cloud. Smart dust to drones, smart
    automobiles with parking assistance and crash avoidance to smart job shop and
    even in hazardous situations like petrochemical plants, industrial IoT applications
    are producing a web across the globe (Ding and Jiang, 2018, Yuan et al., 2017)
    To empower these globalized industrial IoT applications, network communication,
    data storage and access, privacy, security and safety in the high-risk environment
    play a very crucial role. References (Yuan et al., 2017, Thibaud et al., 2018)
    presented some latest research articles addressing the above points with good
    insight. 4.4. Other applications 4.4.1. Smart agriculture Steep rise in population,
    stagnated agriculture production, climate extremes and weather variability demand
    instant deployment of advanced technologies in agriculture. The quantity and quality
    needs of future food and nutrition supplements can only be met when both biotic
    and a biotic constraints are addressed with agro-technological research and development
    boost. With the characteristics like heterogeneous low power sensors and actuator
    deployment, ubiquitous network connectivity, knowledge extraction from big raw
    data and real-time distributed computing, IoT with cloud computing and big data
    mining algorithms can be the best solution for optimized and improved smart agriculture
    (Talavera et al., 2017, Popovic et al., 2017). The applications of Smart Agriculture
    are as follows: (Tzounis et al., 2017) used SmartMesh IP enabled technology to
    predict frost events in a peach orchard, (Severino et al., 2018, Wang, 2014) applied
    it for environmental risk reduction with soil moisture dynamics, Mitigation and
    Reduction of emission of CH4, CO2, NO and NO2, water recycling, drip irrigation,
    hybrid machine learning based automatic plant phenotyping, smart aquaponics for
    urban farming and fully automated support system for non-experienced farmers.
    4.4.2. Smart transportation The racing population expansion, automobile and other
    routine utilities in the present and future foster significant and complex challenges
    that cannot be handled with current transportation management systems. Transportation
    today demands intelligent technologies with huge number of smart sensors and actuators,
    video cameras, smart cards, RFID Tags, GPS, Smartphone’s, internet and social
    network with the big data mining techniques and intelligent control unit. The
    petabytes of complex data collected from these ubiquitous smart devices can be
    transformed into useful knowledge that have profound impact on intelligent decision
    making like vehicle to vehicle communication to avoid accidents and traffic congestion
    (Shukla, et al., 2017, Saini et al., 2017, Alam et al., 2015a, Alam et al., 2015b,
    Chowdhary et al., 2019, Tian et al., 2020a, Tian et al., 2020b). Zhu et al. (2018)
    presented a good survey on big data analytic for intelligent transportation services
    (ITS). They also submitted three layers architecture of conducting big data analytics
    in ITS viz. data collection, analytics and application layer. The smart transportation
    applications are the integral part of smart city application where numerous other
    field applications devices can also participate to build smarter transportation.
    And so there are several ways to acquire verity of data (Shukla et al., 2017).
    A survey has been conducted by (Shukla et al., 2017) on the ways of data collection
    by the mobile smart vehicle. Vehicles are accessing and generating data, either
    of entertainment type or of informative type (Saini et al., 2017). Extracting
    the useful information from it requires a real time solution. Saini et al. (2017)
    presented “InCloud” framework, a cloud base middleware solution for vehicular
    infotainment application development. Chowdhary et al., 2020a, Chowdhary et al.,
    2020b, Chowdhary et al., 2019 Presented a IoT based battery health monitoring
    and alert system for vehicle to avoid malfunctioning condition. To overcome huge
    data from an embedded lightweight Clint application installed with internet connected
    vehicle, they incorporated data filtering and fusion functionalities. Not only
    the infotainment data but vehicle can also exchange several services data (Like
    safety, comfort and efficiency) for social good. The Vehicular Ad-hoc Network
    (VANETs) plays a very important role here. Alam et al., 2015a, Alam et al., 2015b
    presented architecture that support vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure
    and vehicle to internet communication based on cloud oriented Cyber Physical Social
    Internet of Vehicle (SIoV). It utilizes the social relationships among the physical
    components (instead of device owners) for social services, although the communication
    between physical devices without knowing to the device owner will also create
    several threats for security and privacy. Passing a single wrong message may lead
    to a threat for lives. Tian et al., 2020a, Tian et al., 2020b proposed a trust
    management framework “Vcash” for Internet of Vehicles. Their mechanism identifies
    malicious vehicle and also encourage vehicle to provide qualified sensed traffic
    events. There were several applications of Smart Transportation system where data
    mining play a vital role. These include: utilizing multivariate logistic regression
    algorithm for fatality risk detection for driver (Bédard et al., 2002), Bayesian
    inference and Random forest for real-time crash detection, Two Stage Divide &
    Conquer (TSDC) algorithm/ Branch and Bound (BB) algorithm/ Dijkstra''s algorithm
    to find out the shortest path (Katre et al., 2017). Fog-FISVER for real-time crime
    detection on public bus services (Neto et al., 2018), Dynamic Bayesian Network
    for Fatigue Modeling and for categorizing human fatigue expressions and driver
    distraction detection, cascade classifiers for face detection (Kaplan et al.,
    2015), multivariate statistical model for weather prediction, hierarchical tree-based
    regression and binomial regression model for accident detection and emergency
    services (Zhu et al., 2018) and many more. There are many advanced applications
    like Traffic control and future predictions, Intelligent transportation planning
    and execution, logistics, automated driving, automatic and accurate identification
    of security threats with smart transportation safety, smart parking and vehicle
    communication are the future research challenges where one can focus (Shukla,
    et al., 2017, Saini et al., 2017, Katre, et al., 2017, Brunner et al., 2017, Bédard
    et al., 2002, Alam et al., 2015a, Alam et al., 2015b). 5. Summary and open research
    issues in IoT applications As per the literature reviewed, Table 1, Table 2, Table
    3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6 summarize various objectives of IoT infrastructure,
    data sources and the utilized data mining algorithms to extract knowledge. This
    article significantly strengthens researchers and developers aiming for fabricating
    an interactive environment for the numerous prospective IoT applications. IoT
    and cloud-assisted data mining technologies equipped with sensors and actuators
    can drastically transform the passive environment into an intelligent and active
    environment. In the following text, we summarize and point wise discuss open research
    issues from diverse IoT applications’ outlook. Table 1. Smart Home, AAL and Smart

    Healthcare: Research on the intelligent buildings with smart home, AAL and healthcare
    applications, majorly focuses on activity discovery, behavior change recognition,
    activity prediction, optimization and emergency detection. The intelligent building
    IoT architecture, extracts information from plethora of raw data and prepares
    analytics with the help of data mining algorithms specific to the given IoT applications
    task. It gives feedback to the system to provide exceptional comfort and quality
    of living, energy management, and establishes a support system for the patients.
    Open Research Issues: • Smart devices (as specified in the raw data sources column
    of Table 1) in IoT environment learn daily activities from real-time information
    and then manage system according to the personal pattern. Therefore robust and
    flawless device integration and management capabilities are required. • The diverse
    components should exchange information and support each other intelligently, irrespective
    of whether they were designed to work together or not. For e.g., healthcare applications
    can utilize and control HVAC home appliances but energy management units should
    not turn off healthcare devices for energy saving purposes. Consecutively, these
    applications require middleware solution for interoperability. • Devices connected
    to the smart house/ building network use various protocols like NFC, Bluetooth,
    DASH7, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G and many more. The key factors that should be considered
    here is the network latency and the available bandwidth as it varies with the
    protocols. It can highly affect the precision in time-sensitive restricted environment.
    • Heterogeneous big IoT data storing, processing and knowledge conversion is another
    key feature that needs to be addressed. A context aware parallel processing architecture
    should be imposed with multiple data mining algorithms, to apply a particular
    or an ordered set of algorithms for serving dynamic application environment. •
    The service needs change person to person and even according to the work environment.
    So, the research in intelligent building should focus on service oriented self-adoption
    mechanism that can update itself when required. • As the number of devices communicates,
    they generate issues like privacy of personal data and physical location tracking.
    Unsafe device behavior, unauthorized access and service modification can create
    glitches to the security in any intelligent building environment. The gaps between
    the security and privacy can be minimized with suitable machine learning researches.
    Smart Grid and Smart manufacturing: The development of smart grid and smart industries
    is a comprehensive process of complexity and competence among human to machine
    and machine to machine. The research under Smart grid concentrates on the management
    of distributed power generation (like renewable and non-renewable resources),
    Demand-side, peak hour power & home appliances utilization, automated revenue
    collection, smart pricing, communication over power line, fault detection and
    recovery. Whereas the Smart manufacturing converges on automatic identification,
    monitoring & controlling of machines, logistics management, Emergency/ Disaster
    /Safety management, Automatic Fault diagnosis, raise in productivity, serviceable
    life prediction of product and cloud-based manufacturing automation. Open Research
    Issues: • Advancement in sensing and actuation has produced ubiquitous computing
    environment from an LED bulb to a full-fledged automated machine. Therefore, a
    vigorous research is required on a broader scale for reliable, energy efficient
    and flexible communication protocol for use in highly heterogeneous and resource
    constraint smart grid. • The existing infrastructure for both in power generation
    and manufacturing is inadequate, especially in developing countries. The issues
    like clean and distributed energy generation and management, framework for utilizing
    the potential of participatory sensing, bidirectional power flow, self-reconfigurable
    machines, and support for generic M2M communication protocols need to be focused
    upon. • The existing technologies ranging from digital to advanced sustainable
    manufacturing in a connected environment should be integrated with cloud based
    machine learning capabilities that can adopt new algorithms (especially Metaheuristic
    and greedy algorithms for unstructured data) with existing realities. This will
    benefit the end user and several SCADA/Discrete control systems with generated
    analytics • Resources in both the applications field suffer several restrictions.
    Physical resources should be integrated with the capabilities like efficient data
    acquisition, analytics visibility to end user and extensible controller access
    to the core industrial network. • With the growing trends, the equipment and systems
    are getting obsolete. Strategic research is required for system lifecycle management.
    This includes designing and manufacturing goals, maintenance goals, and an assisting
    model for interoperability between the old and new generation devices having huge
    variation from design to standards and protocols. • Due to non-uniform power generation
    in distributed grid, it demands huge storage capacity. Most of the batteries have
    very short life span of a few years, are heavy and of large size. Research over
    smarter and lighter batteries while covering all above aspects is one of the highlighted
    fields in smart grid. • Information security and privacy are extremely vital for
    power and manufacturing utilities, especially for billing purposes, grid control
    and manufacturing/production data. To avoid cyber-attacks, to prevent unauthorized
    access to connected control systems and to avoid misuse of enterprise data in
    high level of connectivity, an efficient security mechanism should be developed.
    Standardization efforts regarding the security and privacy should be made. Smart
    agriculture and Smart transportation: IoT is gradually transforming the human
    operated agriculture and transportation environment to self-organized automated
    environment. The research in the smart agriculture domain include the climate
    variation monitoring, forecasting and optimization, environment predictions, alerting
    and risk reduction system, keenly intellective farming, rainwater harvesting,
    automatic plant phenotyping and aquaponics urban farming. Smart transportation
    research objectives include traffic forecasting, intelligent transportation service
    planning, accident avoidance and emergency support system, train and air traffic
    management, driver behavior analysis, smart parking and smart automobiles. Both
    of these application areas are dealing with large geographical region. While the
    former has majorly stable embedded nodes spread over the field and the latter
    has majorly mobile nodes with ever changing density. Open Research Issues: • Devices
    in both the application environments handle a harsh environment with limited power
    supply. A smart and efficient power utilization system architecture must be applied
    that can program short time slot activation of a devices without missing any important
    information. • Huge number of sensors and actuators are involved in the network.
    Heterogeneity in devices, standards, protocols, generated data, memory, processing
    and power constraints are handled by the network dynamically. Lot of good research
    work (like LEACH and its variants) in this field with WSN has already been published.
    • Data gathering is also one of the biggest challenges in a dynamic environment.
    There are various types of data like random logistic and traffic data, vehicle
    to vehicle communication data, road side unit’s data, environmental monitoring
    data, linguistic data, GPS data and many more. The devices occupy diverse methodologies
    to gather this heterogeneous data. Applying mining technologies to extract useful
    analytics (like driver behavior recognition, linguistic identification, automated
    car support etc.) and to prepare them in several formats to provide services to
    highly divergent devices is an emerging research area. • The plethora of data
    generated in the highly resource constraint agriculture and transportation application
    environment can be supported well by Cloud based infrastructure. Other services
    include high quality analytics, hardware support, interoperability, storage and
    computational resources to process the data at the edge of the network. In summary,
    an IoT system architecture provides services to several applications. It is loaded
    with the massive data generated from the intellective sensors and the embedded
    devices. The big data transforms into valuable knowledge with data mining techniques,
    which later can be utilized for even more intelligent resources and service management.
    Advanced classification and clustering techniques are the frequently used data
    mining algorithms. These include SVM, HMM, Bayesian network, logistic regression,
    deep neural network, k-mean, DBSCAN, Extended Finite automation, fuzzy c-meant.
    Frequent and Sequential Pattern mining algorithms like FP-growth, Episode Discovery,
    Varied-order Sequential Miner, Deep belief network and variants play a significant
    role when the sequential real-time events or patterns are discovered. Future IoT
    infrastructure requires a lot of in-depth research and development integrated
    with machine learning capabilities. As depicted in Fig. 3, in high-performance
    IoT environment, applications will be benefited with the integrated multiple data
    mining technologies. In most of the applications, classification and clustering
    algorithms are used interchangeably or coherently for the complex data set. Some
    applications perform clustering then classification, some do classification before
    clustering. Whereas some applications (Youngblood and Cook, 2007, Alam et al.,
    2016, Jindal et al., 2018, Zhu et al., 2018) begin with frequent/sequential pattern
    mining or outlier detection and then the extracted information is supplied to
    the clustering and then to the classification algorithm. By repeatedly employing
    several data mining algorithms in sequence, applications can produce and utilize
    distinct classifiers, clusters or even can find unpredicted important frequent/sequential
    information from huge heterogeneous data of several devices. Therefore, the cloud-assisted
    IoT architecture integrated with deep learning on data mining technologies is
    the best solution for today''s smart service-oriented environment. 6. Conclusion
    The paper presented a systematic and detailed review of data mining algorithms
    like classification, clustering, and frequent/sequential pattern mining from IoT
    applications’ perspective. The article summarized them in tabular form with the
    open research issues. We descriptively analyzed the applications like Smart Home,
    Ambient Assistant Living, Smart Healthcare, Smart Grid, Industrial IoT and Smart
    Manufacturing, Smart Agriculture and Smart transportation on the basis of data
    mining technologies employed for data to knowledge conversion. This conversion
    increases complexity and intellect into today’s huge data producing IoT environment.
    We also presented an overview of cloud assisted system architecture in Section
    2 and Data mining process in Section 5, for IoT which shows that pre-processing
    and knowledge discovery plays the most important role among all the six layers.
    For systems that contain various dissimilar smart devices, and that produce heterogeneous
    data, pre-processing is of great importance. Knowledge discovery boosts the system
    performance by more appropriate and advanced service suggestions. Declaration

    Plant breeding is an effective guarantee of agriculture production and food security,
    whereas information technologies are effective ways to promote plant variety improvement.

    breeding 1. Introduction Food security that ensures the food supply for the several
    billion people on this planet is a serious challenge worldwide, especially with
    the pressure of global environmental change, such as land degradation and water
    contamination, climate change, and sociocultural developments (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017). Variety and agronomic improvements are the main factors of agricultural
    development. Breeding and promotion of high-yield and stable-yield varieties is
    the fundamental driving force underlying seed industry innovation and development
    (Pingali, 2012). In order to adapt to the environmental pressure as well as the
    food production situation and consumption preferences, crop breeding strategies
    have gradually shifted from yield-based approaches to comprehensive consideration
    of yield, quality, stress resistance, and even the international sustainability
    targets (e.g., food and seed sovereignty, social justice, agrobiodiversity, and
    climate robustness) (Tester and Langridge, 2010, Van Bueren et al., 2018, Zhao
    et al., 2020). This shift has brought new requirements for collection and comprehensive
    utilization of multi-omics data, and great progress of related technologies (e.g.,
    biotechnology, high-throughput phenotyping platforms, breeding management systems,
    and artificial intelligence) has been made (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res
    image (335KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Upcoming breeding with
    core technologies. Biotechnology and molecular breeding is the current state-of-the-art
    breeding technology and the symbol of Breeding 3.01. As the most commonly applied
    molecular tool, the applications of marker-assisted selection have made great
    progress in developing cultivars in rices, maize, legume, horticultural crops,
    and several long juvenile species because of their low cost, high read accuracy,
    and competing sequencing systems (Rasheed et al., 2017). Genome-wide prediction
    is to predict individual’s phenotype with the collected genetic data and phenotypic
    data, and genomic selection (GS) is using those predictions to make breeding decisions
    (Wallace et al., 2018). These methods can greatly reduce the cost of phenotype
    testing and improve the genetic gain by accelerating the breeding cycles (Heffner
    et al., 2010). Genetic modification is considered to be a major contributor for
    future crop variety innovation because it can generate novel variations beyond
    those that occur naturally (Tester and Langridge, 2010). High-throughput phenotyping
    platforms offer efficient, flexible, high-throughput, and low-cost solutions to
    collect field phenotypic data using technologies such as novel sensors, cameras,
    and robotics (Araus and Cairns, 2014). Typical phenotype platforms mainly consist
    of unmanned aerial vehicle based platforms, ground based platforms, and conveyor-based
    indoor platforms. These platforms have been used to evaluate the field performance
    and adaptability of crops by capturing data with multiple sensors and analyzing
    data with a suite of machine learning methods (Tsaftaris et al., 2016, Mohanty
    et al., 2016). These detailed and abundant phenotypic data propose a great opportunity
    to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap, and study the genome-wide association. These
    advances in both phenomics and genomics are constantly providing massive new data.
    This not only provides data support for breeders to study crop mechanisms and
    breed new cultivars, but also comes with difficulties in data storage and analysis.
    Fortunately, the rapid development of breeding management systems has facilitated
    the collection and utilization of massive breeding-related data using information
    technologies. In the modern seed industry, plant breeding is based on the comprehensive
    research of multi-omics (e.g., epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics,
    phenomics, and microbiomics) and large-scale breeding experiments, including both
    field and laboratory tests (Harfouche et al., 2019). The massive generated breeding
    data (e.g., genotype, phenotype, environmental data, and breeding process information)
    need to be collected and utilized according to the breeding objectives, and many
    breeding management systems (e.g., , and BMS) have been developed (Han et al.,
    2018). They provide support for breeders, such as planting scheme design, field
    management, data collection, and data analysis, during the multiple life cycles
    of crops. Big data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) technology is considered
    important in the transition from Breeding 3.0 to Breeding 4.0 (Wallace et al.,
    2018). Big data has become a reality in genomics and phenomics, but the current
    AI approaches still have shortcomings in terms of interpretability and cannot
    effectively generate knowledge from overwhelming and chaotic data (Harfouche et
    al., 2019). The future AI approaches are conceived to solve these problems gradually,
    and to effectively use highly heterogeneous and complex data, bridge the genotype-phenotype
    gap, and promote the continuous progress of breeding. Intuitively, breeding management
    systems are suitable for integrating these technologies to promote the intelligent
    upgrade of the seed industry. AGROBASE links the genotypic and phenotypic data,
    and provides statistical analysis, genetic analysis, and data visualization support
    for plant breeding and selection; PRISM provides statistical analysis tools (e.g.,
    variance analysis, stability analysis, and genotype-by-environment analysis) to
    make sound decisions on which lines to advance; BMS links an easy user interface
    to a statistical analysis package (Genstat) for rapid phenotypic and genotypic
    analysis of field trial observations, and produces graphical and spreadsheet reports
    of analysis. The breeding cloud platform (GSBCP) is our released breeding management
    system with about 150 institutional users in China (Han et al., 2018). It provides
    breeding process and breeding data management support in multiple dimensions (e.g.,
    programs, trials, materials, plots, and single plants) for both hybrid and self-bred
    crops (e.g., maize, rice, soybeans, wheat, cotton), and has been widely recognized
    due to the convenience of data recording, data querying, and data analyzing. However,
    it is also facing an urgent upgrading need during the transition from Breeding
    3.0 to Breeding 4.0. The upgrading detail will be introduced at three levels,
    graphical user interfaces (GUI), statistical tools, and intelligent decision support.
    2. Graphical user interfaces Breeding is naturally a data-driven science. The
    accumulation of a large amount of genotypic and phenotypic data not only provides
    the possibility for more scientific and effective breeding decision, but also
    brings confusion in data viewing and understanding without an intuitive representation.
    User-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) can help to hide irrelevant details,
    offer easy-to-understand data visualization, and provide convenient decision support
    (Zhai et al., 2020). A variety of data visualization tools are provided for data-viewing
    and data-analysis in GSBCP, such as multi-year data of varieties displayed in
    a histogram, the comparison of quantitative traits among multiple cultivars displayed
    in a scatter diagram or radar chart, and the distribution of test stations or
    the adaptation areas of cultivars shown on a map. These tools help breeders to
    view data intuitively, and effectively improve its interpretability. In addition
    to these general data visualization tools, several special visualization tools
    are also provided according to the breeding characteristics. The law of heredity
    implies that the performance of materials depends largely on the quality and genetic
    stability of their ancestors, especially their parents. Breeders can infer the
    advantages and disadvantages of the current material according to the pedigree,
    and carry out key identification and targeted improvement in the breeding process.
    The pedigree tree (Fig. 2) displays typical genealogical data to visually record
    and interpret the consanguinity of the current material. The selfing family tree
    (Fig. 3) describes the progenies that originate from the same parents and are
    generated by self-crossing and gene recombination. Detailed information of a material
    can be viewed by clicking the node. Materials can be added to a comparison set
    by clicking the plus sign next to the node, and a comparison view (Fig. 4) is
    provided, so that breeders can easily compare the similarities and differences
    between materials and their parents, or between sibling lines from the same selfing
    family tree with customized data dimensions (e.g., attributes, traits, pictures).
    Such comparisons can facilitate the understanding of consanguinity, heredity,
    and other characteristics of breeding materials. Moreover, the comparison tool
    can be used to conduct an all-round comparison of candidate materials after material
    retrieval. Download : Download high-res image (76KB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 4. Example of materials comparison view. 3. Statistical tools Breeding is
    dependent on statistical science, because breeders usually design field experiments
    and analyze data under the guidance of statistical theory, estimate the genetic
    gain or combining ability of cultivars, and make decisions of evaluation and cultivar
    selection (Griffing, 1956). Experiment design and data analysis are arduous and
    professional tasks that require statistical knowledge and familiar tools. With
    the help of statistical tools of GSBCP, experiment design can be automatically
    completed after customizing several parameters (e.g., number of blocks, material
    number in a group), and statistical analysis results (e.g., variance analysis,
    and yielding ability and stability analysis) can be obtained through just one-button
    click without the need to learn the usage of professional statistical software
    or the implementation details of the statistical analysis methods. The planting
    scheme design tools support designing field trails for different requirements.
    A sequence method is provided for selfing materials of each generation that allows
    breeders to select materials in the order of their preferences. Both parent nursery
    and alternating planting of parents are supported for making combinations. A variety
    of layout methods (e.g., interval comparison, randomized block, and Latin squares)
    are provided for cultivar performance test to satisfy different scale and error
    requirements. The multiple-location trial design method also is supported to verify
    the regional adaptability of materials. Specific analysis tools are provided for
    different field experimental design methods to eliminate interference factors
    and evaluate the performance of cultivars. For example, the variance analysis
    is provided for the block in replication or randomized block trial so that breeders
    can find the degree of freedom, sum of squares, mean square, and F value and P
    value of each source and determine the significance of yield increase; the yielding
    ability and stability analysis is provided for multiple-location trials as a supplement
    to variance analysis; analysis of combining ability and hereditability is supported
    to help breeders understand the general and specific combining abilities for incomplete
    diallel crossing trails. 4. Intelligent decision support tools Breeding is also
    a decision-making science, such as incidental phenotype-based selection in Breeding
    1.0, statistical design and relative selection in Breeding 2.0, and comprehensive
    decision-making by integrating genetic and genomic data in Breeding 3.0 (Wallace
    et al., 2018). In particular, during the transition period of Breeding 3.0 to
    Breeding 4.0, there is a great need for comprehensive utilization of multi-omics
    data to carry out intelligent design and selection in breeding, which presents
    a strong demand for intelligent decision support technologies. Heterosis prediction
    and cultivar evaluation are provided intelligent decision support tools of GSBCP.
    Due to the data privacy requirements in the platform protocol, these tools only
    use the internal data of each institution. 4.1. Heterosis prediction The essence
    of breeding is the aggregation of advantageous alleles. Crossing is the most commonly
    used method to aggregate the dominant alleles of multiple cultivars (Griffing,
    1956). Heterosis prediction is based on a premise that the heritable component
    of traits can be viewed as being generated by the combined effect of all underlying
    genome-wide variations (e.g., SNPs, indels), so mapping the genomic data layer
    to phenotypes is considered as a possible way to short breeding cycles (Harfouche
    et al., 2019). Many prediction approaches have been developed, including mixed-effect
    linear models, Bayesian models, and machine learning models (Heslot et al., 2012,
    Meuwissen et al., 2001). These models can be integrated into the heterosis prediction
    tool (Fig. 5) in GSBCP to predict the phenotypic traits of the candidate hybrids.

    Fig. 5. Framework of heterosis prediction tool. The input part includes genomic
    data of parents and phenotypic data of tested hybrids. These data, collected by
    our crop trait information acquisition system (Han et al., 2017), integrated high-throughput
    acquisition equipments, and manually recorded data, have been stored in GSBCP.
    The genomic data of parents is the genetic background, which indicates the potential
    of the population, while the phenotype of hybrids is the presentation of the breeding
    effect and breeding objective. However, it is impossible to test the phenotypic
    data of all the candidate hybrids, because of the tremendous number of hybrids
    and the high cost of phenotype testing. Benefiting from the development of high-throughput
    sequencing facilities, the cost of gene sequencing is significantly reduced. In
    addition, the number of parents of a population is limited, which indicates the
    feasibility of sequencing all of them. Therefore, a typical breeding solution
    is to construct heterosis prediction models with the genomic data of all parents
    and the phenotypic data of hybrids that have been tested, and then the models
    can be used to predict the untested hybrids. There are three parts of the heterosis
    prediction tool. As the two preprocessing steps before prediction, data preprocessing
    is to remove outliers based on the customized trait range and normalize data into
    the same scale with standard scaler to ensure the robustness, while feature selection
    is to prune the redundant and irrelevant features based on missing rate, polymorphism
    and P-value. GSBCP automatically performs data preprocessing steps, and then heterosis
    prediction models can be trained to map the relationships of genotypes-to-phenotypes
    and parents-to-hybrids with mixed-effect linear models, Bayesian models, or machine
    learning models. Six heterosis prediction models have been integrated in GSBCP,
    i.e., best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), ridge regression-best linear unbiased
    prediction (RRBLUP), three Bayesian models (BayesA, BayesB, and BayesCpi), and
    a Bayesian version of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (BayesLASSO)2
    (Heslot et al., 2012, Meuwissen et al., 2001). Since the adaptability of the models
    shifts according to different plant populations, sequencing chips, and target
    traits, integrating multiple models can effectively improve the adaptability.
    In addition, the scalability of the architecture makes it easy to integrate new
    models into the heterosis prediction tool, and more models will be gradually integrated
    to further improve the adaptability and predictive capability in the future. Current
    prediction models are prone to losing accuracy when predicting across different
    population and/or environments (Harfouche et al., 2019). Therefore, datasets are
    split by the population and sequencing chip, and the heterosis is predicted for
    each dataset. For a target population and sequencing chip, six prediction models
    will be trained and the best model is selected with 5-fold cross-validation tests.
    Then the selected model will be trained with the whole dataset for the prediction
    task. Breeders can switch models and view the predictions according to their personal
    experience or preference. It is supported to filter and sort the prediction results,
    so that breeders can easily find candidate hybrids that may meet their breeding
    objectives (Fig. 6). Benefiting from the data management capabilities of the whole
    process, the genotypic data of the newly bred inbred lines and the phenotypic
    traits of the newly tested hybrids can be automatically imported into the dataset,
    and participate in the training of future models. This can further improve the
    prediction effectiveness and breeding efficiency. Download : Download high-res

    that are perceived to have traits consistent with breeding objectives (e.g., high
    yield, superior quality, and disease resistance) depend on breeders’ work over
    several seasons (Hallauer, 2007). The evaluation is usually based on multiple
    trait selection and balancing the relative importance of different traits. Continuous
    selection from tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals requires a great
    amount of work by experienced breeders, which can be considered evaluation models
    with decades of focused training plus thousands of years of accumulated knowledge
    of breeding, climate, and biology, especially facing the continuous changes of
    breeding objectives (Harfouche et al., 2019). In addition, the rapid development
    of breeding data management software and high-throughput phenotyping/genotyping
    acquisition equipment has resulted in the accumulation of a wealth of breeding
    data with lots of additional data analysis work. This has led to a shortage of
    experienced breeders who can handle all these changes. The intelligent cultivar
    evaluation tool can help with these problems. As shown in Fig. 7, prediction models
    are trained with historical data. Because differences exist in breeding objectives
    and environments for different trials, the data are not directly comparable, and
    should be preprocessed by trials. After that, key features can be selected by
    the preprocessed data and evaluation results from breeders. Typical breeding evaluation
    can be considered a classification task of giving , or discard results for overall
    cultivar performance, so prediction models can be trained with several built-in
    classification algorithms. The final step is assisted decision making using the
    prediction models and the data to be evaluated. Ensemble learning is used to synthesize
    the prediction results of multiple meta models based on the similarity of breeding
    objectives and environmental conditions between trials to obtain the final results.
    Predictions made by the GSBCP are displayed on the material evaluation page for
    breeders’ reference (Fig. 8). Importantly, breeders rather than the cultivar evaluation
    tool are the real decision makers. Breeders can use the assistant decision information
    to filter materials and select good ones to upgrade or poor ones to discard. Download

    evaluation tool normalizes and standardizes the data in each trial to eliminate
    the influence of dynamic factors between trials. The evaluation of results in
    historical trials is solidified into each meta evaluation model as expert experience,
    and then used to evaluate the current trial together with historical data. The
    breeders’ evaluations of new trials are automatically used to train new meta evaluation
    models, and then update the model base. This can help solve time-consuming and
    complex breeding evaluation problems. The cultivar evaluation tool can improve
    the possibility of much larger-scale breeding programs in the future together
    with the developments in high-throughput phenotyping/genotyping acquisition equipments.
    5. Discussion and conclusion This paper introduces our exploration and practice
    of the intelligent upgrading of GSBCP. Several decision support tools have contributed
    to plant breeding in three aspects: graphical user interfaces provide an accessible
    way to see and understand trends, patterns, and connotations in data; statistical
    tools provide convenient experimental design and data analysis support which may
    reduce the professional demand for statistics skills of breeders; intelligent
    decision support tools provide data-based decision support in heterosis prediction
    and cultivar evaluation, and enhances the ability of breeding decision-making
    using multi-dimensional big data. Benefiting from the scalable architecture and
    open application programming interface support, future studies of decision support
    services can be easily integrated into GSBCP. In addition, it is hoped to improve
    data usage efficiency to promote the progress of the seed industry while protecting
    data privacy. To explore the application of federated learning and transfer learning
    technologies in the field of intelligent breeding to break the restrictions of
    plant populations, sequencing chips, and breeding institutions is the main task
    of our future work. It is expected that GSBCP and its intelligent upgrading can
    promote the upgrade of seed industry from Breeding 3.0 to Breeding 4.0, and guarantee
    the agriculture production and food security. Declaration of Competing Interest

    HI, USA SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture faces many challenges going forward;
    economic viability, environmental concerns, and consumer expectations must both
    be simultaneously and sustainably reconciled. Cur-rent agriculture practices are
    viewed by many as being intrinsically unsustainable. Significant contributors
    to the current situation include, among others, environmental pollution of aquatic,
    atmospheric, and terrestrial ecosystems and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). AMR
    has been linked to 33,000 deaths in the European Union (EU) each year [1]. Other
    almost paradoxical problems include food poverty, food wastage, and obesity. Many
    of these problems arise at various points along the food production chain. However,
    as all food originates on the farm, the resolution to many of these difficulties
    must begin there; therefore, effective and holistic solutions depend on contributions
    across the full food production value chain. Smart agriculture [2] offers an intriguing
    vision of how food will be produced going forward. The underlying hypothesis is
    that an aggregation of data from various sources, including in-situ sensors and
    remote sensing satellites, will drive a new generation of farm information systems
    that harness data analytics and machine learning to deliver novel insights and
    advice on appropriate courses of action in near real-time. Fundamental to such
    data provision are smart sensor & actuator systems, Internet of Things (IoT),
    Cloud computing, and 5G networks. While this scenario is indeed tractable, its
    practical implementation on the ground poses many challenges. No two farms are
    the same; thus, their requirements are determined by the system of farming, the
    physical nature of the farm itself, and the expertise of the individual farmer.
    Sensor systems demanded by an arable farm will radically differ from those of
    a livestock farm. The microclimate of individual farms may vary between farms
    and even within an individual farm. The profile of the individual farmer, for
    example, how technically savvy or risk-averse they are, will influence their views
    on smart agriculture. In the case of farm management information systems, it is
    well-known that adoption amongst farmers is low [3]. In this paper, a software
    framework is presented for effectively managing the heterogeneity of sensors and
    associated services necessary to realize customizable and scalable services for
    smart agriculture. A. Problem Statement Two issues limit the adoption of sensor-driven
    information systems in smart agriculture. Conventional models of IoT and sensors
    are frequently coupled to a Cloud computing model. In this model, data is captured
    locally and transmitted to a data center on the Cloud for processing. Such a model
    is mature, well-understood, and relatively straightforward to implement. However,
    this model is wholly dependent on the availability of an Internet connection.
    For rural communities and farmers, such availability is a systemic and global
    problem. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 39 per-cent
    of rural Americans lack access to broadband; in contrast, 4% of urban Americans
    have limited access [4]. This digital divide scenario recurs globally; overall,
    it is estimated that just over half of households (55%) have an Internet connection
    [5]. Edge computing [6] offers one potential solution for reducing Internet dependence;
    in this model, processing is moved from the back-end servers to local nodes, thus
    significantly reducing dependency on the Cloud and the Internet connection [7].
    Edge computing has been demonstrated as tractable in agriculture; however, it
    increases the complexity of system design. Moreover, sensor nodes may be mobile;
    for example, sensors may be attached to agricultural machinery or even animals.
    Thus the topological structure of the network on the farm may be dynamic - sensors
    may leave or join a network at any time. Such uncertainty introduces significant
    complications into both network and system design at the farm level. Moreover,
    such dynamicity renders a manual solution obsolete and demands the adoption of
    robust, self-adaptive designs. SECTION II. Related Research Service-oriented Architectures
    (SOA) demonstrate the migration of tasks from Cloud servers to Edge nodes [8]
    [9]. Lan et al. [10] proposed an ontology-based resource description model to
    provide unified access, control, and management of both devices and sensors to
    solve the silo application problem in IoT deployments. In [11], the IoT device
    is configured as a server and provides direct access through a static IP address,
    without needing a router. In situations where the IoT device is mobile, such an
    approach is limited. In recent years, researchers increasingly explored the possibilities
    of integrating microservice architectures with Edge computing. Qian et al. [12]
    harnessed the virtualization plat-form Docker to deploy microservices in Edge
    computing in the context of a smart city; experiments demonstrated good performance.
    Dai et al. [13] integrated microservices with Edge computing in an industrial
    context, demonstrating a knowledge-driven reasoning process to support dynamic
    configuration. Gedeon et al. [14] designed a microservice store where services
    are uploaded and made available by developers. However, the dynamic features of
    the service nodes were not considered. SOA prioritizes function reuse and adopts
    the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) for messaging. In contrast, microservices focus
    on decoupling and the use of lightweight communication protocols. Thus, the flexibility
    of the microservice architecture makes it an appropriate candidate to support
    Edge-based sensing; furthermore, it eases task scheduling between Edge nodes.
    Alam et al. [15] introduces the orchestration concept; this concept is widely
    used in Cloud and Edge computing to resolve availability and reliability problems.
    Villari et al. [16] present an orchestration broker based on OpenStack [17]; this
    orchestration service operates under geolocation deployment constraints. Samanta
    et al. [18] adopt a heuristic solution to schedule microservices at the Edge of
    the network; its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulations. Wang [19]
    illustrates how reinforcement learning may optimize microservice coordination;
    performance is validated based on a real-world dataset. In [20], microservices
    are implemented as Docker containers and allowed to migrate in the geographic
    vicinity of moving IoT devices. In summary: existing research mainly focuses on
    the algorithm aspects; minimising design and implementation complexity has not
    been emphasized. A. Novelty Research and software engineering practice indicate
    that microservice architectures are good at resolving dynamic issues at the design
    stage. Microservices encapsulate stateless, independent deployment, and fine-grained
    granularity characteristics. Thus such services may be regarded as components
    that can be seamlessly integrated with, or removed from, an arbitrary system but
    without negatively affecting the functionality of other system components and
    services. Such loose coupling of features provide excellent foundations for dynamic
    system design. Thus in this paper, the design and implementation of an Autonomous
    Edge-Sensing Software Framework (AES2F) are presented. The framework is illustrated
    through the design of several microservices for smart agriculture. Fig. 1. Data-driven
    microservices for smart agriculture Show All SECTION III. Architecture Smart agriculture
    demands access to a wide variety of data. Some data are static, for example, soil
    type; other data are dynamic, for example, soil fertility. Sources of data vary
    and include legacy or historical data concerning the farm in question. Farmers
    increasingly access external data such as that acquired from satellites, either
    every few days if using free Sentinel imagery, or every day if subscribing to
    a commercial service. Data from in-situ sensors, for example, weather stations,
    or mobile sensors such as Variable Rate Technologies (VRT), are usually harnessed
    in precision farming scenarios. Both the in-situ and mobile data categories raise
    significant challenges. However, it must be emphasized that the value of all these
    data categories can only be obtained when integrated; in this way, analytics and
    real-time decision-making becomes viable. A unified model of data-access services
    is a prerequisite for managing the heterogeneity of data and enabling the autonomous
    configuration of microservices. The heterogeneity and dynamicity of the data render
    existing orchestration methods for resource allocation obsolete as system resources
    are invariably static. AES2F remedies this situation as the frame-work supports
    the dynamic registration and deregistration of services in response to the changing
    spatial contexts and network operating conditions. Fig. 2 illustrates the architecture
    of AES2F. Core to AES2F is the microservice Register Center; this centre is the
    hub for all microservices, either those deployed on Cloud servers, Edge nodes,
    or smart sensors themselves. AES2F is now considered in terms of its core functionality.
    A. Registration Developers may choose one of three modes - active, inactive, or
    debug when deploying a microservice. Once deployed, it is registered in the microservice
    hub automatically through a post request to the register API provided by AES2F.
    Registration includes Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) of the device, device
    IP address, service access point (URI), request type, parameters, response type,
    service description, and accessing example. AES2F harnesses the device UUID to
    identify the device. The UUID is a consistent hash of critical device components,
    such as the CPU and memory chips. Therefore, even its IP address changes, the
    devices will still be recognized correctly. However, once the IP address changes,
    the device must automatically re-register to ensure synchronization with the AES2F
    microservice hub. Fig. 2. Architecture of autonomous edge sensing software framework
    (AES2F) Show All 1) Communication: All AES2F microservices adopt standard HTTP
    as the communication protocol and Representational State Transfer (REST) as constraints.
    Request types includes GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, while the response type is a
    JSON object even when the image data is encoded with a base64 string. 2) Naming:
    To avoid conflicts and ensure a consistent understanding of syntax, a specification
    to inform the naming of the microservices was designed. AES2F also has a simple
    verification scheme as part of service registration to ensure that all microservice
    names adhere to guidelines. An appropriate naming convention is essential for
    service discovery. 3) Consistency: Long-running connections in HTTP can be resource-intensive
    and inefficient; thus data is delivered asynchronously to the consumer. To resolve
    any out-of-order message problems caused by network delays or latency, timestamp
    is appended to each communication to ensure consistency. 4) Fault tolerance: AES2F
    checks for microservice avail-ability by querying the service at a regular frequency.
    If the microservice does not respond at a 200 status HTTP code for any reason,
    the microservice hub changes its status to inactive until the service is back
    on-line. From an invokers’ perspective, when a microservice is not available,
    they are requested to query the hub about the microservice status to verify that
    it is still active or whether they need to change the accessing IP address. B.
    Quality verification Data quality is crucial for decision-support. Data from sensors
    can be unreliable if calibration activities are not undertaken regularly. In some
    instances, faults with sensor data are apparent from a visual inspection of the
    data. However, problems with drift can be challenging to detect, and statistical
    methods must be employed. Missing values are a common problem with sensor data;
    AES2F employs an interpolation microservice for resolving missing data from weather
    stations [21]. The service is generalizable so can be adopted for other categories
    of data. SECTION IV. Implementation A. Complexity of smart crop production To
    illustrate how complexity and scalability issues could arise, consider an arable
    enterprise producing wheat. Such farms range in size from an average of 444 acres
    in the USA to over 11000 in the Australian Wheatbelt. A wide range of IoT devices
    is needed to monitor growth performance, including, for example, temperature,
    humidity, solar radiation, pH, and soil moisture sensors. Deploying and managing
    a network of IoT devices that cover such areas presents many challenges. Such
    challenges arise from the resulting complexity of managing large data streams
    at different spatial and temporal resolutions and in a range of diverse formats.
    Thus the classic centralized approach quickly becomes unsustainable. Edge platforms
    can help alleviate these difficulties and deliver more robust, scalable infrastructures
    such as would underpin near-real-time farm information systems. B. Implementation
    details Three components are now considered. 1) Implementation of the Register
    Center: Three modules comprise the Register Center - Developer Management, Server
    (or device) Management, and Microservice Management. The Developer Management
    module manages the users using this framework, for example, creating credentials
    and deriving statistics. The Server (or Device) Management Module super-vises
    all servers and smart devices on which microservices are deployed, ensuring consistent
    and timely network supervision. There is also a heartbeat mechanism in this module
    to detect and monitor device connectivity. Microservice Management oversees the
    operation of all microservices, for example, register, unregister, and status.
    The Register Center is implemented using Node.js [22]; it is deployed on a Docker
    container and accessed via HTTP. The database is MySQL 5.7. 2) Implementation
    of the Server Microservices: Server microservices focus on accessing legacy databases
    and third-party data repositories. These microservices are categorized according
    to their function, as illustrated in Fig. 1. For implementation, a range of open
    technologies, including Node.js, Python, and Java are employed. All microservices
    subscribe to the REST model and follow an AES2F convention regarding format, request
    method, entry point, and implementation of the dynamic register interface. 3)
    Implementation of the Edge Microservices: Edge mi-croservices gather and process
    real-time sensor data. An Android device serves as the Edge platform. Since there
    is no existing web server on the Android platform, a simple webserver to handle
    the RESTful request and responses using the Android network APIs was implemented;
    the Edge microservices are constructed on top of this. Implementation is based
    on Kotlin [23]. Edge microservices follow a similar protocol to that of the Server
    microservices. C. Examples of AES2F Microservices Three microservices illustrating
    the three different implementations described previously are now outlined. 1)
    Register Center: registerServices: The registerServices function belongs to the
    Service Management module of the Register Center; it registers one or more microservices
    to the Register Center. This microservice uses the POST method, taking a JSON
    array of service objects and the developer credential as the request body. A list
    of the successfully registered microservices and a list of fail attempts (and
    their reasons) are returned in response. An example of the JSON request and response
    are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Sample microservice: registerservices Show All 2)
    Server microservice: getSentinelImage: The getSentine-lImage microservice obtains
    a true-color image from a Sentinel 2 satellite. It requires three parameters -
    location, date, and an optional parameter zoom. The location identifies a particular
    geographic area (e.g., a field), and a date for when the image was captured. The
    optional parameter zoom allows the scaling of the image to a desired size and
    resolution. This microservice is activated via a GET method; its response is an
    image in PNG format. Fig. 4 illustrates an archetypical response for this request.
    3) Edge Microservice: getTemperature: The getTemperature microservice is deployed
    on an Android device; the service returns real-time data from the device’s temperature
    sensor. This microservice is activated via a GET method; the response is in JSON
    format as illustrated in Fig. 5. SECTION V. Results A. Experimental design A suite
    of experiments to test the effectiveness of AES2F in dynamic environments were
    designed. Three actors are central to the experiments: The Microservice Caller,
    a digital agriculture application deployed on a laptop. The microservice Register
    Center, running as a Docker container and deployed on the Cloud. The Edge microservices,
    all of which are deployed on Android devices. The deployment architecture for
    the experiments is illustrated in Fig. 6. The scenario for validating the AES2F
    is as follows: The application discovers that the microservices have lost the
    network connection. Simultaneously, the service Register Center also finds that
    the microservices have a connection problem; it then marks the status as \"inactive\"
    until the device is back online. The application checks the microservice status
    with the Register Center and gets the \"inactive\" response. The application then
    enters periodic query mode and checks the service status with a time-frequency
    tfreq before a timeout occurs; If the device network address has changed, it is
    re-registered to the Register Center. Once the application receives an \"active\"
    status from the Register Center, the connection to the microservice is restored.
    Fig. 4. Sample Server microservice: getSentinelImage Show All Fig. 5. Sample Edge
    microservice: getTemperature Show All Two scenarios that commonly affect network
    performance are considered: the connection is temporarily lost; the network address
    changes. The time difference Δt between the time that the microservice is back
    online t0 and the time that the application discovers the service is back online
    t1, that is, Δt = t1 − t0, are both measured. In the experiments, both tfreq and
    heartbeat time are set to 10 seconds. Fig. 6. The deployment architecture for
    the validation experiment Show All B. Scenario 1: Connection temporarily lost
    Connection loss and restoration are simulated by disabling and enabling the network
    connection. The timestamp of t0 and t1 and calculate the time difference Δt automatically
    are both recorded. This exercise is repeated for 50 iterations; the result is
    as Fig. 7 illustrates. It can be seen that the minimum restoration time is 0.61
    seconds, while the maximum restoration time is 15.25 seconds. The average restore
    time is 6.65 seconds. Fig. 7. Scenario 1: Restoration time when connection is
    temporarily lost Show All C. Scenario 2: Network address change Change of network
    address is simulated by changing the IP address of the device. The timestamp of
    t0 and t1 are recorded, and the time difference Δt automatically calculated. Again,
    the process is repeated 50 times. The result is as Fig. 8 illustrates. It can
    be seen that the minimum restoration time is 1.93 seconds, while the maximum restoration
    time is 14.16 seconds. The average restoration time is 7.52 seconds. Fig. 8. Scenario
    2: Restoration time when network address changes Show All The experimental results
    demonstrate that the AES2F framework is robust and effective in managing dynamic
    net-working circumstances. D. Limitations The restoration time could be changed
    with a different configuration of both the tfreq and heartbeat time; for this
    initial validation, the tfreq and heartbeat time were set to 10 seconds. This
    choice was made with due consideration to server and network payloads and the
    experimental envi-ronment. Increasing the frequency of the heartbeat cycle will
    reduce the restoration time. However, this would also increase the system payload
    and possibly decrease performance as the network scales up. Future work will involve
    increasing the test network’s heterogeneity and identifying heuristics for increasing
    robustness and ensuring scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion Limitations in broadband
    coverage limit the adoption of technologies for smart agriculture. There is an
    increasing need for mature Edge-enabled technologies to enable the practical adoption
    of smart and precision farming technologies at the individual farm level. Frameworks
    such as described in this paper are urgently needed to address the heterogeneity
    of communication, sensor technology, and farm requirements. Authors Figures References

    role of agriculture in the economy of most countries is constantly growing. The
    reason for this is, on the one hand, an increase in population, and on the other,
    an increase in the level of urbanization. Wherein, the volume of resources (land
    and water) required to produce products does not increase. The traditional resources
    for increasing the efficiency of agriculture (mechanization, development of new
    lands) have practically dried up. Achieving a qualitatively new level of development
    of the agro-industrial complex is possible only with the use of modern digital
    technologies in agricultural management. Digitalization and intellectualization
    have been made possible in a broad sense by accelerating the development of technology.
    The fourth technological revolution involves a large-scale development and deployment
    of “smart” systems, equipment, technology, and infrastructure in various fields,
    particularly agriculture. For example, according to the analysis of the Ministry
    of Agriculture of Russia, over 50 percent of the costs of agricultural enterprises
    can be optimized using digital technologies. At the same time, Russia ranks 15th
    in the world in terms of agricultural digitalization. Only about 10% of Russian
    farmers use digital technologies, while in the EU countries it is about 80% of
    farmers, and in the USA - 60% [1]. Management of agrarian systems can be divided
    into strategic and operational, while they are characterized by insufficient information
    security, imperfect methods of information processing and decision-making, limited
    time for making control actions. The development of mathematical methods and computer
    technology, the emergence of microprocessors and their improvement make it possible
    to largely remove restrictions on the quality of control. Digital, “smart” agriculture
    in general and irrigated agriculture in particular, requires the development of
    new tools that allow making increasingly complex decisions and systematizing data.
    Thus, the development of decision support systems is the main task of smart farming.
    An overview of the applications of artificial intelligence in agriculture is presented
    in [2, 3] and includes forecasting in agriculture, intelligent monitoring of diseases
    and pests, and weed control. Further development of decision support systems in
    agriculture in general and in irrigated agriculture is their intellectualization.
    The process of technological development of computer technology, software and
    related mathematical methods dictates the conditions for the development of appropriate
    decision support systems. The process of evolution goes from simple information
    and reference systems to systems based on mathematical simulation models that
    allow to form solutions. Such decision support systems for irrigated agriculture
    have been developed by Russian and foreign scientists. The emergence and rapid
    development of data science and artificial intelligence has led to a new stage
    in the development of DSS - intellectualization. Work in this direction is already
    underway [4,5,6]. In [5], an automated decision support system for irrigation
    control in a specific field of crops is proposed, based on both climatic and soil
    variables provided by meteorological stations and soil sensors. For example, FieldNET
    Decision Support System provides a fast and convenient solution for water, fertilizer,
    and chemical applications with remote control. The IrrigaSy system, developed
    in [7], is a decision support system (DSS) for irrigation water management based
    on open source online tools. The LCIS DSS, developed in [8], an irrigation supporting
    system for water use efficiency improvement in precision agriculture One approach
    is to integrate irrigation decision support systems [9] with automated irrigation
    systems. However, the existing solutions do not fully cover the needs of the agricultural
    sector, in particular, irrigated agriculture. Namely, agro-climatic resources
    are one of the key factors for the efficiency of irrigated agriculture. In countries
    with large territories and diversification in agro-climatic zones, their correct
    assessment is critically important. The purpose of this work is to develop neural
    network approaches to constructing an intelligent decision support system for
    irrigated agriculture. 2 Materials and Methods Most of the traditional Russian
    agricultural crops, such as soybeans and corn, require irrigation, while favorable
    regions can have an arid climate. So, for example, irrigation norms for soybeans
    can vary within the range: 1300–4900 m3/ha according to data only within one region,
    such as the Saratov region. And this trend, in the light of global climate change,
    can only get worse. Some analysis of forecasts of agroclimatic changes according
    to the most severe scenario for the Middle and Lower Volga regions is shown in
    Table 1 [10]. Table 1. Forecast of agro climatic changes according to the most
    severe scenario of global warming for the Middle and Lower Volga regions. Full
    size table Traditionally, in decision support systems for agro climatic parameters,
    classical statistical methods of correlation and analysis of variance are used,
    while data mining models and artificial intelligence methods are used in intelligent
    decision support systems. Artificial intelligence tools - fuzzy logic, decision
    trees, artificial neural networks, etc. can be used as the basis for such systems.
    We will use neural network algorithms as the basis for building intelligent decision
    support systems. An artificial neural network, as the most famous model of artificial
    intelligence, is a set of neurons with a specific architecture formed based on
    the relationships between neurons in different layers. The main element of a neural
    network is a neuron. The mathematical formalization [11] of an artificial neuron
    is the adder equation: $${s}_{k}={\\sum }_{j=1}^{n}{w}_{j,k}\\cdot {x}_{j}+{b}_{k}$$
    (1) and activation block equation $${y}_{k}=\\phi \\left({s}_{k}\\right),$$ (2)
    Where, for \\(k\\)-th neuron, \\({x}_{1},{x}_{2},...,{x}_{n}\\) - input signals;
    \\({w}_{1,k},{w}_{2,k},...,{w}_{n,k}\\) - synoptic weights; \\({b}_{k}\\) - reference
    signal level; \\({s}_{k}\\) - linear adder output; \\(\\phi ({s}_{k})\\) - activation
    block conversion function; \\({y}_{k}\\) - output signal. Figure 1 shows a functional
    diagram of an artificial neuron model and a multilayer neural network. Fig. 1.
    Functional diagrams of an artificial neuron model (left) and a multilayer neural
    network (right). Full size image A set of neurons connected by inputs and outputs
    makes up an artificial neural network. These networks can have different architectures,
    which leads to different types of ANNs. Different types of ANNs are used to solve
    different problems. We will consider the so-called self-organizing neural networks
    (neural network architecture of unsupervised learning), namely self-organizing
    Kohonen maps. They allow identifying clusters of input vectors that have some
    common properties. The main tasks solved with their help are best suited for the
    formation of intelligent DSS, namely, we will consider two of them: Forecasting
    agro-climatic resources by correlating new objects to one of the clusters, it
    is possible to predict the behavior of objects, since it will be similar to the
    behavior of cluster objects; Detection of anomalies in agro-climatic resources
    by analyzing clusters with a small number of objects helps to identify anomalies.
    2.1 Mathematical Model We use a feed-forward network architecture. The structure
    of a neural network has two layers - an input and a single layer of neurons (Kohonen
    layer) without displacement coefficients (Fig. 2) [12]. Fig. 2. Kohonen’s neural
    network: network connections (right), general view (left). Full size image Traditionally,
    for networks of this architecture, three main stages are considered: training,
    cluster analysis and practical use. The general scheme and mathematical implementation
    of the Kohonen network learning algorithm is well developed and can be summarized
    in the following steps: Initialization process. Initially, the original synaptic
    weight vectors are filled with random values; The process of selecting a training
    signal. Reading a set of input values from the database and choosing, with a certain
    probability, an excitation vector to be applied to the lattice of neurons; The
    process of finding the maximum similarity. Search for the “optimal” neuron according
    to the criterion of the minimum Euclidean distance; Correction process. The weights
    of the neurons located in the vicinity of the “optimal” neuron are being adjusted;
    Go to step 2. The steps of the algorithm are repeated until the output values
    of the network are stabilized with the specified accuracy. At the training stage,
    the distances \\({d}_{j}\\) from the training samples to each neuron are calculated
    using the formula [12]: $${d}_{j}={\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{({w}_{ij}- {x}_{i})}^{2}$$
    (3) \\({w}_{ij}\\) – the weighting factor connecting the input vector \\({x}_{i}\\)
    to the j-th cluster element. Then, over all distances, the minimum $$d={min}_{1\\le
    j\\le n}({d}_{j})$$ (4) is calculated and the weight coefficients of the corresponding
    neurons are adjusted according to one of the standard algorithms, for example,
    $${w}_{ij}\\left(n+1\\right)={w}_{ij}\\left(n\\right)+s(n)({x}_{i}-{w}_{ij}\\left(n\\right))$$
    (5) Where \\({w}_{ij}\\left(n\\right)\\) – the weighting factor connecting the
    input vector \\({x}_{i}\\) to the j–th cluster element at iteration n, and \\(s\\left(n\\right)\\)
    – a learning rate factor with values from zero to one. The learning process ends
    when a certain criterion is reached, for example, the value of the change in the
    weight coefficients at the next iteration - if it is less than the specified value,
    then the process is completed. This is not the only algorithm that can be applied,
    there are other ways as well. A cluster analysis procedure is applied to the trained
    neural network. The Kohonen neural network application algorithm consists either
    in correlation to one of the existing clusters, or in the conclusion that such
    a correlation is impossible for a new example. Moreover, in the first case, the
    description of the cluster and the corresponding solutions are applicable to the
    newly analyzed example. 2.2 Materials and Problem Statement As databases for model
    validation, we use data from official climate reference books, meteorological
    observations in the Roshydromet system, data from field experiments conducted
    on the basis of irrigation systems in the Saratov region of Russia, materials
    from the work of Russian scientists (for example, [13, 14]. The main climatic
    parameters of the irrigated zone are presented in Table 2. Table 2. The main parameters
    of the climate of irrigated lands in the Saratov region. Full size table The sums
    of air humidity deficits in the warm season increase from north to south from
    1800 to 2200 mm. On the contrary, the sums of active temperatures decrease in
    the same direction from 3500 to 3000 ℃. The amount of precipitation in the warm
    season for the Saratov Trans-Volga region in the northern direction increases
    from 150 mm in the extreme southeast of the region to 250 mm, and in the northeast
    region - up to 275 mm. The most important environmental problem facing humanity
    in the 21st century is the rise in temperature of the climate system of our planet
    - the so-called global warming. Over the past thirty years on the territory of
    the Saratov region during the main growing season of grain crops (May-July), the
    climate aridity has increased: the average air temperature has increased by 0.80
    ℃, while the amount of precipitation has decreased by 10 mm. The amount of autumn-winter
    precipitation (November-February) increased by 20% and the amount of precipitation
    decreased in August. Thus, the analysis shows that even within one region, the
    differentiation of agro climatic resources is high. All this urgently requires
    the development of intelligent decision support systems that allow predicting
    agro-climatic resources and detecting anomalies for optimal planning of irrigated
    crops and material resources. 3 Results and Discussions The main agro climatic
    parameters, such as the sum of active temperatures, the sum of precipitation,
    the moisture coefficient, etc. determine the assessment of biological productivity
    on what basis the yield of agricultural crops is predicted, which we will take
    as the basis for clustering. We are considering three clusters by categories:
    low, medium and high biological productivity. The number of clusters can be larger.
    The work of an intelligent algorithm in the structure of an intelligent system
    is as follows. We will supply data for each observation polygon at the input of
    the network (Table 3). Table 3. Data structure. Full size table Here aij is a
    character of the j-th parameter on the i-th polygon. Task intelligent algorithm
    would consist in agro-climatic data clustering parameters by three categories
    of biological evaluation of productivity, enabling to consider the characteristic
    properties. And, to assess the possible yield for the main irrigated crops applicable
    for practical use - low, medium and high. Consider the main agro climatic parameters,
    such as the sum of active temperatures, the amount of precipitation, the sum of
    the average daily moisture deficit values, and the moisture coefficient (Table
    4). Table 4. Data example. Full size table Let’s simulate a self-organizing Kohonen
    map in Matlab [15]. The network architecture and learning process are shown in
    Fig. 3a. We obtain the following characteristics of the object of study: the location
    of the neurons in the topology and the amount of training data associated with
    each of the neurons - cluster centers (Hits) Fig. 3c, the distance between neighboring
    neurons (SOM Neighbor Weight Distances) Fig. 3b and the neural network weight
    coefficients Fig. 3d. Analysis of the trained network based on regional data shows
    clusters of biological productivity assessment: low 18%, average 49% and high
    33%. The trained neural network is ready for implementation into a decision support
    system. The trained neural network is tested using a specific year dataset with
    specific parameters Sum of active temperatures, Average annual rainfall and etc.,
    determining the optimal biological productivity. The quality assessment of the
    constructed network can be assessed using the so-called ROC-analysis method (Receiver
    Operator Characteristic). The basis of this analysis is the construction of the
    so-called ROC-curve. It shows the dependence of the number of correctly classified
    positive examples on the number of incorrectly classified negative examples. ROC-analysis
    data with a confidence interval of 95% are shown in Table 5. Area under the ROC
    curve - 0.980; the standard error is 0.021; 95% confidence interval 0.895–0.997;
    significance level - 0.0001. Fig. 3. Neural network modeling in Matlab results.
    Full size image Table 5. ROC analysis. Full size table The constructed neural
    network model shows good quality and can be included in the control system. The
    proposed architecture of an intelligent DSS includes three modules (Fig. 4). The
    first central module is the databases and knowledge databases that provide the
    use of computational means of the other two modules of an integral and independent
    system of knowledge about the environment. The executive system is a module that
    combines a set of tools that ensure the execution of the generated program. Namely,
    the application of cluster analysis procedures, the practical use of a neural
    network and the formation of conclusions based on the knowledge bases of the main
    irrigated crops. The third module is an intelligent interface that provides communication
    and system recommendations for the end user. Fig. 4. Architecture of an intelligent
    DSS. Full size image Forecasting agroclimatic resources in a changing climate
    is more relevant than ever. Currently, many researchers are moving from physical
    models to models based on artificial neural networks, for example [16]. Another
    problematic is the further use of these models in decision support systems. For
    example, an approach based on the use of Kohonen’s neural network and GIS technologies
    was applied in [17] to cluster the spatial-temporal variability of irrigated areas.
    4 Conclusions Due to global climate changes, zonal differences and instability
    of weather conditions within one region and the influence of these factors on
    the size and quality of the yield of irrigated crops, it becomes important to
    develop decision support tools at different levels of management. In this regard,
    the central direction in the development of scientific and technological progress
    in agriculture is to improve the management of irrigated agriculture, increase
    yields on irrigated lands and resource conservation through the development of
    intelligent decision support systems, digital information technologies and mathematical
    models. Approaches based on the use of neural network technologies lead to the
    possible implementation of better and more efficient control, and the availability
    of modern software allows solving complex problems and taking into account dynamic
    components. The proposed approach to building a DSS based on an intellectual component
    will allow obtaining more accurate management decisions due to the fact that the
    ANN-model at the heart of the decision support system allows us to reveal deeper
    connections between the parameters under study. All this will contribute to increasing
    the efficiency of irrigated agriculture. References Trufliak, E., Kurchenko, N.,

    Intelligent water resources management platform for precision irrigation agriculture
    based on Internet of things Article 07 November 2022 1 Introduction In recent
    years, Chinese scholars have launched a broad and in-depth study for farmland
    environment monitoring. These studies mainly rely on 3S (GIS, RS, GPS) technology
    in a large range, and take the way of artificial ground survey in a small range.
    Surely these studies have made a lot of valuable research results. However, from
    the practical application, the farmland environmental information monitoring system
    that based on 3S technology has some questions of data imprecise, poor real-time
    and poor efficiency [1]. At present the network technology and wireless communication
    technology have been rapid development. Especially the development and maturity
    of ZigBee and GPRS/CDMA technology made up for the lack of abovementioned research,
    and to provide an effective way for improving China’s agricultural information
    monitoring system. Currently the data transmission technology which based on ZigBee
    and GPRS/CDMA has a number of typical applications in some related areas. However
    through integrating long-distance data collection with agricultural expert system
    for field data collection, processing data and sending messages to provide timely
    service to farmers, the related researches still needs to strengthen [2]. This
    paper has developed a wireless information monitoring field and timely service
    system which based on ZigBee and 4G technology, which can uniformly monitor and
    manage the environmental parameters (including environmental temperature and humidity,
    soil temperature and humidity, light, rainfall, soil pH) that distributed in farmland
    through the ZigBee wireless network, while can use the SMS to release production
    guidance information to the farmers at any time [3]. 2 Design of Architecture
    of the System The entire monitoring and service system consists of a monitoring
    host, a ZigBee network and an expert system. The ZigBee network consists of a
    ZigBee gateway node and a number of ZigBee sub-nodes that connect multiple external
    sensors. They form a wireless monitoring network. The ZigBee network sub-nodes
    collect the environmental parameters in the agricultural area through various
    sensors [4]. The collected data of environmental parameters are sent to the gateway
    node according to the ZigBee protocol through the wireless communication module
    of the terminal node. The gateway node will real-timely send the received information
    back to the server knowledge base system through the serial port, and give timely
    guidance according to the expert knowledge [5]. The whole system architecture
    is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. The system architecture Full size image 3 Design and
    Implementation of System Function 3.1 Design of Hardware Structure of Sub-node
    The sub-node hardware structure of Lower position machine is designed for multiple
    modular, and its structure is shown in Fig. 2. It mainly consists of the sensor
    module, data processing module, ZigBee communication module and power supply module
    [6]. Fig. 2. Hardware structure of a sub-node Full size image The data processing
    module is mainly composed of integrated A/D converter and the microprocessor that
    has a certain storage capacity. It is responsible for node network transaction
    management, data conversion and control of power supply of the external equipment.
    It combined the display module with keyboard module to achieve on-site data display
    and parameters setting [3]. The data acquisition module is composed of various
    sensors (environmental temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity,
    rainfall, light, soil pH and soil salinity). It is responsible for the quick and
    accurate collection of environmental information in the field. The wireless communication
    module is responsible for the data transmission and instruction transceiver among
    gateway nodes. The power management module is responsible for providing all of
    sub-nodes with the power in the entire network [7]. This paper selected a 32-bit
    low-power ARM11 microprocessor STR911FAM42 that the ST company developed as the
    core of data processing module. For other common low-end microcontrollers, it
    has richer resources and low power consumption, and can provide some processing
    capacity for future system function expansion [8]. In addition to the normal operating
    mode, it has also different levels of low-power operation mode, and is very suitable
    for low-energy farmland information monitoring applications in the field [9].
    3.2 Design of Software Structure of Sub-node The sub-node of lower position machine
    mainly realized the functions of sensor information acquisition, field data display
    and working parameter setting and ZigBee network communication. The AT commands
    are used to realize the communication between the data processing module and the
    ZigBee wireless communication module, which simplifies the communication process
    and ensures the versatility of the ZigBee wireless module. In order to reduce
    power consumption, here the following measures are taken: (1) When the sub-node
    is idle, the microprocessor is in sleep mode, when the RTC alarm and external
    interrupt come, it is in wake mode; (2) when the microprocessor acquires sensor
    data, through the I/O port The mouth control electronics relay is closed to supply
    power to the sensor, and the electronic relay is disconnected at other times [10].
    The program flow of sub-node is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Hardware structure of
    a gateway node Full size image Compared with the assembly language, the C language
    is easy to develop, readable, good maintenance and other good characteristics,
    so the software program of sub-node is written in C language. In order to ensure
    the accuracy of the sensor data, using 4 Bytes to represent the data, in line
    with IEEE 754 floating point definition. The sub-node sends the data to the gateway
    node in the following format, where the leading byte includes the packet sequence
    number, the node ID, etc. The extended byte is used to extend the additional sensor
    data and the frame check bit [11] (Table 1). Table 1. The sub-node sends the data
    to the gateway node. Full size table In the mountain farmland environment, due
    to changes in terrain, the wireless signal is easy to be interfered, resulting
    in data packet loss and error. Therefore, the sub-node software can reduce the
    data packet loss and bit error rate by increasing the number of data transmission
    and frame checking. At the same time, the software filtering technology is adopted
    to improve the accuracy of data acquisition [12]. 3.3 Design of Hardware Structure
    of Gateway Node The hardware structure of gateway node of the lower position machine
    realized modular design, the structure is shown in Fig. 3, mainly consisting of
    remote data transmission module, data processing module, ZigBee communication
    module and power supply module [13]. The data processing module is still using
    STR911FAM42 as the core unit, and responsible for the node network transaction
    management, data processing and control of external equipment such as power supply,
    and combined with the display module and keyboard module to achieve node information
    display and work parameter settings. The remote transmission terminal is responsible
    for the remote information Transmission, and collecting farmland environmental
    information quickly and accurately [14]. The ZigBee communication module is responsible
    for data transmission and instructions transceiver among sub-nodes. The power
    management module is responsible for providing energy to the entire gateway node
    [15]. 3.4 Design of Gateway Node Software Structure The software design of gateway
    node of the lower position machine mainly includes the network communication program
    that based on ZigBee protocol, the node information display, the information storage
    and forwarding program. The flow of main program is: the gateway node stores and
    integrates the data received from the sub-nodes, and encapsulates the data into
    the data frame according to the corresponding working parameters and the agreed
    code. Then they are sent to the industrial host through serial port 0, and keeps
    inquiring serial status until all the data is finished sending [16]. And then
    it is ready to receive the next packet. The gateway node main program flow is
    shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Gateway node flow Full size image 4 Intelligent Decision
    Support Application System Taking intelligent information processing as the core
    technology, the expert knowledge is integrated into the network service center
    to build a knowledge base. Through the technologies of multi-point automatic acquisition
    of the field farmland environmental data, wireless transmission based on public
    band, virtual online expert analysis and decision-making, and integration of remote
    real-time sensing data, the rapid diagnosis of farmland information and remote
    monitoring is realized. It actively push early warning and forecasting information.
    The real-time data collected by the system terminal are carried out data fusion
    and mining through the intelligent information processing module. Further the
    knowledge base system is integrated into the relevant pest forecast and fertilization
    decision-making module [17]. The decision-making results are submitted to the
    SMS service platform, and the real-time information is sent to the users. Through
    the GSM Modem (CM310) module and RS-485 computer communication interface, these
    are submitted to the WEB service system for network publishing [18]. At the same
    time, we use the methods of model calculation, knowledge reasoning and qualitative
    and quantitative ways to realize the comprehensive reasoning and decision based
    on production rules. Finally the real-time early warning information and intelligent
    decision-making of crops is achieved according to real-time data and processed
    data and rule base [19]. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6 below. Fig. 5. Intelligent
    decision support service system structure Full size image Fig. 6. Display interface
    of intelligent decision support service system Full size image 5 System Experiment
    and Analysis In order to test the stability and reliability of the system, the
    environment temperature and humidity sensor, soil temperature and humidity sensor,
    light sensor and other sensors are connected with the terminal ZigBee node that
    installed in the field farmland monitoring point. the terminal nodes collect these
    sensing data, after the data are each finished to send, it will automatically
    enter the sleep mode, and recovery wake mode after receiving the acquisition command,
    and fulfill re-acquisition of data, continuous monitoring for a month. The gateway
    node displays the received data and uploads the received data, then transmitted
    to industrial control host through the serial port. The system display interface
    is shown in Fig. 7 below. The data curve is drawn as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 7.
    Display interface of the entire system Full size image Fig. 8. Analysis of trends
    of crop habitat information Full size image The experimental data show the terminal
    nodes have send the 24 groups data of the environmental temperature and humidity,
    soil temperature and humidity, light intensity and other sensors in a month of
    monitoring, and the gateway node has received all of sensing data in real time.
    The loss rate of data packet is zero, and the collected data are accurate and
    reliable. At the same time in application demonstration of the system, this paper
    also carried out testing wireless transmission distance of the data, the current
    system can achieve barrier-free network transmission distance of 800 m, point-to-point
    communication distance of about 2.5 km. Relatively the transmission distance of
    a common ZigBee transceiver module is 200 m. So the communication distance of
    our designed system is increased by about 10 times. So our system has achieved
    the desired effect. The above experimental results show that the wireless sensor
    network based on ZigBee and ARM11 technology has good stability and reliability,
    and can provide real-time reliable and accurate on-line monitoring services for
    habitat parameters acquisition and precision agricultural production. 6 Conclusion
    This paper briefly introduced the basic principle of the farmland information
    monitoring system based on ZigBee and ARM11 technology, as well as the development
    process of the system’s hardware and software. The stability and reliability of
    the system is verified. The ZigBee and ARM11 technologies are applied to field
    farmland information transmission, and has greatly improved the reliability and
    real-time of the system [20]. The expansion and maintenance of the node is also
    very easy. It help improve the economic management of precision agricultural production
    [21]. Although the system needs to further improve in anti-interference, anti-fading,
    energy saving and network topology, the system’s integration of a variety of wireless
    communication technologies is very good learning for the existing 3S-based economic
    farmland information monitoring system. With the growth of demand for economic
    farmland products, China’s agricultural production needs to be further developed
    on the existing basis [22]. Future agricultural production requirements will strengthen
    integrated of a variety of information technologies. The advantages of integrated
    multi-system are played for the efficient management farmland production and providing
    accurate scientific basis [23]. References Shi, K., Tang, M., Wang, Z.: Research

    Nanchang, China SECTION I. Introduction In recent years, developed intelligent
    greenhouse system is a kind of resource saving and efficient agricultural development
    technology, it is based on the common greenhouse, combined with the high-tech
    methods such as modern computer control technology, intelligent sensor technology,
    artificial intelligence and expert system etc., [1] in the environment suitable
    for crop growth which is provided by computer integrated control, in order to
    realize the various kinds of crop''s factory production with quality, high efficiency
    and low consumption. Large greenhouses in Israel, Japan and other advanced countries
    have been widely used computer control system, on the basis of greenhouse automatic
    control. In present, the research direction of computer control technology to
    greenhouse includes: 1) greenhouse computer control system based on the Internet
    and greenhouse image system; 2) the ecological environment factors control; 3)
    task automation; 4) applying expert system to the greenhouse management, decision-making,
    consultation, etc., all these directions have made considerable progress. Most
    of domestic existing system are introduced from abroad, these systems are expensive
    and not suitable for China. After years development, domestic greenhouse has occupied
    the dominant position, but the computer control system of the greenhouse depends
    on import, this becomes a technical problem and bottlenecks of greenhouse industry
    in our country. In aspects of greenhouse automatic control and intelligent, China
    has take a lot of valuable research, but the system structure is unreasonable,
    the software function is weak, the reliability is not high, the system configuration
    is not flexible, so it can''t adapt to the requirement of greenhouse automatic
    control. On the present domestic demand for greenhouse automatic control level
    and demand situation of automatic control system, combining with the research
    advantages in the field of artificial intelligence and expert system, the author
    adopted the central control computer and single chip microcomputer intelligent
    controller system, real-time multitasking operating system and agricultural expert
    system for greenhouse, developed the distributed intelligent greenhouse control
    system. SECTION II. The Characteristics and The Overall Structure of Greenhouse
    Automatic Control System A. The Characteristics of The Intelligent Greenhouse
    Intelligent greenhouse control is mainly according to the environment temperature,
    humidity, light and wind speed, wind direction, rainfall and other climate factors,
    based on the greenhouse expert system and the user parameter setting, with some
    control measures to adjust the greenhouse''s temperature, humidity, ventilation,
    lighting and other environmental factors, to create the right greenhouse ecological
    environment suitable for crop growth, that is according to the demand of crops
    in different growth phases to testing standards, through the real-time detection
    of greenhouse environment, to compare the parameters for automatically adjust
    the greenhouse control equipment''s, in order to make the various environmental
    factors in accordance with established requirements. B. The Overall Architecture
    of Greenhouse Control System Greenhouse control system is consists of four parts:
    Signal collection input part: including the detection of environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, illumination, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall
    etc. Signal conversion and processing part: transfer the collected signal to which
    computer and the amount of operators can identify, and processed by a computer.
    output and control part: control wet curtain fan, sunshade net, window switch
    system. irrigation control: including the timing irrigation, the time set by the
    control room to adjust, and according to the actual situation, it can irrigate
    in greenhouse with manual control. Overall system framework is shown in figure
    1. Fig. 1 Structural diagram of the whole system Show All SECTION III. The Composition
    of Hardware System and Control Function A. Principle of System Control system
    is constituted by the central computer (Intel Celeron 433M PC) and single chip
    microcomputer intelligent control instrument (51 series single chip microcomputer),
    to implement master-slave communication, it can monitor, manage and control for
    multiple greenhouse. Single chip microcomputer intelligent control instrument
    monitors the meteorological environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity,
    light and wind speed, wind direction, rainfall and control greenhouse equipment.
    B. System Function PC: to configurate the entire system, set the control parameters
    of the controller, read the data of control instrument measurement, and operations
    like storage and display printing. If the PC is not turn on, the controller can
    automatically collect data and control. control instrument: each controller controls
    one greenhouse, with functions of data acquisition and control, it can work independently.
    Each controller has its own LCD display and keyboard system, can independently
    to control and adjust the system running state. Liquid crystal display provides
    complete menu of equipment operation parameters, equipment status, system operation
    cycle and so on, can adjust all the parameters by keyboard. SECTION IV. System
    Software Structure System software includes host computer software and slave computer
    software, host computer software is compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, the
    slave computer is written by C language, and solidified in the program memory[3].
    A. Function of Control Software read the measured value of each sensor, and transmit
    to the PC, if necessary, will store the measured data in the large capacity power-fail
    protection memory, and can exchange data with another PC. according to the internal
    control algorithm to control the greenhouse equipment, and transfer the control
    action and equipment status to the PC. realize the independent control interface
    of controller, and through the liquid crystal display and keyboard to control,
    including display the system data to LCD, provide a complete data menu, etc. B.
    Computer Greenhouse Control Software Key of system control is the greenhouse climate
    control, for making the operator can visually check the climate data, man-machine
    interfaces all adapt the friendly graphical interfaces, make the operation more
    simple and intuitive. System Software is Mainly Composed of Seven Big Modules
    Real-time monitoring module, the system parameter setting module, intelligent
    decision-making module, data processing module, database management module, manual
    control module, sprinkler module, help file module and so on. Real-Time Monitoring
    Module The Module is Responsible for the various meteorological factors analogue
    value by real-time outdoor sensor into the data which operators can identify,
    in order to prevent the impact of some transition data to observation, we Filter
    the collected data, and then displays it to the main interface of the meteorological
    factors display box, ensure the reliability of data. System Parameter Setting
    Module For parameters such as temperature, humidity, in addition to the need of
    monitor, also need to set the scope of the crop growth''s various parameters according
    to the needs of crop growth, and write these settings into the database, and then
    transmit the parameters from computer to single chip microcomputer data registers
    through the communication bus sent, on the basis of these parameters, OCM adjusts
    the inside/outside windows, the wet curtain, blower, inner/outer shading devices,
    for example when the temperature more than set temperature limit, you need to
    open the equipments such as fans and windows to cool. Intelligent Decision Module
    According to the measured data, the module adopts the method of artificial intelligence,
    with the help of the greenhouse control expert system, to automatically set some
    important control parameters of slave computer. The module is a greenhouse control
    expert system, it provides the most scientific and effective help on greenhouse
    parameters setting[4]. Data Processing Module In order to adapt to the growth
    of crops, the temperature and humidity value not only need to understand and grasp
    timely, and to summarize the rule of crop growth and demand for various parameters,
    so in the system, using system database can give the real-time data and historical
    data table display, as well as their real-time trend curve and history trend curve,
    ensure that the user can view the current value of the various parameters and
    realtime trend curve. This module can let the user to set the time interval of
    various meteorological factors and the greenhouse need to store the data. Database
    Management Module This module is responsible for setting parameters and recording,
    querying and maintaining of various meteorological factors,. Manual Control Module
    The module in the “manual” state can directly click the analog switch in the “manual
    control” to control the equipment. Sprinkler Irrigation Module According to the
    date and time interval set by users, the module can automatically sprinkle and
    irrigate. SECTION V. Key Techniques of the System A. The Real-Time of Control
    System Control system can carry on the processing to this abnormal situation in
    a timely manner, is able to start the corresponding equipment to adjust the environment
    factor. Real-time software operation cycle realizes by timer, timer is divided
    into hardware timing and software timer. Hardware timing clock''s pulse sequence
    generated by the semiconductor vibration, if it does not require high precision,
    can also produce pulse by resonance circuit. The rest of the clock can use hardware,
    or use the software to realize, and selects according to the requirements of precision
    and the duration. When we select hardware method, pulse interval is usually between
    1µs~1ms. Programmable clock can run by interval timer model or stopwatch model
    method, can change the count frequency, within a basic pulse count many times,
    but the word length of hardware counter limits the duration of the count. Because
    of its un-precision, hardware clock encoding model mainly used for the logging
    statements and printing tasks in real-time applications. Using software to realize
    timing takes calculation time, but its precision and word length can change by
    the program. So when the pulse interval is milliseconds above, software timing
    is more flexible than hardware ways, it is easier to adjust the timing model.
    In order to get higher timing accuracy, this system adopts the software timing
    method, the real-time control of this system mainly includes the following aspects:
    Real-Time Acquisition Multi-channel acquisition mode, each channel''s acquisition
    time is 0.5s, it adopts cycle collection ways, as long as the environment changes,
    the system can quickly collect the changed data. Real-Time Control For all the
    equipment, it carries out rapid and timely control, control cycle of the whole
    system is about 2s, according to the real-time collected data, we can automatic
    or manual control the system. Real-Time Reports According to the collected data
    and the current state of system equipment, the system generate the data plot and
    data curve. B. Multitasking and Concurrency Control of the Control System Greenhouse
    control system includes multiple independent operation processes, such as timing
    tasks (such as data storage and irrigation task), random tasks (such as regulating
    environmental factors controlled equipment), communication tasks and other control
    tasks, etc. For noninterference in each other, the system used multi-threading
    and multitasking software concurrent manner. Acquisition, control and communication
    run together. How to handle the coordinate relationship between multiple tasks
    is a more important problem. Single-chip microcomputer system uses interrupt response
    and query interrupt method to implement multitasking operating system. Interrupt
    response monopolizes the resources while it reacts quickly, so it is not suitable
    for higher requirements for real-time systems. This system adopts the interrupt
    query method to realize the multitasks. Using WatchDog to prevent system into
    dead circulation, to guarantee the realtime performance of the system. Interrupts
    Query Mechanism Guarantees the Running of Multitasks Interpret query mechanism
    is the key to the computer to perform multitasking. Interrupt signal sent by the
    hardware, after operating system identified signal, first to suspend the executing
    program, store the entire recovery information, initialize the interrupt. Then
    the computer starts to execute the foreground tasks, such as the “clock” module
    in the example program. Concurrency Control The main interface between the control
    program and timing program is clocK handle variables. For design the control program,
    it usually keeps the timing by a progress, the process and control procedures
    are completely independent and run in parallel. The following control program
    USES software to timing, and definite trigger variables for all tasks. C. Coordination
    of Expert System and Control System Expert system is a heuristic reasoning system
    based on the knowledge, it reasonings by special knowledge provided by one or
    more experts, to simulate human experts'' thinking method in the decision-making
    process, in order to solve the problems of complicated engineering and non-engineering.
    Expert system method provided ways and tools for dealing with heuristic intuition
    reasoning information. In the field of control, expert system combined with control
    theory, especially the heuristic reasoning combined with feedback control theory,
    to form the expert control system. Our expert system is the expert system technology
    using artificial intelligence, in the precondition of crops and livestock domain
    knowledge, models and experience of experts collected, adopted appropriate knowledge
    representation and reasoning technology to establish the knowledge base. It cooperated
    the computer control system, according to the current crop, season and time, the
    system provided decision-making support (manual setting cases) and set (fully
    automatic case). D. System Stability and Security Control system takes precise
    control for crop growth environment, so the safety of the system is particularly
    important. Security guarantee with hardware: single chip microcomputer fault display
    and system reset, Watch dog technology to prevent crashing. power-fail protection
    of the default data. host computer adopts RS-232 and RS-485 communication interface
    converter to complete the signal conversion, OCM adopts MAX485 to realize electronic
    level conversion of RS-485 and TTL. Security assurance with software: using three-time
    handshake protocol to guarantee the data transmission and system parameters of
    the remote control right between PC and multiple computer control devices. using
    CRC cyclic redundancy to check errors in the data communications. using Filtering
    technology to Filter the noise in the process of data collection. use “polling”
    technology to avoid communication conflicts. E. Software Configuration Technology
    In order to adapt to the software science development, so we must divide complex
    application into a few small, relatively simple function modules, this method
    is the component technology. In order to make components have a greater versatility
    and better extensibility, the current component technology designed the component
    module to run in different system environment, even under the different operating
    systems. The application of components has become more and more important and
    widely. This system mainly USES the Microsoft''s COM component technology to realize
    the configuration control distributed software, configuration control software
    can be used in different industrial system, it reduced the repeated programming
    work, improved the efficiency of software reuse, also improved the expansibility
    and maintainability of the system. SECTION VI. Conclusion Distributed intelligent
    computer control system uses real-time multitasking operating system and the greenhouse
    expert system. Real-time multitasking operating system makes more decisions can
    be run in parallel, increased the efficiency and response of the system. The greenhouse
    expert system which has stored large amounts of field experience and knowledge
    ensured that the system running is practical and reliable. Software configuration
    way can make the software applied to different greenhouse systems, reduced the
    repeated coding work, improved the efficiency of software development. Since 2000,
    this method has been adopted by large greenhouse in Hebei, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang,
    Gansu, Xinjiang, Henan and other places. These systems get great appraisal in
    the actual operation, fully implemented the system design target. In the actual
    operation, the parameters control range of the system running (1) temperature:
    10~40 °C, the error is ±0.01 °C (2) humidity: 45%~95% the error is ±0.1% . has
    well meet the requirements of the greenhouse control. Authors Figures References

  description: Remote sensing technology has been widely used in many fields, such
    as agricultural resource investigation, crops production estimation, disaster
    monitoring, evaluation and prediction and agricultural information management.
    People have made rich achievements in these research fields. However, the routine
    remote sensing technology has shortage to some extent and can't totally meet the
    higher demand of agriculture. Imaging spectral data with high spectral resolution
    can discern slighter spectral differences among crops, detect the changes of crops
    in narrower spectrum range and thus improve the accuracy of distinguishing crops.
    This paper takes Shunyi District of Beijing as a research area, makes systematical
    study on imaging spectral data processing and analytical method, and discusses
    how to use the massive hyperspectral remote sensing data sufficiently and effectively
    in order to do some researches on agricultural parameter selection and crops information
    extraction and mining. Based on these, remote sensing technology can serve precision
    agriculture better and more directly, and we can make intelligent decision and
    management for modern agriculture.

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification

    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are
    half of the major and minor axis of the ellipse and is the height of the IRT sensor
    with respect to the soil. Download : Download high-res image (373KB) Download

    equation (10). (10) where is the IRT inclination, is FOV/2 and is the half of
    the ellipse-major axis from Fig. 3b. (11) (12) (13) (14) Using the ellipse equation

    (16) is obtained. (15) (16) where is the half of the minor axis of the ellipse.
    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    and GPS location on the center pivot. A Geo7X GPS (Trimble®, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
    allowed the definition of , (Span1 distance) and (Span2 distance) coordinates,
    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).
    (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number,
    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and
    discussion Fig. 5a shows the GPS node located at the center pivot final tower.

    cell panel connected to a voltage regulator from 12 V to 5 V. The Raspberry Pi3

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting

    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    Available Nearly all aspects covered in state-of-the-art studies involve using
    temperature and humidity sensors, crucial considerations for mushroom plants.
    Some studies delve deeper, incorporating additional sensors for monitoring soil
    moisture, carbon dioxide levels, light intensity, and even climate factors like
    wind and air. The diversity extends to the forms of technology communication and
    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.
    Method Number of managed vital parameters Number of actuating tools Ability to
    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Soil moisture, also referred to as soil water content, is a crucial
    geophysical state variable in various fields, including agriculture, hydrology,
    meteorology, and remote sensing calibration/validation (cal/val). Therefore, accurate
    measurements of in situ soil moisture are essential to ensure the improved modeling
    of geophysical processes, perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for
    societal benefits. There are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the gravimetric
    method of soil moisture measurement is the most accurate, however, it is not suitable
    for real-time or large-scale field studies due to labor- and time-intensive procedures.
    In other words, the gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not
    very feasible for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large number
    of in-situ observations are needed frequently as well as for validation of the
    remote sensing-based products that require sampling in a narrow time window during
    satellite passes. Hence, alternative modern methods like electronic sensors that
    measure soil moisture instantly are necessary for such applications. Since soil
    moisture sensors usually operate on the principle of dielectric characterization
    of the soil and water and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture,
    these sensors require appropriate calibration for precise measurements. Although
    various procedures for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors are available
    in the scientific literature, factors affecting calibration, the technical complexity
    of calibration, and lack of confidence in their effectiveness limits their use
    in field studies. In this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration
    protocols has been conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and limitations
    of various calibration methods and approaches for dielectric permittivity-based
    soil moisture sensors. The importance of selecting an appropriate calibration
    method based on the sensor type, soil type, and environmental conditions is highlighted
    in this review. We also examine various calibration methods, including traditional
    equations based on linear or polynomial regression and advanced methods such as
    the nonlinear approach (i.e., artificial neural network). The need for regular
    calibration and maintenance of soil moisture sensors to ensure accurate and reliable
    data is also emphasized. The review concludes by providing recommendations for
    selecting the appropriate calibration method/approach for dielectric soil moisture
    sensors to achieve the required accuracy and future directions. Overall, this
    review provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field
    of dielectric sensor-based soil moisture monitoring and management.

    (FDR) 1. Introduction Accurate measurement of soil moisture is crucial in various
    hydrological, agricultural, and remote sensing applications (Chen and Or, 2006,
    Lamaoui et al., 2018, Robinson et al., 2008, Rosenzweig et al., 2014). It determines
    crop water needs (Dong et al., 2020) and affects crop growth (Mane and Kadam,
    2021). Surface soil moisture (∼5 cm) significantly impacts rainfall-runoff relationship
    (Brocca et al., 2017, Mohanty et al., 2000, Pan, 2012, Rowlandson et al., 2013)
    and plays role in drought, floods, groundwater recharge, and water management
    (Robinson et al., 2008; Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014, Vereecken et al., 2014). These
    applications rely on soil moisture’s influence on various atmospheric processes,
    affecting hydrology, weather predication and agriculture (Lal et al., 2023, Seneviratne
    et al., 2010, Vargas Zeppetello et al., 2019). Understanding these interactions
    informs decisions on water resources, drought and flood mitigation and land use
    practices. Though soil moisture is an important hydrological state variable for
    various applications, these applications require soil moisture measurements at
    different spatial scales i.e., point- (for soil moisture monitoring stations),
    field- (such as farms), watershed-, and regional-scale. Fairly accurate soil moisture
    measurement at various spatial scales is essential to fulfilling the technical
    requirements of applications such as initializing the state, data assimilation,
    optimization of model parameters, and validation of model outputs (Lal et al.,
    2022). However, obtaining the soil moisture value (average) at a particular spatial
    scale beside the point-scale is no trivial task. As spatial evolution of soil
    moisture across scales depend on the soil texture, vegetation, terrain, and variability
    in precipitation (Pan and Wang, 2009, Yao et al., 2012). Thus, conducting in-situ
    soil moisture measurements at various locations within the chosen scale is necessary
    to obtain an accurate estimate of average soil moisture. The conventional approach
    of soil moisture measurement i.e., gravimetric sampling is the most precise in-situ
    method (Gardner, 2018), but not feasible to extend measurements at watershed-/regional-scale
    (Singh et al., 2019) and real-time continuous measurements at point-/field-scale
    (Mukhlisin et al., 2021, Mwale et al., 2005). Hence, there is a need for alternatives
    to gravimetric sampling, providing precise, spatially distributed in-situ soil
    moisture measurements over large regions with less time and effort to support
    various applications and validate remote sensing data. Over the past decade, the
    use of sensor-based techniques, for indirect measurement of soil moisture, has
    increased significantly (Yin et al., 2021). Various commercial sensors, including
    neutron, electromagnetic, tensiometry, and hygrometry types, have revolutionized
    soil moisture measurement (Gorthi et al., 2020, Nagahage et al., 2019; Susha Lekshmi
    et al., 2014). Electromagnetic sensors, like Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR),
    Transmission Line Oscillator (TLO), Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR), and
    Capacitance-based sensor are popular due to their simplicity and efficient data
    handling (Barkunan et al., 2019, Soulis et al., 2015, Spelman et al., 2013). These
    sensors typically measure soil dielectric permittivity, indirectly estimating
    volumetric water content (VWC) by assessing electrical conductivity or charge-storage
    capacity or travel time. Calibration is a crucial process that involves adjustment
    of the sensor readings to account for the specific conditions and properties of
    the soil to provide accurate and consistent soil moisture readings (Bogena et
    al., 2007, Spelman et al., 2013). For example, soils with higher clay content
    typically exhibit higher electrical conductivity, whereas soils with higher sand
    content often display lower electrical conductivity (Heil and Schmidhalter, 2012,
    Stadler et al., 2015). This difference can significantly affect accuracy of soil
    moisture sensors, especially those operating at lower frequencies, up to 150 MHz
    (Kizito et al. 2008a). Hence, the development of a robust calibration for a dielectric
    principle-based sensor is crucial to consider the frequency of the sensor and
    the type of soil where measurement needs to be carried out (Baumhardt et al.,
    2000, Bogena et al., 2007, Chandler et al., 2004, Seyfried and Grant, 2007). Several
    studies on calibration of soil moisture reveal conflicting results in the performance
    of lower-frequency soil moisture sensors and their relationship to the effects
    of temperature. Chen and Or (2006) established a relationship between frequency
    and electrical conductivity for soil moisture sensors having operating frequencies
    less than 150 MHz but did not investigate temperature sensitivity. Kizito et al.
    2008a suggested a solution to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors by
    increasing their frequency to more than 150 MHz. This helps to make the sensors
    more sensitive and reduces the effect of temperature. As a result, a single calibration
    curve can be used across different types of soils. In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015)
    found temperature and salinity sensitivity for the low frequency sensor at 50
    MHz such as Stevens Water Hydra Probe, and Cosh et al. (2016) reported a low absolute
    error (± 0.013 m3m−3) estimates for the low frequency impedance probe such as
    Theta Probe at 100 MHz. However, the recent study by Zawilski et al. (2023) emphasized
    the inadequacy of a single calibration curve (i.e., generalized calibration) for
    dielectric-based soil moisture sensors in same soil textural class at different
    locations, and suggested to develop soil-specific calibrations to achieve high
    accuracy in measurement. The many past studies (Cosh et al., 2016, Rowlandson
    et al., 2013, Singh et al., 2021, Zawilski et al., 2023) highlight the importance
    of developing various calibrations i.e., field-specific, soil-specific, and generalized
    calibration for achieving reliable accuracy based on the available resources.
    The divergent results in the literature emphasize the importance of appropriate
    calibration procedures for dielectric-based soil moisture sensors. While calibration
    of dielectric soil moisture sensors is crucial for accurate measurements, there
    is currently a lack of standardization and consistency in calibration methods
    among different studies (Francesca et al., 2010, Mittelbach et al., 2012, Ojo
    et al., 2015, Rowlandson et al., 2013, Singh et al., 2021). In this regard, the
    review conducted by Ochsner et al. (2013) focused on describing the state of large-scale
    soil moisture monitoring and identifying critical research needs to optimize the
    use of available soil moisture data. Their review covered emerging sensing techniques,
    remote sensing missions, monitoring networks, and applications of large-scale
    soil moisture measurements. From this review it was revealed that the lack of
    standardization in sensor calibration is a significant challenge for monitoring
    accurate soil moisture over a large area. Without standardized protocols for sensor
    calibration, the quality and accuracy of soil moisture measurements collected
    across different soil types and a wide geographic extent remain uncertain, making
    it difficult to quantify the associated uncertainty. Although the review did not
    specifically address the critical calibration methods employed for soil moisture
    sensors, these methods are integral components of comprehensive soil moisture
    monitoring. Also, the literature on soil moisture sensing techniques, calibration,
    and factors affecting soil moisture sensing lacks a comprehensive organization.
    As a result, reviewing existing calibration practices and methods for soil moisture
    sensors becomes imperative. In the modern era of smart agriculture and advanced
    sensing technology, soil moisture measurement is increasingly shifting toward
    the adoption of indirect measurement technologies especially use of electromagnetic
    dielectric soil moisture sensor. Furthermore, with the upcoming launch of the
    NISAR mission, set for 2024, which will provide high-resolution satellite soil
    moisture measurements, there will be a growing need for ground validation of these
    satellite-derived soil moisture products. Dielectric soil moisture sensors can
    play a crucial role in the satellite soil moisture products validation process
    due to its instantaneous and reliable in-situ measurements. However, several challenges
    persist for the dielectric sensor based accurate soil moisture measurements in
    a large region. Firstly, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding
    the specific calibration requirements of various commercially available dielectric
    sensors used in this domain. Although numerous research studies have addressed
    dielectric-based soil moisture sensor calibration, the difficulty lies in translating
    these research findings and recommendations into practical guidelines for farmers,
    agricultural practitioners, and researchers. This aspect is often overlooked,
    creating a gap in the implementation of effective sensor-based soil moisture management
    practices. Establishing standardized protocols for dielectric sensor calibration
    can improve the quality of data, promote comparability, and enable a better understanding
    of soil water resources, which will be need of various Governmental as well as
    Non-Governmental Organization. Failure to address these issues could result in
    unreliable measurements, misinformed decision-making, and, ultimately, environmental,
    and economic consequences. Therefore, a comprehensive review of previous research
    on dielectric soil moisture sensor calibration is needed to gain a deeper understanding
    of the most effective calibration methods and the limitations of current commercially
    available sensors. The primary goal of this review is to identify the most suitable
    calibration approach or strategy and establish guidelines to enhance the calibration
    process of dielectric soil moisture sensor, ensuring consistently reliable and
    accurate measurements. 2. Soil moisture measurement technique by using sensors
    Generally, there are two types of sensors used to measure soil moisture: volumetric
    water content (VWC) and soil matric potential (Sharma, 2019). The VWC sensor indirectly
    measures the soil moisture (Jackson et al., 2010), whereas soil matric potential
    sensors measure the amount of force required to extract the water from the soil,
    which can further be converted to VWC using soil–water retention curve (Yu et
    al., 2021a). Usually, soil moisture sensors that measure VWC are considered over
    soil matric potential sensors because their measuring range is limited to 0 to
    − 85 kPa which is not useful for dryer soil and repeatability of calibrations
    is poor in the field even when the same sensor is repeatedly recalibrated in the
    same soil and perform (Evett et al., 2008, Noborio et al., 1999, Spaans and Baker,
    1992). Several techniques are available to measure VWC by using soil moisture
    sensors like neutron scattering, gamma attenuation, COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing
    System (COSMOS) and dielectric techniques, including TDR, Transmission line oscillator
    (TLO), and capacitance probes (Caldwell et al., 2018, Campbell and Anderson, 1998).
    Neutron moisture meters (NMM) were once considered a reliable tool for determining
    soil water content in the soil profile. The NMM sensors work by measuring the
    amount of thermal or epithermal neutrons that are scattered or absorbed by the
    soil. However, due to radiological regulations and the need for constant supervision
    and trained personnel, the use of NMMs became limited, as highlighted in studies
    by Kafarski et al. (2019) and Susha Lekshmi et al. (2014). Furthermore, research
    by Yu et al. (2021b) has discussed that the NMM''s vertical precision is low,
    making it challenging to obtain accurate measurements of the surface layer. In
    contrast, the gamma-ray attenuation technique is a non-destructive in-situ technique
    that uses changes in saturated density to determine moisture content by using
    gamma rays (Evett et al., 2008). However, it comes with greater safety risks than
    NMM due to the use of gamma rays. Moreover, the operational costs of the gamma
    attenuation technique are relatively high compared to NMM. Despite its effectiveness
    in measuring soil moisture, potential hazards make it practically impossible to
    use gamma-ray attenuation techniques on a large scale, as emphasized by Zazueta
    and Xin (1994). The Cosmic-ray method, used to measure area-average soil moisture
    at the hectometre horizontal scale, is implemented within the COSMOS. This system
    utilizes a stationary cosmic-ray soil moisture probe to measure neutrons generated
    by cosmic rays interacting with air, soil, and other materials (Zreda et al.,
    2008). These neutrons are predominantly moderated by hydrogen atoms, primarily
    in soil water, and subsequently emitted into the atmosphere, where they mix instantaneously
    over hundreds of meters. The density of these neutrons is inversely correlated
    with soil moisture levels (Bogena et al., 2022, Zreda et al., 2012). This approach
    offers an advantage over the NMM sensor. It operates in a manner similar to the
    neutron probe, with a key distinction being its utilization of cosmic rays as
    the source of fast neutrons. This design choice eliminates the challenges associated
    with handling a radioactive source (Zreda et al., 2008). The COSMOS system offers
    a landscape-scale perspective on soil moisture, complemented by point measurements
    obtained through dielectric-based electromagnetic soil moisture sensors. However,
    it is important to note that the practicality of employing COSMOS in agriculture
    (as highlighted by Li et al. (2019)) and the probe''s measurements alone may not
    fully capture changes in soil moisture at greater depths (Dimitrova-Petrova et
    al., 2020, Peterson et al., 2016). A dielectric-based soil moisture sensor is
    a powerful tool for accurately measuring soil moisture content. Unlike other methods,
    such as NMM and Gamma-ray attenuation, this sensor works by detecting changes
    in the electrical properties of the soil, specifically the dielectric permittivity
    (Topp et al., 1980). The dielectric permittivity of the soil changes as the soil
    moisture content varies, which is reflected in the EM signal measured by the sensor.
    Analyzing these changes in the EM signal allows for estimating the soil moisture
    content with a high degree of accuracy. In addition, this type of sensor has a
    rapid response time (Mwale et al., 2005), making it ideal for applications where
    real-time data is crucial. Moreover, it can be easily calibrated for specific
    soil types and fields thus, enhancing its measurement accuracy. The versatility
    of the dielectric-based soil moisture sensor is another advantage, as it can be
    used as either a stationary or portable unit with minimal cost of operation. Overall,
    dielectric-based reliable and effective solution for measuring soil moisture content
    can be used in various other applications including agriculture and hydrology
    (Chen et al., 2012, Kameyama et al., 2014, Scheuermann et al., 2009, Schimleck
    et al., 2011). The dielectric-based soil moisture sensor has advantages over other
    methods, such as NMM and Gamma-ray attenuation. It is a valuable tool that has
    gained popularity due to its accuracy, rapid response time, and versatility. 3.
    Principle of dielectric soil moisture sensors Soil moisture sensors based on dielectric
    permittivity operate on the principle that when a sensor propagates electromagnetic
    (EM) wave through the soil, it encounters variations due to changes in soil dielectric
    permittivity. Dielectric permittivity is an electrical property of the soil that
    is highly influenced by the soil moisture content. The soil dielectric permittivity
    is defined as the ratio of the permittivity of the soil to that of free space,
    and is commonly referred to as the relative permittivity of soil or soil dielectric
    constant, which usually denoted as εr. The εr ranging from 80 for water to 1 for
    air, with variations between 2 and 5 for dry soil (Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018,
    Singh et al., 2019). Since the εr of water is much higher than the air and dry
    soil, the εr of soil–water mixture, is greatly influenced by the proportion of
    water present in the soil pores. As a result, electromagnetic dielectric soil
    moisture sensors, which make use of relative dielectric permittivity (εr), have
    evolved into well-established technologies for measuring the VWC of soil (Blonquist
    et al., 2005, Robinson et al., 2008, Topp et al., 1980, Wobschall, 1978). An essential
    aspect of comprehending the principle of operation of dielectric sensors used
    to measure soil moisture content is measuring the encountered variations in EM
    waves’ frequency, or charge-storage capacity, or travel time when passes through
    the soil–water medium. The variations in EM wave influenced by water content in
    soil as well as vary from one soil type to another, and may also influenced under
    different environmental conditions. In a soil–water mixture, a water molecule
    has the ability to either store energy (i.e., charge storage capacity) or release
    heat as a loss of energy when exposed to an EM field, which influences the EM
    wave and helps in measurement of εr. The εr is a dimensionless number that is
    in generally a complex-value, which can be characterized by its real (εr′) and
    imaginary (εr˝) parts, where the εr′ indicates the energy storage capacity (correlated
    with VWC) and the εr˝ denotes the amount of energy loss as heat (Mohamed and Paleologos,
    2018, Wang and Schmugge, 1980). The equations to calculate the real and imaginary
    parts of εr are as follows: (1) (2) The contribution of the σdc term is relevant
    only when the material has some ionic conduction, and its value is non-zero. The
    refractive index is represented by n, while εs stands for the static relative
    permittivity. ω is the applied angular frequency (2πf) and τ is the relaxation
    time (time required for the water molecule to align itself with an applied field).
    In general, dielectric soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture content by
    analyzing the ability of soil to store electrical energy in an electric field
    based on the soil dielectric permittivity (Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018, Wang
    and Schmugge, 1980). This unique property of soil, which enables the storage of
    electric charge without polarizing salt ions, is measurable in terms of the dielectric
    permittivity. Since soil consists of solid, liquid, and gas, each with a different
    dielectric permittivity, dielectric sensors relate the change in the dielectric
    permittivity of the solid and liquid components by volume to determine the VWC
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Campbell et al., 2021). 3.1. Types of dielectric permittivity-based
    soil moisture measuring techniques Generally, three dielectric sensor types are
    used for soil moisture measurements, such as Time domain reflectometry (TDR),
    Capacitance, and Transmission line oscillator (TLO). 3.1.1. TDR technique TDR-based
    soil moisture sensor is a commonly used technique to measure soil moisture based
    on the relative dielectric permittivity (εr) of soil. In general, TDR is based
    upon the cable testing technology, where sensors measure the time taken by the
    EM wave (travel time) to propagate along the stainless-steel rods that are surrounded
    by the soil, and this travel time depends upon the dielectric permittivity of
    soil. The schematic for measuring the soil moisture by using TDR is shown in Fig.
    1. The sampling oscilloscope generates an EM pulse and sends it into the soil
    through a TDR probe. It encounters a change in the εr at the soil–water interface,
    leading to alterations in εr and variations in EM pulse speed along the length
    of the TDR probe rods. Consequently, the initial pulse reflection occurs at the
    beginning of the probe rods within the soil, while the subsequent pulse reflections
    originate from the end of the probe rods. The elapsed time between these reflections
    serves as the basis for subsequent calculations. The technique involves measuring
    the time delay between the initial pulse and the reflected pulse is directly proportional
    to the distance between the probe, length of probe rods inside the soil, and the
    charge storage capacity (or dielectric permittivity) of the soil–water interface
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Chavanne and Frangi, 2022). TDR calculate the εr of soil
    by measuring the time delay (Δt) in EM pulse propagation along the TDR probe rods
    of length (Le) that are surrounded by the soil medium using the following relationships
    given by Topp et al. (1980): (4) where, c is the velocity of EM wave in free space
    and Le is length of metal tine or rods or waveguide. The term c×Δt/2 in Eq.4 can
    be referred as the apparent length (La) of TDR probe. The La measures as a distance
    between EM pulse’s initial reflection (occurs at the beginning of the probe rods
    within the soil) and reflection originate from the end of the probe rods (Baker
    and Allmaras, 1990). Thus, the Eq.4 can be written as: (4.1) since La is related
    to εr, it can also be correlated with VWC. Saturated soil experiences an increase
    in La of the EM pulse along the probe rods, leading to a high εr value due to
    the presence of a high-water content in the soil. However, in dry soil, the La
    of the EM pulse along the probe rods is shorter, resulting in a low εr value.
    Readers can refer to Noborio (2001) for more details about La of the EM pulse
    along the probe rods under different soil wetness conditions. The TDR based sensors
    considered as the highly accurate and reliable soil moisture sensors (Baker and
    Allmaras, 1990, Fellner-Feldegg, 1969, Heimovaara, 1994, Noborio, 2001, Smith
    and Mullins, 2001, Topp et al., 1980). The equipment required for TDR measurements
    is relatively expensive compared to other soil moisture measurement methods, such
    as capacitance-based sensors and frequency domain sensor (Scheberl et al., 2019,
    Singh et al., 2023, Staub et al., 2010). Download : Download high-res image (274KB)

    measure the capacitance namely electrical charge storage capacity, of the soil
    (Kelleners et al., 2004a, 2005a). The ability of soil to store charge is related
    to its water content present in the soil pores, allowing the sensor to determine
    the soil moisture. These sensors are cost-effective, and report acceptable accuracy
    with error less than ± 0.04 m3m−3 in soil moisture measurements (Bogena et al.,
    2007, Entekhabi et al., 2010, Francesca et al., 2010, Parvin and Degré, 2016).
    The relative permittivity or charge storage capacity of water is very high (εr
    = 80) as compared to dry soil (εr = 3–5) and air (εr = 1), thus any change in
    soil water content changes the εr of the soil–water mixture (Robinson et al.,
    2002, Singh et al., 2019). Since soil acts as a dielectric medium, the charge
    time of the sensor capacitor was used to measure the εr of soil. The capacitance
    sensor utilizes an electronic oscillator that generates a repetitive square waveform
    with a characteristic frequency (less than 100 MHz) to measure the εr of the soil–water
    mixture surrounding the two thin electrodes of the sensor, as illustrated in the
    schematic of the capacitance operation shown in Fig. 2. The relationship between
    the time (t) taken to charge a capacitor with a starting voltage (Vi) to a final
    voltage (V) with an applied voltage, Va of capacitor is as follows (Kargas and
    Soulis, 2012): (5.1) if resistance (R), Vi, and Va held constant then using Eq.
    (5.1), then charge time of capacitor (t) can be relate to capacitance (C), which
    is a charge-storage capacity of the dielectric material like soil–water mixture.
    The capacitance varies according to the water content present in the soil. The
    greater is the soil water content, the higher the capacitance of the sensor and
    vice-a-versa. Download : Download high-res image (179KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Capacitance-based schematic for measuring soil moisture. The capacitance,
    C, is related to the dielectric permittivity of a soil–water mixture and sensor
    geometrical factor, F (F = A/d, A is the area of conductive plates cross-section
    and d is the distance between the conductive plates) and can be calculated by:
    (5.2) By assuming charge time (t) as a linear function of dielectric permittivity
    of the soil–water mixture, the εr can be calculated as: (5.3) where, ε0 is the
    permittivity of free space. The εr of the soil is calculated by utilizing the
    charge time (t) of a capacitor in Eq.5.3. At a high-water content in soil the
    capacitor charge slowly and therefore the charge time is higher in wet soil as
    compared to the dry soil (Bogena et al., 2007). A typical capacitance sensor provides
    the outputs in terms of voltage (V) level, which is directly related to the charge
    time of the capacitor. The resulted output voltage is then related to εr or directly
    to VWC using specific calibrations. Capacitance sensors, which operate at low
    frequencies (less than 100 MHz), are widely used for measuring soil moisture content.
    However, their accuracy is highly sensitive to temperature and salinity, and therefore,
    a robust calibration is required to compensate for these factors during the measurement
    process (Bogena et al., 2007, Kelleners et al., 2004b). Despite this limitation,
    studies have demonstrated that low-cost capacitance sensors can provide soil moisture
    measurement with an acceptable absolute error less than ± 0.04 m3m-3 in the 0
    °C to 20 °C soil temperature range and up to 9 dS/m salinity. This makes them
    a viable option for validating remote sensing based soil moisture products (Mittelbach
    et al., 2012). Capacitance-based soil moisture sensing is relatively simple, instantaneous,
    and inexpensive, giving it an advantage for regional scale soil moisture measurements.
    However, the accuracy of capacitance sensors is limited by the depth of placement
    (Mazahrih et al., 2008), length of probe and the presence of salts in the soil
    (Kelleners et al., 2004a, Kelleners et al., 2004b, Kizito et al., 2008). Therefore,
    while capacitance sensors are a promising option for soil moisture measurement,
    their limitations must be taken into account when using them for different applications.
    3.1.3. Transmission line oscillator (TLO) technique and frequency domian Reflectometry
    (FDR) The TLO technique involves transmitting an EM wave into the soil and measuring
    its reflection, which is influenced by the soil''s dielectric permittivity (Caldwell
    et al., 2018, Munoz Carpena, 2021). The TLO sensor consists of a transmission
    line, a probe, and a measurement system as shown in Fig. 3. The transmission line
    is used to transmit the electromagnetic wave into the soil, and the probe (which
    act as an extension to transmission line) is used to measure the reflection of
    the wave. This measurement is then used to calculate number of reflection (Kelleners
    et al., 2005) or probe impedance (Gaskin and Miller, 1996). A differential oscillator
    circuit (frequency generator) is connected to the rods, and it experiences a state
    change in its oscillator when it detects the reflected signal from either of the
    rods. The measurement system is used to analyze the two-way travel time (t) or
    period (P) of the reflection of the EM wave and determine the soil moisture content
    as per the varying dielectric permittivity of soil under different soil wetness
    conditions (Caldwell et al., 2018). The travel time of the reflection is inversely
    proportional to number of reflections per second (fr, T−1) of the EM wave (Caldwell
    et al., 2018). The commercially available TLO sensors like Campbell Scientific’s
    CS-615 and CS-616 utilizes this principle for soil moisture measurement. The travel
    time (t) for the reflectometer can be related as follows: where, L is the length
    of probe rods, Sf is scaling factor, c is speed of light in free space, td is
    delay time in the probe head before the next pulse is triggered. Download : Download

    for moisture measurement. The radiometric coaxial transmission line oscillator
    technique, such as used in Stevenson’s Hydra Probe, utilizes probe impedance (Zp)
    to measure the dielectric permittivity. It is also referred as the FDR technique
    to measure soil moisture, which is based on swept frequency (i.e., collecting
    the data over a wide range of frequencies) of the EM wave. The sensing probe acts
    like an extra section of the transmission line, and its impedance changes based
    on the dielectric permittivity of soil around the probe rods (Gaskin and Miller,
    1996). Notably, the both TLO and FDR sensor-based measurement process involves
    repetition of multiple frequencies to obtain a frequency response of the soil
    based on the wetness. The frequency response of the soil is analyzed using mathematical
    models to determine the soil moisture content (Seyfried et al., 2005, Topp et
    al., 1980; Xu et al., 2012). When the voltage applied to the coaxial FDR, the
    response of signal is related to Zp is as follows (Seyfried et al., 2005): where
    Zc is the characteristic impedance of the coaxial cable (determined independently)
    and Γ is the complex ratio of the reflected voltage to the incident voltage. Under
    these conditions, the probe impedance is determined by the electrical properties
    of the probe itself (Z0) and the εr of the media in the soil–water mixture. The
    relationship is as follows: where L is the probe length and c is the speed of
    light. By using the raw signal outputs i.e. voltage level, it can be solved for
    εr (Seyfried and Grant, 2007). TLO and FDR technique offers significant advantages
    over other soil moisture measurement methods, such as TDR and capacitance sensors.
    Similar to TDR, TLO is also utilized for continuous measurements of soil moisture
    content at various points over a larger area (Lievens et al., 2015, Sanchez et
    al., 2012), and can measure moisture content to a greater depth (Bosch et al.,
    2006, Cosh et al., 2016). Capacitance sensors are limited in their ability to
    measure moisture content to shallow depths. However, the TLO technique is more
    expensive than capacitance sensors. Despite the higher cost, TLO provides more
    accurate measurements of soil moisture content, particularly in clay and organic
    soils. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of TLO in measuring
    soil moisture content in a range of soil types. For instance, Bosch et al., 2006,
    Kelleners and Verma, 2010, and Zawilski et al. (2023) found that Hydra probe provides
    more accurate soil moisture measurements in clay and organic soils compared to
    TDR and capacitance sensors. However, it is important to note that Bittelli, (2011)
    and Zawilski et al. (2023) reported that the accuracy of TLO or FDR measurements
    may still be affected by various factors, such as salinity, clay and organic soil.
    Although some experimental and theoretical approaches have been studies by Caldwell
    et al., 2018, Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2015, and Zawilski et al. (2023) to
    address this issue and all of them suggesting a soil specific calibration to improve
    the accuracy which is also the similar for other two types of techniques we discussed.
    Furthermore, from a cost perspective, the sensor based on TDR technique notably
    more expensive than both the Capacitance and the TLO or FDR technique. Specifically,
    the sensor based on TDR technique is approximately 3.08 times more costly than
    the Capacitance based sensor. Comparatively, the sensor based on TLO technique
    is around 1.29 times more expensive than the Capacitance sensor. Furthermore,
    when directly comparing the TDR and TLO or FDR, the TDR is roughly 2.41 times
    more expensive than the TLO or FDR sensor. The given costs comparison for a single
    sensor with a data logger were obtained from Kukal et al. (2020) and quote obtained
    from the respective companies. These cost differentials underscore the financial
    considerations associated with choosing the TLO or FDR sensor for soil moisture
    measurement, especially in large-scale applications. Therefore, while TLO or FDR
    offers many advantages over other soil moisture measurement techniques, users
    should carefully consider their specific needs and circumstances before choosing
    this technique. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the accuracy in soil moisture measurement
    of different technique-based dielectric sensors as reported in various research
    studies. Table 1 lists the measurement accuracy details of manufacturer-provided
    calibration or factory calibration and the calibration developed in various research
    studies for popular commercially available dielectric soil moisture sensors such
    as 10HS, TDR, EC 5, Hydra Probe, and Theta Probe. It is evident from the Table
    1 that the accuracy of measuring soil moisture using a dielectric sensor varies
    depending on the type of sensor used, the calibration method adopted, and the
    specific application. For instance, the 10HS sensor shows an accuracy of approximately
    ± 0.03 m3m−3 with factory calibration as well as specific calibrations developed
    in various research studies. However, the CS616 and CS625 sensors found to have
    soil moisture measurement accuracy of ± 0.025 m3m−3 with factory calibration and
    an accuracy range of ± 0.016 m3m−3 to ± 0.129 m3m−3 using specific calibrations
    developed in various research studies. The widely used Hydra Probe and Theta Probe
    found to have an accuracy range between ± 0.0177 m3m−3 to ± 0.0623 m3m−3 and ±
    0.018 m3m−3 to ± 0.055 m3m−3, respectively, in various research studies. These
    past studies also revealed that soil or field-specific calibrations can significantly
    improve the accuracy of the sensors in measuring soil moisture, as seen in the
    examples provided in Table 1. These finding highlights the importance of calibrating
    sensors to specific soil types and conditions to obtain accurate soil moisture
    measurements (Burns et al., 2014, Colliander et al., 2017, Cosh et al., 2005).

    affecting the accuracy of dielectric soil moisture sensors The soil moisture sensors
    are criticized for being non selective because of soil environmental impacts since
    they frequently operate at the low end of the frequency (Chen and Or, 2006, Kizito
    et al., 2008). The data presented in Table 1, demonstrates that the accuracy of
    the sensor differs when the identical equation is applied in the same soil type.
    This indicates that factors other than soil moisture content, including temperature,
    salinity and soil texture, affect the accuracy of the sensor. The laboratory and
    field calibration methods are commonly used in academic, scientific, as well as
    professional studies. Several studies have been conducted in past and still, there
    is a lot of research scope to ascertain how factors in the soil environment, such
    as temperature, salinity, and soil type, affect the measurement''s accuracy and
    dependability (Chandler et al., 2004, Kelleners et al., 2005b, Seyfried and Murdock,
    2004, Topp et al., 2000). Following we discuss such environmental factors (soil
    type, soil temperature, and salinity) that introduce uncertainties in the development
    of a robust calibration of the dielectric sensors and restrict them to become
    applicable universally. Another factor influencing the accuracy of sensor measurements
    during any application is the cost of the sensor under consideration (Mittelbach
    et al., 2012). 4.1. Soil properties The physical properties of soil, such as particle
    size, organic content, and management practices, are significantly influenced
    by a combination of factors. The amount and composition of the soil solution,
    along with porosity, density, and mineralogical composition, primarily determine
    these properties and depend on the soil type. Together, these factors constitute
    crucial parameters that distinguish different types of soil. The polarization
    and conduction of electric charge in the soil water system are significantly affected
    by the soil physical properties (Heil and Schmidhalter, 2012, Wobschall, 1978).
    The soil moisture sensor which utilizes dielectric permittivity a physical property
    of soil that measures the polarization and conduction of electric charge in the
    soil water system. However, alterations in the soil, arising from variations in
    soil physical properties, impede the precision of these sensors, necessitating
    their consideration and universal applicability (Arsoy et al., 2013, Bogena et
    al., 2017, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Stangl et al., 2009).
    Soil texture classification primarily divides soil into two categories: mineral
    soil and organic soil. Clay soil within the mineral category is known for its
    high reactivity, while coarse-textured soil in the same category exhibits lower
    reactivity (Ojo et al., 2015). The electromagnetic soil moisture sensor uses relative
    dielectric permittivity (εr) for the estimation of the soil moisture in soil water
    medium. The TDR soil moisture sensor relies on apparent relative permittivity
    and employs the calibration equation developed by Topp et al. (1980). However,
    when dealing with soil high in organic matter, this calibration equation may not
    be suitable, necessitating the determination of a separate calibration equation
    as suggested by Kirkham (2014). Furthermore, Topp et al. (2000) observed that
    the equation proposed by Topp et al. (1980) becomes less reliable, especially
    for soil samples with a VWC exceeding 0.15 m3m−3, particularly when soil rich
    in salt or clay content. This inconsistency may arise from the complexities of
    conduction inherent in this method. To address this issue, they recommended incorporating
    the imaginary component of relative permittivity (εr) during the TDR calibration
    process. Similarly, Vaz et al. (2013) conducted an evaluation of multiple soil
    moisture sensors across various soil textures and reported variations in accuracy
    attributed to the type of soil. Additionally, Singh et al. (2021) conducted a
    comprehensive analysis of soil moisture sensors utilizing TLO or FDR techniques,
    with a specific focus on the ML3 Theta Probe. Their research findings underscored
    that the accuracy of these sensors exhibited variability depending on the soil
    type under investigation. In the course of their studies, they recommended the
    implementation of soil-specific calibration when dealing with soils rich in clay
    and organic matter. In a related study, Kim et al. (2020) delved into the performance
    of various electromagnetic-based soil water content probes, including the Hydra
    Probe, HS2, and FS100, in sandy loam soils. They noted Root Mean Square Deviation
    (RMSD) values around ± 0.040 m3m−3 without employing a specific calibration approach.
    However, they observed a significant improvement, with RMSD values falling to
    less than ± 0.025 m3m−3, when a soil-specific calibration was utilized. In conclusion,
    when calibrating soil moisture sensors, it is essential to consider the soil type
    under examination. For soils rich in clay and organic matter, it is advisable
    to develop a soil-specific calibration to achieve high accuracy. Conversely, when
    dealing with coarse-textured soils, a general calibration may yield acceptable
    accuracy. This approach ensures the precise measurement of soil moisture content,
    as highlighted in the studies conducted by Datta and Taghvaeian (2023) and Zawilski
    et al. (2023). Their research underscores the critical importance of tailoring
    calibration to the specific properties of the soil, particularly clay content,
    for accurate soil moisture measurements. 4.2. Soil temperature The dielectric
    soil moisture sensor utilizes frequency or electromagnetic waves to determine
    electric property of soil (i.e., dielectric permittivity) to measure VWC of the
    soil. The temperature of soil influences the physical and chemical properties,
    including its electrical properties (Andry et al., 2009, Kekane et al., 2015).
    Temperature fluctuations induce variations in electrical conductivity, consequently
    enhancing the interfacial polarization of water molecules. This leads to an increase
    in the real component of the dielectric permittivity of the soil, which can significantly
    impact the performance of dielectric soil moisture sensors, as highlighted in
    studies by (Bogena et al., (2017); Chakraborty et al., 2019, Yu et al., 2021.
    Contrastingly, Kelleners et al., (2005a) and Chen and Or (2006) have proposed
    that dielectric sensors operating at high frequencies (more than 100 MHz) exhibit
    considerable potential for accurately measuring soil moisture while minimizing
    sensitivity to changes in soil electrical conductivity and temperature. Notably,
    TDR sensors, widely acknowledged for accurate soil moisture measurements, operate
    within a high frequency range from 0.1 to 1.5 GHz. Within this frequency range,
    the impact of temperature on the calibration equation proposed by Topp et al.
    (1980) is generally minor, except under conditions of very high soil moisture
    levels (Yu et al., 1999). In contrast, TLO or FDR sensors operating at low frequencies
    (less than 100 MHz) exhibit minimal sensitivity to temperature variations. These
    sensors determine the real component of the soil relative dielectric permittivity
    by calculating it from both the soil dielectric permittivity and bulk electrical
    conductivity (σb). Notably, the Hydra Probe, an FDR sensor, records four voltages
    readings, with one specifically accounting for changes in soil temperature. These
    four voltage readings are then utilized to compute the relative dielectric permittivity
    of the soil through an empirical equation (Stevens Water Monitoring Inc, 2018).
    This implies that the Hydra Probe indirectly incorporates the influence of soil
    temperature into its measurements of the soil relative dielectric permittivity.
    Several studies have shown that capacitance sensors are highly sensitive to soil
    temperature (Evett et al., 2006, Kizito et al., 2008, Seyfried and Grant, 2007).
    Capacitance sensors operate at the lower end of the frequency, typically less
    than 50 MHz. The sensitivity of capacitance sensor measurements to temperature
    changes is primarily affected by operating at a low frequency (Chen and Or, 2006).
    The high sensitivity of capacitance sensors to temperature changes arises from
    their working principle. This is because capacitance sensors incorporate the soil
    as dielectric medium where the permanent dipoles of water molecules within the
    dielectric medium align themselves in response to an electromagnetic field and
    become polarized. For contributing to the dielectric permittivity, the electric
    dipoles, regardless of their origin, must respond to the frequency of the electromagnetic
    fields (Paltineanu and Starr, 1997). As mentioned previously, an increase in temperature
    leads to an increase in soil electrical conductivity, thereby enhancing the interfacial
    polarization of water molecules. This effect significantly influences the estimation
    of the relative dielectric permittivity of soil, especially when using capacitive
    sensors. Several studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity of capacitance
    sensors to soil temperature (Evett et al., 2008), while TDR sensors have been
    found to be less impacted by temperature (Olmanson and Ochsner, 2006, Robinson
    et al., 2008; Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014). Previous studies have proposed methods
    such as the measurement of temperature-based imaginary dielectric components and
    the application of temperature correction factors to reduce the temperature sensitivity
    (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2015, Fares et al., 2016, Saito et al., 2009).
    This highlights the importance of considering the soil moisture sensor technique
    as a potential factor of soil temperature when selecting sensor for accurate soil
    moisture measurements. Moreover, it is crucial to investigate the influence of
    temperature on sensor electronics amplification drift, especially when considering
    materials with relative dielectric permittivity. While there are a few studies
    that touch upon this aspect, such as Dean et al. (1987), who investigated the
    dimensional changes in electrode geometry induced by temperature fluctuations,
    highlighting the significance of the temperature effect on soil moisture measurements.
    They noted that it can be minimized in circuit design by incorporating component
    capacitors in parallel. Noborio et al. (1994) conducted a study on the impact
    of temperature changes on stainless-steel probes, specifically analyzing the TDR
    waveform. Their findings suggested no significant effects on the waveform due
    to temperature variations of the probes. In a study, Seyfried and Grant (2007)
    et al. examined the impact of instrument temperature on the calculated volumetric
    water content derived from the dielectric permittivity-volumetric water content
    relationship. They observed that the instrument''s effect exceeded 0.01 m3m−3
    in dry soil, diminishing at higher water content. Notably, their investigation
    spanned a temperature range of 5–45 °C. Despite these valuable contributions,
    the available literature remains scarce regarding the compensation for temperature-induced
    effects on sensor electronics amplification drift, especially concerning materials
    of relative dielectric permittivity. More extensive research is needed to elucidate
    the extent to which compensation mechanisms operate under these specific conditions.
    Future studies should aim to address this gap and contribute to a comprehensive
    understanding of the effect of temperature on sensor electronics. 4.3. Salinity
    Soil salinity refers to the concentration of salts in the soil, typically measured
    in terms of electrical conductivity (EC) or ion concentration which exhibit strong
    dependence on temperature. The presence of dissolved salts increases the EC of
    soil, which in turn increases the dielectric losses or conductive loss (i.e.,
    imaginary part of the relative dielectric permittivity) due to ionic conductivity
    and relaxation (Kargas and Soulis, 2019, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). As discussed
    in above sections, the dielectric soil moisture sensor utilizes various principles
    such as capacitance, TDR, and TLO or FDR to generate an electrical signal. It
    then measures a specific parameter (either frequency, travel time, period, impedance
    and charge time) in response to changes in the apparent permittivity or relative
    dielectric permittivity of the soil to infer the VWC using calibration equation
    (Blonquist et al., 2005, Robinson et al., 2003). Consequently, the accuracy of
    soil moisture sensors is influenced by the increasing soil salinity due to the
    effect on the electrical property of soil (Kargas et al., 2011, Kelleners et al.,
    2004b, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). In capacitance sensor, VWC depends on how
    fast an electrical circuit in the sensor oscillate. This oscillation speed is
    decided by how much the soil affects the circuit''s ability to hold electrical
    charge, and that, in turn, is influenced by the soil''s electrical properties
    (Kelleners et al., 2004b). As salinity levels rise, there is an increase in the
    concentration of ions in the soil–water mixture. These ions facilitate the flow
    of electrical currents through the soil more readily than usual. Thus salinity
    presents in soil interrupts the usual behaviour of the dielectric sensor and leads
    to either over or underestimation of actual moisture content of soil (Baumhardt
    et al., 2000). Thompson et al. (2007) studied the effect of salinity on the capacitive
    soil moisture sensor and found that the VWC increases in the well-irrigated treatment
    fields. In TDR, when a signal is transmitted through the soil, the extent to which
    the signal can pass through depends on the soil''s conductivity. If the soil conducts
    electricity too effectively, the signal can be lost, rendering it impossible for
    the sensor to make measurements. This occurs when the soil''s conductivity is
    so high that it essentially short-circuits the sensor. The presence of ions in
    the soil (related to salinity) increases soil conductivity, ultimately affecting
    the performance of TDR sensors (Susha Lekshmi et al., 2014). TDR measurements
    remain reasonably accurate without overestimation for soils with bulk electrical
    conductivity values up to 5 dS/m (Blonquist et al., 2005, Louki et al., 2019).
    However, if EC exceeds this threshold, correction becomes necessary. The calibration
    trend is non-linear within the EC range of greater than 5 dS/m (Wyseure et al.,
    1997), and it is advisable to employ non-linear calibration, incorporating EC
    into the calibration equation to rectify sensor performance. Singh et al.(2021)
    have described a method for integrating EC and dry bulk density into the non-linear
    calibration equation. In saline soils, the low-cost dielectric sensors may overestimate
    VWC due to the high relative dielectric permittivity of the soil. This issue has
    been reported in several recent studies, including a study by Inoue et al. (2008).
    This highlights the importance of calibrating the soil moisture sensors under
    conditions that accurately reflect the soil and environmental conditions in which
    they will be used. In these efforts, researchers have developed correction methods
    aimed at minimizing the impact of soil salinity on soil moisture measurements.
    One such approach is the two-step correction method developed by Kelleners et
    al. (2005). This method involves calibration of the sensors using soil samples
    with known salinity levels, followed by the development of a correction factor
    to adjust the sensor readings for the influence of soil salinity. Apart from this,
    in a study conducted by Peng et al. (2022) the impact of soil salinity on the
    Thermo-Time Domain Reflectometry (TTDR) method for measuring VWC, was investigated.
    The findings indicated that correcting for the effect of soil salinity in VWC
    measurements contributes to improved accuracy. 4.4. Cost In scientific applications,
    priority is generally given to the accuracy of soil moisture sensors over cost,
    as precision and reliability are critical for producing valid and meaningful results.
    However, in the context of large-scale studies and commercial agriculture, cost
    becomes a crucial consideration in addition to accuracy (Kukal et al., 2020).
    This is because these applications often require the use of numerous sensors,
    which can be expensive to purchase, calibrate, install, and maintain (Songara
    and Patel, 2022). Moreover, the labor and management costs involved with retrieving,
    analyzing, and interpreting data (Spelman et al., 2013). Therefore, while accuracy
    remains a top priority, it is important to balance it with the financial consideration
    of using a particular sensor in these contexts. The study by Czarnomski et al.
    (2005) evaluated three soil moisture measurement devices and found that the low-frequency
    sensor (ECH2O) was low-cost and performed well compared to the other devices.
    As a result, there is an increasing interest in using low-frequency techniques
    to reduce the error in estimating soil moisture measurements for large areas (Kelleners
    et al., 2004a, 2004b). Nonetheless, the high cost of some sensors has led researchers
    to develop low-cost soil moisture measurement sensors that maintain accuracy (Adla
    et al., 2020, Bogena et al., 2007, Chavanne and Frangi, 2022, González-Teruel
    et al., 2019, Kargas and Soulis, 2012, Mane and Kadam, 2021, Nagahage et al.,
    2019). The use of TDR and TLO techniques in hydrological research (Buytaert et
    al., 2014, Mohanty et al., 2000, Robinson et al., 2008, Singh et al., 2021) and
    remote sensing-based calibration/validation research (Cosh et al., 2016, Cosh
    et al., 2005, Jackson et al., 2010) suggests that these techniques are precise
    and reliable for soil moisture measurement. However, it is crucial to consider
    the trade-off between cost and accuracy, as some low-cost sensors may not be as
    accurate as high-cost ones. Therefore, while accuracy remains a top priority,
    it is necessary to balance the cost and feasibility of using a particular sensor
    for soil moisture measurement in different applications, such as scientific and
    commercial agriculture. Low-cost sensors, while offering affordability and accessibility,
    often face challenges during installation due to their construction using less
    expensive materials and simplified designs. Further research required on the durability
    of low-cost dielectric sensors. 5. Calibration strategies across spatial domains
    Upon examining multiple studies regarding soil moisture sensor calibration, the
    calibration process can be classified into four major categories: (i) point or
    site-specific calibration, (ii) field-specific calibration, (iii) soil-specific
    calibration, and (iv) generalized calibration. This classification aids in comprehending
    each individual calibration condition and facilitates its adoption in research
    endeavors. 5.1. Point or site-specific calibration Point calibration refers to
    the calibration of the soil moisture sensor at a single point or a specific site
    in the field having no variation in soil type, topography, vegetation, and environmental
    conditions. This calibration involves measuring the response of the sensor to
    different known moisture levels (i.e., gravimetric sampling) and then establishing
    a calibration curve that relates the sensor''s output to the moisture content
    of the soil. Point calibration is straightforward and easy to perform (Gasch et
    al., 2017). From Fig. 5, it is observed that the accuracy of the point or site-specific
    calibration is better than ± 0.04 m3m−3 i.e., ± 0.022 m3m−3. The highest accuracy
    of ± 0.004 m3m−3 was found by Matula et al. (2016), which is significantly better
    than the accuracies reported for other methods, such as soil and field-specific
    calibrations. Matula et al. (2016) also observed that the accuracy of soil moisture
    measurements is influenced by the dry bulk density factor, which refers to the
    degree of packing between the sensing rods of the soil moisture sensor and the
    soil/sand particles. The authors found that good contact between the sensing rods
    and soil/sand particles is important for achieving high accuracy and that significantly
    higher Root-Mean-Square -Error (RMSE) values were obtained for loose packing.
    Based on these observations, Matula et al. (2016) concluded that direct regression
    approaches, such as point calibration, may be necessary for achieving high accuracy
    with soil moisture sensors in sand/soil with lower dry bulk density values. This
    highlights the importance of carefully considering calibration approaches and
    measurement conditions when selecting a soil moisture sensor. Additionally, it
    is important to note that all three studies, including the studies by Sharma et
    al. (2017) and Burns et al. (2014), were conducted in a laboratory setting for
    point calibration. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the findings in a field
    setting, as the behavior of soil moisture sensors in the field may differ from
    that in the laboratory. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Comparison of accuracy of soil moisture sensor by using
    point calibration. 5.2. Soil-specific calibration Soil-specific calibration is
    a type of calibration for soil moisture sensors that involves taking measurements
    at multiple points within a specific soil type. The goal of soil-specific calibration
    is to establish a calibration curve that is tailored to the unique characteristics
    of a particular soil type (Parvin and Degré, 2016). By taking measurements at
    different locations within the same soil type, a more accurate calibration curve
    can be established that accounts for any variability in soil moisture content
    that may exist within that soil type. To perform soil-specific calibration, a
    set of measurement points is chosen within the soil type of interest. The sensor
    is then placed at each measurement point and a moisture measurement is taken.
    This process is repeated for multiple moisture levels to establish a calibration
    curve that relates the sensor''s output to the moisture content of the soil (Cosh
    et al., 2005). Fig. 6 shows the accuracy of soil moisture sensors under soil-specific
    calibration by using linear and nonlinear calibration approaches across laboratory
    and field measurement conditions. In section 5.1, it was discussed that the overall
    accuracy of point calibration for soil moisture sensors is less than ± 0.022 m3m−3.
    But the studies conducted by Kukal et al., (2019) and Dong et al., (2020) also
    reported good accuracy values for soil moisture sensors under soil-specific calibration.
    However, the accuracy varied depending on the sensor type and measurement conditions.
    For example, the TDR sensor reported by Kukal et al. (2019) achieved a high accuracy
    value of ± 0.025 m3m−3 in the field, while Ojo et al. (2015) had a lower accuracy
    value of ± 0.188 m3m−3 in the field. Ojo et al. (2015) used the Hydra Probe sensor
    with the manufacturer''s default soil-specific calibration for clay soil and found
    lower accuracy. However, by using a soil-specific calibration developed for the
    soil in the study area, the accuracy improved to ± 0.025 m3m−3, and by using field
    calibration, it became ± 0.026 m3m−3. Similar observations were reported by Zawilski
    et al. (2023), who suggested that laboratory calibration for clay soil is necessary
    to ensure accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (70KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Comparison of soil moisture sensor accuracy in soil-specific
    calibration. In contrast, Cosh et al., (2005) revealed that soil-specific calibration
    did not improve the accuracy of the sensor when compared with field-specific calibration,
    but other statistics, such as bias were greatly improved. Ojo et al. (2015) suggested
    that the effectiveness of soil-specific calibration depends on the soil textural
    class. Soil-specific calibration produced the best results for clay soil, but
    it showed little improvement over the calibration for low-reactive, coarse-textured
    soils. Similarly, Singh et al., (2021) found that soil-specific calibrations were
    limited to specific soil textural classes and failed to reduce the overall error
    in soil moisture measurements at regional scale. Therefore, the choice of calibration
    method should consider soil texture and other measurement conditions, such as
    sensor type and field vs. laboratory calibration, to achieve the best possible
    accuracy. 5.3. Field-specific calibration The goal of field-specific calibration
    is to capture the soil moisture variability that may exist within the field of
    measurement. By taking multiple measurements at different locations and wetness
    conditions within the area of interest, a more accurate calibration curve can
    be established that accounts for any variation in soil moisture content that may
    exist due to factors such as topography or vegetation. In field-specific calibration,
    the bulk density is not determined based on soil type but rather on the specific
    area of interest. This means that the bulk density is calculated as an average
    value over the entire area, regardless of the soil type (Cosh et al., 2005). Therefore,
    in field-specific calibration, the focus is on the specific area being studied,
    rather than on the soil type. Cosh et al. (2005) conducted a detailed analysis
    of the effectiveness of field-specific calibration for soil moisture sensors and
    found that, while there was a minor improvement in accuracy with field-specific
    calibration, there were significant improvements in bias and a reduction in errors
    and outliers compared to generalized calibration. However, the study also highlights
    several limitations of using field-specific calibration for impedance probes with
    low frequency of operation. Firstly, the improvement in root mean square error
    (RMSE) with field-specific calibration may not always be significant (Zawilski
    et al., 2023), as shown in Fig. 7. Secondly, the calibration may still have limitations
    at very low and very high soil moisture contents (Mittelbach et al., 2011). Thirdly,
    there may be an inherent bias in the measurement of high soil moisture contents
    (Mittelbach et al., 2012). In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015) conducted a study that
    suggests that field-specific calibration provides the highest accuracy for low-reactive,
    coarse-textured soils as compared to generalized calibration. Similar findings
    were reported by (Kim et al., 2020). However, this finding may not apply to all
    soil types or environmental conditions (Zawilski et al., 2023). Download : Download
    high-res image (64KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Comparison of
    soil moisture sensor accuracy in field-specific calibration. Overall, it is important
    to consider both the advantages and limitations of field-specific calibration
    when evaluating the validity of the data collected by soil moisture sensors. While
    there may be some improvements in accuracy, bias reduction, and error reduction
    with field-specific calibration, the effectiveness of this approach may be limited
    in certain soil types and moisture content ranges. 5.4. Generalized calibration
    General calibration involves calibrating the sensor using intensive measurements
    from multiple sites, fields, and soil types across a large region. This approach
    aims to establish a calibration curve that can be used across a broad range of
    soil, vegetation, topographic, and environmental conditions within the area of
    interest. Developing general calibration is challenging since these conditions
    can vary significantly over a large region or watershed. However, for regional
    or watershed-scale applications, generalized calibration is advantageous over
    other calibrations of being more straightforward, less time-consuming, and practicable
    (Singh et al., 2021). Fig. 8 shows the accuracies reported in different studies
    by various researchers across the world. The RMSE values range from ± 0.022 m3m−3
    to ± 0.1 m3m−3, with some sensors having better accuracy in the laboratory than
    in the field. The best-performing sensor in the field is the TDR sensor, with
    an RMSE of ± 0.027 m3m−3. The EC5 sensor was evaluated by several researchers,
    with reported RMSE values ranging from ± 0.032 m3m−3 to ± 0.1 m3m−3. The Hydra
    Probe sensor was also evaluated by several researchers, with reported RMSE values
    ranging from ± 0.026 m3m−3 to ± 0.059 m3m−3. The Theta Probe was evaluated by
    several researchers, with reported RMSE values ranging from ± 0.022 m3m−3 to ±
    0.065 m3m−3. The lower accuracies observed in soil were higher variations in the
    soil texture observed and Ojo et al. (2015) reported that the general equation
    performs better in low-reactive, coarse-textured soils. Download : Download high-res
    image (63KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Comparison of soil moisture
    sensor accuracy in general calibration. Based on the information provided in Table
    2 and the cited studies, it appears that general calibrations for soil moisture
    sensors can be a viable alternative to field-specific or soil-specific calibrations.
    For example, the study conducted by Vaz et al (2013), utilized the factory-supplied
    calibration equation in nine different soils, and average accuracy of the CS616
    observed is 0.128 m3m-3 which also support the previous research (Mittelbach et
    al., 2012; S.R. Evett et al., 2011). This accuracy is improved to ± 0.041 m-3m-3
    with an enhanced calibration, highlighting the need for improving factory-supplied
    calibrations (Udawatta et al., 2011). However, the accuracy of general calibrations
    depends on the calibration approach used. The linear and nonlinear calibration
    approaches have different effects on the accuracy of the sensors as shown in Fig.
    8. Table 2. Accuracies of various soil moisture sensors by using linear and nonlinear
    calibration approaches for point, field, soil-specific, and generalized calibrations.

    for soil moisture sensors and have found that nonlinear general calibrations can
    result in higher accuracy. For example, Vaz et al. (2013) evaluated both linear
    and nonlinear general calibrations for the 10HS and Theta Probe sensors in laboratory
    settings. They reported higher accuracy with the nonlinear general calibration
    for the 10HS sensor, with an RMSE of ± 0.073 m3m−3 for the linear general calibration
    and ± 0.029 m3m−3 for the nonlinear general calibration. Similarly, for the Theta
    Probe sensor, they reported an RMSE of ± 0.04 m3m−3 for the linear general calibration
    and ± 0.029 m3m−3 for the nonlinear general calibration. Kargas and Kerkides,
    (2008) also evaluated both linear and nonlinear calibrations for the Theta Probe
    sensor in the field, reporting an RMSE of ± 0.065 m3m−3 for the linear calibration
    and ± 0.054 m3m−3 for the nonlinear calibration. These findings suggest that the
    calibration approach used for soil moisture sensors can play an important role
    in achieving high accuracy with general calibrations. Therefore, it is important
    to carefully consider the calibration approach when using general calibrations
    for soil moisture sensors and to evaluate the accuracy of the sensors under different
    calibration approaches to ensure that the best approach is used. In summary, point
    calibration is the simplest and most straightforward method, while soil field-specific
    calibration and general calibration are more complex but lead to more accurate
    measurements in specific conditions or over a broader range of soil conditions.
    The choice of calibration method will depend on the application and the level
    of accuracy required. 6. Calibration methods for dielectric soil moisture sensors
    Dielectric soil moisture sensors encompass various principles such as capacitance,
    TDR, and TLO or FDR as mentioned in section 3.1. As observed in Table 1, current
    trends in soil moisture sensing predominantly rely on the relative soil dielectric
    permittivity for estimating VWC. The calibration process entails establishing
    a relationship between the measured relative dielectric permittivity and known
    volumetric water content through soil samples. Therefore, the primary focus is
    centred on dielectric-based calibration. Generally, soil moisture sensor calibration
    methods can be classified as laboratory calibration and field calibrations (Burns
    et al., 2014, Ojo et al., 2015). Field calibration requires obtaining gravimetric
    samples from the field being studied and then comparing them with the corresponding
    dielectric sensor readings obtained from the same location (Cosh et al., 2005,
    Dhakal et al., 2019, Stangl et al., 2009, Singh et al., 2021), while laboratory-based
    calibration involves adjusting the sensor readings with gravimetric sampling in
    a controlled environment (Adla et al., 2020). However, the choice of calibration
    method depends on various factors, such as the type of sensor, soil type, accuracy
    requirement, cost and time involvement, and the intended use of the measurements
    (Burns et al., 2014). In fact, each of these methods has its limitations and advantages.
    During field calibration, practically it is challenging to collect the gravimetric
    samples with very wet conditions and also for very dry conditions, specifically
    when the VWC falls within the range of 0 to 8 %. In these arid conditions, obtaining
    accurate gravimetric samples and corresponding sensor readings can be exceptionally
    difficult due to the limited availability of moisture. In very wet conditions,
    it is difficult to get sensor reading for dry soil condition. In such challenging
    circumstances, we found that laboratory calibration becomes a viable and pragmatic
    solution. By conducting laboratory calibration for the dry range, we can ensure
    the accuracy and reliability of the sensor calibration process (Stangl et al.,
    2009). 6.1. Laboratory calibration method There are two methods used for laboratory
    calibration of soil moisture sensors, wet-up and dry-down, which have been described
    by various authors in the literature. In the wet-up method, as described by Young
    et al. (1997), the soil sample is first weighed and then water is added at a known
    rate until the soil reaches saturation. The outputs from an inserted sensor in
    the soil column are recorded at regular intervals as the soil wets. In contrast,
    the dry-down method, as described by Bosch (2004), involves starting with a saturated
    soil sample and allowing it to dry out naturally while the sensor output is continuously
    recorded. To carry out laboratory calibration of soil moisture sensors, Burns
    et al. (2014) and Holzman et al. (2017) suggested a standard procedure as shown
    in Fig. 9. This procedure involves packing an oven-dried soil sample of known
    volume into a glass beaker, ensuring that the density of the soil sample is as
    similar as possible to the soil density in the field. The sensor probe is then
    inserted vertically into the soil column without touching the bottom or side wall
    of the beaker. The sensor is connected to a data logger and the output is recorded
    at 15-minute intervals. In addition, the weight of the soil sample is continuously
    observed and recorded by using weighing balance with data logger. It is advisable
    to use a data logger instead of relying solely on a traditional weighing balance
    to ensure accurate weighing of soil samples. This recommendation is based on the
    potential interference caused by the presence of a fan, which can occasionally
    disrupt the normal functioning of the weighing balance and result in inaccurate
    measurements. Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Configuration of the laboratory calibration experiment. The true
    VWC is calculated as Ojo et al.(2015): (7) where, is soil bulk density (ratio
    of the mass of dry soil to total volume of moist soil), WTi is the total weight
    (wet soil + probe), Wp is sensor probe weight, and WD is the dry weight of soil
    sample. For wet-up calibration, the distilled water is added to the oven-dried
    soil sample at a controlled rate. The controlled rate is determined to be suitable
    when the water is able to infiltrate without ponding into the soil sample (Champagne
    et al., 2010, Quinones et al., 2003). This process is continued until the soil
    is saturated or the output becomes almost constant. For dry-down calibration (Ojo
    et al., 2015), the saturated soil column was allowed to dry with a soil moisture
    sensor. At the same time, measure the change in weight of the soil column over
    time (Bosch, 2004, Huang et al., 2004). A small fan or dehumidifier must use to
    promote the evaporation. The procedure is considered complete when the evaporation
    becomes negligible or the change in weight of the soil column becomes negligible
    (Burns et al., 2014). It is important to note that for soil moisture sensor calibration,
    it is recommended to calibrate across a full range of soil water content conditions,
    from oven dry to saturation (Cosh et al., 2005). This is because incorporating
    a larger range of soil moisture conditions into sensor development can improve
    the transferability of the general calibration equation to different soils and
    environments (Rowlandson et al., 2018). The calibration equation is typically
    developed for these data using true volumetric water content (as truth) regressed
    with dielectric permittivity or voltage measurements from soil moisture sensor
    (Adla et al., 2020, Cobos and Chambers, 2010, Cosh et al., 2005). Research by
    Burns et al. (2014) suggests that the dry-down method is statistically more accurate
    than the wet-up method (Halley, 2016), particularly for soils with higher clay
    content. This is due to the fact that the dry-down method accounts for the natural
    variations in soil moisture content, providing more precise measurements (Rüdiger
    et al., 2010). However, it is important to note that the wet-up method can still
    be effective in certain soil types and should not be disregarded (Loiskandl et
    al., 2010, Seyfried et al., 2005). The laboratory-based soil moisture sensor calibration
    process is generally considered to be a more controlled and accurate method for
    calibrating soil moisture sensors, especially for sensors that are buried in the
    soil (Bell et al., 2013, Cosh et al., 2016) or used in a single location for a
    longer time. By following standardized procedures, researchers can obtain reliable
    calibration data, which can then be used to convert sensor output into soil moisture
    content. It is worth noting that although laboratory-based calibration is important,
    it is not always practical or feasible in the field (Colliander et al., 2017).
    In-situ calibration methods, such as comparing sensor data to manual soil moisture
    measurements, is useful alternatives when field-based measurements are required.
    6.2. Field calibration method Field calibration of a dielectric soil moisture
    sensor is a crucial step in ensuring accurate and reliable measurements in real-world
    applications. To perform a field calibration, it is important to select a field
    that represents the variability in soil water content and soil structure that
    the sensor will encounter in actual use (Caldwell et al., 2018). To calibrate
    the sensor, it is necessary to compare its output, which includes raw output data
    (voltage, and dielectric permittivity), with the gravimetric volumetric water
    content. Fig. 10 emphasizes the technique used for soil sampling for in situ or
    field calibration. The technique of collecting three soil samples from each field
    and averaging the results has been suggested as a potential solution to address
    the issue of sensor-to-sensor variability during field calibration of soil moisture
    sensors. The importance of this approach has been highlighted by several previous
    studies, including Cobos and Chambers, 2010, Cosh et al., 2016, Rowlandson et
    al., 2013 and Seyfried et al. (2005). Download : Download high-res image (619KB)

    method, where the sampling design at each sampling location is shown as a schematic
    diagram. Three-point measurements at a typical sampling location forming a triangle
    are for capturing spatial variability. A view of the gravimetric sample collection
    corresponding to Theta Probe measurement in the rice field is presented through
    photographs. This is a modified figure of Singh et al. (2021). The determination
    of gravimetric soil moisture content is achieved through the use of the oven dry
    method, (Gardner, 2018). The known volume of soil core sampler is required to
    collect the samples from the field. Then by using the dry bulk density (dry mass
    of soil / volume of soil sample) the gravimetric moisture content is converted
    to the soil VWC. Once the VWC is known, the sensor''s output is compared to this
    value. The relationship between the relative dielectric permittivity (εr) and
    VWC is established by using either linear or nonlinear equations. These equations
    can be used to develop a calibration curve that relates the dielectric permittivity
    of a soil to its corresponding VWC. Field calibration methods include in situ
    techniques such as neutron probes and gravimetric sampling. These methods measure
    the soil moisture content and provide a reference for calibrating the sensor (Leib
    et al., 2003). It allows for more accurate measurement of soil moisture, as it
    takes into account the real-world conditions that the sensor will encounter in
    the field (Chandler et al., 2004, Ojo et al., 2015, Singh et al., 2018, Stangl
    et al., 2009) including variations in soil type, temperature, salinity, soil structure
    (Caldwell et al., 2018, Geesing et al., 2004) and even unfrozen or frozen soil
    condition (Amankwah et al., 2022). However, field calibration can be challenging,
    time-consuming, and expensive, especially in remote or difficult-to-access areas
    (Caldwell et al., 2018, Cosh et al., 2005, Stangl et al., 2009). This can limit
    the use of dielectric-based sensors in some applications, particularly in areas
    where access is restricted. Furthermore, the calibration process can be influenced
    by various factors, such as changes in the soil structure over time or the presence
    of other materials in the soil, which can affect the accuracy of the readings.
    Though dielectric sensors have numerous advantages over other methods for measuring
    soil moisture, their practical application can be limited by the challenges associated
    with field calibration. Nonetheless, ongoing research is focused on improving
    the accuracy and reliability of these sensors, which may lead to increased use
    in various applications. In summary, while the field calibration of dielectric-based
    sensors can be challenging, it remains an essential aspect of ensuring the accuracy
    of soil moisture measurements in real-world conditions. 7. Linear and nonlinear
    approach for calibration of soil moisture sensor In the context of a dielectric
    soil moisture sensor, calibration refers to the process of establishing a statistical
    model/relationship between the measured dielectric permittivity of the soil and
    its corresponding moisture content. This relationship allows for a nearly accurate
    measurement of soil moisture content based on the dielectric properties of the
    soil. The approach of calibration used depends on the nature of the relationship
    between the dielectric permittivity and the moisture content, which can be linear
    or nonlinear. A linear calibration assumes a directly proportional relationship
    between the measured refractive index (which is square root of dielectric permittivity)
    and the soil moisture content, while a nonlinear calibration takes into account
    any deviations from linearity in this relationship. We examined previous research,
    including studies by Rowlandson et al., 2013, Vaz et al., 2013, Ojo et al., 2015,
    and Singh et al. (2021), which employed these two calibration approaches. The
    analysis revealed interesting insights and depicted in Table 2 and Fig. 11. For
    the generalized calibration of the Hydra probe sensor, Rowlandson et al. found
    similar root mean square error (RMSE) values for both linear and nonlinear calibration
    approaches indicating no significant improvement with either method. However,
    Vaz et al. (2013) reported similar observations in a generalized calibration setting.
    In contrast, Ojo et al. (2015) and Singh et al. (2021) reported improvements in
    RMSE when transitioning from linear to nonlinear calibration. Notably, all these
    studies consistently demonstrated improved RMSE values when employing nonlinear
    calibration for soil-specific calibration. Download : Download high-res image

    sensor accuracy using linear and nonlinear calibration approaches. These observations
    collectively suggest that the choice between linear and nonlinear calibration
    methods depends on the specific context and goals of the soil moisture sensor
    calibration. These insights have motivated to incorporate these approaches into
    a review, with the aim of providing valuable guidance to researchers and citizen
    scientists alike, enabling them to grasp the nuanced implications of these calibration
    methods in the context of point, soil-specific, and field-specific calibrations.
    7.1. Linear approach A widely used method for calibrating a dielectric soil moisture
    sensor that uses dielectric measurement involves establishing a linear relation
    between the sensor''s output and the gravimetric method based soil VSM. (Kelleners
    and Verma, 2010, Kim et al., 2020, Logsdon et al., 2010, Seyfried et al., 2005,
    Singh et al., 2021). The general form of this linear relationship is: (8) where
    εr (relative dielectric permittivity) and V (raw voltage) are the sensor outputs,
    and A and B are the calibration coefficients calculated empirically. According
    to Fig. 11, the linear approach results highest accuracy for the point scale calibration,
    with a median accuracy of ± 0.012 m3m−3. This suggests that linear calibration
    is highly effective for calibrating sensors at a specific point location (i.e.,
    fixed type soil moisture measurement for continuous measurements). The field-specific
    calibration has a median accuracy of ± 0.025 m3m−3, which lower than the point
    specific calibration, but still below the required accuracy of ± 0.04 m3m−3 for
    the satellite soil moisture product validations. The soil-specific calibration
    has a median accuracy of ± 0.031 m3m−3, indicating that calibration accuracy decreases
    when attempting to calibrate sensors across different soil types. The generalized
    calibration, typically developed for large-scale field studies, has demonstrated
    the lowest accuracy with a median accuracy of ± 0.048 m3m−3. The potential reason
    for this lowest accuracy of generalized calibration is the inclusion of diverse
    soil textural classes and field conditions across a large region, introducing
    potential nonlinear relationships that cannot be adequately captured through linear
    regression. This implies that linear calibration may not be the most effective
    method for calibrating sensor, particularly in the context of large-scale field
    studies. 7.2. Nonlinear approach Nonlinear equations are used to calibrate a dielectric
    soil moisture sensor, particularly when the relationship between the sensor''s
    output and soil moisture content is nonlinear (Bosch, 2004). Some examples of
    nonlinear equations that can be used for calibration include power equations,
    exponential equations, and second-order quadratic equations. The second-order
    quadratic equation is widely used as well as for the soil-specific calibration
    for both TDR and capacitance techniques. Studies conducted by Seyfried et al.,
    2005, Topp et al., 1980, Vaz et al., 2013 are using the second-order quadratic
    equation to calibrate the dielectric-based soil moisture sensors in the following
    format: (9) where, A, B, C, and D are calibration constants and εr is the relative
    dielectric permittivity. Fig. 11 shows the median accuracy for nonlinear calibration
    using different types of calibration approaches, i.e., point-specific, field-specific,
    soil-specific, and generalized. Similar to the linear approach, the nonlinear
    calibration approach for the dielectric soil moisture sensor also yielded the
    highest accuracy for point-scale calibrations and the lowest accuracy for generalized
    calibrations. However, as shown in Fig. 11, it is evident that the nonlinear approach
    consistently outperforms the linear approach in calibrating dielectric sensors
    across all calibration types, from point to generalized. The median accuracy for
    point-specific nonlinear calibration is ± 0.004 m3m−3, which indicates that this
    approach provides the highest accuracy for point-specific calibration. For field-specific
    calibration, the median accuracy for nonlinear calibration is ± 0.0085 m3m−3.
    The median accuracy for soil-specific nonlinear calibration is ± 0.028 m3m−3,
    which is higher than that for field-specific nonlinear calibration. The general
    nonlinear calibration approach has a median accuracy of ± 0.045 m3m−3, which is
    the lowest accuracy among the linear calibration approaches. From the data depicted
    in Table 2, we can observe that for developing the generalized calibrations, the
    nonlinear calibration approach has higher median accuracies compared to the linear
    calibration approach. However, it is also important to note that the difference
    in accuracy between the two approaches varies depending on the calibration type.
    For example, in the case of point-specific calibration, the nonlinear approach
    has a much better median accuracy compared to the linear approach, while in field-specific
    calibration, the difference is relatively smaller. It may not be practical or
    suitable to use specific (point or field or soil) calibration for large-scale
    study areas such as watersheds or agricultural areas. Over a large region, the
    soil type, salinity, and temperature might be different, and these factors are
    responsible for the determination of soil dielectric properties (Chen and Or,
    2006, Jacobsen and Schjønning, 1993, Mohamed and Paleologos, 2018). This implies
    that different soil types may have unique and complex interactions among their
    various components, resulting in different electric properties (Persson et al.,
    2001, Singh et al., 2021). This complexity is further compounded by the fact that
    previous studies have shown that the relationship between soil moisture content
    and the dielectric permittivity of soil can be affected by soil bulk density and
    porosity (Malicki et al., 1996). The complex dielectric response of soil makes
    it difficult to accurately describe the relationship between the dielectric permittivity
    and soil moisture content using linear regression methods alone (Persson et al.,
    2001, Persson and Bertacchi Uvo, 2003). To overcome this challenge, nonlinear
    models are often used to calibrate this relationship. However, these traditional
    nonlinear methods may struggle to capture the complex relationships between variables,
    which has led to the adoption of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANNs are machine
    learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of biological neural
    networks in the brain. ANNs are capable of learning complex relationships between
    input and output data and can be used to model nonlinear relationships and interactions
    between multiple input variables (Puri et al., 2016, Shanmuganathan, 2016). ANNs
    can account for interactions between multiple variables, including soil type,
    temperature, and organic matter content, which may affect the dielectric properties
    of soil. Therefore, ANNs are increasingly being used to model the relationship
    between soil properties and dielectric measurements. It has several advantages
    over traditional linear regression methods. One of the main benefits of ANNs is
    their ability to account for the effects of multiple soil properties on dielectric
    measurements, such as soil texture, temperature, and salinity, which can result
    in more accurate estimates of soil water content under a wider range of soil conditions
    (Namdar-Khojasteh et al., 2010, Singh et al., 2021). The calibration of the TDR
    soil moisture sensor by Zanetti et al. (2015) using ANNs achieved high accuracy,
    as evidenced by the low root mean square error (RMSE) values and high R2 values.
    Singh et al. (2021) compared a Bayesian neural network (BNN) to linear regression-based
    calibrations for estimating soil water content. The BNN-based approach outperformed
    the linear regression-based calibration, with a RMSE of less than ± 0.04 m3m−3.
    Singh et al. (2021) also suggested that the inclusion of soil physical properties
    as input into the BNN model further improved the calibration performance, yielding
    even lower RMSE value. Overall, ANNs have shown promise in accurately modeling
    the complex relationship between soil properties and dielectric measurements,
    providing a powerful tool for soil water content estimation (Arsoy et al., 2013,
    JingFeng et al., 2010, Persson et al., 2002). However, it is important to note
    that the accuracy of ANN models depends heavily on the quality and quantity of
    input data, as well as appropriate training and validation techniques (Köksal
    et al., 2011). However, one limitation of ANNs is that they require a large amount
    of data for training and validation (Shahid et al., 2019), and the results can
    be difficult to interpret in terms of the physical processes governing the relationship
    between the dielectric permittivity and soil water content (Singh et al., 2021).
    Overall, the use of ANNs for calibration is a rapidly evolving field, and the
    development of more advanced models, integration of additional data sources, and
    the application of more efficient training algorithms can further improve the
    accuracy of soil water content estimation. 8. Conclusions Soil moisture measurement
    plays a vital role in both agriculture and hydrology research, and the utilization
    of soil moisture sensors provides an efficient method of real-time measurements
    across the large study areas. Nonetheless, the calibration of these sensors is
    of paramount importance to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the obtained
    measurements. Researchers must aim to calibrate the sensors comprehensively, encompassing
    the entire spectrum of soil moisture conditions while accounting for variations
    in soil texture and different levels of soil wetness. This review aims to guide
    researchers in the selection of the most appropriate strategy for achieving precise
    soil moisture measurements. Prior to initiating the calibration process for the
    soil moisture sensor, it is essential to understand its working principles. Subsequently,
    assess factors influencing its accuracy, such as soil type, temperature, and salinity,
    in accordance with the sensor''s specifications. Additionally, consider cost implications
    during the calibration process. To align with the study''s specific requirements,
    carefully select the appropriate calibration strategies across various spatial
    domains, ranging from point-scale to regional-scale. Tailor the calibration methods
    and approaches to accommodate the prevailing environmental and soil, ensuring
    alignment with the necessary accuracy standards. In laboratory calibration, two
    primary methods are employed: wet-up and dry-down, with dry-down being more accurate
    for soils with higher clay content. While field calibration stands out as the
    optimal method, it demands a considerable investment of time and a collection
    of representative soil samples over a large area. Various calibration options
    are available, including soil-specific, field-specific, and generalized calibrations,
    among which point-specific calibration being the most accurate. Opting the field-specific
    calibration brings notable advantages, such as enhanced accuracy, reduced bias,
    and minimized overall errors. It is essential to acknowledge that developing a
    generalized calibration can be a time-saving and resource-efficient approach,
    especially when conducting extensive field measurements over a large region. Nevertheless,
    it is important to note that the accuracy of generalized calibrations for dielectric
    sensors is observed to be lower compared to point-specific and field-specific
    calibrations. Nonlinear calibration approach for dielectric sensor may yield higher
    accuracy compared to linear approaches, underscoring the importance of assessing
    sensor accuracy under different calibration approaches for optimal application.
    While a generalized calibration method proves practical and time-efficient for
    large-scale study areas, its accuracy may fall short in regions with diverse soil
    types, salinity variations, and temperature changes. Nonlinear calibrations, particularly
    those developed using ANNs, show promise in addressing the influences of multiple
    soil properties on dielectric measurements, as recently shown by Singh et al.
    (2021). This results in more accurate estimates of soil water content across a
    wider range of soil conditions. However, additional studies are needed to comprehensively
    evaluate the effectiveness of this approach across diverse soil types. In conclusion,
    the field of soil moisture sensing continues to evolve, and researchers should
    strike a balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness, considering variations
    in soil type, temperature, and salinity. The accurate calibration of soil moisture
    sensors across a full range of soil moisture conditions is crucial for reliable
    results. The selection of the most appropriate calibration method should be made
    based on the specific application, incorporating a thorough assessment of calibration
    accuracy to confirm the optimal approach. In this endeavor, the thoughtful application
    of the strategy outlined in Fig. 12 would be invaluable. Download : Download high-res

    multiple soil properties and exploring innovative approaches such as machine learning
    algorithms. Additionally, sustained efforts should be directed to evaluating the
    long-term stability and performance of these sensors, as well as establishing
    maintenance protocols to address any drift or changes in sensor accuracy. By continuously
    improving calibration methods and gaining deeper understanding of sensor performance,
    researchers can optimize the utility of soil moisture sensors and enhance their
    applicability across various fields. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: The paper “IOT WEATHER DATA ACQUISITION AND AUTOMATION SYSTEM” deals
    with presenting a smart device in terms of real-time accumulation of data and
    automation. The core intention is to make life easier and hassle-free. From agriculture
    drones to the defense, real-time data is feeding in every sector of industry to
    make everything automated, more susceptible, and sustainable. Data can be further
    studied to bring out meaningful insights from them. Right on the track, the prototype
    is capable of visualization of data through the internet on many platforms in
    the form of GUI (Graphical User Interface). This prototype uses some sensors like
    DHT11, MQ135, BMP280, Soil moisture, and Flame sensor. 38% Humidity, 32.3 Temperature
    reading provide by the DHT11 during the test. BMP280 sensor shows their readings
    in graphical format. 9% moisture present in the soil, noted during the test through
    the soil moisture sensor. 8% of Hard Particles are present in the atmosphere and
    the Lux value was 89.167 noted during the test with the help of MQ135 and Light
    Intensity sensor. A flame sensor also used in the prototype gives the warning.
    When it senses the flame, and it increases the safety. All data are represented
    through interactive graphs and plots that are easy to interpret. In addition,
    this data is stored in the cloud platform. Which are further fetched into platforms
    like MATLAB, Simulink, and excel sheets for further analysis. Simply connecting
    to the internet, can get their data from anywhere in the world through the API
    ports and are supported in many channels like Thing Speak and Arduino IoT cloud.

    Frost events have resulted in huge economic losses in agriculture. Apple flower
    buds are susceptible to being damaged by cold weather in early spring, leading
    to reduced apple production. Applying heat is one of the most effective methods
    to prevent apple flower bud damage. However, growers generally determine when
    and how to apply heat in orchards based on their experiences and available labor
    force, leading to either insufficient heating or energy waste. In this study,
    a frost protection cyber-physical system (CPCPS) was developed to make heating
    decisions based on real-time ambient temperature and wind direction data. The
    CPCPS consisted of a real-time temperature sensing system, an angle auto-adjusted
    heater, and an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to move the heating system. The results
    show that the CPCPS improved protection performance during the field tests. Compared
    to the non-CPCPS, the CPCPS increased the percentages of canopy protected time
    by 198.8 % and 111.9 % in two low-temperature field tests. The outcome of the
    study can be beneficial for enhancing protection performance of canopies in apple
    orchards. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Frost protectionCyber-physical

    ground vehicle (UGV) 1. Introduction Extreme cold events i.e., frost events, have
    caused devastating impacts on agriculture, threatening crop yield and quality
    (Field et al., 2012) resulting in major economic losses. For example, cold damage
    resulted in more than $ 2B of agricultural crop losses in the U.S. in 2007 and
    $ 3B losses in Europe in 2017 (Smith, 2018, Vitasse and Rebetez, 2018). Climate
    change may be responsible for exacerbating early flower development for many crops,
    such as wheat, apple, pear, and peach, making the blossoms more susceptible to
    damage (Eccel et al., 2009, Inouye, 2000, Barlow et al., 2015, Cittadini et al.,
    2006, Guo et al., 2019, Sugiura et al., 2007, Tsipouridis and Thomidis, 2005).
    Applying additional heat is one of the most effective methods to reduce economic
    losses for fruit growers. Much effort has been made to improve the heating performance.
    For example, Brooks et al. (1950) applied a combined use of wind machines and
    heaters in a citrus orchard and proved that the combination increased protection
    20–30 %. Alshami and Evans (2009) developed a pulse jet orchard heater system
    to effectively reduce buoyant heat losses in a grape vineyard. Hua et al. (2022a)
    developed a mobile heating model and found that additional 7 % of the volume of
    the canopy was protected for one movement. A heater pulled by an orchard tractor
    with a speed of 8 km/h was used in a pistachio orchard by Hokm et al. (2013),
    suggesting that approximately an area of 2.5 ha was protected by the tractor-based
    heater. Even though much effort has been made to reduce frost damage, two critical
    challenges deter growers from taking active protection actions and simply relying
    on crop insurance. One challenge is that growers determine when and how to apply
    heat in orchards based on their experiences and available labor force, leading
    to either insufficient heating or energy waste. The other challenge is that ambient
    wind is often treated as an uncontrollable factor when growers are implementing
    heating tasks in orchards, while it greatly affects heating performance. To overcome
    these challenges, the key is to monitor the environment and take actions according
    to the monitored data, e.g., use temperature sensors and wind sensors to perceive
    environmental changes and then make corresponding heating decisions. A Cyber-Physical
    System (CPS) is defined as a transformative technology for managing interconnected
    systems between their physical assets and computational capabilities (Baheti and
    Gill, 2011). It can be used to monitor real-time variations in complex environments
    when controlling mechanical mechanisms, and thus applicable CPSs can improve the
    efficiency and performance of mechanical systems. CPSs have attracted attention
    in irrigation management, pest management, crop yield management, and greenhouse
    stress management in agricultural research (Dusadeerungsikul et al., 2019, Stark
    et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2021, Guo et al., 2018). CPSs
    have also been applied for crop frost protection. For example, a wireless sensor
    network was developed to monitor air temperature during frost/freeze protection
    events (Pierce and Elliott, 2008). Stombaugh et al. (1992) developed an automated
    pulsed irrigation system based on temperature sensors for frost protection of
    strawberries, which reduced half the typical amount of water used without compromising
    the level of crop protection. Jaradat and Mohd (2008) developed an intelligent
    smoke generator system based on a set of distributed wireless sensors in an open
    field environment, which maintained the soil surface temperature above 0 °C overnight.
    However, the advantage of CPS for smart frost protection has not been investigated,
    and the challenges in heating decisions based on personal experiences and unpredicted
    wind conditions have not been solved. This study focused on developing an intelligent
    canopy protection cyber-physical system (CPCPS). The primary goal of the CPCPS
    was to implement heating decisions based on real-time temperature and wind direction
    data. The objectives included (1) the development of a real-time temperature and
    wind direction sensing system, (2) the development of an angle auto-adjusted and
    mobile heating system, and (3) an experimental verification of the CPCPS in an
    apple orchard. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Design of CPCPS Fig. 1 shows the
    general structure of the CPCPS to address the temperature and wind direction data
    from the physical environment by using two data microprocessors, respectively.
    After the data were processed, two separate actions were sent to a LED lamp and
    a linear actuator. Subsequently, a UGV was controlled by a remote controller based
    on the LED flashing signal to move to an assigned place. A rotatable heater was
    automatically controlled to rotate to an assigned angle by the linear actuator.
    In the non-CPCPS, tested as a control group, only a fixed heater was used and
    the rest of the structure in the CPCPS was deactivated. Download : Download high-res

    heating system, the gas heater was assisted by a turntable and a linear actuator
    to rotate on the horizontal plane, which is further described in section 2.2.
    In the temperature sensing system, real-time temperatures were measured by digital
    thermometers, and the LED signal was emitted when temperature criteria were met,
    which is further described in section 2.3. The UGV system was used to transport
    the heating system to an unheated block according to the LED signal, which is

    Angle auto-adjusted heating system The angle auto-adjusted heating system consisted
    of a wind direction sensor (RUCHDYHSDWZIY5U2, Cheresouse, IN, USA), an Arduino
    MEGA 2560 (Arduino, New York, USA), an L298N dual H-bridge motor driver (Makefabs,
    Shenzhen City, China), a linear actuator (L11TGF1000NB300-T-1, ECO LLC, Washington,
    DC, USA), a gas heater (Dyna-Glo RMC-FA150DGD, GHP Group Inc, Niles, IL, USA),
    a 15-pound propane tank (Blue Rhino Corporation, Winston-Salem, NC, USA), a 12VDC
    power source (Lead Acid Automotive Battery, EverStart Maxx, Cork, Ireland), a
    750 W power inverter (EverStart, Cork, Ireland), and an Arduino NANO (Arduino,
    New York, USA), as shown in Fig. 2. The wind direction sensor measured real-time
    wind direction data from 16 directions of with ± 3° accuracy each second. The
    wind direction sensor was modified by replacing an original TP8485E-SR IC Chips,
    i.e., an RS485 interface module inside the wind sensor with the Arduino NANO to
    output a digital signal of an average ambient wind direction every 30 s. The heater
    rated at 159,000 KJ·h−1 input was applied heat by burning propane during field
    tests. The 12VDC power source was used to provide power for the system. The gas
    heater fan was powered by a 110VAC power, which was converted from the 12VDC battery
    by the 750 W power inverter. Fig. 3 shows the basic structure of the rotatable
    gas heater. A 25 cm (D) turntable was used for rotation. The linear actuator was
    controlled based on wind direction, resulting in the heater rotation in the horizontal
    plane. T-slot framings were utilized to connect the heater and the UGV. Download

    for the angle auto-adjusted heating system. The Arduino NANO was connected to
    a reed tube relay inside the wind sensor which provided a digital signal output
    of the average wind direction to the Arduino MEGA 2560 by serial port communication.
    The Arduino MEGA 2560 then controlled the linear actuator to extend and retract
    by the L298N dual H-bridge motor driver. The programming code was developed in
    the Arduino IDE 2.0.3 (Arduino, Milan, Italy). Download : Download high-res image
    (411KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Control system for angle auto-adjusted
    heating system. A principle of the angle adjustment was to keep the heater facing
    upwind i.e., applying heat against the background wind direction. The principle
    was utilized to reduce heating loss from the orchard based on a numerical model
    developed by Hua et al. (2022b). Previous research simulated and found that an
    angle of 15° between the heater outlet surface and the tree row provided maximum
    energy utilization (Hua et al., 2023). The canopies were approximately arranged
    in 30° W of N in the experimental orchard, which was further described in section
    2.5. The rotation strategies are as follows: (1) If the ambient wind direction
    was 60° or 240° (Fig. 5 (a)), designating north as 0°, the heaters were assigned
    to face the tree row. Download : Download high-res image (299KB) Download : Download

    or 240° < wind direction < 360°, where north = 0°, east = 90°, south = 180°, and
    west = 270°. (2) If the ambient wind direction was between 60° and 240°, the heaters
    on the left- and right-hand sides were assigned to rotate 15° clockwise and counterclockwise,
    respectively (Fig. 5 (b)). (3) Otherwise, the heaters on the left- and right-hand
    sides were assigned to rotate 15° counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively
    (Fig. 5 (c)). 2.3. Real-time temperature sensing system Given that the heating
    system had the capacity to warm up a maximum area of 6 m, a real-time temperature
    system was developed and separately settled in two blocks with 6 digital thermometers
    (DS18B20 1-Wire Digital, Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA, USA) in each block. In
    addition to thermometers, the real-time temperature system consisted of an Arduino
    UNO R3 (Interaction Design Institute, Ivrea, Italy), an Adafruit data logging
    shield (Adafruit, New York, USA), two 5 mm LED lamps (450pcs, DiCUNO, Madison,
    WI, USA), and six 1.5 V AA batteries (Duracell, CT, USA), as shown in Fig. 2.
    The thermometers were connected with the Arduino UNO R3 to measure the air temperatures
    in canopies during field tests. The digital thermometers had ± 0.5 °C accuracy
    from −10 °C to + 85 °C. The Adafruit data logging shield was used for data logging
    on an SD card. The 5 mm LED lamps were used in the temperature sensing system
    and powered by six 1.5 V AA batteries. Fig. 6 shows the two groups of digital
    thermometers (A1-F1 and A2-F2) connecting to the Adafruit data logging shield
    by an ElectroCookie breadboard with six 4,700 Ohm resistors as voltage dividers.
    The pins on the Adafruit data logging shield were directly connected to the pins
    on the Arduino UNO R3. The LED lamps were also connected to the Adafruit data
    logging shield by a solderless breadboard and two 330 Ohm resistors. The digital
    thermometer measured one temperature data point every 13 s. The temperature sensing
    system was programmed to update output temperature data when the digital thermometer
    obtained a data point. The output temperature data were the average temperatures
    of the six thermometers in each group (A1-F1 and A2-F2): (1) where is the average
    temperature of the six digital thermometers A-F (℃). Download : Download high-res

    sensing system. Thermometers (A1-F2) and two LED lamps are connected to the Adafruit
    data logging shield by breadboards. The Arduino UNO R3 is covered by the Adafruit
    data logging shield, and thus not shown in the figure. An average temperature
    under a relatively stable state was used as a criterion to determine the timing
    of UGV moving from one block to another during the tests. Typically, after heat
    flows in canopies reached a relatively stable state, the average temperature of
    the heated canopy remained unchanged with continuous heating. Once the criterion
    was met during a test, the UGV was ready to move to an unheated block. Average
    temperature criteria of 10 ℃ and 20 ℃ at the stable state were used for a low-temperature
    condition field test (ambient temperature around −3 ℃) and a windy condition field
    test (ambient temperature around 4.5 ℃), as shown in Eqs. (2), (3): (2) (3) 2.4.
    Unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) system The angle auto-adjusted heating system was
    transported by a ground vehicle converted from a Cub Cadet RZT-S Zero electric
    lawnmower with a 48-volt battery (Cub Cadet, Cleveland, OH, USA). The electrical
    and control components included a 2.4 Ghz receiver (6Ch V2, HobbyKing HongKong,
    China), a 2.4 GHz 8 channels remote controller with a “dead man” function (T8FB,
    Radiolink, Hongkong, China), two motor controllers (BAC1000, Accelerated Systems
    Inc (ASI), Waterloo, Canada), and a control box consisting of a custom microprocessor
    circuit called Cub Cadet motor shield (CCMS) and an Arduino MEGA 2560 (Pagan,
    2021) (Fig. 7). The CCMS received three analog pulse-width modulated (PWM) radio
    control (RC) signals, i.e., the steering signal, the throttle forward/reverse
    signal, and the dead man signal. The CCMS activated the onboard relay to provide
    48 VDC power to the two ASI motor controllers when the dead man signal was active.
    The CCMS then mixed the steering and throttle signals to provide individual digital
    commands to the ASI motor controllers for the left and right wheel motors. Download

    and an Arduino MEGA 2560. A section of tree canopy (17 m long) was divided into
    three blocks (Block 1, Block 2, and Waiting block) (Fig. 8). Block 1 and Block
    2 were 7 m in length, and Waiting block was 3 m in length. In Block 1 and Block
    2, two groups of the digital thermometers (A1 - F1 and A2 - F2) were placed in
    the middle of the tree row (y-axis) at a height of 1 m (z-axis) with a constant
    spacing of 1 m in the x-axis. F1 in Block 1 and A2 in Block 2 were spaced 2 m
    apart to ensure negligible heat flow effect between each area. The orchard track
    between the selected tree row and the neighboring tree row was roughly 2.6 m wide.
    The heaters on each side of the tree row were placed in the center line of the
    orchard track during the field tests. The red and green LED lamps in Fig. 6 were
    used to represent the temperature conditions in Block 1 and Block 2, respectively.
    The heater moving decisions are explained as follows: (1) When the red LED lamp
    at Block 1 flashed and the green LED lamp at Block 2 was off, representing the
    fulfilled temperature criterion at Block 1, the heaters should be moved to Block
    2 (x = 10.5 m). (2) When the red LED lamp at Block 1 was off and the green LED
    lamp at Block 2 flashed, representing the fulfilled temperature criterion at Block
    2, the heaters should be moved to Block 1 (x = 3.5 m). (3) When the red and green
    LED lamps at Block 1 and Block 2 flashed, representing the fulfilled temperature
    criteria at both Block 1 and Block 2, the heaters should be moved to Waiting block
    to save energy. (4) When the red and green LED lamps at Block 1 and Block 2 were
    off, representing that neither temperature criteria at Block 1 nor Block 2 were
    fulfilled, the heaters should stay at the current block and continue applying
    heat. Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size

    1 and Block 2. The letters from A to F represent thermometers. 2.5. Study site
    An apple orchard was selected as the study site, located at the Penn State Russell
    E. Larson Agricultural Research Center, Rock Springs, Pennsylvania (40.70°N, 77.95°W).
    The apple trees in this orchard were planted and trained in a central leader structure
    with trellis wire support in the 1980s. The orchard dimension was 70 m (L) × 20
    m (W), and the size of each tree row was roughly 70 m (L) × 1 m (W) × 2 m (H).
    The canopies were approximately arranged in 30° W of N. A canopy block of 17 m
    (L) in the orchard was selected for field tests, as shown in red in Fig. 9. In
    field tests, the two heaters were placed on each side of the tree row with a distance
    of 3.6 m between them. The right-hand side heater was equipped with the CPCPS,
    and the left-hand side heater was placed on a wagon and manually controlled according
    to the behavior of the heater on the right due to the limited number of UGVs.

    of protection performance To test the canopy protection performance, six field
    tests in the apple orchard were conducted on March 29th, April 8th, April 18th,
    and April 25th, 2023, respectively. The tests on March 29th and April 25th were
    conducted for evaluating the protection performances of the angle auto-adjusted
    heating system in low-temperature conditions; the tests on April 8th and 25th
    were conducted for evaluating the protection performances of the CPCPS in low-temperature
    conditions; the tests on April 18th were conducted for evaluating the protection
    performances of the angle auto-adjusted heating system and the CPCPS in a windy
    condition. The average ambient temperature, average wind speed, average wind direction,
    and maximum gust speed during the tests are shown in Table 1. Table 1. The field
    test schedules and the environment conditions during each test. Date Test Group

    Note: Ta = ambient temperature, Va = average wind speed,  = average wind direction,
    Vm = maximum gust speed. The angle auto-adjusted heating system is one of the
    most important parts of the CPCPS. To investigate the performance, a 5 min heating
    test of the angle auto-adjusted heating system and a 5 min heating test of the
    angle fixed heating system were conducted as the test group and control group,
    respectively. The heaters were placed along the tree row between thermometers
    C1 and D1 in Block 1 and toward the direction of thermometer D1 for the test of
    the angle fixed system. The rotatable heaters were placed along the tree row between
    thermometers C2 and D2 in Block 2 for the test of the angle auto-adjusted system.
    The heating angle was determined according to the principles of angle adjustment
    shown in Fig. 5. To investigate the overall protection performance of the CPCPS,
    a 10 min heating test enabling the CPCPS and a 10 min heating test disabling the
    CPCPS were carried out as the test group and control group, respectively. For
    the test of the non-CPCPS, the heaters were placed along the tree row between
    thermometers C1 and D1 in Block 1 and toward the direction of thermometers D1.
    For the test of the CPCPS, the heating angle was determined based on the principle
    of the angle adjustment shown in Fig. 5. The heating location either in Block
    1 or Block 2 was determined according to the principle of the UGV movement in
    Fig. 8. Between the two 10 min tests, a time interval of 10 min was used to ensure
    the heat provided by the gas heaters was completely dissipated so that the effect
    of the former test was negligible on the latter. All tests were conducted either
    in the early morning before sunrise or late evening after sunset without direct
    solar radiation so that the variations of ambient temperatures over time during
    field tests were negligible. Therefore, the comparisons of the protection performance
    between test groups and control groups were acceptable. Apple flower buds are
    damaged when the temperature is lower than a critical temperature for 30 min.
    The critical temperature of −2 ℃ was utilized in this study as suggested by Proebsting
    and Mills (1978). The percentage of protected time ( ) and the temperature increase
    ratio ( ) were used to evaluate the protection performance of the canopy for two
    conditions, i.e., cold-temperature condition and windy condition. The percentage
    of protected time ( ) was defined as the ratio of the protected time to total
    test time in low-temperature conditions, as shown in Eq. (4). The temperature
    increase ratio ( ) was defined as the ratio of the temperature increase to the
    initial ambient temperature in windy conditions, as shown in Eq. (5): (4) (5)
    where is the protected time (s), is the total test time (s), is the average temperature
    over time during the test (℃), is the initial ambient temperature (℃). 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Protection performance of angle auto-adjusted system in low-temperature
    condition The angle auto-adjusted heating system worked properly during the heating
    tests in the low-temperature conditions on March 29th and April 25th, 2023. Table
    2 shows the working procedures for the angle auto-adjusted heating system in Block
    2 and the angle fixed heating system in Block 1. On March 29th, a 5 min test started
    at 7:28:27 in Block 2. Two adjustments of the heating angle were observed at 7:29:33
    and 7:31:58 respectively due to the change of the ambient wind direction. Subsequently,
    a 5 min test of the angle fixed heating system, i.e., the control group, started
    at 7:33:34 in Block 1 with the heaters angled toward thermometer D1. On April
    25th, a 5 min test started at 6:52:40 in Block 2 and an adjustment of the heating
    angle occurred at 6:55:39. The 5 min control test started at 6:58:53 for the angle
    fixed heating test. Table 2. Working procedures of the angle auto-adjusted heating

    angle fixed heating system in Block 1 and the angle auto-adjusted heating system
    in Block 2 on March 29th and April 25th. On March 29th, thermometers D1 and E1
    in the angle fixed heating test measured obvious increases in temperature, up
    to 57.5 and 4.7 ℃, as shown in Fig. 10 (a). For thermometers B1 and C1, which
    were in the opposite direction of the heat flow, the temperatures remained below
    the critical level (-2 ℃). In the test of the angle auto-adjusted heating system
    in Block 2, the temperatures measured by thermometers D2 and E2 increased to 23.2
    ℃ and 3.0 ℃ at 7:29:33 and then decreased to 6.0 ℃ and −2.2 ℃ at 7:31:58. After
    the second change of the heating angle at 7:31:58, the temperatures for thermometers
    D2 and E2 increased again to 22.0 ℃ and 1.8 ℃, as shown in Fig. 10 (b). On the
    contrary, the temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and C2 remained unchanged
    at the first 70 s, then increased to 5.6 ℃ and 48.3 ℃ before the second change
    of the heating angle, and finally decreased to 1.8 ℃ and 46.3 ℃ at the end of
    the test, as shown in Fig. 10 (b). Fig. 10 (c) shows that the temperatures for
    thermometers D1 and E1 increased to 53.1 ℃ and 7.8 ℃, but the temperatures for
    thermometers B1 and C1 remained below the critical level during the test of the
    angle fixed heating on April 25th. For the test of the angle auto-adjusted heating
    (Fig. 10 (d)), the temperatures for thermometers D2 and E2 first increased and
    then decreased, resulting in the temperature peaks of 43.2 ℃ and 7.5 ℃, respectively.
    For thermometers B2 and C2, the temperatures remained at the ambient level before
    6:55:39 and went up to 5.0 ℃ and 36.7 ℃ at the end of the test. The thermometers
    A1, A2, F1, and F2 remained at the ambient temperature level (-3.6 ℃) during the
    tests, indicating that the distances between these points and heaters were farther
    away than the heat flow reached. Download : Download high-res image (480KB) Download

    heating system in Block 1 on April 25th; (d) test of angle auto-adjusted heating
    system in Block 2 on April 25th. Thermometers of A1, A2, F1, and F2 during the
    tests remained at the ambient temperature level and thus are not shown in the
    figure. Table 3 shows the comparisons of the average temperature between the angle
    fixed heating system and the angle auto-adjusted heating system. The spatial difference
    of the average temperature for each thermometer greatly varied between the two
    heating systems. In the angle fixed heating system, the heat mainly focused on
    the location of thermometer D1, leading to the dramatically high of 45.9 ℃ and
    40.9 ℃ on March 29th and April 25th, respectively. In contrast, for thermometers
    B1, C1, and E1 ranged from −3.3 ℃ to −2.8 ℃ on March 29th, and from −2.5 ℃to 5.9
    ℃ on April 25th. In the angle auto-adjusted heating system, thermometer C2 measured
    the highest of 29.5 ℃ on March 29th and thermometer D2 measured the highest of
    32.6 ℃ on April 25th. The highest measured in the angle auto-adjusted heating
    tests on March 29th and April 25th were lower than those measured in the angle
    fixed heating tests. However, the overall showed a different result. The overall
    was 11.1 ℃ and 12.7 ℃ for the angle auto-adjusted heating system on March 29th
    and April 25th, which were higher than those for the angle fixed heating system
    (  = 10.6 ℃ and 10.4 ℃). Table 3. Comparisons of average temperature and percentage
    of protected time between angle fixed heating system and angle auto-adjusted heating

    Table 3 also shows the comparisons of the percentage of protected time between
    the angle fixed heating system and the angle auto-adjusted heating system. In
    the angle fixed heating tests, for thermometers D1 and E1 were as high as 96.2
    % because they were located in the heated area, but for thermometers B1 and C1
    were 0. In the angle auto-adjusted heating tests on March 29th, remained at high
    levels for thermometers D2 and E2 (96.2 % and 84.6 %). More importantly, compared
    to  = 0 in the angle fixed heating tests, for thermometers B2 and C2 greatly increased
    to 69.2 % and 76.9 %. Increases in for thermometers B2 and C2 were also observed
    in the angle auto-adjusted heating test on April 25th, up to 46.2 %. The overall
    average for the angle auto-adjusted heating system were 81.7 % and 71.2 % on March
    29th and April 25th, which were 69.9 % and 48.0 % higher than those for the angle
    fixed heating system (  = 48.1 %). In summary, the angle auto-adjusted heating
    system greatly enhanced the protection performance during the heating tests in
    low-temperature conditions. 3.2. Protection performance of CPCPS in low-temperature
    condition In addition to the angle auto-adjusted heating system, the real-time
    temperature sensing system and the UGV system in the CPCPS also worked properly
    in the low-temperature conditions on April 8th and 25th. Table 4 shows the working
    procedures for the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS, including start time, time of heating
    angle adjustment, time of UGV movement, and end time. On April 8th, the test of
    the CPCPS started at 7:21:00 in Block 1. Three angle adjustments occurred at 7:22:55,
    7:24:27, and 7:27:20. The heating systems were moved at 7:25:34 and 7:28:58. After
    10 min of heat dissipation, the test of the non-CPCPS started in Block 1 at 7:41:00,
    lasting for 10 min. On April 25th, the test of the non-CPCPS and the test of the
    CPCPS started at 6:11:30 and 6:31:11, respectively. An adjustment of the heating
    angle and a movement of the heating systems were observed at 6:34:15 and 6:35:18
    during the test of the CPCPS, respectively. Table 4. Working procedures of the

    Fig. 11 shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations for the CPCPS and
    the non-CPCPS on April 8th. For the CPCPS test, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    B1 and C1 remained at the ambient level for the first 2 min and increased at 7:22:55
    due to the first heating angle change, as shown in Fig. 11 (a), resulting in the
    temperature peaks (4.0 and 29.5 ℃) at 7:24:27 before the second heating angle
    changed. The temperatures measured by thermometers D1 and E1 first increased to
    54.0 ℃ and 7.7 ℃ at 7:22:55, and then decreased to 29.3 ℃ and 1.0 ℃ at 7:24:27.
    After the second change of the heating angle, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    D1 and E1 increased again, up to 40.3 ℃ and 6.3 ℃. At 7:25:34, the measured average
    temperature of thermometers A1-F1 in Block 1 met the criteria in Eq. (2), which
    triggered the UGV movement. Consequent temperature drops in thermometers B1, C1,
    D1, and E1 occurred due to the movement of the heating systems to Block 2. At
    7:25:40, the UGV arrived at the location between thermometers C2 and D2 in Block
    2 in the center line of the orchard track. The heating angle was toward thermometer
    D2 and thus the temperatures measured by thermometers D2 and E2 greatly increased
    to 42.2 ℃ and 4.5 ℃, as shown in Fig. 11 (b). At 7:27:20, the third change of
    the heating angle occurred, leading to temperature decreases in thermometers D2
    and E2. However, the temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and C2 increased
    to 6.2 ℃ and 42.0 ℃ at 7:28:58. At that moment, the measured average temperature
    of thermometers A2-F2 in Block 2 met the criteria in Eq. (2), which triggered
    the UGV movement again. Subsequently, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    B2, C2, D2, and E2 gradually decreased. At 7:29:04, the heating system moved back
    to Block 1, resulting in temperature increases in thermometers B1 and C1, up to
    7.8 ℃ and 54.1 ℃ at the end of the 10 min test. In the test of the non-CPCPS on
    April 8th (Fig. 11 (c)), thermometer D1 monitored a dramatic temperature increase
    and after around 2 min remained at a high-temperature level of around 55 ℃ with
    a slight temperature fluctuation caused by the occasional gust of wind in the
    orchard. Thermometer E1 also monitored a temperature increase (around 5 ℃) until
    the end of the test. However, no temperature increases were monitored by the other
    10 thermometers (A1-C1, F1, and A2-F2). Download : Download high-res image (396KB)

    variations on April 8th. (a)-(c) Test of CPCPS; (c) test of non-CPCPS. The temperatures
    for the thermometers that remained at the ambient level during the tests are not
    shown in the figure. The temperature variations for thermometers F1 and A2 are
    not shown in the figure because thermometers F1 and A2 in CPCPS only had a slight
    and transient temperature increase (around 2–3 ℃) due to the simultaneous moving
    and heating of heaters. Fig. 12 shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations
    for the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS on April 25th. For the CPCPS test, the temperatures
    measured by thermometers D1 and E1 increased to 38.6 ℃ and 4.6 ℃ at 6:34:15 and
    then gradually decreased due to the first heating angle change, as shown in Fig.
    12 (a). Thermometers B1 and C1 monitored temperature increases from 6:34:15 to
    6:35:18, and temperature decreases after 6:35:18 due to the UGV movement to Block
    2. The peak temperatures for thermometers B1 and C1 before the UGV movement were
    20.4 ℃ and 3.5 ℃, respectively. The temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and
    C2 increased after the heating systems moved to Block 2 at 6:35:24 and eventually
    reached 47.5 ℃ and 5.0 ℃, as shown in Fig. 12 (b). The ambient wind direction
    remained unchanged from 6:35:24 to 6:41:11 in Block 2, so the temperatures of
    thermometers D2 and E2 remained at the ambient level until the end of the test.
    For the non-CPCPS test (Fig. 12 (c)), the temperature measured by thermometers
    D1 and E1 reached an approximate steady state at 5 min. Compared to the temperature
    data of thermometers D1 in the non-CPCPS test on April 8th (Fig. 11 (c)), the
    temperature data monitored on April 25th (Fig. 12 (c)) reached a stable state
    more slowly. The canopy on was denser on April 25th than on April 8th due to growing
    leaves and flowers, leading to less active convection heat transfer in the later
    date. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download full-size

    and (b) Test of CPCPS; (c) test of non-CPCPS. The temperatures for the thermometers
    that remained at the ambient level during the tests are not shown in the figure.
    The protection performances, i.e., the average sensor temperature and the percentage
    of protected time , were greatly improved with the CPCPS, as shown in Table 5.
    For example, compared to for the non-CPCPS (2.4 ℃ and 1.3 ℃ on April 8th and 25th),
    for the CPCPS was higher (3.9 ℃ and 2.6 ℃), respectively. for the CPCPS during
    the two tests (47.8 % and 33.9 %) was also larger than those for the non-CPCPS
    (16 %), which increased by 198.8 % and 111.9 %. The temperatures measured by most
    of the thermometers in the non-CPCPS tests were lower than the critical level
    because the rotation and the mobility were not activated. Correspondingly, at
    most of the locations in non-CPCPS was 0, leading to insufficient protection performance.
    However, for the CPCPS tests, the rotatable and mobile heaters applied heat to
    more areas, which greatly enhanced the heating performance. Table 5. Comparison

    %), and were higher on April 8th (3.9 ℃ and 47.8 %) even though the ambient temperature
    on April 8th and 25th was similar. Except for the less active convective heat
    transfer on the later date, another reason is that the heating angle change and
    the heating system moving were less frequent on April 25th, leading to more thermometers
    remaining at the ambient temperature, such as A1, F1, A2, and D2 - F2. In contrast,
    other than thermometers A1 and F2 on April 8th, for the other thermometers were
    all higher than the critical level. Therefore, most of (thermometers B1-E2) were
    high on April 8th, ranging from 46.9 % to 97.9 %, as shown in Table 5. 3.3. Protection
    performance of angle auto-adjusted system and CPCPS in windy condition The angle
    auto-adjusted heating system and the CPCPS worked properly in a windy condition
    during the field tests on April 18th, 2023. Table 6 shows the working procedures
    for the angle fixed heating system, the angle auto-adjusted heating system, the
    CPCPS, and the non-CPCPS. The 5 min tests for the angle fixed heating system and
    the angle auto-adjusted heating system started at 8:04:17 and 8:14:56. Two adjustments
    of the heating angle were observed at 8:16:19 and 8:18:21 respectively due to
    the changes of the ambient wind direction. The 10 min tests for the non-CPCPS
    and the CPCPS started at 8:29:58 and 8:50:41. Two heating angle adjustments and
    a movement of the heaters occurred in the test of the CPCPS at 8:55:10, 8:56:22,
    and 8:57:20, respectively. Table 6. Working procedures of the angle auto-adjusted

    shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations during the field tests of
    the angle fixed heating and the angle auto-adjusted heating systems in the windy
    condition. During the test of the fixed heating system, the temperature measured
    by thermometer D1 greatly increased to 72.1 ℃ at 8:06:21 and obvious fluctuations
    in temperature were then monitored ranging from 61.2 ℃ to 75.2 ℃, as shown in
    Fig. 13 (a). The temperature fluctuations can be explained by the strong wind
    in the orchard that carried some heat away. Thermometer E1 measured much lower
    temperatures than thermometer D1 but a similar fluctuation in temperature was
    observed between them since the two thermometers were in the same direction of
    the heat being applied. During the test of the angle auto-adjusted heating system,
    the temperatures measured by thermometers B2 and C2 first increased to 20.5 ℃
    and 62.3 ℃ at 8:16:19, then decreased to 7.9 ℃ and 28.0 ℃ at 8:18:21, and eventually
    increased to 22.7 ℃ and 63.6 ℃ at 8:19:49 due to the two changes of wind direction,
    as shown in Fig. 13 (b). For thermometer D2, the measured temperature slightly
    increased to 10.2 ℃ at 8:16:19, which seemed to be due to the heat flow brought
    from the location of thermometer C2 in the windy condition. Subsequently, the
    temperatures measured by thermometers D2 and E2 dramatically increased to 71.8
    ℃ and 25.6 ℃, and then decreased to 31.2 ℃ and 8.8 ℃ due to the auto-adjusted
    heating angle based on the ambient wind direction. Download : Download high-res

    2. Thermometers that remained at the ambient temperature level (4.5 ℃) are not
    shown in the figure. Fig. 14 shows the spatial and temporal temperature variations
    for the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS in the windy condition on April 18th. In the CPCPS
    test, the temperatures measured by thermometers B1 and C1 increased from 4.5 ℃
    to 14.8 ℃ and 64.0 ℃, and remained at these levels until the first change of the
    heating angle at 8:55:10. Thermometer D1 first monitored a slight increase (10.4
    ℃) before 8:55:10 due to the heat flow from the location of thermometer C1 caused
    by ambient wind and then an obvious increase (48.0 ℃) after 8:55:10 due to the
    change of heating angle. After the UGV movement to Block 2, the temperatures measured
    by thermometers B1, C1, D1, and E1 in Block 1 gradually decreased to the ambient
    temperature level. In contrast, thermometers B2, C2, D2, and E2 in Block 2 subsequently
    measured temperature increases. For example, the temperatures measured by thermometers
    D2 and E2 increased to 30.4 ℃ and 13.5 ℃ before the second change of the heating
    angle at 8:57:20. For thermometers B2 and C2, their temperatures first increased
    by around 3.5 ℃ because the heaters were operating while moving. The temperatures
    for thermometers B2 and C2 increased to 20.1 ℃ and 63.2 ℃ at the end of the test.
    In the non-CPCPS test, thermometers D1 and E1 monitored temperature increases
    to 69.5 ℃ and 21.3 ℃ in the first 4 min and then fluctuated around 60 ℃ and 15
    ℃. Meanwhile, thermometer C1 also measured a slight temperature increase, which
    was attributed to a gust of wind in the orchard, resulting in heat flow from the
    location of thermometer D1 to the location of thermometer C1. Download : Download

    that remained the ambient temperature level during the tests are not shown in
    the figure. Table 7 shows the average temperature and the temperature increase
    ratio in the angle fixed heating system and the angle auto-adjusted heating system.
    The measured results indicate that the angle auto-adjusted heating system had
    an overall higher (23.6 ℃) than the angle fixed heating system (20.2 ℃), and the
    overall average in the angle auto-adjusted heating system (425.0 %) was higher
    than that in the angle fixed heating system (348.9 %). In the angle fixed heating
    system, thermometer D1 had a maximum (55.2 ℃), leading to an extremely high of
    1126.6 %, but for the other thermometers were relatively low. For example, for
    thermometers B1 and C1 only increased by 6.7 % and 4.4 %. for all the thermometers
    in the angle auto-adjusted heating system were high, ranging from 11.7 ℃ to 39.7
    ℃, leading to high (148.9–782.2 %). Therefore, compared to the angle fixed heating
    system, for the angle auto-adjusted heating system increased by 21.8 %. Table

    Note: for the average temperature that was lower than the initial temperature
    (4.5 ℃), the temperature increase ratio was assigned to 0. Table 7 shows and in
    the CPCPS and the non-CPCPS. for the CPCPS was higher (11.5 ℃) than for the non-CPCPS
    (10.2 ℃). Even though a dramatically large was measured by thermometer D1 (56.7
    ℃), the temperature remained at ambient in most locations in the non-CPCPS, resulting
    in more locations with no temperature increase. In the CPCPS, ranged from 31.1
    % to 811.1 % except for thermometers A1, F1, A2, and F2. The overall average for
    the CPCPS (155.4 %) was thus larger than that for the non-CPCPS (125.6 %). Compared
    to the non-CPCPS, for the CPCPS increased by 23.7 %. In summary, the angle fixed
    heating system and the CPCPS had the capacity for improving protection performance
    in windy conditions. 3.4. The implication and future work A canopy protection
    cyber-physical system (CPCPS) for smart management of frost damage was developed
    based on a UGV system, an angle auto-adjusted heating system, and a temperature
    sensing system. The designed system is beneficial to minimizing labor and maximizing
    frost protection efficiency. The total cost of equipment used in this study was
    approximately $5,000, mainly including a UGV for $4500, a heater for $200, and
    microcomputers for $100. Even though the UGV is a large initial investment, the
    total cost can be substantially cheaper compared to human labor costs for frost
    protection in the long-term. These components of the framework can be modified
    as needed and the current CPCPS can be improved in a few aspects in future studies
    to further enhance the heating performance. First, the CPCPS performed well under
    the average wind velocities from 0.1 m/s to 3.1 m/s during the tests, but occasional
    strong gusts reduced the heating performance. Therefore, future studies can focus
    on the stability of heating performance under occasional strong gusts. Second,
    the UGV was manually controlled by a remote controller. Improvements can be made
    for fully autonomous management, such as using autonomous UGVs and real-time communication
    between temperature sensors and UGVs. Specifically, after temperature data measured
    by real-time temperature sensors are processed, navigation decisions are automatically
    made for UGV-based heater movements according to GPS coordination. Third, the
    run time for the UGV of Cub Cadet RZT-S Zero typically can up to 1.5–2 h and the
    utilization of solar panels on top of UGV would increase the run time by simultaneously
    charging the battery. 4. Conclusions A CPCPS that relied on open software sources
    and easily accessible hardware was proposed and evaluated in an experimental apple
    orchard. The combination of real-time temperature sensors, wind direction sensor,
    gas heaters, and a UGV system offers insight into smart frost management. The
    following major conclusions can be drawn from the study: 1. Compared to the angle
    fixed heating system, the percentage of protected time for the angle auto-adjusted
    heating system increased by 69.9 % and 48.0 % during the two low-temperature field
    tests. 2. Compared to the non-CPCPS, the CPCPS effectively enhanced the protection
    performance during the two low-temperature field tests, resulting in the percentage
    of protected time increasing by 198.8 % and 111.9 %, respectively. 3. The angle
    fixed heating system and the CPCPS also worked properly during the windy field
    test. Compared to the angle fixed heating system and the non-CPCPS, the average
    temperature increase ratio increased by 21.8 % and 23.7 % for the angle auto-adjusted
    heating system and the CPCPS, respectively. The results suggest that the CPCPS
    is beneficial for frost management by improving the protection performance of
    apple canopies. In the future, the integration of autonomous UGVs may further
    improve the level of mechanization and automation of the CPCPS. CRediT authorship

  description: This paper gives the idea of solving some of the problems faced by
    farmers. The population rate of the world is growing rapidly and will double in
    the coming decades and the need of food is also increasing simultaneously. To
    meet this rapid growth in demand for food, automation in agriculture is the best
    solution. The aim of this paper is to design and develop an automated system to
    monitor the various conditions of soil and moisture on the crops, and the proper
    supply of water, which affects the crops [5]. Such a system will contain sensors,

    in a controlled climate without the natural environmental conditions. In the last
    few decades there has been a huge advancement in technology for agriculture, with
    the help of technology we can help farmers for increasing their rate of yielding.

  description: The objective of this study is to examine how IoT-enabled intelligent
    irrigation systems can be used in rice agriculture. The study uses sensors to
    gather environmental data in real time, such as temperature, water level, humidity,
    and humidity sensors. Machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks
    (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and random forests
    (RF), are then used to process the data in order to predict future water demand.
    Experimental findings The efficacy of the system indicates, where ANN demonstrates
    the greatest accuracy of 95.6%, followed closely by SVM of 93.2%, DT of 88.7%,
    and RF of 86.5% These performance indicators indicate the robustness and accuracy
    of the model in forecasting environmental conditions for irrigation highlighting
    the positive. The effectiveness of each model is further demonstrated by confusion
    matrices, which provide instances of true positives, false positives, true negatives,
    and false negatives. Achieving a successful integration of IoT and machine learning
    ensures a proactive response to changing field conditions and lowers the risk
    of resource misuse through precise adjustments to the water supply. The results
    emphasise the potential of technology-driven solutions to increase precision agriculture,
    leading to sustainable practices that optimise yields while conserving resources.
    The study offers vital insights for agricultural stakeholders, opening the road
    for flexible and adaptable solutions that solve the problems of contemporary rice
    production in the face of altering climates and global food.

  description: Recognition of the importance of soil moisture information to the optimisation
    of water-limited dryland cereal production has led to Australian growers being
    encouraged to make use of soil moisture sensors. However, irrespective of the
    merits of different sensing technologies, only a small soil volume is sensed,
    raising questions as to the utility of such sensors in broadacre cropping, especially
    given spatial variability in soil water holding capacity. Here, using data collected
    from contrasting sites in South Australia and Western Australia over two seasons,
    during which either wheat or barley were grown, we describe a method for extrapolating
    soil moisture information away from the location of a probe using freely-available
    NDVI time series and weather data as covariates. Relationships between soil moisture
    probe data, cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP) and seasonal
    growing degree days (GDD) were significant (P < 0.0001). In turn, these could
    be used to predict soil moisture status for any location within a field on any
    date following crop emergence. However, differences in ΣNDVI between different
    within-field zones did not fully explain differences in the soil moisture from
    multiple sensors located in these zones, resulting in different calibrations being
    required for each sensor or zone and a relatively low accuracy of prediction of
    measured soil moisture (R2adj ~ 0.4–0.7) which may not be sufficient to support
    targeted agronomic decision-making. The results also suggest that at any location
    within a field, the range of variation in soil moisture status down the soil profile
    on any given date will present as greater than the spatial variation in soil moisture
    across the field on that date. Accordingly, we conclude that, in dryland cereal
    cropping, the major value in soil moisture sensors arises from an enhanced ability
    to compare seasons and to relate similarities and differences between seasons
    as a guide to decision-making.

    to the optimisation of water-limited dryland cereal production has led to Australian
    growers being encouraged to make use of soil moisture sensors. However, irrespective

    raising questions as to the utility of such sensors in broadacre cropping, especially

    measured soil moisture (R2adj ~ 0.4–0.7) which may not be sufficient to support
    targeted agronomic decision-making. The results also suggest that at any location
    within a field, the range of variation in soil moisture status down the soil profile
    on any given date will present as greater than the spatial variation in soil moisture
    across the field on that date. Accordingly, we conclude that, in dryland cereal
    cropping, the major value in soil moisture sensors arises from an enhanced ability
    to compare seasons and to relate similarities and differences between seasons
    as a guide to decision-making. Introduction Climate variability and its impact
    on farmer attitudes to risk are key drivers of both profitability and yield gaps
    in Australia’s broadacre dryland cereal cropping systems (Hochman & Horan, 2018;
    Monjardino et al., 2013, 2015; Zhang et al., 2019). This is due primarily to the
    importance of soil moisture to agronomic performance (Kirkegaard et al., 2014)
    and its impact on farmer investment in nitrogen (N; note that, in contrast to
    places like the European Union, farm businesses in Australia do not receive any
    government subsidies). In effect, the N management problem faced by Australian
    farmers boils down to one of: ‘given prevailing and expected seasonal conditions,
    will I have enough soil water available to produce a crop of desired commercial
    yield, and to therefore justify investment in sufficient N to produce it ?’ Because
    soils and their ability to supply a crop with water may be highly spatially variable
    (Rab et al., 2009), fertilizer management based on soil-specific management zones
    and underpinned by Precision Agriculture (PA) technologies, is one response to
    the uncertainty associated with these questions (Monjardino et al., 2013). However,
    the rate of adoption of sensing technologies aimed at supporting targeted, variable-rate,
    N management is low (Bramley & Ouzman, 2019). A possible reason for this is that
    the development of such sensors as aids to N management (e.g. Raun et al., 2005)
    has generally failed to recognise the complex multivariate nature of the drivers
    of crop response to N and its profitability (Colaço & Bramley, 2018). For example,
    Colaço and Bramley (2019) have highlighted the need to incorporate consideration
    of site and seasonal variation, and their consequences for soil moisture status,
    into the calibration and use of sensors to assist with N management. Indeed, where
    the optimisation of N management is a key goal, the need to factor soil moisture
    status into the decision-making process is critical (Lawes et al., 2019). The
    importance of soil moisture as a primary determinant of yield potential is a major
    reason why cereal growers in Australia’s dryland wheatbelt have been encouraged
    to purchase soil moisture sensors, such as are commonly used to underpin irrigation
    management in winegrape (Nordestgaard, 2019) and other horticultural systems (Montagu
    & Stirzaker, 2008). However, no matter how well these are calibrated, the utility
    of such sensors is arguably constrained by the fact that they sense moisture status
    in a small volume of soil. As a result, their interpretation in the context of
    soil spatial variability at the field and farm scale is potentially problematic
    and somewhat reliant on the development of ‘rules of thumb’, especially given
    the low intensity of field-based characterisation of plant available water capacity
    (PAWC; Dalgleish et al., 2012; see also https://www.apsim.info/apsim-model/apsoil/).
    Accordingly, fewer than a quarter of Australian broadacre dryland cereal growers
    have adopted such sensors, with their use strongly skewed towards the eastern
    states of Australia and otherwise more focussed in higher rainfall areas (Bramley
    & Ouzman, 2019). Furthermore, of the approximately 500 dryland farmer clients
    of one provider of soil sensing services, around 70% have just a single sensor
    on their farm (L. Wilksch, Agbyte—pers. comm.) which is likely to be around 2,500
    ha in area (Bramley & Ouzman, 2019). Methods of extrapolating soil moisture probe
    data away from the location of the probe are therefore of considerable interest,
    as is the question of how useful being able to do this is in the context of supporting
    PA, including targeted on-farm decision-making such as variable rate N application.
    Our objective in the present work was to develop a method for extrapolating soil
    moisture probe data to other parts of a field and so enable it to be interpreted
    throughout the field. The method relies on a combination of freely available satellite
    and weather data, along with a simple understanding of crop phenology and which,
    as such, should be readily implementable. We also consider the utility of the
    information generated by this method in light of the results obtained when it
    is implemented at two contrasting sites in the Australian grainbelt. Methods and
    materials Sites Development and initial testing of the methodology (see below)
    was done using data collected in 2019 and 2020 from a 64 ha field located near
    Tarlee in the mid-north of South Australia, where annual rainfall is in the 425–525
    mm range. As reported by Colaço et al. (2023), the growing season rainfall at
    this site was 218 mm in 2019 and 352 mm in 2020, whilst the mean yields achieved
    were 3.5 t/ha wheat in 2019 and 7.5 t/ha barley in 2020. Several years of yield
    maps and an electromagnetic soil survey (Fig. 1a) promoted the delineation of
    three zones (Taylor et al., 2007) within the field (Fig. 1b). The soils in zone
    1 are deep (> 1 m) black cracking vertosols (ASRIS, 2011). Those in zone 2 are
    a mix of a shallower variant of these black soils and the red vertosols that are
    common in the district, often with calcrete layers in the subsoil, the occurrence
    of which ranges in depth from around 40–80 cm. The soils in zone 3 are much shallower
    (generally < 80 cm) red calcarosols with more loamy textures, again with calcrete
    in the subsoil, often occurring as shallow as 35 cm. Notwithstanding the different
    soils in each zone, the average soil clay content in the top 30 cm derived from
    21 soil sample locations (Fig. 1a; Colaço et al., 2023) was 38.8%. A soil moisture
    capacitance probe (EnviroPro EP100G-L-12, Entelechy Pty Ltd, Golden Grove, SA
    5125, Australia) was installed in each zone. The locations of these were conditioned
    by the need for them to be located within ~ 15 m of the fence line to enable access
    to power and avoid interference with farm machinery, but they were otherwise located
    to reflect the different zones (Fig. 1b). Note that these probes measure soil
    moisture within a field of influence of 55 mm from the wall of the probe. As such,
    they are specified to assess soil moisture status in a total soil volume of 19.2
    L. A soil moisture characterisation (Burk & Dalgliesh, 2013) was undertaken at
    a location close to (within ~ 15 m) each probe for estimation of plant available
    water capacity (PAWC), and samples were also collected close to the position of
    the probe in ad hoc time series for probe calibration. As part of other work on
    N decision making (Colaço et al., 2023), samples were also collected from the
    21 locations distributed across the field (Fig. 1a) close to growth stage GS31
    (Zadoks, 1974). In all cases, gravimetric soil moisture content was determined
    using oven drying at 105 °C for not less than 48 h. Other aspects of soil characterisation
    (estimation of bulk density and PAWC, etc.) were as described by Burk and Dalgleish
    (2013). Fig. 1 The 64 ha field near Tarlee in the mid-North region of South Australia

    zones. c–f Cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI) at either approximately GS31 or in late September
    in each of 2019 and 2020 Full size image Further testing of the methodology described
    below made use of a contrasting 358 ha field located near Kalannie in Western
    Australia. Here, the soils are predominantly Kandosols (ASRIS, 2011), non-calcareous,
    and with no marked texture contrast down the profile, with a mean clay content
    in the top 30 cm of 11.7%, with some Chromosols (ASRIS, 2011) also present. The
    latter have a marked texture contrast with 10.0% clay in the top 10 cm and 37.3%
    at 30 cm; overall, the mean clay content in the top 30 cm in this field was 17.2%
    (Colaço et al., 2023). Growing season rainfall at this site was 194 mm in 2019
    and 162 mm in 2020, with mean yields of wheat achieved of 2.2 and 2.5 t/ha in
    2019 and 2020 respectively (Colaço et al., 2023). Data and rationale The method
    developed here relies on the ability to predict biomass from a time series of
    NDVI (Perry et al., 2022a, 2022b) coupled with the basic dependence of cereal
    crop phenology on temperature and water availability (Flohr et al., 2017). In
    particular, it is enabled by the observation that, during a cropping season, cumulative
    NDVI (ΣNDVI) obtained from the time series closely matches crop biomass accumulation
    (Perry et al., 2022a, 2022b). Since soil moisture status is a strong driver of
    crop biomass, the objective here was to see whether ΣNDVI could be used as a spatio-temporal
    covariate to enable extrapolation of soil moisture probe data away from the probe
    to other locations within a field during the growing season. In brief, for both
    sites, publicly available Level-2A orthorectified and atmospherically corrected
    surface reflectance imagery obtained from the Sentinel-2A and B multispectral
    instrument was downloaded using the Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017)
    for dates covering the growing season in 2019 and 2020. Note that such imagery
    can be obtained at no cost, making it an attractive basis for the approach used
    here. Following removal of images that were affected by cloud cover and/or cloud
    shadows, the retained images were fitted, on a per pixel basis (each pixel is
    10 m × 10 m), with a smooth function to describe the NDVI time series during the
    growing season (Perry et al., 2022a, 2022b). Since NDVI is reflective of the amount
    of photosynthetically active biomass, it has values of approximately zero at sowing,
    rises slowly following crop emergence and then more steeply during the main period
    of vegetative growth, before reaching a plateau mid-season and then declining
    as the crop matures (Fig. 2a). As described by Perry et al., (2022a, 2022b), from
    the function fitted to the useable NDVI time series, daily values of NDVI were
    estimated for each pixel and from these, ΣNDVI calculated, again on a daily time
    step. As seen in Fig. 2b, and consistent with the foregoing, ΣNDVI increases slowly
    before rising more steeply and reaching a maximum immediately prior to senescence.
    The output from this process is the ability to generate maps of ΣNDVI for any
    day in the growing season, as shown in Fig. 1c–f; here, we have focussed on a
    date corresponding to GS31 (Zadoks, 1974) when a grower might be considering a
    mid-season N application, and a date in late September when a grower might be
    considering whether there is sufficient soil moisture to finish a crop, or whether
    it might be better to cut the crop for hay. Fig. 2 Change in a NDVI and b cumulative
    NDVI (ΣNDVI) with days after sowing for the location corresponding to the soil
    moisture probe located in zone 1 (Fig. 1) in 2020 Full size image Daily temperature,
    rainfall and evaporation data were downloaded from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM;
    http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/). For the South Australian site, which is
    approximately halfway between Clare (BOM station 23021) and Roseworthy (21131),
    data for the weather stations at these locations were accessed and mean values
    calculated. These Clare-Roseworthy means were assumed to provide a representative
    reflection of seasonal conditions at this SA site. For the site in Western Australian,
    BOM station 10070 (Kalannie) was used. Again, these data are available at no cost.
    Crop phenology is highly temperature-driven and accordingly, the aforementioned
    daily temperature data were used to calculate the season growing degree days (GDD;
    base of 0 °C) with time-zero defined by the date of sowing. Since GDD provides
    a cumulative measure of temperature, and given the use of ΣNDVI in this work as
    a biomass predictor, rather than relying solely on daily rainfall to reflect the
    water impact on crop growth, we instead focussed on net precipitation (NP; i.e.
    daily rainfall—daily evaporation) and, to be consistent with the cumulative nature
    of GDD, calculated cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP). Soil moisture data were
    downloaded from the probes on a daily time step with all dates converted to a
    ‘days after sowing’ (DAS) basis. Three probes were used at the South Australian
    site (Fig. 1) with the Western Australian site equipped with a single probe. Statistical
    analysis and mapping From the above, and on a daily time step, we had a dataset
    comprising the following: For each study field as a whole, daily temperature,
    rainfall, GDD, NP, ΣNP, and on a per pixel basis within these fields, ΣNDVI; at
    each soil probe location, in addition to the aforementioned data, we also had
    the soil moisture probe data to a depth of 1 m in increments of 10 cm. Note that
    for the purposes of our analysis, the daily weather indices were assumed to be
    spatially invariant throughout the field. We also acknowledge the difference in
    area between a single pixel in the NDVI Imagery and the much smaller area around
    which the probe was sensing soil moisture status (within 55m of the probe wall).
    Whilst this is certainly a source of error in our approach, we do not believe
    it has a material impact on the utility or otherwise of these data of differing
    areal support, as may be inferred from the results presented below. Relationships
    between the soil moisture and other data were explored using normal and stepwise
    multiple linear regression in JMP (v. 16.0, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA),
    which was also used for other statistical analysis. For the prediction of soil
    moisture probe data, our working model was: $$\\Theta_{{{\\text{v}},p,d,t}} =
    a_{d} + b_{d} .\\Sigma {\\text{NDVI}}_{p,t} + c_{d} .\\Sigma {\\text{NP}}_{t}
    + e_{d} .{\\text{GDD}}_{t}$$ (1) where Θv,p,d,t is the volumetric soil moisture
    content (%) recorded by probe p (p = 1…3), at depth d (d = 0…100 cm in increments
    of 10 cm), on t days after sowing; ΣNDVIp,t is the value of ΣNDVI in the pixel
    that is co-incident with the location of probe p, on day t after sowing; ΣNPt
    and GDDt are the values of ΣNP and GDD on day t; and a, b, c and e are parameters
    which are specific for each depth increment (d). Subsequently, following crop
    emergence (i.e. once there is a measurable NDVI), for each soil depth increment
    of interest (d), on any day (t), and at any location (xy) in the field, we sought
    to predict Θv as: $$\\Theta_{{{\\text{v}},{\\text{xy}},d,t}} = a_{d} + b_{d} .\\Sigma
    {\\text{NDVI}}_{xy,t} + c_{d} .\\Sigma {\\text{NP}}_{t} + e_{d} .{\\text{GDD}}_{t}$$
    (2) where, for any depth (d), the parameters a, b, c and e take the values obtained
    from Eq. (1). At the WA site, where we only had access to one soil moisture probe,
    Eq. (2) was applied across the entire field. However, at the SA site, where three
    probes were available (Fig. 1), Eq. 1 was generated separately for each probe
    and consequently, it was also possible to apply three discrete versions of Eq.
    (2), one specific to each probe. This also meant that at the SA site, we could
    also constrain the locations (xy) for which Eq. 2 was applied to a zone-specific
    basis and explore the merits of averaging the predictions of Θv,xy,d,t generated
    by the 3 probes for the entire field. The results of exploration of Eqs. (1) and
    (2) were used, along with raw soil moisture data (see below), as inputs to map
    display and analysis which was done using the ArcGIS software suite (v. 10.8.2;
    ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). For the SA site, evaluation of the utility of soil moisture
    predictions derived from Eq. (2) was done using samples collected from the 21
    locations shown in Fig. 1a on 7 August 2019 and 28 July 2020 as part of other
    work reported by Colaço et al. (2023); these were the only dates during the growing
    season for which we had actual soil moisture measurements. Values of ΣNDVIxy,t,
    ΣNPt and GDDt pertinent to these dates were used to generate estimates of soil
    moisture content (Eq. 2) and these were regressed against measured soil moisture
    using simple linear regression. A similar approach was used for the WA site where
    soil moisture was measured in samples collected on 20 August 2019 and 14 August
    2020. Results For the SA site (Fig. 1), ΣNDVI, ΣNP and GDD were all significant
    predictors (P < 0.0001) of soil moisture probe data logged by the probe in zone
    1 at a depth of 20 cm across the two seasons (2019–2020) when either normal or
    stepwise multiple linear regression was used (R2adj = 0.87; Fig. 3); that is,
    Eq. (1) was found to be useful. When Eq. (1) was run on a per season basis, the
    result improved markedly in 2019 (R2adj = 0.99), compared to 2020 (R2adj = 0.82),
    most likely due to the effect of aberrant mid-season rainfall events in 2020 (Fig.
    3). When the analysis was repeated for all depth increments, R2 for the predictions
    ranged from 0.78–0.99 in 2019, 0.62–0.83 in 2020 and 0.59–0.85 for both years
    combined (P < 0.0001 in all cases). In other words, the time series of ΣNDVI along
    with ΣNP and GDD could faithfully reproduce the time series of soil moisture status
    logged by the probe. Similar results were obtained for the probes located in zones
    2 and 3 (Fig. 1b) and for the WA site (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the parameters ad,
    bd, cd and ed derived for each probe location could be used, along with the ΣNDVI
    imagery, to implement Eq. (2) and so extrapolate predicted soil moisture status
    across the entire field in depth increments of 10 cm—that is, for every pixel
    (xy) in the ΣNDVI imagery, on any date (t), using data from any of the probes
    (p) as input (Figs. 5, 6). Fig. 3 Prediction of soil moisture probe data at 20

    a normal and b stepwise multiple linear regression over both seasons and c, d

    approximately 45–70 days after sowing Full size image Fig. 5 Prediction of within-field
    soil moisture variation at GS31 in 2019 (22 July; 68 days after sowing) in a 64
    ha field in the mid-North of South Australia using cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative
    net precipitation (ΣNP) and season growing degree days (GDD) and data logged by
    soil moisture probes (green triangles) located in each of three zones (Fig. 1).
    Predictions are shown in 10 cm increments down the profile (0–100 cm) Full size
    image Fig. 6 Prediction of within-field soil moisture variation on 14 September
    2019 (130 days after sowing) in a 358 ha field near Kalannie in Western Australia
    using cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP) and season growing
    degree days (GDD) and data logged by a soil moisture probe located close to the
    edge of the field. Predictions are shown in 10 cm increments down the profile
    (0–100 cm) Full size image Figures 5, 6 suggest that when within-field variation
    in soil moisture is predicted using a single probe, variation in the estimated
    soil moisture content down the profile is greater than the within-field spatial
    variation in soil moisture content at any individual depth. At the SA site, this
    is despite the fact that soil characterisation highlighted the differences between
    the soils at the three probe locations. Thus, PAWC to a depth of 50 cm (below
    which no roots were observed during the study) was estimated at 60.2 and 77.4
    mm in zones 1 and 2. In zone 3, it was only possible to determine PAWC (30.5 mm)
    to a depth of 40 cm due to interference from calcrete and calcareous stones; PAWC
    to the same 40 cm depth in zones 1 and 2 was measured at 58.5 and 72.2 mm. Given
    the existence of the three zones at the SA site (Fig. 1) and these measured differences
    in PAWC, it is of no surprise that the predictions of soil moisture status over
    the entire field based on individual zone-based probes also differed (Fig. 5)
    a result which, even assuming that all probes were equally well installed and
    calibrated to the soil conditions at each probe location, may present a dilemma
    for farmers purchasing such sensors. Note also that, as part of the soil characterisations,
    we found that the calibration of probe data against measured soil moisture was
    strongest at shallower depths (not shown). Given the difficulties presented by
    the shallow and stony nature of soil in zone 3, along with the observation that
    probe calibration against measured soil water over the season (not shown) was
    better at shallower depths, calibration of predicted (extrapolated) soil moisture
    determined using Eq. (2) against measurements made at 21 locations (Fig. 1a) was
    confined to samples taken from the top 30 cm only. Figure 7 shows the derivation
    of ‘average’ and ‘zone-based’ maps for the SA site at GS31 in 2019. To calculate
    these, each probe-specific implementation of Eq. (2) for the whole field (Fig.
    5) was adjusted using calibrations generated for each probe based on the volumetric
    water content of samples collected at each probe site during the season in 10
    cm depth increments, and an average map was calculated across the three probes.
    The zone-based maps were derived from the same calibration-adjusted maps but using
    the selection of just those portions of each probe-specific map delimited by the
    zones (i.e. values of xy; Eq. 2) identified in Fig. 1b. One consequence of the
    zone-based approach is an apparent over-emphasis of between-zone soil differences
    by ‘hard boundaries’ between zones (Fig. 7). These are much less evident in the
    maps of ΣNDVI (Fig. 1c-f) which, nevertheless, do reflect any effects of between-zone
    differences on the crop. Nonetheless, the ‘average’ and ‘zone-based’ maps (Fig.
    7) were used as the basis for evaluation of Eq. (2) by comparison with actual
    measurements of soil moisture made at 21 locations throughout the field (Fig.
    1a) on 7 August 2019 and 28 July 2020. Note that, whereas hitherto, all soil moisture
    data used here (probe data and for probe calibration) were expressed on a volumetric
    basis, at the 21 sampling points (Fig. 1a), at which bulk density was not determined,
    soil moisture was determined on a gravimetric basis only. However, at each soil
    moisture probe location, a strong linear relationship was evident between volumetric
    and gravimetric soil moisture. Fig. 7 Average and zone-based soil moisture maps
    at GS 31 (22 July; 68 days after sowing) in 2019 at the SA site derived from probe-specific
    maps (Fig. 5) following adjustment based on the calibration for individual probes
    against actual soil moisture for each depth at each probe location (green triangles)
    Full size image In spite of between-zone soil differences being reflected in both
    NDVI and ΣNDVI (Fig. 1c-f), at our SA site, values of R2adj for regressions of
    observed against predicted soil moisture suggest that zone-based prediction (c.f.
    Figure 7) of mid-season soil moisture was markedly better than predictions based
    on single probes (Fig. 8). They were also better than the average prediction from
    three zone-based probes (not shown). Furthermore, if a single probe-based implementation
    of Eq. (2) was used for the prediction over the whole field (i.e. all xy), it
    made no difference which one of the three available probes was used. This last
    result makes sense given that on any date, the same ΣNDVI image and values of
    ΣNP and GDD are used as input, such that a simple linear transformation reflects
    the effect of between-probe differences in the actual prediction. Similarly, given
    the close linear relationship between gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture
    at any depth, there was no difference in the accuracy of prediction between gravimetric
    or volumetric soil moisture. Fig. 8 Calibration of measures of gravimetric soil
    moisture against predictions of volumetric soil moisture at a–c the SA and d WA
    sites derived from soil moisture sensor data at either a–c 20 cm or d 30 cm depth,
    cumulative NDVI (ΣNDVI), cumulative net precipitation (ΣNP) and season growing
    degree days (GDD). a August 7, 2019, top 10 cm predicted from the sensor in zone
    1; b July 28, 2020, top 30 cm predicted from the sensor in zone 2; c both dates
    (2019, red; 2020 blue), top 10 cm using zone-based predictions derived from the
    sensors in each of zones 1–3 (Figs. 1b and 7); d 20 August, 2019, top 30 cm. In
    a, b and d, the predictions derived from sensor calibrations developed for the
    year of measurement only (c.f. Figure 3c–d). In c the prediction derived from
    calibrations developed over both years of the study combined Full size image There
    was no substantive difference in the accuracy of prediction of actual gravimetric
    soil moisture using relationships derived from either one (Fig. 3c) or two years
    of probe data (Fig. 3a, b). At the SA site, R2adj for zone-based prediction of
    soil moisture at the 21 locations in 2019 (Fig. 1a) was marginally better when
    the two-year prediction was used rather than that specific to 2019 (0.75 compared
    to 0.73 for the 0–10 cm depth; P < 0.0001 in both cases); in 2020, the season
    specific prediction was marginally better (R2adj of 0.54 and 0.56; P < 0.0001).
    Over the two years together (7 August 2019 and 28 July 2020; Fig. 8c) the two-year
    prediction was slightly better (R2adj of 0.69, P < 0.0001) than when season-specific
    predictions were used (R2adj of 0.67, P < 0.0001). However, as indicated by Fig.
    8a,b, when only a single probe was available, the accuracy of soil moisture prediction
    was generally not sufficient (R2adj of approx. 0.4) to regard the extrapolation
    method (i.e. Eq. 2) as a satisfactory alternative to direct measurement if accurate
    estimates of soil moisture status are required. In other words, in variable fields,
    multiple, zone-based probes are required. Notwithstanding the lower range of soil
    moisture variation in the typically drier, sandy, topsoils at the WA site (Fig.
    6), and that only one probe was available, the results obtained there were similar.
    However, presumably due to the lower water holding capacity at the WA site and
    the effect of evaporative demand on sandy topsoil moisture contents, a better
    prediction was obtained using probe data from 30 cm depth at this site (Fig. 8d)
    than at shallower depths (not shown), as used for the SA site (Fig. 8a–c). Discussion
    Our objective here was to see whether we could extrapolate soil moisture probe
    data away from the location of a probe, and so make it useful for dryland cereal
    growers as input to targeted (i.e. site-specific) management at the within-field
    scale. It is clear from Figs. 5 and 6 that, in general (i.e. for any probe or
    any date), variation in the estimated soil moisture content down the profile is
    considerably greater than the within-field spatial variation in soil moisture
    content at any individual depth—when within-field variation in soil moisture is
    predicted using a single probe. At a site such as our Western Australian site
    (Fig. 6), which does not exhibit marked soil variation either spatially or down
    the profile, it might therefore be concluded that being able to extrapolate soil
    moisture away from the location of a probe to other parts of a paddock may not
    inspire a targeted decision—at either GS31 or late in September—because for any
    depth, the magnitude of spatial variation in soil moisture is only a few %. The
    same conclusion might be drawn at the South Australian site (Fig. 5) if only a
    single probe were available—as is the case in most instances of soil moisture
    sensors being used by Australian dryland cereal growers. However, as both Figs.
    7 and 8 illustrate, in our SA field in which marked soil variation is apparent
    and expressed in the existence of management zones, the use of a single soil moisture
    probe may be misleading in similarly suggesting that soil moisture variation down
    the profile is greater than its spatial variation at field scale, with the latter
    more appropriately highlighted by the use of zone-based probes. We suspect that
    for reasons of cost, along with the effort required for sensor calibration against
    site conditions, data management and analysis, dryland broadacre cereal growers
    are unlikely to want to pursue zone-based use of soil moisture sensors, especially
    given the accuracy of prediction illustrated here (Fig. 8). In other words, they
    are unlikely to perceive the value of the information provided by multiple probes
    as sufficient to warrant investment in them (Bramley & Ouzman, 2019). This may
    especially be the case at drier sandier sites, such as our WA field (Fig. 6, 8d).
    In general, therefore, and notwithstanding that our method provides a means of
    extrapolating away from the location of a probe, we conclude that the primary
    value in using soil moisture sensing in most dryland cereal cropping situations
    is likely to be in comparing seasons, and in understanding differences between
    them, rather than informing a targeted decision in-season. Thus, such sensors
    assist growers in assessing how similar this year is to last year or the year
    before in terms of water availability to a crop and so enable such similarities
    or contrasts to be factored into agronomic decision-making, such as in relation
    to mid-season N management, or the ability to finish a crop. Likewise, as demonstrated
    by Colaço and Bramley (2019), they may provide critical information to enable
    value to be accrued from other sensing technologies which are otherwise hamstrung
    by their present univariate approach to agronomic decision support. Indeed, and
    in respect of N management, the over-simplification of the myriad of agronomic
    and business factors which impact on an N decision in mechanistic crop models
    is arguably a major reason why data-driven approaches to decision making using
    machine learning have recently been shown to outperform such mechanistic approaches
    (Colaço et al., 2021, 2023) and thereby deliver benefits to growers from both
    profit enhancement and error reduction perspectives (Colaço et al., 2023). Recent
    research (He et al., ) has pursued an inverse modelling approach, first attempted
    by Florin et al. (2011), for the estimation of PAWC using crop yield data, derived
    either from yield monitors or simulated using APSIM (Holzworth et al., 2015).
    This work has demonstrated that PAWC can be reliably predicted using such an approach
    and might therefore inform targeted management in broadacre cropping systems.
    Of course, it contrasts from the present study by focussing on spatial variation
    in the ‘size of the bucket’ (i.e. PAWC) rather than ‘how full the bucket is’.
    In our calibration of extrapolated against measured soil water status at the SA
    site, inclusion of a surrogate measure of PAWC provided by electromagnetic soil
    survey as a covariate did not improve prediction of soil water status, in spite
    of the results of a preliminary analysis (not shown) which suggested that the
    ECa data used as a part of the initial zone delineation (Fig. 1a), were correlated
    to PAWC. However, the integration of the present approach with that of Florin
    et al. (2011) and He et al. (2021, 2022) would enable understanding of spatial
    variation in not only the size of the bucket, but also how full the bucket is.
    Such information could indeed inform targeted agronomic decision making and is
    therefore worthy of further research. In the absence of soil modification, PAWC
    is a static variable; soil moisture status is dynamic. Two obvious significant
    limitations of the present method therefore are that it only works during the
    season (i.e. when there is measurable NDVI), and that in the absence of improved
    weather forecasting, or even an ability to predict NDVI, its utility remains limited
    by lack of knowledge as to how the season might evolve. This first of these limitations
    means that the method cannot be used to inform a sowing decision, which is a key
    area of interest for growers. Whilst the second limitation can be partially overcome
    by continual updating of ΣNDVI and weather data, the ability to predict a dry
    finish, which may render a targeted mid-season decision worthless, remains elusive.
    It is for these kinds of reasons that alternative approaches to so-called ‘now-casting’
    (Wimalathunge & Bishop, 2023) are the subject of much current effort. That of
    Wimalathunge and Bishop (2019) draws on the integration of water balance modelling
    with soil and weather information. It is currently limited by the resolution of
    available soil information (Han et al., 2022), and to support targeted decision-making,
    is likely reliant on farmers paying for bespoke digital soil maps of their farms
    at high spatial resolution (Wimalathunge & Bishop, 2023). The cost of these therefore
    makes the approach of He et al. (2021, 2022), perhaps combined with the present
    approach, an attractive one. Whilst the utility of ‘now-casting’ is likely to
    remain somewhat constrained by inability to predict the future, understanding
    how much soil water is available in real time, is clearly valuable for risk management
    (Monjardino et al., 2015). Overall, the integration of the present approach with
    those of He et al. (2021, 2022) and Wimalathunge and Bishop (2019, 2023), as multivariate
    input to a machine learning-based, data-driven tool (Colaço et al., 2021, 2023;
    Lawes et al., 2019; Richetti et al., 2023) may offer the best way forward. Finally,
    we note that both the development and evaluation of our method was confined to
    fields in which wheat or barley was grown. Whilst the performance of other crops
    such as canola, lentils or lupins is also known to be reflected by NDVI, additional
    work will be required to evaluate the method for these crops if there is interest
    in using it when such crops are being grown. Similarly, exploration of the method
    for use in irrigated systems across a range of cereal and horticultural crops
    may well be of value. Conclusions Using cumulative NDVI, season growing degree
    days and cumulative net precipitation as covariates, extrapolation of soil moisture
    probe data to any location within a field on any day within a growing season is
    possible. However, the utility of being able to do this is of questionable value
    to farmers interested in targeted variable rate management, both in fields with
    limited soil variation, and also in those with well defined soil zones, but which
    do not have a probe in each zone. Accordingly, the main benefit of soil moisture
    sensors to dryland cereal growers is likely confined to better understanding seasonal
    variation in soil moisture and its implications for differential management between
    different cropping seasons. However, greater value from such technology may accrue
    through integration with other approaches to better understanding field scale
    variation in soil moisture. Data availability Since this work was conducted on
    private farms, the data are not being made publicly available. However, the authors
    will consider reasonable requests for access to the data, subject also to the
    permission of the collaborating farmers. References ASRIS (2011). Australian Soil

    Humidity sensorGraphene oxideQuick responseHuman body sensing 1. Introduction
    Humidity sensors are widely used in industry, agriculture, medical care, and household
    appliances [1], [2]. Over the years, various types of humidity sensors have been
    developed. To meet the needs of practical applications, these sensors are required
    to have a high sensitivity, wide humidity detection range, and fast response.
    High-speed humidity sensors are essential for some special fields, such as aerospace,
    respiratory monitoring, chemical reactions, precision instruments, which require
    dynamic real-time monitoring of humidity. The development of new sensing principles
    [3] and moisture-sensitive materials [4], [5], [6] have significantly improved
    the sensitivity and the detection range of humidity sensors. However, it remains
    a great challenge to shorten their response time and recovery time. The response
    time and recovery time of the most humidity sensors are difficult to be less than
    1 s at the same time [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. According to different humidity
    sensing signal conversion mechanisms, the humidity sensors can be mainly divided
    into resistance, capacitance, impedance, voltage, quartz crystal microbalance
    (QCM), and surface acoustic wave (SAW). Resistance humidity sensor with direct-current
    (DC) working mode is widely studied because of its simple processing circuit [13],
    [14], [15]. Up to now, many kinds of humidity sensing materials have been reported
    to fabricate humidity sensors, mainly including cellulose paper, carbon materials,
    polymers, two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene, oxides, and their composites.
    Duan et al. [11] selected the natural nanomaterials of halloysite nanotubes (HNTs)
    to prepare impedance-type humidity sensors. The response time was about 0.7 s,
    and the recovery time was about 57 s. The impedance variation of the HNTs humidity
    sensor is five orders of magnitude within the humidity range from 0 % to 91.5
    % RH at the optimum working frequency (100 Hz). Na et al. [12] synthesized Sm2O3
    nanoflowers with hierarchical structure. The unique hierarchical structure could
    provide more active sites, which is beneficial for the adsorption and desorption
    of water molecules. By compounding with KCl, the KCl/Sm2O3 composite demonstrated
    enhanced humidity sensitivity and rapid response on account of that the introduced
    K+ and Cl- could participate in the conduction process. The impedance-type humidity
    sensor based on KCl/Sm2O3 showed extremely high response value of 127,121 with
    a response time of 0.1 s and a recovery time of 21 s at 11 %−95 % RH. Zhao et
    al. [19] designed a hyaluronic acid (HA)-induced crumpling of Nb2CTx nanosheet
    to construct hydrogen bond conduction network, and applied it for fast humidity
    sensing based on primary battery. The Nb2CTx/HA primary battery-based humidity
    sensor (PBHS) exhibied outstanding response and recovery speed (15.1 s and 3.4
    s at 72.0 % RH), high response (0.7 V), and low hysteresis (3.6 % RH). However,
    the response time and recovery time of most humidity sensors are difficult to
    be less than 1 s at the same time [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23],
    [24]. Graphene oxide (GO) is a green, biocompatible, solution-processable, and
    mass producible nanomaterial [25]. GO contains abundant oxygen-containing functional
    groups, which are highly hydrophilic [26] and can efficiently capture water molecules.
    In addition, interactions between the oxygen-containing functional groups and
    water molecules will rapidly change the conductivity of GO [27]. Therefore, the
    GO is an excellent candidate for humidity sensitive materials. Wu [28] et al.
    developed a GO -based humidity sensor by dropping GO aqueous solution on micro
    interfinger electrode, which displays ultrahigh sensitivity (124/% RH), fast response
    time (3 s) and wide detection range (8–95 % RH) at room temperature. Ghosh [29]
    et al. prepared a fast-response humidity sensor by drop-casting GO on patterned
    gold electrodes, with the response time of 5 s and the recovery time of 6 s. Due
    to the large proton conduction of GO, the sensor response varied from ∼180 times
    (40 % RH) to ∼1200 times (88 % RH). Liu et al. [10] demonstrated a simple and
    cost-effective approach using laser induced graphene (LIG) on a polyimide film
    to prepare highly sensitive and fast-response flexible humidity sensors. The LIG
    humidity sensor exhibits a 28,231-fold increase in current when the relative humidity
    changes from 26.1 to 90.2 %,and it also shows ultrashort response/recovery times
    (0.5/7 s). Most of the GO-based humidity sensors show excellent sensing performance,
    and thedifference in device structure and GO material specifications arethe key
    factor affecting sensing performance. In this paper, GO is used as the humidity-sensitive
    material. The GO material and the device configuration have been synergisticallytailored
    toachieve fast response and recovery. Both the response and recovery time of the
    prepared sensor is less than 1 s in the 10 %–95 % RH range. In terms of moisture-sensitive
    material, highly oxidized, monolayer and large-size GO sheets were used as the
    moisture-sensitive material. The oxygen-containing groups increase with degree
    of oxidation of graphene. The increased oxygen-containing groups will provide
    more adsorption sites for water molecules. Compared with bilayer GO and multilayer
    GO, single-layer GO have the largest specific surface area, which is conducive
    to increasing the sensitivity per unit volume. The average size of the GO sheet
    is more than 40 μm, which is more than twice the electrode spacing (20 μm) of
    the sensor. This means that a single GO sheet is sufficient to connect two electrodes,
    which is beneficial to improve the carrier transport efficiency. In terms of device
    configuration, an ultra-thin GO film with a thickness of 300 nm was optimized
    by controlling the concentration and the volume of the drop-casting GO dispersion.
    Meanwhile, the electrode spacing of the sensor is designed to be only 20 μm. As
    a result, the volume of the effective moisture-sensitive film between the two
    electrodes is as small as 15.3 × 10-3 mm3. The smaller moisture-sensitive region
    can quickly reach the saturated adsorption of water molecules, which is the key
    to achieve fast response of the sensor. Furthermore, the high sensitivity of the
    sensor enabled it to effectively detect humidity changes caused by human breath
    and the proximity of human fingers. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Preparation of
    single-layer GO aqueous dispersions A single-layer GO slurry was purchased from
    Hangzhou Gaoxi Technology (China) at a concentration of 10 mg/g in water. The
    proportion of single-layer GO was greater than 99 %, and the average size of single-layer
    GO sheets was 40 µm. The GO slurry was ultrasonically dispersed in deionized water
    to obtain single-layer GO aqueous dispersion, the concentrations of which were
    adjusted by changing the volume ratio of the slurry and deionized water. Single-layer
    aqueous GO dispersions with concentrations of 0.8 mg/mL, 1.2 mg/mL, and 2.4 mg/mL
    were respectively prepared for subsequent drop-casting. 2.2. Device preparation
    Parallel gold electrodes approximately 100 nm thick and separated by a 20 μm channel
    were deposited on a quartz substrate using vacuum thermal evaporation with shadow
    masks. Single-layer GO dispersions with different concentrations were coated on
    electrodes by drop-casting. After 12 h of natural drying, conductive silver adhesive
    was used to connect a copper wire to each electrode. A schematic diagram of the
    device structure is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (55KB)

    humidity sensor. 2.3. Characterization of GO thin films The elemental composition
    and the oxygen-containing groups of the GO thin film were identified using an
    X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Britain) with monochromatic Al
    Kα X-ray radiation as the source type. Defects in the GO structure was characterized
    using a laser confocal Raman microscope (inVia Qontor, Renishaw, United Kingdom)
    with a laser wavelength of 532 nm and a laser power of 0.02 mW. The thickness
    and morphology of the thin films were examined using an atomic force microscope
    (MultiMode 8, Bruker, USA) and optical microscope (BX53M, Olympus, Japan), respectively.
    2.4. Humidity-sensing performance test system The humidity response tests were
    carried out at room temperature of 22C in a humidity range from 10 % RH to 95
    % RH. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the measurement system. The injection
    pump controlled the volume and speed of water feeding to the humidity generator.
    The humidity generator is equipped with a heater for the production of water vapor.
    In the humidity generator, the water vapor is fully mixed with nitrogen gas from
    a compressed nitrogen cylinder. By adjusting the injection pump rate and the compressed
    nitrogen flow, the humidity generator was able to output a stable gas with required
    humidity. The humidity value of the gas was calibrated using a commercial humidity
    sensor (AR847+, SMART SENSOR, China). The sensor was placed in an airtight test
    chamber, and was connected to a Keithley 2410 source meter (Tektronix, OR, USA)
    by copper wires to measure the resistance of the sensor as a function of humidity.
    A constant bias voltage of −1 V was applied to the sensor throughout the measurement
    process. The data was recorded using KickStart instrument control software (Tektronix,
    OR, USA). Download : Download high-res image (118KB) Download : Download full-size

    thin films Fig. 3(a) is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the GO sheets
    provided by Hangzhou Gaoxi Technology Ltd., indicating that the average size of
    the GO sheets is greater than 40 m. Fig. 3(b) shows an atomic force microscope
    image of the GO thin film formed by dropping 8 µL of a 1.2 mg/mL GO dispersion
    onto the quartz substrate. The GO thin film was dense and continuous, with an
    average thickness of approximately 300 nm showed in Fig. 3(c). Fig. S1 shows optical
    microscope images of the GO thin film. The film was very thin and almost transparent.

    the white rectangular area in panel (b). 3.2. Raman spectra of the GO thin film
    Raman spectroscopy can be used to characterize graphene defects, which generally
    include marginal defects, sp3 defects, and vacancy defects [30], [31]. Raman spectra
    of the GO film (Fig. S2) exhibited prominent characteristic peaks at 1354 and
    1607 cm−1 corresponding to the D and G bands, respectively. The generation of
    D band involves the scattering information of incident photons by defects.Therefore,the
    D band intensity (ID) reflects the amount of disorder in the graphene. The G band
    is generated by the stretching motion of sp2 atom pairs in the carbon ring. The
    G band intensity (IG) is related to the highly ordered carbon network of the graphite
    plane [32]. The intensity ratio of ID/IG is a directly related to the number of
    graphene defects [33]. The ID/IG value of 1.014 indicates that the graphene contained
    a considerable number of lattice defects and was highly disordered [34]. Since
    the defects and the disorder mainly come from the oxidation reaction of graphene,
    the large ratio of ID to IG indirectly indicates the high degree of oxidation
    of graphene. 3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of GO thin films X-ray photoelectron
    spectra of the GO thin films is shown in Fig. 4. The main elements in the GO thin
    film are carbon and oxygen, containing 66.69 % at.% C1s and 28.12 at.% O1s,with
    a carbon-to-oxygen atom ratio of 2.37. This indicated that the GO had a high oxygen
    content. These oxygen elements all come from oxygen-containing groups produced
    by oxidation reaction of the graphene, further confirming the high degree of oxidation
    of graphene. Peak-fitting analysis enabled the determination of the types of oxygen-containing
    groups, as shown in Fig. 4(b) and (c). The C1s spectrum of GO identified four
    functional groups: CH/CC (≈284.76 eV), OCO (≈286.72 eV), CO (≈288.02 eV), and
    OCO (≈288.94 eV). The O1s spectrum identified three functional groups: C–OH (≈530.9
    eV), OCOH (≈532.1 eV), and OCO (≈533.2 eV). Download : Download high-res image

    parameters The response and the response speed are important parameters to evaluate
    the performance of a humidity sensor. The response of the humidity sensor is defined
    as the ratio of the electrical value of the sensor at a specific RH to the reference
    RH [35]: (1) where R0 and RRH denote the sensor resistances at dry air (6 % RH)
    and other specific RH, respectively. The evaluation of the response speed includes
    two parameters: response time and recovery time. Defining ΔR as the change of
    the sensor resistance between a dry environment and a certain relative humidity
    environment, the response time and the recovery time are the time consumption
    between resistance of 0.1ΔR and 0.9ΔR measured at the rising and falling edges
    of the sensor response, respectively. 3.4.2. Effect of GO dispersion concentration
    on humidity-sensing performance To study the influence of the GO dispersion concentration
    on sensor performance, aqueous dispersions of single-layer GO with concentrations
    of 0.8, 1.2, and 2.4 mg/mL were prepared. An identical volume (8 µL) of each dispersion
    was dropped on the channel between two separated parallel electrodes. GO thin
    films were formed after 12 h of natural drying. The humidity-sensing performance
    was tested at 50 % RH, as shown in Fig. 5. For the sensor based on a 0.8 mg/mL
    GO dispersion, the response and recovery times were 0.32 s and 0.49 s, respectively,
    and the response was 110.1 %. Higher GO dispersion concentrations resulted in
    a higher response but longer sensor response time. For the sensor fabricated using
    1.2 mg/mL GO dispersion, the response and recovery time were 0.49 s and 0.65 s,
    respectively, and the response was 120.06 %. For the sensor fabricated using 2.4
    mg/mL dispersion, the response and recovery times were extended to 0.81 s and
    1.14 s, respectively, and the response increased to 124.44 %. A greater number
    of oxygen-containing groups in the GO thin film provides more adsorption sites
    for water molecules, so it takes longer to saturate the adsorption sites. However,
    adsorption of more water molecules increases the magnitude of ΔR, thus improving
    the sensor response. Fig. 5 shows that the sensor based on 1.2 mg/mL GO dispersion
    resulted in both a large response and fast speed. In view of the excellent humidity-sensing
    performance, the subsequent experiments were based on 1.2 mg/mL GO dispersion
    to prepare the sensor. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download : Download

    humidity (RH) from 6 % to 50 %. Sensors were prepared using aqueous dispersions
    of single-layer GO at concentrations of (a) 0.8 mg/mL, (b) 1.2 mg/mL, and (c)
    2.4 mg/mL, respectively. 3.4.3. Humidity sensing performance Fig. 6(a) shows the
    time-resolved dynamic response of the sensor based on GO dispersion of 1.2 mg/mL
    at 10 %–95 % RH. The resistance of the sensor increases with the increase of humidity.
    The performance of the sensors under different humidity conditions is summarized
    as shown in Fig. 6(b). Both the response and recovery time of the sensor is less
    than 1 s in the 10 %–95 % RH range. At 10 % RH, the sensor achieved the fastest
    response time of 0.33 s. The response value increases monotonously with the increase
    of RH. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6(c), the humidity sensor follows a polynomial
    fitting response in the full humidity range (10–95 % RH). To assess the long-term
    stability of the sensor, the resistance of the sensor at 50 % RH was tracked every
    15 days for two months. As shown in Fig. 6(d), there was no obvious change in
    resistance, indicating that the performance of the sensor is stable. Download

    of previously reported humidity sensors [36], achieving the fastest response among
    all the reportedresistive humidity sensors. Table 1. Performance comparison of

    other gases in air on humidity sensing, we carried out humidity response experiments
    with high-purity nitrogen gas and synthetic air as carrier gas respectively. The
    humidity sensor showed similar response to humidity in synthetic air compared
    with high-purity nitrogen gas as carrier gas, and the results are shown in Fig.
    S3. 3.4.4. Humidity response mechanism The voltage-current (I-V) characteristics
    of the sensor, measured in voltage sweep mode, at different humidity levels are
    shown in Fig. 7. The characteristic curves show that the I-V characteristics were
    nonlinear regardless of the ambient humidity, indicating that the contact between
    the GO film and the gold electrode was not ohmic. This is because that GO possesses
    P-type conductive behavior due to the presence of C-O bonding. Oxygen plays a
    role in p-type doping of GO, because oxygen atoms tend to pull and hold electrons,
    leading to the formation of holes in the graphitic network [45], [46]. Thus, a
    Schottky contact is formed between the GO film and the gold electrode. Furthermore,
    the I–V characteristics showed that the sensor current decreased as the humidity
    increased, that is, the resistance of the sensor increases with the increase of
    humidity. The microscopic mechanism is as follows: The GO film has a large number
    of hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups, which can easily trap water molecules,
    and then these water molecules act as donors of electrons [47] to recombine with
    holes in the P-type GO film, resulting in a decrease of holes the concentration
    in the GO film. This ultimately manifested as an increase in the resistance of
    the sensor. Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download : Download full-size

    levels. 3.4.5. Humidity monitoring related to human activities Many human activities
    are accompanied by humidity changes. A rapid-response humidity sensor can monitor
    these changes and thus be used for dynamic monitoring of health. Fig. 8 presents
    the response of the sensor to humidity changes caused by human breath and finger
    proximity. As shown in Fig. 8(a), due to the evaporation of sweat the proximity
    offinger will cause slight increase of the ambient humidity near the sensor, leading
    to an increase in the sensor resistance. When the finger was subsequently moved
    away, the ambient humidity near the sensor decreased to the initial value, resulting
    in a decrease in the sensor resistance to its initial value. More strikingly,
    the sensor was sensitive enough to measure the distance between the finger and
    the sensor, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Changing the distance between the finger and
    the sensor yielded commensurate changes in the sensor resistance, that is, the
    smaller distances resulteed in the larger resistance changes. Therefore, this
    sensor could be used in intelligent human sensing systems. Fig. 8(c) shows the
    dynamic response of the sensor to changes in humidity caused by rapid breathing
    of the human body. The rate of fast breathing is about 36 times per minute. The
    response performance of the humidity sensor can satisfy the monitoring of human
    breathing state. Exhalation caused an increase in ambient humidity, resulting
    in an increase in sensor resistance. Conversely, inhalation decreased the ambient
    humidity, leading to a decrease in sensor resistance. Furthermore, the sensor
    could monitor and recognize the depth of breathing. As shown in Fig. 8(d), small
    resistance changes can be tracked in response to shallow breathing and vice versa.
    This sensor could therefore be used to monitor respiratory abnormalities. The
    above results show that our GO-based humidity sensor yields both fast response
    and high response and shows great application potential in respiration monitoring
    and non-contact human sensing. Download : Download high-res image (475KB) Download

    a resistive humidity sensor based on ultra-thin GO films formed by drop-casting
    single-layer GO dispersion. The concentration of the GO dispersion had a large
    effect on the humidity-sensing performance. The higher dispersion concentrations
    will result in longer response and recovery time but higher response. The sensor
    based on GO dispersion of 1.2 mg/mL exhibited both fast response and high response
    in the 10 %−95 % RH range. To our knowledge, the response and recovery time of
    this sensor (<1 s) are the shortest compared to those of reported GO-based resistive
    humidity sensors. Moreover, the sensor was sensitive enough to accurately measureits
    distance from a human finger and the depth of human breathing. We believe that
    this work provides a new approach for the development of humidity sensors with
    rapid response and high response. CRediT authorship contribution statement Junyi

    Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction India is the world''s largest producer of sugar,
    fruits, and jute and also the largest manufacturer of 25% overall production.
    The extremely familiar types of disease attacks on plants’ leaves are alternative
    of viruses and fungoid diseases. As for proper growth of plants and crops, the
    geographical conditions are required 15–20 °C for spraying time, and 20–26 °C
    for maturing and picking with rainfall around 75–100 cm. The growing rate of population
    and advanced conditions of climate also cause harm to plant diseases. Now, the
    main cultivation in India is groundnut, cotton, fish, species, livestock, etc.
    For this, various methods of cultivation have been used like livestock farming,
    arable farming, nomadic farming, sustainable farming, and mixed farming. Livestock
    farming is best for employment and waste which gets activated by animals is used
    as natural manure for the maintenance of soil fertility as agriculture enables
    a large number of quantities of grains and other foodstuffs, and arable farming
    is used for the production of crops that include various types of crops from the
    growth of plants it also produces an extensive range of yearly crops the annual
    crops means total life cycle of the crops from germination to grain production
    enclosed by 12 months. Nomadic farming is a type of primary sustainable farming,
    nomadic live in arid and semiarid parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in Africa
    nomadic herd cattle, goats, sheep, camels, and other animals managed by nomadic
    including horses, mux-oxen, yaks; mixed farming is used to involve growing crops
    and raise of livestock. Thus, pesticides take an essential role in the production
    of food and the pesticide industry had done contribution in 2018 of over 6.75
    billion and the Indian industry cultivated 9%, the investment is evaluated at
    16.7 million. Although there are various types of pesticides used in farming like
    rodenticides larvicides, overuse of fertilizers and pesticides affects soil organisms
    that are similar to humans overworked with antibiotics. For example, plants may
    depend on different types of microorganisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into
    nitrates, which plants can use. As per the Indian government, 40% land about 150
    billion corrupted. As in agricultural generation, 25% of land gets degraded and
    the soil carbon, nitrous oxide exists the atmosphere. Once there, they can infect
    plants and animals ranging from favorable microorganisms, insects, fish, and birds.
    The detection can be done by using plants leaf, temperature, gas sensor, humidity,
    and soil moisture readings will be received from the sensors. Now, in the advanced
    period of agriculture epoch of Industry 4.0 faces many objections, and IoT with
    automation is used for the fulfillment of “Automatic disease detection to monitor
    the plant health for various plants leaf using image processing techniques and
    TensorFlow algorithm.” 1.1 Literature Review The apple leaf disease affects the
    yields of apples; they show a detecting process in real time and a deep learning
    approach on CNN detection of leaves of brown spots, gray spots, and mosaics [1].
    In this paper, they have discussed and used the technology of bacteria foraging
    algorithm, image segmentation, and neural network. The image processing is done
    for processing of leaf images by using methods like soft computing and conventional
    method [2]. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus on growth and development of blast
    resistance is used and examined all rice types which were sensitive root colonization
    by AM fungus [3]. This paper shows plant detection of disease in real time that
    is affected using a convolutional neural network for appropriate fertilizers spread
    on the damaged portion of plants. For improving the accuracy of the system, they
    have used a TensorFlow framework; the accuracy is increased by up to 95%. The
    remaining area infected by diseases is calculated by k-means algorithm [3]. In
    this paper, they show the detection of diseases that affect various plants by
    using image processing techniques. As commonly we know farmers spray pesticides
    on the plants but also affect humans directly and indirectly through health issues
    or any other [4]. This paper uses the technology of ML and processing of image
    to allow the viral disease from the snaps of leaf, and this method identifies
    the injury of potato leaf disease. Their segmentation approaches the utilization
    by using multiclass SVM [5]. The algorithm has used deep learning network for
    detection of tobacco plants in photos captured by using unmanned aerial vehicles.
    This algorithm has three stages the primary stage with morphological and watershed
    segmentation, the second is convolutional neural network is assembled and train
    with tobacco plant region and the third part is post-processing are performed
    to discard the non-tobacco plant [6]. This paper uses forest in identifying plant
    disease between healthy and disease plants for extracting the features of the
    image. This is used by using the trained dataset to detect the virus by using
    ML technology [7]. They have used a data augmentation technique that has been
    used to do the deviation of the leaf photos in dataset. As they have also used
    the CNN model for image classification, the accuracy is 98.56% [8]. This paper
    shows about image detector and the resource-constrained using a convolutional
    network implemented in a low-cost, platform to perform the types of plant infection
    [9]. In this paper, they discussed current trends and challenges for plant leaf
    disease using deep learning method using a k-means clustering algorithm [10].
    This paper shows the present surveys on current techniques and prediction models
    for the validation and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases based on image processing
    and the IoT for the verification and various types of tomato plant diseases [7].
    They show leaf diseases that can be effectively used to detect the leaves of plants
    but the unhealthy plants that we get are unbalanced that’s why it is difficult
    to detect the diseases from the unhealthy plant''s dataset for solving this they
    have used double GAN to generate higher-resolution pictures of unhealthy plants
    leaf using samples [11]. 2 Methodology First of all, the robot system will start
    activating and it will move into the farm for taking photos; it will check the
    height of plants; if it''s too low, then the mechanism will spray the fertilizers
    for the proper growth of plants; if the height is proper, then it will again go
    for taking photos for detection of insects on plants; if any parasitic detected,
    then it will spray pesticides on the affected portion of plants and send alert
    message to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Flowchart for prototype device Full size
    image Algorithm Used for Plants Disease Detection: TensorFlow: It is a library
    of Python language used for rapid arithmetic calculations, and it can also create
    models of hierarchical learning exactly. This model detects leaf spot diseases
    and also predicts healthy leaves. The TensorFlow algorithm also uses a neural
    network for training the image classification model. The TensorFlow should be
    run on single central processing unit as well as on graphic processing unit and
    mobile devices. The used dataset is used in training and testing of dataset 1000
    from that 700 images of plants are used for training and remaining 300 images
    are uses for testing. The dataset is identified across the model for the procedure
    of building to escape overfitting. The tested dataset is independent for the training
    set. The test dataset is used to identify the performance of model or accuracy
    of model, and the images of plants classify leaves based on the below parts: Healthful
    part: In this case, the plants’ leaves are healthy and show no symptoms of bacteria
    or infections of any kind (change in color, of leaves, etc.) Bacteria part: In
    this, the bacterial spots are identified, and therefore, the system gives alert
    message to farmer. Viral part: In this case, the color of leaves gets changed
    due to DNA virus that’s why it changes the color. Late Blight part: In this part,
    the harmful plants infection especially affects rice. 2.1 Block Diagram Figure
    2 shows systematic diagram for the observation of farms as the Esp32 module is
    used to collect all data from sensors like LDR. Various sensors are used in the
    farm like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and gas sensor. As temperature
    sensor is useful while growing the crops which needs wet and dry climatic conditions,
    the temperature sensor measures the presence of heat energy of the soil and also
    determines whether it is good for plants growth. If the temperature rises high
    in the farm, then it causes erosion to the cultivation of yields. If temperature
    is too low on the farm, then it decreases the plant''s enzymes and it causes to
    stunt growth or may cause it to die. The humidity sensor is used for controlling
    and monitoring [12] the humidity as well as the air temperature of the farm. As
    if humidity arises high, then plants get to die and crops get fail. If it arises
    low, then the growth of plants takes more time for the growth and smaller leaves
    get to drop off and the quality of plants is not so good. The moisture sensor
    is used for the capacity of water level of soil and also for good irrigation management
    which gives better crops and increases the profit of the farmer as well as the
    land; if the moisture level is too low in the farm, then plants may not mature
    and they may die. So for the betterment of crops and plants, normally 21–40% of
    moisture level is required. The gas sensor is used on the farm for how much amount
    of gas is present in the farm and environment or if anyone tries to spread petroleum
    in the farm at that time this sensor senses it and gives an alert message to the
    farmer; due to this, our farm can be saved due to unwanted gas spread. The DC
    motor is used in the farm as it plays a necessary part in the farm for scanning
    plants vertically and horizontally for the detection and monitoring of the plant''s
    health if the disease gets detected the LCD will display all the desired conditions.
    And servomotor is used for spraying the pesticides on the affected portion of
    the plant this mechanism is inserted in the robot if any insect is detected, then
    the mechanism will start and spray the pesticides. The water pump is used if the
    moisture of the soil gets low, then water pump will start by triggering the relay.
    If moisture level is too high, then off the water pump. Thus, all the data will
    be sent to on new technology of Blynk cloud to show the data in real time and
    a power supply is provided to all the sensors for proper working and giving the
    results. As in greenhouse automation [13], they used the old Blynk technology
    for controlling the greenhouse system including soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of observing farmland Full size image 3 Design
    Implementation The working implementation consists of various parts, processing
    which is defined below: A. Collection of Dataset The analysis depends on the detection
    of affected leaf; [14] I have collected a dataset from an agricultural institution.
    This dataset has images of various disease-affected plants [15] . I organized
    to collect pictures of various types of infection indication. They are apple black
    dots, grape spot, maize gray dots, tomato mosaic virus, and peach bacterial spot
    [16]. One of the most frequent diseases is in apple plants which may be increased
    by fungi. Podosphaera leucotricha is the black spot as its name shows with black
    spots seen on the surface of the leaves. Grape leaf spot shows about fungus Phomopsis
    viticola, and maximal is determined the most critical disease of grapes [17].
    Gray spot on corn results on top side. Yellow spots are viewed on another side
    of white disease wrapping the inner part of a leaf. Tomato mosaic virus is mostly
    known as plant pathogenic [18]. The number of images collected from diseases is
    shown in the table (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Fig. 3 Table on plants diseases Full size
    image Fig. 4 Various leaves [19] affected by unwanted pesticides Full size image
    Fig. 5 Boxplot on the affected area of the plants (leaf) Full size image 4 Future
    Scope It is used in the animal shed for monitoring domestic animals. It will help
    the farmers to do work in any season and conditions [20, 21] . It reduces the
    time consumed in spraying the pesticides [22]. It works very effectively, and
    it will reduce the danger to farmers [23] from different breathing and physical
    problems. This model is used for the detection of various types of plants disease
    [24]. This system is used for multiple types of plants health and disease. 5 Conclusion
    The agriculture field needs automation in large amounts to make the human work
    easy, [25] and the agriculture [26] hanging robot [27] has been designed for monitoring
    the farm weather (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and also plants health;
    thus, system will go detection of insects [28] if any found the system will spray
    pesticides only on the affected portion of plants. By using this technology, there
    will be less time consumed and I can protect the farm as well as plants from unwanted
    pesticides. This proposed model is designed for the detection and quality of leaves
    by using different types of sensors like temperature, humidity, gas sensor, and
    soil moisture sensor. The purpose device is used whether the device is healthy
    or diseased. 6 Software Testing See Figs. 6, 7, and 8. Fig. 6 Monitoring the farm
    by using Blynk cloud Full size image Fig. 7 Blynk app results in real time Full
    size image Fig. 8 Visuino results for temperature and humidity Full size image
    7 Hardware Testing Figure 9 shows the output results of the farm on LCD as ESP32
    is the controller module of IoT as to help the farmers and send the data on cloud.
    In this project, I have used various sensors like DHT11, gas sensor also soil
    moisture; apart from these, I have also used water pumps for the proper nourishment
    of crops health. Although these all sensors have been used for monitoring, the
    farm and sensors give values on LCD in real-time mode [29, 30] . Thus, the proposed
    system also gives suggestion to the farmers for the betterment of farm and how
    to get rid of plants diseases by applying the appropriate amount of fertilizers
    and pesticides. Fig. 9 Output results of the farm on LCD Full size image References

    paper PDF 1 Introduction The majority of individuals can profit from advanced
    technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) has just started to play a big role
    in daily life, giving us more ways to sense our surroundings and letting us change
    them. IoT is used both to figure out field conditions and to manage them, especially
    in the agro-industrial and environmental fields [1] Additionally, it can tell
    the customer about the origins and characteristics of the product. It may be used
    to assess field factors including soil quality, weather, and animal or plant biomass
    [2]. It can also be used to keep an eye on and control things like temperature,
    humidity, vibrations, and shocks while a product is being shipped. WSN may also
    be used to track and manage variables that affect crop output and growth [3].
    They may also be used to manage machinery, find the best solution for a certain
    situation, find the best time to harvest, and more. In this study, we concentrate
    on information on soil moisture, humidity, and temperature in agricultural fields.
    We need a place to store the data, a way to get information out of the data over
    time, a way to connect with the user, and a way to water the plants. A database
    structure will be created to make decisions about the autonomous irrigation of
    plants [4]. Techniques for collecting, analyzing, and controlling data in real
    time improve operational efficiency, increase productivity, and reduce water waste
    [5]. This research highlighted the usage of the Internet of Things for smart farming
    and how different sensors can be used to make automated irrigation systems. An
    automated smart irrigation system was developed. 2 Literature Review A smart gadget
    developed by [6] can measure the temperature, pH, and moisture content of the
    soil in diverse places. An ANN model is then used to examine this data. The automated
    irrigation system developed by [7] was an attempt to develop an effective technique
    for producing agricultural crop operations [8]. A working model of an automated
    sprinkler system has been developed using an Arduino Microcontroller for monitoring
    soil moisture and relative humidity. Current issues and the implementation of
    Smart Agriculture Systems Based on the Internet of Things are discussed [9]. Madhav
    et al. [10] has investigated the machine learning technique and IoT in agriculture.
    These aid in gathering data for farmer management systems. While [11] has concentrated
    on estimating production measures for vegetable crops employing a fuzzy-logic
    control system, Upadhya et al. [12] has evaluated the development of smart IoT
    devices for agriculture applications. The output parameters are the precise crop-yielding
    values, while the input variables are humidity, temperature, and soil moisture.
    For the purpose of identifying undesirable plants on crops, Dasgupta et al. [13]
    has conducted research on a mix of IoT devices, WSN, and AI algorithms. Deep learning
    techniques and a drone have been used to capture data. The notion of an intelligent
    irrigation system was developed by [14] who concentrated on an IoT-based irrigation
    system for monitoring the rice crop field using various sensors. IoT-enabled smart
    drip irrigation system’s experimental performance employing web-based apps by
    [15]. Design and execution of a portable watering system that is solar-powered
    and IoT-enabled [16] Design and execution of a portable watering system that is
    solar-powered and IoT-enabled. Design and implementation of an IoT-based wastewater
    irrigation system [17]. This low-cost platform may assist manufacturers, governments,
    and farmers in forecasting environmental data over geographically expansive farm
    field, which improves crop yield and farm man—agreement in a timely and affordable
    way. The unique integration of IoT sensors with the drone in the obtained experimental
    findings implies that automatic and human-made sets of actions may be implemented
    and/or proposed. These smart efforts support precision agriculture, which significantly
    boosts agricultural output and preserves natural resources [18]. A framework for
    tracking and monitoring smart crops is presented in this research. Big data analytics,
    mobile apps, Internet of Things cameras, and sensors are all addressed. An Arduino
    Uno, a number of sensors, and a Wi-Fi module make up the hardware. As a result
    of this approach, the least amount of agricultural waste is produced while utilizing
    energy most efficiently. This article suggests a framework for agricultural disease
    identification. SVM classification is used for this. On the basis of previously
    existing soil data for a specific site, it recognizes disease in crops and recommends
    relevant pesticides [19]. The main objective of this research is to suggest a
    method for autonomously irrigating farms employing sensors that measure soil moisture
    in agricultural fields. Using buzzers and passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors,
    farmland may be secured to prevent animal encroachment. For crop health monitoring,
    a Raspberry Pi camera is employed [20]. In this study, a smart irrigation control
    system is installed using a customized Internet of Things (IoT) system for monitoring
    agricultural areas and properly utilizing water resources. Sensors are positioned
    in the agricultural field where the crop is cultivated in order to sense several
    characteristics, including soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and rainfall.
    A cloud infrastructure is used to store sensed data. Using a mobile application,
    it is possible to manually switch the motor pump between the ON and OFF states
    from a distance [3]. In order to estimate irrigation system water requirements
    and achieve sustainability, this work blends IoT, machine learning, and transfer
    learning methodologies. The key conclusion of this research is that it decreased
    water use and transferred prediction model characteristics in exchange for more
    accurate forecasting and analysis. IoT sensor devices gather fundamental data,
    including wetness, temperature, and humidity. With the help of meteorological
    and historical data, the total amount required for overall cultivation was projected
    and estimated in the short and long terms [21]. The study discusses smart agricultural
    and irrigation systems based on IOT. This paper’s main goal is to automate the
    watering of plants. This research enables us to understand the values of many
    factors for plants, such as humidity, moisture, and temperature, and to water
    them appropriately. Three sensors make up the system, which measures the humidity,
    wetness, and temperature of plants. The motor automatically turns on the water
    for plants if any of the variables drop. The tomato plant was success fully grown
    on the paper using an automated procedure. We were able to have a healthy farming
    operation because of this practice and the Internet of Things [22]. This review
    explores case studies on climate monitoring, greenhouse automation, crop management,
    cattle monitoring, and smart farming using IoT devices, highlighting the benefits
    of these techniques in agriculture over pre-existing tools [23]. The goal of this
    work was to examine existing information about the volumetric soil water content
    (VSWC) concept and electromagnetic sensor monitoring for irrigation control. In
    the context of the Internet of Things, capacitance, impedance, and the more dependable
    TDR sensors are examined for aiding automated irrigation [24]. 3 IOT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture The work that has already been done on smart sensors for
    agriculture applications is discussed in this section. The uses of sensors in
    animal husbandry, soil, irrigation, crop disease, and harvesting are then covered
    [25]. IoT applications in smart agriculture are discussed below (see Fig. 1).
    Fig. 1 Internet of Things-based smart agriculture applications Full size image
    3.1 Soil Health Monitoring An important factor in increasing agricultural product
    production is soil health. Monitoring the health of soil with sensors has made
    the analysis of soil composition more effective and efficient. It results in raising
    the standard of agricultural items, increasing the farmers’ financial rewards
    [26]. Smart sensors are most useful in agriculture for estimating soil moisture,
    nitrate and phosphate levels, and soil compaction, making a way to recommend fertilizers,
    measuring capsaicin levels, sorting land, and figuring out soil fertility. Soil
    health monitoring impacts nutrient concentration, affecting agricultural product
    production and quality [27]. Therefore, estimating these nutrients in advance
    and keeping track of them is beneficial for improving quality and cost-effectiveness.
    Smart devices with a variety of sensors allow for the monitoring of nitrate, phosphate,
    capsaicin, etc. concentrations. The farmers’ smartphones receive alarm texts.
    The amount of ploughing required on an agricultural field is determined by the
    assessment of soil compaction prior to ploughing [28]. 3.2 Automated Irrigation
    System Controlling the water flow in an agricultural region is simple with the
    help of a smart irrigation system. IoT is used to set up when water will be delivered
    and to get real-time information about the farm. The smart irrigation system may
    be used for a variety of tasks, such as climate-driven irrigation, water management,
    leak detection, and water level monitoring [29, 30]. Both the moisture content
    and the water level are monitored by the sensors. It makes sure there is enough
    water available for crops to flourish properly. Here, the water pump controller
    receives the sensor data from several sensors in order to automatically take the
    necessary action [31]. Because of this, the water pump works better when irrigation
    activities are planned well. By measuring the difference in pressure between two
    pipe connections, leaks in irrigation systems can be found. Pressure sensors are
    installed at each pipe junction to conduct leakage detection. If the pressure
    is low at any joint, it means that leakage happened before that joint. 3.3 Pest
    and Disease Detection Crop leaves in agricultural fields are an easy target for
    parasite and disease assaults. In traditional farming methods, it is not recommended
    that the farmer look at each plant in the field because it is often wrong and
    takes a long time. Smart agriculture offers a low-cost method of spotting illnesses
    in plant leaves [32]. The smart sensors for agriculture can be used to monitor
    leaf diseases in a number of ways, such as finding tomato leaf curl, parasite
    damage to leaves, and diseases in bananas based on their leaves. IoT-based real-time
    leaf monitoring enables the early detection of illnesses that impede plant development.
    The images from the many sensors that have been put in the agricultural area are
    looked at by the web server, which then sends alarms to the farmers. A sensor
    network was used to identify paddy and banana plant diseases earlier [33]. 3.4
    Crop Production Tracking Increased productivity and financial rewards for farmers
    are the main objectives of farming. Smart sensors aided in increasing agricultural
    output by facilitating efficient management and multi-point sensor monitoring
    [34]. For example, smart sensors can be used to find early crops, figure out how
    much fertilizer to use, tell when a plant is stressed, classify crop diseases,
    and build greenhouses that work well. The quality of the crop yield is greatly
    affected by how well you guess when to harvest. Crops are prematurely harvested,
    which results in lower-quality produce. So, using IoT to estimate when the harvest
    will happen can help farmers increase the amount of food they grow. Next, employing
    sensors to determine the precise needs for fertilizers and fertilizer results
    in a considerable improvement in product quality [35]. A number of temperature
    sensors have been put in the greenhouse to help control and keep an eye on the
    temperature. The way IoT-enabled greenhouses are built makes sure that the right
    conditions are always there for plants to grow in a healthy way. 3.5 Post Harvesting
    Events After the successful harvesting of agricultural goods, the main issue is
    the successful distribution of such items to consumers at the highest quality.
    Smart sensors for agriculture facilitate post-harvest operations by offering reasonably
    priced options for the monitoring of the storage and transit of agricultural products
    in real time [36]. It can be used for smart grain storage, smart inventory control,
    smart agricultural transportation, and smart agricultural product preservation.
    Two important factors—namely, “how to store?”—play a key role in the storage of
    agricultural commodities. Where should it be stored? Harvested grain sacks have
    passive sensors that monitor humidity and temperature. Temperature, humidity,
    and cleanliness data are provided in real time by the various sensors positioned
    within the inventory [37]. 3.6 Smart Animal Husbandry Agriculture is not possible
    without animal husbandry. In the last few years, there has been a big rise in
    the use of sensors in smart animal husbandry. Numerous advantages of smart animal
    husbandry include real-time animal activity monitoring, early illness identification,
    movement detection while grazing, etc. [38]. Farmers can benefit from different
    animal husbandry apps, such as those that let them keep an eye on pigs, beehives,
    sheep, and chicken farms. Smart sensors offer real-time in-dairy cow monitoring.
    By improving the cows’ constant assessment and real-time tracking, milk production
    can be more stable. In order to improve the quality of the honey supply, the farmers
    use sensors to keep track of the temperature, humidity, and other biological factors
    in the beehives. In a similar way, the radio collar’s sensors and GPS may help
    figure out how the sheep moves and where it is. Next, sensors are attached to
    the saddle and the rider’s clothing to track the horse’s gaits. Multiple sensors
    installed in the chicken farm also keep an eye on the environmental conditions
    inside [35, 39]. Early disease detection and real-time activity monitoring are
    made possible by monitoring pigs using cameras and radio collars systems. The
    outside temperature is monitored by the sensors that were installed in the animal
    shelter. The choice to graze outside is made based on the temperature threshold
    [40]. 4 Proposed System The Arduino UNO microcontroller is used to develop the
    smart irrigation system, which is an important part of this automated system.
    The microprocessor is connected to sensors such as soil moisture sensors, water
    level sensors, temperature sensors, and rain detection sensors. As a result, the
    Arduino UNO receives the output of these sensors. When such sensors send a signal,
    the microcontroller responds with the expected outcomes, turning on the relay
    in accordance with the soil sensor and rain and temperature sensor conditions
    and operating the water motor. A soil moisture sensor collects a reading of the
    soil’s moisture content and communicates it as voltage (analog signals). The necessary
    hardware and software are listed in Table 1. The output voltage is then compared
    with the standard voltage. The pump turns on and the agricultural area is automatically
    irrigated by the signal that is transmitted by the relay if the voltage used as
    the reference voltage is greater than the soil condition defined by the voltage.
    The pump stays in the OFF status and the relay does not activate in vice versa
    condition. The microcontroller receives an analog signal from the soil moisture
    sensor, which is transformed into a digital signal. The relay circuit receives
    the signal after the program has already been completed in the microcontroller.
    The motor is switched ON or OFF in accordance with the signal sent to the relay
    circuit. When the temperature drops, the soil gets moist, the voltage rises beyond
    the reference voltage, and a low signal (“logic 0”) is sent to the microcontroller,
    which turns off the motor and causes it to stop pumping water. The comparator,
    which is housed inside the sensor, provides the voltage. There will be conductivity
    in the field when the sensor is positioned there. Since water is an excellent
    conductor of electricity, good conduction indicates the presence of moisture.
    The signal is then transmitted, and the required signals switch the motor OFF.
    And when there is no conduction, it shows that there is no water present; as a
    result, the Arduino generates the appropriate signals to switch on the motor.
    The relay switch closes, the motor is attached to the circuit, and the water is
    pumped to the plants as soon as the control signal to turn on the motor is transmitted.
    Similar to this, if the control signal instructs the motor to be switched OFF,
    the relay switch is opened, cutting off power to the motor, which causes it to
    be turned OFF. As a result, the plants receive the water they require when they
    do, thanks to the Arduino software that has been programmed into its memory. Here,
    regular observation is not necessary. A block diagram of an automated regulated
    watering system is shown in (Fig. 2). Table 1 List of material required Full size
    table Fig. 2 System block diagram Full size image The design of the hardware and
    the basic structure of the system are both covered in the implementation. The
    basic construction is completed using a sprinkler irrigation system developed
    from parts such as a water pump, water tank, main pipelines, capacitive sensor,
    DHT-11 sensor for tracking air temperature and air humidity, LCD display to show
    the data, buzzer, and sprinklers. Numerous bulk irrigation control devices are
    constructed on a breadboard that is attached to an Arduino Uno board as the hardware
    implementation. These irrigation management devices are responsible for data collection
    and transmission to the system. The sensor information gathered is utilized to
    manage the irrigation system and keep an eye on the state of the crops. 4.1 System
    Implementation The Arduino IDE software contains programs that enable data reading
    from the transmitter and data transmission from an Arduino Uno to a system. The
    system’s prototype is displayed below (see Fig. 3). Table 2 displays the results
    from various times of the day from all sensors’ testing. Figure 4 explains the
    working flow of the proposed system. If the soil moisture is below 40%, the water
    motor turns on, and the relay enters an active state when it transmits the high
    signal to the relay. The red and green LED lights indicate their active state.
    If soil moisture is above 40% and in between 100%, the relay remains off as it
    receives the LOW signal from the relay, and only the single red LED light on the
    relay indicates its off state. Data samples from both wet and dry soil are collected
    to test the soil moisture by using a capacitive soil moisture sensor type v1.2
    to validate the result and test the relay. The values obtained for dry soil conditions
    are below the soil moisture required values, and the values obtained for wet soil
    conditions are above the soil moisture required values. The results show that
    the range of dry soil moisture values is between 40 and 0%, while the range of
    wet soil moisture values is between 80 and 100%. As result shown in Table 2, the
    rain sensor is used to indicate a rainy state. If it is raining, then it will
    indicate a rainy state; otherwise, it will not rain. The tank has a water level
    indicator installed to display the water level. If the water trough is full, it
    will show on the system. If the water trough is empty, it will show empty on the
    system screen. Since temperature and humidity are key factors in the growth of
    crops, the DHT11 sensor is used to measure air temperature and humidity. Data
    from soil moisture sensors and DHt11 sensors is displayed on an LCD display screen
    for a quick review of the data. Fig. 3 Prototype of smart irrigation system Full
    size image Table 2 Experimental result Full size table Fig. 4 Main flowchart of
    the proposed system Full size image Working Steps Working process of proposed
    system is explained below. 1 The moment the power supply is turned on, the system
    starts. 2 The Arduino is linked to the LCD display in order to make sure that
    sensor data gets displayed on the LCD panel correctly. 3 The soil moisture sensor,
    which measures the soil moisture content, sets a maximum threshold of 100% and
    a minimum level of 0%. The engine will pump water to the crops if the soil moisture
    content falls below 40%. 4 The agricultural field’s outside temperature is determined
    by the temperature sensor. 5 A rain sensor ensures that the motor is shut off
    when it starts to rain in order to save power. 6 Additionally, the user will receive
    all of the data acquired by sensors automatically. 5 Result and Discussion Agriculture
    has challenges with water management and irrigation since water supplies are depleting
    quickly and 60% of irrigation water is lost. In this study, a comprehensive irrigation
    system based on automated controls and wireless sensor networks was developed
    on a low budget. The primary goal of this research is to build smart control systems
    and automated irrigation systems at the local level. The system was successfully
    constructed and implemented, and its accuracy was tested; the results met expectations.
    At various temperatures, the rate of water content loss has been measured and
    is shown in Table 2. Because high temperatures might interfere with the irrigation
    plan, this lowered rate makes it easier to forecast when to irrigate next time.
    In these kinds of systems, automated and wireless sensor networks offer notably
    high efficiency. The ESP board and sensor were precise. The system’s soil moisture
    detection nodes are crucial; when water reaches all of them, the system instructs
    the water pump to turn off. This method cuts water waste by up to 70% by carefully
    planning irrigation. Results from experiments are used to generate Table 2. The
    temperature change and its impacts on soil dry rate forecast, irrigation system
    management, and moisture drop rate are shown in the table. The variation in the
    actual temperature is described by the temperature change rate. The relationship
    between a drop in moisture content and a rise in temperature is seen in the table.
    6 Conclusion A smart system for irrigation can potentially be used widely to decrease
    water waste and supply farmers with healthy crops. In our project, a relay that
    regulates this process allows the motor to be automatically turned ON and OFF.
    The water required by the crops is supplied by the motor-attached water tank or
    water storage. This project effectively monitors the water level of the plants.
    When necessary, it gives plants the right amount of water. The plants’ development
    and vitality can be preserved. As farmers are not required to regularly examine
    the irrigation operation, manpower and labor costs are decreased. Water wastage
    has decreased, which has numerous positive economic effects; as a result, this
    project has positive economic effects as well. The best way to prevent water problems
    in agriculture will be through smart irrigation. Sensor-based irrigation is in
    high demand now and will continue to grow in the future. By controlling soil moisture
    levels, it decreases human error and saves time. Precision agricultural farming
    is now feasible because of the advent of sensor-based applications in agriculture,
    which increase production, efficiency, and profitability. In order to further
    the sophistication and effectiveness of future research, field data will be gathered
    and combined with artificial intelligence, big data, and/or neural networks. References

  description: Due to the impact of climate change on agriculture and the emergence
    of water security issues, proper irrigation management has become increasingly
    important to overcome the challenges. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    is being utilized in agriculture for collecting field information and sharing
    it through websites in real time. This study discusses the efforts taken to develop
    an IoT-based sensor station, a user-friendly website, and a smartphone app for
    irrigation management. In addition, the demonstration of the IoT-based sensor
    station and its effectiveness are discussed. Before deploying the sensor station,
    soil moisture sensor calibration was conducted using a laboratory experiment.
    Overall, the calibrated soil moisture sensors met the statistical criteria for
    both sand [root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.01 cm3/cm3, index of agreement (IA)
    = 0.97, and mean bias error (MBE) = 0.01] and loamy sand (RMSE = 0.023 cm3/cm3,
    IA = 0.98, and MBE = −0.02). This article focuses on case studies from corn, blueberry,
    and tomato fields in Michigan, USA. In the corn and blueberry fields, the evaluation
    of irrigation practices of farmer's using an IoT-based sensor technology was considered.
    In the tomato field, a demonstration of automation irrigation was conducted. Overirrigation
    was observed using the IoT-based sensor station in some fields that have sandy
    soil and use a drip irrigation system. In the blueberry demonstration field, the
    total yield per plant (p = 0.025) and 50-berry weights (p = 0.013) were found
    to be higher with the recommended irrigation management than the farmer's existing
    field. In the tomato demonstration field, there were no statistical differences
    in the number of marketable tomatoes (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756)
    between the farmer's existing method and the recommended irrigation strategy.
    However, 30% less water was applied to the recommended irrigation strategy plot.
    Thus, the result showed that the IoT-based sensor irrigation strategy can save
    up to 30% on irrigation while maintaining the same yields and quality of the product.

    for centuries and plays a significant role in developing economies worldwide.
    Irrigation is the process of supplying water to the crops using an artificial
    means to provide moisture, which helps in the growth and produces higher yields
    in crops. It is particularly important in regions with low precipitation and limited
    water resources. Irrigation also significantly impacts local rural economies by
    affecting the production of crops, creating jobs, increasing carbon sequestration,
    and boosting economic growth. Climate change poses a threat to agriculture. Erratic
    and unpredictable precipitation patterns, rising global average temperatures,
    and water scarcity can compromise food security (Rosa, 2022). Crop health is affected
    by rainfall trends, such as wetter springs, and drier summers with temperature
    anomalies, such as cold or heat waves (Alam et al., 2021). These flooding and
    drought events, without precision irrigation, can decrease the yield and quality
    of the product. In addition to these precipitation changes, average global temperatures
    are expected to increase by around 2°C each year until the year 2100. Higher temperatures
    lead to alterations in evapotranspiration (ET) and weed growth, affect pollination,
    and decrease photosynthesis rate, source-sink relationship, and crop duration,
    all of which can affect plant health and productivity (Malhi et al., 2021). Precision
    irrigation management practices have the potential to increase water use efficiency
    while minimizing the effects of climate change on farms. Irrigation scheduling
    is a well-established strategy to manage crop water needs throughout the growing
    season. This method involves monitoring the water requirements of crops and determining
    whether the existing soil moisture and any additional water from precipitation
    and irrigation can fulfill them. Irrigation scheduling also considers economic
    and environmental variables. Every day, farmers face the challenge of making decisions
    that balance the cost of applying water (labor and energy) against the goal of
    achieving a high yield, enhanced crop quality, and the efficient use of water
    resources. Several types of irrigation scheduling have been demonstrated in the
    past, including ET-, soil moisture-, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based irrigation
    scheduling (Aguilar et al., 2015; Goap et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Alibabaei
    et al., 2021; Dong, 2023; Kelley et al., 2023). ET-based irrigation scheduling
    is a method of irrigating a crop using daily reference ET, particular crop coefficient
    (Kc) value, and the amount of precipitation. Kc is determined by crop types and
    crop growth stage. This method has been shown to save water by up to 61% compared
    to the conventional irrigation application method (Simić et al., 2023). Soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling utilizes soil moisture sensors to estimate
    soil moisture content in the root zone to ensure optimal moisture levels for crops
    and avoid overirrigation. Typically, soil moisture sensors are installed at multiple
    depths in the root zone to understand the soil moisture levels at different depths
    comprehensively. The changes in soil moisture at different depths help to estimate
    the root growth. Many types of soil moisture sensors are available, including
    tensiometers, capacitance sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, and
    frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors. A tensiometer is a soil water tension
    measuring tool comprised of a porous ceramic cup with a water-filled tube working
    on the capillary action principle, which measures the soil matric potential expressing
    soil water energy. Capacitance sensors measure soil dielectric constants that
    differ for different moisture regimes, which provide real-time data for precise
    irrigation management (Smajstrla and Harrison, 2023). TDR is an approach that
    works on the principles of sending an electromagnetic pulse to the soil, and the
    travel time of the pulse is directly related to the soil moisture content, and
    it provides continuous soil moisture data across different depths, which helps
    in understanding efficient irrigation management (He et al., 2021). In addition
    to these sensors, FDR is another technique based on electromagnetic wave reflections
    that send high-frequency waves to the soil for measuring dielectric properties,
    which determines the soil moisture for precision irrigation management (Choi et
    al., 2016). Previously, this soil moisture sensor-based irrigation scheduling
    helped to save water by up to 60% compared to conventional irrigation methods
    (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005; Grabow et al., 2013; Millán et al., 2019). A study
    conducted by Boltana et al. (2023) showed that the soil moisture sensor-based
    method saved 18% of irrigation water compared to the ET-based method in tomato
    fields (Boltana et al., 2023). Moreover, the sensor-based irrigation method increased
    water use efficiency in soybean and potato fields by 49% and 16%, respectively
    (Wood et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2023). The AI-based irrigation scheduling analyzes
    multiple input data, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, plant canopy temperature, crop type, crop growth stage, and
    yield data, to develop AI logarithms. Machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement
    learning techniques are typically used for developing algorithms. These algorithms
    provide predictive analytics about optimum irrigation volume, time and frequency
    of irrigation, and yield data. These data can be used for the long-term planning
    of water usage based on weather forecasts and provide predictive measures for
    proactive interventions. This AI-based irrigation scheduling has been shown to
    improve the efficiency of water use for irrigation by up to 50% (Mohammad et al.,
    2013; Zia et al., 2021) and save the usage of water by 59% (Jamroen et al., 2020)
    compared to the industry standard method. Of those methods discussed, weather-
    and soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling are the most common methods, as
    they are relatively cheap, more practical, and easier to use. While the weather-based
    irrigation scheduling method uses reference ET and Kc to determine when and how
    much to irrigate, the soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling method utilizes
    actual in-field soil moisture data using sensors to estimate the current soil
    water available and determine the irrigation decision. Soil moisture sensors can
    also be used for monitoring the spatial variation of soil moisture within the
    fields, thus allowing precise irrigation management. Recently, soil moisture sensor
    adoption in agriculture in the United States is only 12% (as of 2020) (Kukal et
    al., 2020). To increase this adoption rate, systems should be more cost-effective
    and easier to use (Dong, 2023). Furthermore, farmers need to be more educated
    on how they work to increase the trust in using them. The cost, difficulty to
    use, and trust are the major challenges for adopting the technology by farmers.
    Therefore, affordable and easy-to-use technology is needed to increase the its
    adoption. In addition, the demonstration of the technology in agricultural fields
    to show the potential use in improving the efficiency of irrigation water use
    is needed. In this study, we propose to develop an affordable and easy-to-use
    sensor monitoring system for farmers to improve irrigation management. We implement
    a low-cost sensor monitoring system (LOCOMOS) to measure soil moisture at multiple
    depths and use the data to provide irrigation recommendations. This article focuses
    on case studies using LOCOMOS in corn, blueberry, and tomato fields. 2 Methodology
    LOCOMOS, which was developed by Michigan State University Irrigation Lab, was
    used in this study. LOCOMOS is an IoT-based sensor monitoring system that measures
    in-field soil and environmental conditions. The collected data were sent to the
    IoT cloud web server, from which irrigation recommendations were provided. 2.1
    An IoT-based sensor monitoring system A LOCOMOS system can continuously measure
    soil moisture levels at multiple depths, leaf wetness duration, air temperature,
    relative humidity, and precipitation. The data were then sent to a LOCOMOS IoT
    website (https://www.locomos1.com) to display the recommended irrigation timing
    and amount, the location of the sensor system, the raw sensor data, and the switch
    to turn irrigation on and off. The dashboard on the LOCOMOS IoT website was updated
    every 15 min, allowing the user to observe and make timely farm management decisions.
    An SD card module was utilized for storing and backing up the sensor data locally.
    LOCOMOS is powered by a 12V 7A battery, a 12V solar panel, and a solar battery
    charging controller. Email and Text message alert systems were set up through
    the IoT website. For example, a user could receive an email and text message when
    the soil water available level is at 50% for growing corn. SoilWatch 10, the soil
    moisture sensors, manufactured by Pino-Tech (Stargard, Poland), were utilized
    for measuring soil moisture levels. SoilWatch 10 is a relatively cheaper sensor
    and has provided reliable soil moisture measurement. PHYTOS 31 Leaf Wetness Sensor,
    manufactured by METER Group (Pullmen, WA, USA), was utilized to record the duration
    of leaf wetness. An SHT30 temperature and humidity sensor, manufactured by Sensirion
    (Chicago, IL, USA), was utilized for measuring the air temperature and relative
    humidity. The accuracy tolerance for air temperature and relative humidity were
    ± 0.3°C and ± 3%, respectively. A rain gauge, manufactured by Davis Instruments
    (Hayward, CA, USA), was utilized for measuring the precipitation. The rain gauge
    measured every 0.02 cm increment. Hunter ICV valves with DC latching solenoids
    were connected to the microcontroller to turn the valve on and off. Figure 1 shows
    a block diagram of the LOCOMOS system. figure 1 Figure 1. A block diagram for
    the LOCOMOS system. The LOCOMOS smartphone application (LOCOMOS APP) is an easy-to-use
    app designed for farmers to manage irrigation for their crops. The LOCOMOS APP
    connects to the LOCOMOS IoT server to visualize the sensor data on the app. Each
    user will be verified using a digital ocean server (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows
    the pages of the LOCOMOS APP. To access the app, existing users can log in using
    their registered email ID and password. New users can sign up using their email
    ID and a unique invitation code, which is provided by the server. Once logged
    in, a list of sensor devices will be displayed. Each device contains its GPS coordinates
    and provides real-time available soil water (%) and maximum recommended irrigation
    amount. In addition, the LOCOMOS APP gathers ET and precipitation information
    from the Michigan State University Enviroweather Network. Users can either push
    the “Use My Location” button or select the closest weather station to their field
    to observe the ET and precipitation data. In addition, the map page allows users
    to visualize the precise locations of all deployed sensors on a map. This bird''s-eye
    view offers a comprehensive overview of users'' farmlands, making it easier to
    identify the location of each sensor. figure 2 Figure 2. An overview of the LOCOMOS
    application. figure 3 Figure 3. LOCOMOS-APP pages; (A) LOCOMOS login page, (B)
    Account setup, (C) Device list, (D) Available soil water and maximum recommended
    irrigation amount, (E) Weather information from MSU Enviroweather, and (F) LOCOMOS
    devices on the map. 2.2 Soil moisture sensor calibration The calibration of soil
    moisture sensors to specific soil types was critical as the accuracy could be
    varied. A laboratory experiment was conducted to calibrate the SoilWatch 10 soil
    moisture sensors and evaluate their performances in two soil types. The soil types,
    including sand and loamy sand, were used in this laboratory experiment. Two 144-L
    size polypropylene containers (80 × 41 × 35 cm) were used. The volumetric water
    content (VWC) analysis was performed six times using a 61-cm3 size soil ring during
    this laboratory experiment. Detailed information on the procedure of the sensor
    calibration can be found in Smajstrla et al.''s study (Smajstrla and Harrison,
    2023). 2.3 Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation model The soil
    moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation was estimated using the field
    capacity of soil and current soil moisture content using soil moisture sensors.
    The irrigation recommendation was calculated by finding the difference between
    the field capacity of the soil and the current soil moisture content. This recommendation
    was the maximum amount of irrigation that could be applied without water being
    lost through deep percolation beyond the root zone. The equation of soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation recommendation is shown in Equation (1). An assumption
    was made that the volumetric soil water content for its representative soil layer
    is uniform and has the same moisture level. I R = ( F C L a y e r i -  θ v L a
    y e r i ) * D L a y e r i     ( 1 ) where IR is the maximum irrigation recommendation
    (cm), FCLayeri is the field capacity of the layer i soil depth (cm/cm), DLayeri
    is the representative layer i soil depth (cm), and θvLayeri is the volumetric
    soil water content of the layer i soil depth (cm3/cm3). 2.4 Statistical analysis
    The performance of the soil moisture sensors was evaluated using root mean squared
    error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), and mean bias error (MBE). RMSE measures
    the difference between sensor values and soil sample values and is defined in
    Equation (2). The index of agreement was proposed by Willmott (1981), as defined
    in Equation (3). MBE is defined in Equation (4). R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( M i
    - P i ) 2     ( 2 ) I A = 1 - ∑ i = 1 N ( M i - P i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 N ( | P i - M
    ¯ | + | M i - M ¯ | ) 2     ( 3 ) M B E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( P i − M i )     ( 4
    ) where N is the sample size, M is the measured (soil sampling) value, P is the
    predicted (sensor measurement) value, and is the average measured value. The units
    for RMSE and MBE are VWC (cm3/cm3), and IA is dimensionless. A range of IA lies
    between 0 and 1, and a value of 0 indicates no agreement between the measured
    and predicted values. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the observed
    and predicted values. The higher value of IA indicates better agreement between
    observed and predicted values. Hignett and Evett (2008) revealed that the sensor
    measurement accuracy for most agricultural applications needs to be <0.02 cm3/cm3.
    Varble and Chávez (2011) and Dong et al. (2020) reported that the criteria for
    MBE and RMSE were ±0.02 cm3/cm3 and <0.035 cm3/cm3, respectively. Therefore, this
    study evaluated the sensor performance using the following criteria: MBE ± 0.02
    cm3/cm3 and RMSE < 0.035 cm3/cm3. 2.5 LOCOMOS field demonstration—Irrigation practice
    evaluation Once the sensors were calibrated and evaluated, LOCOMOS was deployed
    in irrigated fields in Michigan farmlands to evaluate the existing farmer''s irrigation
    practices. Irrigated corn and blueberry fields were evaluated. The demonstration
    irrigated corn field was located in Manchester, Michigan, USA. A commercial corn
    was cultivated in this field and was irrigated with 20–28 cm of water and 224
    kg/ha of nitrogen was applied. The commercial corn fields were irrigated using
    a center pivot irrigation system. The second demonstration field was located in
    West Olive, Michigan, USA. The field size was approximately 20 acres, and blueberries
    were cultivated in it. These blueberry fields were irrigated using a surface double-drip
    line system. Soil samples were collected to test the soil texture. The physical
    properties of the soils at different depths are shown in Table 1. The soils in
    these fields were mostly sandy soil, such as loamy sand and sandy loam, which
    were the common soil types in irrigated fields in Michigan. Figure 4 shows installed
    LOCOMOS in the irrigated corn and blueberry fields in Michigan, USA. Corn roots
    typically grow up to 90 cm in this demonstration field. Thus, the soil moisture
    sensors were installed at 15, 60, and 90 cm in the irrigated corn field. In the
    irrigated blueberry field, the sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm.
    All data loggers were programmed to record soil moisture measurements every 30
    min. The soil samples were collected three times during this monitoring period.
    These samples were analyzed for texture and volumetric water content. The VWC
    from the soil samples was utilized for testing the accuracy of the sensors. table

    4 Figure 4. LOCOMOS stations installed in an irrigated corn field in Manchester,
    MI, USA (left) and an irrigated blueberry field in West Olive, MI, USA (right).
    2.6 LOCOMOS field demonstration—automation irrigation Automation irrigation using
    LOCOMOS was demonstrated in a tomato field in Hart, Michigan, USA. The 9V DC solenoid
    valves with Hunter''s ICV valves were utilized to control irrigation. Fresh tomatoes
    were cultivated in this field, and plastic mulch was used to maintain the soil
    moisture and keep the weeds out. Figure 5 shows the experimental setup for this
    tomato field. This tomato field is irrigated with a surface single drip line system.
    Two irrigation strategies, namely, the farmer''s existing irrigation management
    and automation irrigation trigger, were evaluated. The farmer''s existing irrigation
    management included 1 h of irrigation per day in June and twice in 1 h of irrigation
    per day in July and August. The automation irrigation trigger method was based
    on the soil moisture sensor data and used Equation (1). Four replications with
    randomized plot designs were utilized for the comparison. The team has collected
    the number of marketable tomatoes and their weights to compare the effectiveness
    of the treatments. Eight plants per replication were considered. Statistic software
    R v4.3.1 was utilized for running a one-way ANOVA. figure 5 Figure 5. Automation
    irrigation demonstration in Hart, MI, USA. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Soil moisture
    sensor calibration The calibration of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensor was
    conducted for sand and loamy sand. Soil temperature during this laboratory experiment
    was kept constant at 22 ± 1°C. The soil moisture sensors were powered at 3.3 V,
    and analog raw counts were used for the calibration. Figure 6 shows the comparison
    of measured VWC and raw count. Based on the curve fitting, Equation (5) was developed.
    The calibration of SoilWatch 10 was based on a wide range of VWC from 0.04 to
    0.4 cm3/cm3. The calibration of the sensor provided confidence in using it for
    field demonstration. VWC  = 2 E - 13 ( R C ) 3 - 4 E - 9 ( R C ) 2 + 4 E - 5 (
    R C ) - 0 . 0677     ( 5 ) where VWC is the volumetric water content (cm3/cm3)
    and RC is the analog raw counts that outputs from the sensor. figure 6 Figure
    6. The calibration curve for SoilWatch 10. 3.2 The performance evaluation of the
    soil moisture sensor The performance of the soil moisture sensor in the sand and
    loamy sand was evaluated. Figures 7, 8 show the comparison of sensors with measured
    VWC using a gravimetric method for sand and loamy sand, respectively. Table 2
    shows the result of the statistical analysis. The MBE values for the soil moisture
    sensor showed that this sensor overestimated VWC by an average of 0.01 cm3/cm3
    in the sand and underestimated it by an average of 0.02 cm3/cm3 in the loamy sand.
    The performance of the soil moisture sensor for sand and loamy sand satisfied
    both MBE and RMSE criteria. The MBE values of the calibrated SoilWatch 10 were
    similar to Campbell Scientific''s CS 616 TDR sensors. The MBE of CS 616 for sand
    and loamy sand were 0.01 and 0.03 cm3/cm3, respectively (Dong et al., 2020). The
    calibrated SoilWatch 10 provided reliable performance in measuring moisture content
    in sand and loamy sand. This confirmed the satisfaction of the calibration process.

    for sand. figure 8 Figure 8. A comparison of the SoilWatch 10 with the soil sampling
    method for loamy sand. table 2 Table 2. A statistical analysis to compare measured
    values to sensor values. 3.3 Demonstration in an irrigated corn field Figure 9
    shows the collected soil moisture sensor data, precipitation, and irrigation.
    Appropriate irrigation should maintain the soil moisture level in the root zone
    at an optimal level and ensure the water does not flow below the root zone to
    save freshwater and energy, reducing nutrient leaching and maximizing return on
    investment. The corn roots in this demonstration field grew up to 90 cm; thus,
    the goal of irrigation management was to moisten only the top 90 cm of soil. During
    the growing season, five events affected increasing soil moisture levels at a
    depth of 90 cm, which means that the water has reached and passed through the
    90 cm depth. In events #1, #3, and #5, soil moisture at a depth of 90 cm increased
    due to continuous and heavy rainfalls. In events #2 and #3, the soil moisture
    level at 90 cm depth was increased due to the combination of rainfall and irrigation.
    The corn farmer in Michigan typically applied irrigation each time between 2.50–3.20
    cm. When heavy rainfall is forecasted, the farmer could reduce the irrigation
    application volume to capture the rainfall within the root zone and minimize the
    potential leaching of water and nutrients below the root zone. In addition, the
    installation of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensors within the root zone and
    right below the root zone helps to evaluate whether the farmer is applying irrigation
    adequately or excessively. These sensor data are helpful in making better-informed
    decisions on when and how much to irrigate. figure 9 Figure 9. The volumetric
    water content at 15, 45, and 90 cm soil depths at an irrigated corn demonstration
    field. 3.4 Demonstration in an irrigated blueberry field In the irrigated blueberry
    field, soil moisture sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm depths. The
    flow rate of the drip emitter was 41 cm/h and was applied for 60 min during each
    application. During this monitoring period, there were no rainfalls. Figure 10
    shows the soil moisture changes from the farmer''s irrigation management practice.
    Proper irrigation for blueberries on this farm should ensure that water does not
    flow below the root zone, which is the top 45 cm of soil depth. Figure 10 indicates
    that the farmer''s existing irrigation management practice provided an adequate
    amount of water to the blueberry root system. However, the overirrigation events
    were observed because of the spike in the soil moisture sensor at both 45 and
    60 cm depths. Thus, it was recommended to reduce the irrigation time from 60 min
    to 40 min. The farmer tested his part of the field to demonstrate the reduced
    and recommended irrigation management practice. Figure 11 shows the soil moisture
    monitoring at the reduced and recommended irrigation plots. The reduced irrigation
    increased the soil moisture levels of the depth up to 30 cm, which is the effective
    water uptake root zone for blueberries grown in sandy soil. Thus, the reduced
    and recommended amount was adequate; however, when the blueberry was at the significant
    growth stage (at first blue fruit) and higher ET, more frequent (three times a
    day) irrigation was suggested, if needed. The soil type in this blueberry field
    is loamy sand. A smaller amount and more frequent application might be needed
    for the fields that have sandy soil. For finer texture soils, irrigating once
    a day with large volume application might be adequate as they have a large water
    holding capacity. figure 10 Figure 10. Soil moisture monitoring at the existing
    blueberry farmer''s irrigation practice at the blue fruit stage. figure 11 Figure
    11. Soil moisture monitoring of adjusted irrigation practice at the blue fruit
    stage. The total yield/plant and 50-berry weights were collected from this demonstration
    field for both the farmer''s existing irrigation method and the reduced/recommended
    irrigation management. The yield per plant for the farmer''s irrigation method
    and the recommended irrigation management were 552 and 722 g, respectively. There
    were statistical differences between the treatments (p = 0.025). 50-berry weights
    for the farmer''s irrigation method and the recommended irrigation management
    were 87.7 and 93.7 g, respectively. There were statistical differences between
    the treatments (p = 0.013). A potential cause of higher yield in the recommended
    irrigation management could be due to proper irrigation application that reduced
    nutrient leaching below the root zone in the sandy soil. An IoT-based irrigation
    management can help save water while maintaining the same blueberry quality and
    yields as the farmer''s typical irrigation management. 3.5 Irrigation automation
    in a tomato field Figure 12 shows the number of tomatoes that are marketable and
    their total weight from each treatment. The figure shows that there were no statistical
    differences among the treatments in the numbers of marketable tomatoes from the
    2022 growing season (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756). Thus, the production
    and quality of tomatoes were similar from all treatments, but the amount of applied
    irrigation was different. The sensor-based irrigation strategy applied a 30% lower
    amount than the farmer''s irrigation scheduling method, which indicates that the
    farmer could improve their irrigation water use efficiency using the sensor technology.
    An IoT-based automation irrigation management using a soil moisture sensor''s
    recommendation can help to save water by 30% while maintaining the same marketable
    yields and quality of tomatoes as the farmer''s typical irrigation management.
    In addition to conserving water, saving energy by pumping less water reduces farm
    energy costs. Moreover, low energy usage contributes to reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions from agriculture. The primary benefit of an automatic irrigation system
    is that it can save farmers'' time and labor costs in operating the irrigation
    system. figure 12 Figure 12. The total number of marketable tomatoes (A) and the
    total weight of marketable tomatoes from each replication (B). T1 is the farmer''s
    typical irrigation management. T2 is an IoT soil moisture sensor-based irrigation
    recommendation. 4 Conclusion Based on the field demonstration, the IoT-based sensor
    technology has proven to improve irrigation water use efficiency by evaluating
    the farmer''s existing irrigation practices and providing recommendations if needed.
    Providing real-time in-field soil moisture sensor data is helpful in making day-to-day
    irrigation management decisions, especially under unpredictable precipitation
    patterns. Minimizing overirrigation can reduce the risk of nutrients leaching
    below the root zone, ultimately protecting groundwater quality. In future studies,
    more on-farm demonstrations are needed to increase technology adoption. In addition,
    a continuation of extension outreach activities to promote making irrigation management
    decisions based on scientific data is needed. Besides irrigation management, this
    IoT sensor technology can be utilized to help other management practices such
    as nutrient, pesticide, insecticide, frost protection, and plant health monitoring
    (heat and water stress). Therefore, continued efforts to explore the application
    of IoT-based sensor technology in agriculture to combat the effect of climate
    change are needed. LOCOMOS utilizes cellular networks to communicate; however,
    cellular reception may be poor in some rural areas. Other communication network
    systems, such as radio, NB-IoT, and Sigfox, should be explored to overcome the
    signal issues. Moreover, the effectiveness of IoT-based technology should also
    be evaluated in other crop types. The usability of the LOCOMOS technology, including
    the installation technique, software interface, data accessibility, and alert
    systems, needs to be improved to make the technology easy to adopt for farmers.
    Additionally, other potential applications of the LOCOMOS platform, such as wind
    speed for spray drift reduction, soil moisture sensors for irrigation management,
    leaf surface temperature measurement for plant heat stress, and carbon dioxide
    measurement for greenhouse gas emission, should be considered in the future. Concerns
    about agricultural water use have been and will continue to grow due to the effect
    of climate change on agriculture. Because water is a limited resource, technologies
    that improve irrigation water use efficiency will play a significant role in increasing
    agricultural water sustainability. Data availability statement The datasets presented

  description: Accurate and near real-time volumetric soil water and volumetric ion
    content (VIC) measurements can both inform precise irrigation scheduling and aid
    in fertilizer management applications in cropping systems. To assist in the monitoring
    of these measurements, capacitance-based soil moisture probes are used in agricultural
    best management practice (BMP) programs. However, the ability of these sensors
    to detect nutrients in the soil sourced from fertilizers is not well understood.
    The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of a capacitance-based
    soil moisture probe in detecting Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium
    (K) movement in the soil. To achieve this, a laboratory-based setup was established
    using pure sand soil cores. Raw soil moisture and VIC probe readings from the
    cores were contrasted across multiple N, P, and K rates. The N treatments applied
    were rates of 0, 112, 168, and 224 kg/ha; for P, were 0, 3.76, and 37.6 kg/ha,
    and for K were 0, 1.02, 1.53, and 2.04 kg/ha. Each nutrient was evaluated separately
    using a randomized complete block design experiment with three replications for
    N and K, and 5 replications for P. The impact of each nutrient rate on the sensitivity
    of VIC readings was determined by evaluating differences in three points of the
    time series, including the observed maximum point, inflection point, and convergence
    value as well as the time of occurrence of those points over a 24-hour period.
    These points were assessed at depths 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 cm. The findings
    of this study highlight the capacitance-based soil moisture probes’ responsiveness
    to changes in all K rates at most depths. However, its sensitivity to changes
    in N and P rates is comparatively lower. The results obtained in this study can
    be used to develop fertilizer management protocols that utilize K movement as
    the baseline to indirectly assess N and P, while helping to inform those who currently
    use the probe which nutrients the probe may be detecting. The probes’ readings
    could be incorporated into decision support systems for irrigation and nutrient
    management and improve control systems for precision water and nutrient management.

    The probes’ readings could be incorporated into decision support systems for irrigation
    and nutrient management and improve control systems for precision water and nutrient
    management. 1 Introduction Agricultural, urban, and industrial water resource
    management continue to play a significant role in eutrophication within freshwater
    systems, driven by factors such as population growth and intensification (Lu and
    Tian, 2017; Wurtsbaugh et al., 2019). It’s been shown that the management of irrigation
    and fertigation has major impacts on the nutrient leachate and runoff coming from
    agricultural production (Pérez-Martín and Benedito-Castillo, 2023). One approach
    to optimize agricultural production and minimize the environmental impacts involves
    high-quality diagnostic soil, plant, and water testing (Mylavarapu, 2010). However,
    a fraction (25%) of surveyed farmers in the USA and Australia conduct soil tests
    for monitoring nutrients (Lobry De Bruyn and Andrews, 2016). Due to these factors,
    the need for real-time soil nutrient monitoring is steadily increasing within
    agricultural water management. Such monitoring can contribute to the optimization
    of farmers’ fertilizer application rates and assist in implementing effective
    nutrient management practices (Burton et al., 2020), thus reducing agriculture’s
    impacts on water quality. To promote wider adoption of nutrient monitoring techniques,
    several advancements in precision agriculture have emerged to assess plant and
    soil nutrient content at the field level. Optical sensors, satellite-based remote
    sensing technologies, and drone-based approaches have been gaining ground (Hunt
    and Daughtry, 2018; Inoue, 2020; Sishodia et al., 2020). While these technologies
    are nondestructive, they are expensive and require skills and knowledge in data
    processing before the farmers can effectively use the collected data for decision-making.
    Currently, the use of remote sensing technology is mainly limited to researchers
    (Weber and McCann, 2015; Bramley and Ouzman, 2019). An alternative approach for
    continuous field-level data acquisition involves in-ground sensors. Capacitance
    soil moisture sensors (SMS) for instance, provide real-time readings of soil water
    (SM), volumetric ion content (VIC) or electrical conductivity (EC), and soil temperature
    (T). These sensors provide two outputs from dimensionless frequencies that within
    conjunction with one another, give readings of volumetric water content and VIC
    when separated by proprietary data model processes. (TriSCAN ® Agronomic User
    Manual Version 1.2a, 2003, Adelaide, Australia). The VIC data derived from SMS
    represents the dielectric constant, which is influenced by the presence of salts
    from fertilizers and irrigation water. If nutrient salts from fertilizers significantly
    impact the soil osmotic potential, the sensor can detect them (Or and Wraith,
    2002). The use of SMS for optimal irrigation scheduling has been adopted more
    by farmers than any other technology-based irrigation scheduling technique in
    the USA (Taghvaeian et al., 2020). If this most-adopted approach could also be
    utilized for nutrient management, the rate of adoption could be greatly increased.
    Based on the VIC-EC measuring capabilities of SMS’s and soil moisture probes (SMP),
    it’s hypothesized that a similar approach could potentially be employed for nutrient
    monitoring and management, in addition to irrigation scheduling using SMS VIC
    data, if relationships between nutrient movement across the soil profile and VIC
    readings are established. If this connection is successfully established, decision
    support systems could utilize this already commercially-available and adopted
    technology to quickly diffuse fertigation management strategies, decreasing agriculture’s
    contributions to eutrophication. It is known that decision support systems already
    utilize sensor outputs for the management of irrigation and fertigation practices
    to reduce environmental impacts (Zhai et al., 2020). But first, before implementation
    into systems as a nutrient-sustainable management strategy, it must be investigated
    which nutrients the technology could potentially be detecting. It’s hypothesize
    that in-ground SMS could be sensitive to nutrient movement in the soil. This hypothesis
    arises from three known principles. First, the nutrients’ influence on EC (Omonode
    and Vyn, 2006; Mirzakhaninafchi et al., 2017; Darmawan et al., 2023). Second,
    the established correlation between soil cations/anions and EC (Friedman, 2005),
    and third, the sensors’ capacity to detect soil VIC. Notably, fertilizers containing
    Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) are known to increase EC (Bhatt
    et al., 2019). The SMS’s VIC measurements have been found to be directly correlated
    to soil EC, with variation across soil types (Biswas et al., 2007). This correlation
    indicates the potential of SMS to detect the presence of N, P, and K in the soil
    due to fertilizer applications, inferred from VIC data. To the best of our knowledge,
    no published studies have examined the capability of these capacitance SMS to
    detect N, P, and K movements individually. In this study, laboratory-based experiments
    were conducted to assess the changes caused in the VIC time series from SMS due
    to the presence of N, P, and K in a pure sand media. While the SMS’s VIC sensing
    capabilities make direct nutrient detection unlikely, the ability to indirectly
    indicate high nutrient content in the soil holds value for those utilizing the
    sensors for management or those creating decision support systems in precision
    agriculture. Given that these SMS are readily available on the market and are
    being used by farmers in the USA, they could represent a feasible and rapid solution
    for implementing efficient in-field nutrient management plans. However, there
    is a need for them to be investigated to fully understand which nutrients are
    in fact being detected by the sensors. By harnessing real-time data, these systems
    could both maintain optimal agricultural water and nutrient management while minimizing
    environmental impacts from crop production. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Experiment
    location, design, and treatments The three N, P, and K experiments were conducted
    individually at the University of Florida’s Indian River Research and Education
    Center in Fort Pierce, FL, USA (27°25''33.9\"N 80°24''29.4\" W). The laboratory
    was kept at a constant temperature of around 21°C. While constant temperature
    cannot be expected in field settings, this study was designed to minimize any
    variation in the time series created from temperature variances, so the SMS signals
    were mostly influenced by each nutrient. Each experiment followed similar protocols
    and had a randomized complete block design where the SMSs data collection over
    a 24-hour time was considered the replication or block (Figure 1). Specifically,
    the N and K experiments encompassed three distinct rates and were replicated three
    times, while the P experiment tested two different rates of P and had five replications.
    Sequentially, the P experiment was conducted initially, followed by the N and
    K experiments. After concluding the P experiment, it was determined that the N
    and K experiments would benefit from more rates and fewer repetitions. This was
    determined due to literature pointing stronger to impacts of N and K on soil EC
    (Carneiro et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2021) while it pointed to smaller impacts
    of P on soil EC (Ding et al., 2020). As previous studies showed weaker P impact
    on soil EC but still impacting, it was determined to be beneficial to investigate
    2 application rates of P which were significantly different from each other with
    higher numbers of repetitions to determine if P would be detectable through the
    SMP. However, as previous studies successfully registered strong EC signals from
    N and K in soils, it was determined to be beneficial to further investigate how
    sensitive the SMSs could be to various application rates of N and K beyond simple
    detection. Despite the differences in number of repetitions and applications between
    the three separate experiments, each experiment had a randomized complete block
    design where the 24-hour time was considered the replication or block. A summary
    of the treatments and nutrient rates used in this study is outlined in Table 1.
    figure 1 Figure 1 Diagram of the randomized complete block design for N, P and
    K experiments. table 1 Table 1 N, P, and K rates per treatment. The N source used
    was powdered urea (42-0-0), and the N rate treatments were application rates selected
    based on local N fertilizer recommendations for sweetcorn (Hochmuth and Hanlon,
    1995). The low rate indicates split application at the six-leaf stage of the crop,
    the average rate is the preplant application rate, and the high rate represents
    the total accumulated N suggested for one crop season. For P a 1000 ppm orthophosphate
    standard solution was purchased from Fisher Scientific. This solution was selected
    as inorganic P is a bioavailable source of P (Thien and Myers, 1992) often found
    in fertilizers (Cade-Menun et al., 2017). P rates were determined based on soil
    P concentration of a local sweetcorn farm in South Florida, USA, where the high
    rate represented average P soil levels, and the low rate was one-tenth of this
    level. The K source was KCl 3M solution from Fisher Scientific, with treatments
    selected based on groundwater salinity concentrations. According to Her and Vassilaros
    (2022), the maximum groundwater salinity concentration reported was 9.12 dS/m
    along the South Florida coastal areas. Thus, in this study, this measurement was
    used as a baseline to convert K levels ranging from 5-10 dS/m reflecting groundwater
    levels (Her and Vassilaros, 2022) to the kg/ha measurements of 1.02, 1.53, 2.04
    kg/ha treatments. Each nutrient source was mixed with 500 ml reverse osmosis water,
    and to ensure consistency in metrics, units were transformed to nutrient rates
    per hectare of land. 2.2 Soil moisture probe and calibration A TriSCAN Sentek
    drill and drop (SMP) soil moisture probe (Sentek Drill and Drop SDI-12 Series
    III, 2015) was utilized for this experiment. The SMP is equipped with 6 individual
    SMSs distributed equally down the probe. Across the SMP, sensors are located at
    specific depths: 5 cm (sensor 1), 15 cm (sensor 2), 25 cm (sensor 3), 35 cm (sensor
    4), 45 cm (sensor 5), and 55 cm (sensor 6) from the surface. Each SMS provides
    readings of volumetric soil water content, soil temperature, and VIC at 15-minute
    intervals. The sensors generate two frequencies. The first frequency is converted
    through a normalization Equation 1 (Schelter et al., 2006). X−Xmin Xmax−Xmin (1)
    and calibrated to volumetric soil water content. The second frequency is proportional
    to soil water content and the presence of free ions in the soil pore water. Proprietary
    data modeling integrates changes in both signals, yielding nominal VIC. These
    VIC readings can also be correlated with EC (Sentek TriSCAN ® Agronomic User Manual
    Version 1.2a, 2003, Adelaide, Australia). When the SMP is inserted into soil,
    each sensor within the SMP begins transmitting the soil water content, soil temperature,
    and VIC data in real-time every 15 minutes, generating a time series that begins
    from the moment of installation. This data can be observed by the user on commercial
    displays developed by data providers for service. Multiple data providers service
    the SMP used in this study. To ensure uniform measurements across all sensors,
    the SMPs were calibrated according to Sentek Technologies’ soil moisture sensors
    calibration manual (Calibration Manual for Sentek Soil Moisture Sensors Version
    2.0, 2011). For each soil core, a single SMP was installed as shown in Figure
    2. Data from the SMPs were retrieved via two data providers currently being used
    within the state of Florida: BMP Logic (https://www.bmplogic.net/) and Pessl Instruments
    (http://metosusa.com/). The subsequent data analysis was performed on the raw
    data extracted from each platform. figure 2 Figure 2 Laboratory experimental setup
    pre-nutrient application. 2.3 Experimental protocol Soil cores were composed of
    60 cm tall riser-pipe cylinders with a 16 cm diameter. Each cylinder was cut through
    the middle lengthwise, and fitted together with hose clamps, with the aim of replication
    sampling (Figure 3). To prevent soil movement with leachate, the lower portion
    of the pipes were sealed using a water-permeable fabric mulch. The fabric mulch
    ground cover utilized in this study was manufactured by Lumite, Inc (http://www.lumiteinc.com/products/groundcover)
    and is comprised of a blend of woven fabrics and UV polypropylene that allows
    passage of water and nutrients at a rate of 720 L min/m2. figure 3 Figure 3 Sand
    core and extraction of soil samples for laboratory analysis based on the sensor
    depth. Horizontal colored lines represent the location of each soil moisture sensors
    across the core. The cores were filled with 15 kg of silica sand and evenly trapped
    along the sides in a uniform manner to prevent air gaps. To avoid variance in
    compaction, cores were only proceeded to be used if greater than 2.5 yet less
    than 5 cm of space was present at the top of the core. As each core held the same
    mass of sand and was equal in volume, anything outside of these parameters was
    determined to have a variance in compaction and was not used in the experiment.
    SMPs were installed in the center of each core following the manufacturer’s installation
    protocols (Sentek Drill and Drop SDI-12 Series III, 2015). Following SMP installation,
    the cores remained undisturbed for 1.5 hours to allow for temperature adjustment
    and soil settling. Subsequently, the 500ml solution containing either N, P, or
    K was applied. The solution was evenly poured onto the core’s surface using a
    custom-made strainer, ensuring uniform distribution across the top surface. After
    the solution had thoroughly passed through the strainer, the core remained undisturbed
    for 24 hours. At the end of the 24-hour period, the SMPs were carefully positioned
    horizontally to prevent further seepage. The core was then divided into six distinct
    10 cm sections (Figure 3), corresponding to the descending depths of sensors within
    the SMP. These soil sections were compositely, air-dried for P and K or stored
    in the refrigerator for N, before being sent for analysis. N and K soil samples
    were sent to Water’s Agricultural Laboratory (Camilla, GA) for extraction and
    analysis while P soil samples were sent to UF IFAS Everglades Research and Education
    Center’s soil lab for Mehlich III extraction and analysis. 2.4 Data analysis The
    time series obtained per treatment were evaluated by assessing three VIC points
    within the time series and their comparison by ANOVA. These points attained were
    identified as the maximum point (MP), inflection point (IP), and the convergence
    point (CV). The MP was evaluated in two ways: the MP value (MPv) and its time
    of occurrence (MPt), which together represent the highest VIC reading given by
    the SMS within the SMP at its given depth. The inflection point was also evaluated
    in two ways: the IP value (IPv) and its time of occurrence (IPt), which together
    represent the slope of drainage after the nutrient solution has passed down to
    deeper soil layers, or the soil is under its water-available field capacity conditions.
    The CV was only evaluated in value as it is the final normalized value taken after
    24 hours, making its time of occurrence equal in each repetition. The CV represents
    the ‘settling point’ of the solution. A visual representation of these points
    is displayed in Figure 4. Graphs were obtained from each repetition of each treatment;
    Figure 4 is a sample of the first repetition in the K experiment presented here
    as a visual guide. figure 4 Figure 4 Identification of signal dispersions in the
    time series from raw data (A) and normalized data (B) from the potassium trial
    at 5 cm depth. Circles represent the maximum points per treatment (MP), squares
    represent inflection points per treatment (IP), and triangles represent the convergence
    points per treatment (CV). As the purpose of this research is to evaluate these
    currently used SMP’s ability to detect nutrients in the soil, it was important
    that the elements of the VIC curve analyzed were elements that reflect the current
    time series management for irrigation scheduling by farmers. the University of
    Florida Electronic Data Information Source (EDIS) offers guidelines to interpret
    time series elements and values to assist growers in irrigation management (Zotarelli
    et al., 2019). The MP value in this study is equivalent to what a grower would
    identify as the irrigation event peak during an irrigation event. IP represents
    the major change in the time series slope (Phlips et al., 2021), which is similar
    to the practical method used by growers to identify soil field capacity, or the
    ‘slope of drainage’. CV represents the final value in the time series where there
    is no more downward movement of nutrients. This is the only value that can be
    directly compared to the laboratory analysis as it is static. Following the identification
    of the MPs, the raw time-series data Y=({ y 1 , y 2 , …, y n }) was normalized
    to a range of (0,1) for IP and CV identification. IPs were detected using the
    changepoint algorithm following the description from Killick and Eckley (2014),
    and adapted as follows in Equations 2–4: Let ( y 1:n ) represent the sequence
    of data points from the first ( y 1 ) to the last observation in the time series
    ( y n ). Under the null hypothesis ( H 0 ) , it is assumed that no changepoint
    exists in the time series. Let ( L 0 ) be the maximum log-likelihood under this
    hypothesis, which is defined as: L 0 =logp( y 1:n ∣ ∣ θ ˆ ) (2) Here, p(⋅) represents
    the probability density function associated with the distribution of the data,
    and θ ˆ =[ μ ˆ ,  σ ˆ  ] is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the mean
    and standard deviation that best fit the distribution of Y . Under the alternative
    hypothesis ( H a ) , a changepoint at ( τ 1 ) is assumed to exist. Let L( τ 1
    ) be the maximum log-likelihood under this hypothesis, which is defined as: L(
    τ 1 )=log p( y (1: τ 1 ) ∣ ∣ θ ˆ 1 )+log p( y ( τ 1 +1:n) ∣ ∣ θ ˆ 2 ) (3) The
    likelihood ratio test statistic λ is constructed using L 0 and L( τ 1 ) , and
    is defined as: λ=2[ max τ 1 L( τ 1 )− L 0 ] (4) Therefore, the test is performed
    by selecting a threshold (c) such that the null hypothesis is rejected if λ>c
    . If the null hypothesis is rejected the position τ 1 is estimated and considered
    as the detected changepoint Following the identification of the MP, IP, and CV
    values, the one-way ANOVA followed by the post hoc Tukey test was performed to
    identify differences among the treatments. By utilizing ANOVA, MPs IPs and CVs
    could be compared across application rates, and immediately determine if the MPs
    IPs and CVs changed in a significant matter with the application of N, P, or K.
    Significant changes in MP IP or CV would indicate the SMPs’ sensitivity to the
    presence of the nutrient, while the absence of significance would indicate a lack
    of SMPs’ sensitivity to the presence of the nutrient. The two-way ANOVA followed
    by post hoc Tukey was performed on the laboratory analysis results for the N,
    P, and K using both treatment and SMS depth as variables to understand the individual
    variable impact and their interactions. The remaining of this study will use the
    following nomenclature for clarity in the results. ‘Experiments’ will refer to
    the entire set of measurements taken from either N, P, or K. ‘Applications’ will
    refer to the nutrient rates applied, including the control, low, average, and
    high application rates. ‘Repetition’ refers to how many times the applications
    were repeated. For example: The 1st repetition of the low application in the N
    experiment would refer to the time series obtained from the first time the low
    nitrogen nutrient application was applied to a core. 3 Results and discussion
    3.1 Maximum point 3.1.1 Value of maximum point Among the three tested nutrients,
    only K has significant differences (Table 2). The analysis of MPv differences
    related to K was approached by comparing MPv across different treatments. When
    comparing MPv per depth and application rate, an increase in MPv was observed
    in direct correlation with each application rate except at 15 cm depth, where
    the highest K application yielded a lower MPv than the low and average applications
    (Figure 5). Results from the control treatment showed that the top five SMSs displayed
    similar MPv, ranging from 894-945 VIC units. However, the sixth SMS, situated
    at 55 cm depth, recorded a VIC measurement of 1079 units, which is higher than
    the readings of the top five sensors. This deviation might be attributed to a
    change in sensor sensitivity, due to increased soil water resulting from downward
    water movement within the soil core, In this context, higher water content leads
    to a higher VIC reading. table 2 Table 2 ANOVA maximum point value means for N,
    P, and K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). figure 5 Figure 5 Maximum
    Point Values (MPv) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0,
    1.02, 1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). The mean values displayed
    in Table 2 confirm that each K application rate resulted in a higher MPv than
    the control, as indicated by the Tukey letter groupings. However, while treatments
    were different from the control, they did not differ from each other in the 5-35
    cm depths. There is an increase in MPv in the average and high treatments compared
    to the low treatment at 45 cm, and increases in MPv across all applications at
    55 cm. A steady increase in MPv at those depths is observed as the concentration
    of K increases. Differences in VIC at the lower depths could be attributed to
    soil water influence. Soil water has an influence and positive correlation on
    the electrical conductivity (EC) of soils (Mojid et al., 2007). In a study conducted
    by Brevik et al. (2006), to understand the effect of soil water content changes
    on soil EC, it was shown that the electrical conductivity was greatly influenced
    by soil water. 3.1.2 Time of maximum point occurrence After evaluating the MPt,
    it was evident that, among the three tested nutrients, only K exhibited significant
    differences. When comparing MPt at each depth within individual application rates,
    an increase in MPt was observed in direct correlation with each increasing application
    rate. Figure 6 shows that each application rate at each depth showed an increase
    in MPt compared to the control application. While every application yielded higher
    MPt than the control, the greatest application of K did not always result in the
    greatest MPt reached. In Figure 6, at the 15 cm depth, the highest K application
    yielded a slightly lower MPt than the average application. Table 3 shows that
    the difference between these values are statistically similar. The 5, 25, and
    35 cm depths display a steady increase in MPt consistent with the increase in
    K application applied. figure 6 Figure 6 Maximum Point Time (MPt) averaged from
    each repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0, 1.02, 1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha)
    at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). table 3 Table 3 ANOVA Maximum Point Time (MPt)
    means for N, P, and K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). Table 3 shows
    that, from 15 cm though 45 cm depth, each K application yields a significantly
    higher MPt than the control. However, the increase in MPt at 5 cm depth is only
    significant for the high application rate if compared to the control. Furthermore,
    at 15 cm, the high and average application MPts are higher than the low application,
    showing the sensor ability to differentiate between application rates. In this
    study, the sensor VIC changes are used as an indication of their sensitiveness
    to K presence and movement in the soil. As the VIC sensor readings are potentially
    impacted by soil water, it is possible that the presence of any nutrient increasing
    electrical conductivity has the potential to delay the MPt. This delay of the
    MPt could potentially be a method of K detection in soil media. These results
    are in accordance to the findings of Thompson et al. (2007), where it was shown
    that ,in a sand column experiment, the soil water content increases approximately
    2-5% with 1 dS/m increase in the EC. Peddinti et al. (2020) used KCl to examine
    salinity effect on capacitance based sensor volumetric water content readings
    and observed similar results where the sensor’s sensitiveness to measuring volumetric
    water content is affected by soil solution salinity. Table 4 shows that K generally
    remained in the top 30 cm of the soil core. These laboratory results were in agreement
    with the results obtained for MPt (Table 3), as the two depths with distinction
    between treatments are at 5 and 15 cm sensor depth, below the 30 cm mark. It was
    observed that there was a stronger difference in MPt at the 15 cm sensor than
    the 5 cm sensor, which could be attributed to K settling in that layer. The passage
    of K and the settling of residual K could have provided greater signal delay at
    15 cm than at 5 cm. This phenomenon is observed for all K application rates. After
    25 cm, each treatment’s MPt occurred at or very near the end of the 24 hours’
    period. As there was only one water application for each repetition, this delay
    is likely the combined impact of water and K not reaching the depth until much
    later, as well as the possible overshadowing of the soil water signal over the
    lower application rates of K at those depths. table 4 Table 4 ANOVA results from
    N, P, and K laboratory samples mean at various depths and rates. Comparing the
    K results with those from N, there was not a MPt delay. This response could be
    attributed to the high mobility of N in water causing lesser accumulation of it
    at one depth, which therefore resulted in no impact on the MPt. NH4+ is highly
    soluble in water and do not easily bind with the soil particles moving quickly
    through the core. According to Casey et al. (2002) the mobility and availability
    of N is increased with an increase in soil moisture. The low cation exchange capacity
    (CEC) of the pure sand media used in this study might have enhanced N mobility,
    particularly in the NH4+ form (Matschonat and Vogt, 1996; Bigelow et al., 2001;
    Phillips, 2002). 3.2 Inflection point 3.2.1 Inflection point value Similar to
    MPv and MPt, significant differences in IPv were only present in the K experiment.
    When comparing IPv at each sensor depth within application rates, an increase
    was observed in direct correlation with each application (Figure 7). As is observed
    in Figure 7, each application at depths 5 and 15 yielded a higher IPv than the
    control application, in the general form of an upward trend. However, 5 and 15
    cm were the only depths in the experiment that yielded an IPv across each application
    rate. The 25 and 35 cm depths showed an increase in IPv in the low application,
    but no IPv occurred at the average or high application. The 45 and 55 cm depths
    only yielded an IPv within the control. figure 7 Figure 7 Inflection Point value
    (IPv) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0, 1.02, 1.52,
    and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). While Figure 7 exhibited general
    increasing trends in IPv across all applications at both the 5 and 15 cm depths,
    Table 5 shows that the 5 cm depth was the only depth at which IPv increased at
    a significant rate as K application rate increased. At the 5 cm depth, each application
    rate was different from each other in addition to the control and display the
    ability for IPv to distinguish between application rates of K applied. The absence
    of IPv below the 15 cm depth could be attributed to the nature of the experimental
    design in our study, where a single water/nutrient application was performed per
    repetition. Although results were not significant for N, and P application rates
    and depths, IPv were observed up to the 35 cm depth for N, and across all depths
    for P. Future experiments should consider longer repetitions and more frequent
    watering to identify the sensitivity of sensors below 30 cm depth to nutrient
    availability. table 5 Table 5 ANOVA inflection point value means for N, P, and
    K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). 3.2.2 Time of inflection point occurrence
    When comparing IPt at each depth within individual K application rates, there
    is a direct correlation between the increase in IPt and each application rate
    at depths 5 and 15 cm (Figure 8). At the 5 cm depth, IPt increases directly with
    the increased rate of K applications. At the 15 cm depth, there is an overall
    increase at application rate increases, with a slight decrease at the highest
    application rate. IPts only occur at the lowest application rates for 25 and 35
    cm depths, and only occur within the control application at the 45 and 55 cm depths.
    Table 6 shows that only the SMS at the 5 cm depth shows significant increases
    in IPt across the K application rates. Similarly, each application rate had a
    higher IPt compared to the control and was significantly different from each other.
    This indicates IPt’s potential to detect differences in K concentration within
    the soil at the 5 cm depth after 24 hours post-application. figure 8 Figure 8
    Inflection Point Time (IPts) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl)
    rate (0, 1.02, 1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). table 6 Table
    6 ANOVA inflection point time means for N, P, and K treatments at each sensor
    depth (5-55 cm). 3.3 Convergence value Table 7 shows no significant differences
    in the N and P experiments, while K yielded results indicating its detection through
    CV analysis. When comparing CVs across applications at each depth, there is a
    strong observable increase in CV as the K application rate increases within the
    5 to 35 cm range (Figure 9). Unlike the MP and IP analysis, in each of the instances
    the increased application rate yielded an increased mean value CV down to the
    35 cm depth. At the 45 and 55 cm depths, the CV maintains high both at the control
    and each K application treatment. table 7 Table 7 ANOVA convergence value means
    for N, P, and K treatments at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). figure 9 Figure 9 Convergence
    values (CVs) averaged per repetition in relation to the K (KCl) rate (0, 1.02,
    1.52, and 2.04 kg/ha) at each sensor depth (5-55 cm). A direct correlation between
    CVs and application rate of KCl applied is observable. From the surface down to
    35 cm, the statistical comparison of CV between treatments showed that the SMP
    successfully distinguished each treatment from the control (Table 7). CVs did
    not distinguish between treatments however, and were only capable of detecting
    the presence or absence of K. The laboratory results are consistent with the CV
    findings were it was confirmed the presence of K from the soil surface down to
    35 cm. A slight contrast found in the laboratory result was the identification
    that K was present down to the 40-50 cm depths, while difference in CV were not
    found across treatments at that level. Although there were not differences below
    the 35 cm depth, a pooling effect may have occurred due to the movement of water
    to the lower layers of the core. This might have influenced the VIC signals due
    to the presence of K in the solution. 3.4 Soil nutrient laboratory results Table
    4 suggests no significant difference in N rate throughout each sensor depth and
    each treatment, ranging from 0.05 – 0.103% TN. Laboratory analysis confirmed undetectable
    P concentrations for the control and low treatments. In the high treatment, P
    mostly remained in the top 20 cm of the soil core, with a smaller amount descending
    up to the 40 cm depth. K analysis suggests this nutrient was mobile, up to the
    60 cm depth for the average and high treatments. Despite its mobility, mean values
    suggest the highest concentrations of K were mostly found at 20 and 30 cm depth
    for average and high treatments, respectively. The treatment and the SMS depth
    interaction results indicated significance for P (p-value = 1.12E-11), whereas
    the N (p-value = 0.883) and K (p-value = 0.778) displayed no significant interaction
    effects. 4 Discussion 4.1 VIC sensor values as indicators of nutrient presence
    in the soil profile K’s presence in the soil and nutrient location can be determined
    by assessing MP, IP, and CV values from SMS readings. MPv was particularly successful
    at differentiating between the control and each application rate. In the topsoil
    layers, regardless of the application rate applied, MPv showed higher values than
    the control. IP was the most successful at distinguishing between application
    rates. Each application rate at the 5 cm mark had an increasing IPv and IPt as
    application rate increased. CV gave the strongest indication of whether K was
    present in the cores. While this method could not differentiate between application
    rates, CVs clearly increased in the presence of K at each rate. Related studies
    evaluating sensing conductance methods have found that sensor readings can be
    an indirect method to assess major nutrients in the soil (Eigenberg et al., 2002;
    Korsaeth, 2005). MP measurements could be a good indicator for the development
    of real-time precision nutrient management systems. As more studies on conductance-based
    sensor development are produced (Basterrechea et al., 2020; Rocher et al., 2020),
    more information would be available for the development of robust decision-support
    systems related to the potential nature, concentration, or location of K within
    a field, after in-field sensor calibration is completed. Progress in the incorporation
    of in-field sensors for the indirect assessment of nutrients through fertigation
    are underway (Avşar and Mowla, 2022) and under development. This, along with the
    findings from this study, can contribute to a more practical and data-based in-field
    nutrient management. While IP does not provide immediate results and is dependent
    on the CV, IP showed the best ability to distinguish between application rates
    and correlate them to K rates within the soil. MP from in-field SMPs and SMSs
    could be used as a real-time water saving parameter for nutrient management as
    this data is available, but underutilized. An increased or delayed MP during a
    fertigation event, when nutrients are applied through irrigation, would be an
    indicator of potentially increased K within the soil. This could determine how
    far down into the soil the K is moving and provide information to prevent nutrient
    leaching and environmental pollution in freshwater systems (Pathan et al., 2007).
    After such irrigation event occurs, as the soil begins to dry and IP and CV points
    are identified, IP could be used to quantify the concentration of K in the soil
    that may have been or was a risk of leaching, and CV used to finalize the resting
    place of the K after the event. This information would be useful in both identifying
    the movement of K in the soils during an irrigation event, as well as identifying
    the final location of K after the event. Furthermore, the nutrients in this experiment
    were studied separately but understanding the interactions between the nutrients,
    soil types and their combined effect of VIC is dynamic and should be studied to
    provide precise real time information to the end users. The N and P control treatments
    at 55 cm have higher MPv, MPt, IPv, and IPt (Tables 2, 3, 5, 6) than the other
    treatments, potentially indicating an effect of the fertilizer presence on the
    moisture movement or a water cumulation effect. This scenario was not observed
    in K due to its high solubility nature compared to N and P and using pure sand
    as a medium, allowing more rapid nutrient movement (Table 4). The soil medium
    can influence sensor conductivity. Generally, the impacts of soil-water osmotic
    potential alterations are not considered for soil-water movement unless the solutes
    are in substantial amounts (Or and Wraith, 2002). However, in this study, this
    might have influenced the SMS readings. Masrie et al. (2017) developed and tested
    an optical transducer sensor for the detection of N, P, and K in soil, and found
    that soil characteristics in the presence of nutrients influence the frequency
    wavelength for sensor detection. This study suggest that SMSs require voltage
    thresholds that variates based on the nutrient assessed. Laboratory results confirmed
    that P was primarily present in the top 20 cm of the cores, yet despite statistical
    analysis comparing MPv, MPt, IPv, IPt, and CVs no significant differences were
    observed. Our results-keeping in mind this study only tested one form of each
    element in a pure sand soil type-suggest that the SMP primarily detects K ions
    from the fertilizers applied and can be used as part of currently available irrigation
    scheduling decision support systems (DSS). Several methods of combining irrigation
    sensing technology with soil moisture prediction models (Kashyap and Kumar, 2021)
    and DSSs (Rinaldi and He, 2014) are available. Any variation in the MP, IP, or
    CV could indicate potential K presence in the soil. However, this signal variation
    could also originate from other ions in the soil with a sufficiently strong osmotic
    potential. Although the interactions between N, P, and K when combined has yet
    to be explored, such interactions could potentially enhance their VIC signals.
    5 Conclusion This study demonstrated that the SMPs’ VIC readings have the ability
    to detect K within the soil profile and provide an indication of its rate and
    location. The statistical analysis from MP, IP, and CV from 24-hour VIC readings
    has proven to be an effective method for K detection. While our study did not
    yield significant results for N and P, mean value comparison hints at the potential
    for detection, possibly through other indirect methods, or different forms of
    N and P that yield strong VIC in soil. The results from this study can serve as
    a foundation for implementing fertigation management programs, focusing on water
    and K movement in the soil, and indirectly managing N and P by maintaining water
    within the effective root zone depth for crops. Future work should investigate
    temperature differences related to in-field seasonal patterns. Utilizing IP as
    a way of differentiating nutrient concentrations showed great promise at the 10
    cm depth. Overall, integrating nutrient management strategies into existing agricultural
    technologies, such as the SMPs investigated in this study, is crucial to accelerating
    the adoption of precision agriculture technology in practical applications within
    the agricultural industry. Data availability statement The raw data supporting

    a salient global issue with 828 million people worldwide experiencing hunger (1,
    2). Advanced high-throughput phenotyping techniques have revolutionized breeding
    efforts by swiftly collecting comprehensive phenotypic data from plant populations
    (3, 4). It allows for more effective and informed plant breeding decisions, thereby
    facilitating the rapid development of improved plant varieties (5–7). Existing
    methods for capturing phenotypic traits predominantly rely on imaging technologies
    (8), robotics (9), and drones (10). However, these approaches have substantial
    limitations in terms of providing customized, continuous, and high spatiotemporal
    resolution monitoring (11). In addition, the currently used devices that are mounted
    on plants are often rigid, heavy, and opaque, exhibiting mechanical and optical
    mismatch with plants (12–14). This discordance can lead to inaccuracies in measurement
    and potential harm to plants. Therefore, nondestructive, continuous, and long-term
    acquisition of phenotypic data are urgently needed for monitoring multiple traits
    for crop breeding. The recent efforts toward plant sensor development have aimed
    to meet this need and to address the mechanical mismatch issues. Advances in human
    wearable electronics (15–23) have prompted botanical applications (24, 25), enabling
    the monitoring of plant conditions through the capture of physical signals like
    growth, surface temperature, and humidity (26–30), chemical signals like volatile
    organic compounds and hormones (31, 32), as well as biopotential signals (33–35).
    The mechanical adhesion is achieved progressively, from using an adhesive tape
    on leaves (36), conformal wrapping of flexible sensors around stems (37), direct
    inkjet writing/printing (38, 39), and vapor polymer printing (40, 41) on leaves,
    to the recent employment of epidermal electronics that can be seamlessly and directly
    attached to leaves (42, 43). Despite these advancements, the existing plant epidermal
    electronics still present limitations in effective monitoring of dynamic plant
    growth over time due to limited stretchability and softness. Furthermore, an aspect
    that has often been overlooked is the consideration of optical transparency, which
    is a critical factor for developing sensors for plants with photosynthetic activities.
    Organic materials that can be made flexible and transparent are promising candidates
    for developing plant sensors. Meanwhile, organic materials also stand out for
    their low-cost, biodegradability, and biocompatibility, which are essential for
    not only plants but also sustainable world. The commercially available poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
    polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is one intrinsically flexible and transparent
    organic material, thus can serve the flexibility and optical transparency purpose
    with their good electrical conductance. However, it has been challenging to develop
    all-organic epidermal sensors due to the difficulties in micropatterning the flexible,
    conductive organic material on another thin soft polymer substrate (44–47). Here,
    we report an all-organic plant epidermal sensor, namely, plant e-skin, that is
    both mechanically and optically invisible for non-invasive plant physiology monitoring.
    The plant e-skin is realized by developing a scalable microfabrication process
    to enable the micropatterning of transparent PEDOT:PSS on a stretchable, transparent
    polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate (Fig. 1A). The successful development of
    this process marks a minimum feature size of 2-μm PEDOT:PSS pattern on a stretchable
    elastomer, paving the way for the development of high-density transparent epidermal
    sensors, displays, and other functional devices. With the transparent, ultrathin,
    and stretchable nature, the plant e-skin can be configured into strain and temperature
    sensors with tailored micropatterns, allowing continuous and real-time monitoring
    of plant growth and surface temperature when attached to leaf epidermis. Experimental
    tests of the strain sensors attached on the juvenile leaves of live Brassica rapa
    revealed distinct diurnal growth patterns with minimal growth during the day and
    predominant growth at night, as well as varying growth rates under different abiotic
    stress conditions. Application of the temperature sensor also captured surface
    temperature dynamics of the corresponding conditions, which would facilitate the
    timely intervention of heat stress. Toward broader practical impact, a virtual
    digital-twin plant is developed, allowing real-time visualization and analysis
    of leaf surface temperature (Fig. 1B). We envision that construction of the virtual
    digital-twin plant interface, aided by the plant e-skin, paves the way for efficient
    monitoring of plants and expedited decision-making in crop breeding as well as
    precision farming. Fig. 1. Fabrication and characteristics of the plant e-skin.

    of the plant e-skin To monitor plant physiological status in a noninvasive manner,
    biocompatibility, transparency, stretchability, and conformability are desired
    simultaneously. A scalable microfabrication process is developed to manufacture
    all-organic plant e-skins that meets all these requirements based on simple lithography
    and lift-off process (Fig. 1A). Detailed fabrication process can be found in fig.
    S1 and Materials and Methods. Table S1 is provided to illustrate the scalability
    of PEDOT:PSS-based transparent e-skin in previous literatures. The all-organic
    plant e-skin is essentially a micropatterned PEDOT:PSS conductive component on
    one PDMS layer and encapsulated by another layer of PDMS. PEDOT:PSS was chosen
    as the conductive component because of its exceptional transparency and conductivity.
    Its biocompatibility further extends its applications to biomedical engineering
    field. Specifically in relation to plants, the transparency and biocompatibility
    of PEDOT:PSS align well with the requirements of developing plant e-skins that
    can be attached to the plants without any observable adverse effects to plant
    health. While achieving a well-defined pattern of PEDOT:PSS on the stretchable
    elastomeric substrate poses a considerable technological challenge, we have succeeded
    to demonstrate the ability to create PEDOT:PSS patterns on PDMS substrate with
    the feature sizes ranging from 100 μm all the way down to 2 μm, as illustrated
    in Fig. 1C. Besides, the versatility of the proposed fabrication process is demonstrated
    by creating intricate patterns of PEDOT:PSS, such as the university logo with
    a lion (Fig. 1D) and alphabets (Fig. 1E), despite their complicated structures
    and varying resolutions. Figure 1F demonstrates the remarkable transparency of
    the as-fabricated e-skin, exhibiting transmittance exceeding 85% within the wavelength
    range of 400 to 700 nm, which aligns perfectly with that required for plant photosynthesis.
    The inserted image exemplifies the plant e-skin’s outstanding transparency, allowing
    for a clear view of the outside scene when affixed to a clean glass. The plant
    e-skin has a thickness of only 4.5 μm (fig. S5), consisting of a layer of PEDOT:PSS
    sandwiched between the PDMS substrate and encapsulation layer where the thickness
    of PEDOT:PSS thin film is 120 nm (fig. S6A). The dependence of transparency and
    conductivity on different PEDOT:PSS thickness are presented in fig. S6 (B and
    C, respectively). Owing to the high transparency together with the ultrathin thickness,
    our plant e-skin offers a superior advantage by enabling seamless attachment to
    a wide range of plant leaves. As shown in fig. S7, we successfully attached the
    plant e-skin to a B. rapa leaf. The midrib and vein of this leaf remain clearly
    visible through the attached sensor, affirming its excellent transparency and
    conformability. Moreover, the plant e-skin can be applied to different kinds of
    leaves with varying surface roughness, including (i) sweet potato, (ii) Zamioculcas
    zamiifolia, (iii) Peperomia argyreia, and (iv) Coleus scutellarioides (Fig. 1G).
    The plant e-skins demonstrate durability, where secure attachment is maintained
    even when the leaves undergo wilting (Fig. 1H and fig. S8). The shear adhesion
    forces between our e-skin and leaves are characterized in fig. S9, which all exceed
    0.2 N with varying leaves, or under various scenarios including wilting, fast
    water flow, and immersion in water. A detailed discussion on adhesion force is
    provided in the Supplementary Materials. Therefore, our all-organic plant e-skin
    has superior characteristics in transparency, stretchability, biocompatibility,
    and conformability. Furthermore, micropatterning PEDOT:PSS on the PDMS provides
    great insights to the plant e-skin for applications with denser integrations.
    Figure 1I compares our plant e-skin with the state-of-the-art plant electronics,
    showing that our plant e-skin is the first of its kind to fulfill all the necessary
    requirements for effective and noninvasive monitoring of plants. Figure 2 shows
    the morphology and performance characterization of our plant e-skin patterned
    into strain sensor and temperature sensor. Regarding the strain sensor, we mixed
    the base sensing material PEDOT:PSS with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 5% d-sorbitol
    as they are the commonly used additives to improve conductivity and stretchability
    of PEDOT:PSS. As shown in fig. S10, the sheet resistance is improved by two orders
    of magnitude after the addition of DMSO and d-sorbitol. The additive-processed
    PEDOT:PSS is defined as p-PEDOT:PSS. The p-PEDOT:PSS film is then sandwiched by
    a top and bottom PDMS thin film to further enhance its stretchability and stability.
    Figure 2A exhibits the schematic drawing of the strain sensor. The sensing part
    is formed by a zig-zag structure where four narrow PEDOT:PSS line resistors are
    connected in series. It is designed according to the common design guideline of
    strain gauges (48–51). Three images in Fig. 2B display the zoomed-in structure
    of the strain sensor, showing the accurate definition of PEDOT:PSS pattern. A
    typical relative resistance change-strain response of the strain sensor is shown
    in Fig. 2C. We have characterized the performance of the strain sensor from initial
    length to a strain of 100%. The resistance change is calculated as ∆ R / R 0 =
    ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 (1) where R0 is the initial resistance of the strain sensor
    and R is the real-time resistance under strain. It is observed that the values
    of resistance change increased with increasing strain level. Sensitivity of the
    strain sensor can be defined as ε Gauge factor ( GF ) = ∆ R / ( R 0 · ε ) (2)
    where ε is the applied strain. When the strain is lower than 60%, GF = 1.15 and
    it reaches 4.13 when the applied strain is higher than 60%. The observed increase
    in resistance under tensile strain is predominantly attributed to geometric alterations
    at small strain levels and the development of cracks in the PEDOT:PSS film at
    higher strain levels (52–54). A comprehensive elucidation of the strain sensing
    mechanism, accompanied by scanning electron microscopy images showcasing the phenomenon
    of crack propagation, is presented in text S1, along with fig. S2. When the e-skin
    strain sensor was held at specific strains for a period of time, the relative
    resistance changes remained stable without distinct drifts, affirming the stability
    of the sensing signals (Fig. 2D). To further verify the long-term stability of
    the e-skin strain sensor, we recorded its resistance for approximately 6 days
    as shown in Fig. 2E. The results demonstrate minimal fluctuations in resistance
    throughout the entire duration, confirming its effectiveness for prolonged monitoring
    of plant leaves. Fig. 2. Electrical performance of the plant e-skin functioning

    sensor. (B) Zoomed-in structure of the sensing region of the strain sensor. Inset:

    the PEDOT:PSS patterns on the PDMS substrate. Scale bar, 500 μm. (H) Relative
    resistance change and temperature response of the temperature sensor. In addition
    to functioning as a strain sensor, our plant e-skin offers the convenience of
    easily transforming into a temperature sensor by modifying the device morphology
    and leveraging the thermoresistive effect in PEDOT:PSS. Prior investigations have
    affirmed that the conductivity characteristics of PEDOT:PSS thin films align with
    the variable range hopping model, demonstrating a discernible decrease in resistivity
    as temperature increases (55–57). A comprehensive elucidation of its temperature-dependent
    conductivity is provided in text S2. This e-skin temperature sensor is developed
    based on the pure PEDOT:PSS as the sensing layer and PDMS as the substrate and
    encapsulation layers as well. As shown in Fig. 2 (F and G), the sensing part of
    the temperature sensor is patterned into a meander shape to minimize the fluctuations
    caused by strain (15, 58). The performance of our temperature sensor is characterized
    by measuring the relative resistance change across a temperature range of 24°
    to 39°C. A negative linear relationship between relative resistance change and
    temperature is observed (Fig. 2H). This is attributed to the enhanced charge transport
    within the PEDOT:PSS percolation network at higher temperature, and the insulting
    PSS chains being more extended and aligned to facilitate stronger intermolecular
    interactions between conductive PEDOT particles. Temperature coefficient of resistance
    (TCR) is used to quantify the performance of our temperature sensor, which is
    defined as TCR = ( R − R 0 ) / R 0 ( T − T 0 ) (3) where R is the resistance under
    temperature T, and R0 is the resistance under temperature T0. As revealed from
    the slope in Fig. 2H, the TCR of our temperature sensor is approximately 0.5%/°C.
    On-leaf biocompatibility test and monitoring Biocompatibility is a critical prerequisite
    for plant sensors, particularly those designed to establish intimate contact with
    biological tissues. To assess the application potential of our plant e-skin for
    nondisruptive plant monitoring, we conducted extended on-plant monitoring tests.
    First, we examined their biocompatibility by attaching them to the leaves of Epipremnum
    aureum as shown in Fig. 3A. Throughout the 65-day experiment, no signs of leaf
    yellowing or withering were observed. Notably, not only did the three original
    small roots exhibit elongation but also new roots and leaves emerged (indicated
    by the yellow arrows). In addition, we conducted similar investigation in two
    other pots, each initially containing one or two leaves, as photographed in fig.
    S11. Both pots exhibited the development of new roots and leaves during the monitoring
    period. The observed growth of plants in all the pots strongly suggests that the
    plant e-skin used in the experiment displayed biocompatibility, with no adverse
    effects on plant rooting, sprouting, or overall growth. Photosynthesis is crucial
    for plants as it is the process through which they convert sunlight, water, and
    carbon dioxide into energy-rich sugars, providing the foundation for their growth,
    metabolism, and overall physiological functions. Despite the extensive efforts
    devoted to plant sensors with various functions, the potential long-term effects
    of on-leaf attachments on photosynthesis have received limited attention. Carbon-based
    flexible materials, though commonly used in flexible electronics and wearable
    sensors, may not be ideal candidates for plant sensors because of their inadequate
    optical transmittance in the visible light range. To demonstrate the necessity
    of visible optical transmittance for nondisruptive on-leaf monitoring, we attached
    the plant e-skin and a carbon-based black film on one leaf of B. rapa (oilseed
    sarson) for 14 days. After removing the two films, the region covered by the plant
    e-skin showed no obvious change, while the one underneath the black film exhibited
    discoloration, indicating the reduction of chlorophyll content in the applied
    area (fig. S12). This suggests that device blocking light transmission can significantly
    affect the biological composition of the monitored leaves, potentially causing
    damage to the overall plant health over extended monitoring periods. On top of
    light absorption, carbon dioxide absorption and oxygen release are also important
    aspects in photosynthesis. Stomata, which are the pores for gas exchange, are
    primarily distributed on the abaxial (bottom) side of leaves in dicotyledonous
    plant species (59). Optical images of stomatal distribution on both adaxial (top)
    and abaxial (bottom) surfaces of different kinds of leaves verify this phenomenon
    in fig. S13. Because our e-skin is attached on the top side of the leaves with
    few stomata, it would not impede normal gas exchange in photosynthesis. Meanwhile,
    both PEDOT:PSS film and PDMS are reported to be gas and vapor permeable (60–66).
    Thus, our e-skin shows negligible impact during photosynthesis. Besides, we also
    attached the plant e-skin and two adhesive tapes on the B. rapa leaf. The adhesive
    tapes are often used in many plant sensors to help adhesion on the leaves. We
    observed that the plant e-skin could be removed successfully without destroying
    the leaf. In contrast, the removal of the two adhesive tapes resulted in the detrimental
    rupture of the leaves (fig. S14). Thus, our plant e-skin exhibits mechanical invisibility
    to plants with noninvasive monitoring capability both during and after tests.
    Considering the need for frequent watering in plants, we conducted additional
    investigations to assess the waterproof capability of the plant e-skin, as shown
    in fig. S15 and movie S1. The results demonstrate that the plant e-skin maintains
    strong adhesion to the leaf surface even when substantial amount of water was
    poured over it. Fig. 3. On-leaf biocompatibility test and monitoring. (A) Biocompatibility
    test of the plant e-skin with plants. (B) Photograph of the plant e-skin as strain
    sensor attached on the B. rapa leaf. (C) Performance of the strain sensor to monitor
    the growth pattern of B. rapa leaf during a 3-day period. (D) Photograph of the
    plant e-skin as temperature sensor attached on the B. rapa leaf. (E) Performance
    of the temperature sensor to monitor the surface temperature of the B. rapa leaf
    during a 3-day period (first day: light on; the following 2 days: light on/off,
    16 hours/8 hours). After confirming the biocompatibility and operation in a noninvasive
    manner, the strain sensor and temperature sensor were applied to monitor the growth
    and temperature of the leaves. Monitoring the growth of leaves, especially in
    leafy vegetables like Brassica, poses distinct challenges compared to tracking
    the expansion of fruits or detecting elongation in larger crop stems. The fragility
    and small size of leaves make it difficult to monitor their growth. Although nondestructive
    imaging has been widely used, tracking the growth of a single leaf typically requires
    mechanical fixation to keep it within the camera’s focal plane. However, this
    fixation method unavoidably restricts the plant’s regular physiological processes,
    potentially affecting its overall development. Our plant e-skin strain sensor
    that is specifically designed to cater to the unique demands of monitoring the
    growth of delicate and petite leaves should be able to record the elongation of
    the leaves while ensuring minimal disruption to the plant natural processes. As
    photographed in Fig. 3B, the strain sensor was uniformly attached to the juvenile
    leaf of a B. rapa to monitor its growth. The experimental growth chamber was maintained
    at a photoperiod of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. Figure 3C depicts
    the recorded relative resistance change of the strain sensor during a 3-day period,
    where the increase of the relative resistance change reveals the extension of
    the monitored leaves, i.e., growth. Leaf growth exhibited noncontinuous patterns,
    aligning with known growth behaviors where plants use stored energy to grow and
    elongate during nighttime while absorbing light for photosynthesis during the
    day (67–69). The growth condition of the leaf was estimated by quantifying the
    total relative resistance change. It indicated that the region of the leaf covered
    by the plant e-skin grew to 1.5 times its original length over the course of 3
    days. Notably, because the stretching of strain sensor will exert a reactive force
    on the plant, we further investigated the influence of this force on plant growth
    and it turns out that such force does not hinder overall plant growth (fig. S16).
    The successful monitoring of this growth pattern of the leaf again reflects the
    secure attachment of the e-skin sensor to the leaf and the reliable performance
    of the strain sensor. Simultaneously, the e-skin temperature sensor was also attached
    to the leaf surface to monitor its temperature, as displayed in Fig. 3D. The B.
    rapa was cultivated within a temperature-controlled growth chamber, which was
    maintained at a constant temperature of 26°C. On the first day, the light was
    continuously switched on, while during the following 2 days, the light was set
    in a photoperiod regimen consisting of 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness.
    The measured temperature data, as depicted in Fig. 3E, show that the temperature
    remained at stable 26°C when the light was constantly on. However, the temperature
    dropped significantly to a lower temperature of 19°C when light was switched off.
    Despite the chamber being regulated to a constant temperature, there were temperature
    variations on the surface of the plants. This phenomenon can be attributed to
    the heat emitted by the light when it is turned on, while no heat emission occurs
    during darkness. The temperature recording capability of the sensor, attached
    to the leaf surface, is thus confirmed. The distinctive role that this epidermal
    temperature sensor can fulfill is not achievable by commercially available temperature
    sensors, which lack the capability to monitor surface temperatures at a local
    scale. Consequently, this temperature sensor holds immense potential for acquiring
    the temperature on the leaf surface, thereby mitigating heat stress in leaves
    caused by excessive exposure to heat. It should be highly beneficial for precise
    cultivation of crops with high economic values. Growth and surface temperature
    monitoring of B. rapa under abiotic stress To demonstrate the practicality of
    our plant e-skin across distinct growing environment, we deployed the e-skin strain
    and temperature sensors on vegetative leaves of B. rapa, under both optimal environmental
    condition and abiotic stress condition, and monitored their respective growth
    metrics. Our investigation was centered on observing the growth patterns of plants
    in the presence of specific abiotic stressors, like combined heat and drought,
    which simulate real-world plant stressors typically encountered in farming environments.
    As schematically delineated in Fig. 4 (A and B), the ideal growth conditions for
    B. rapa were ensured by providing suitable temperature (26°C light/23°C dark)
    and sufficient water, whereas a separate group of plants was subjected to combined
    heat and drought stress by disrupting water supply and raising temperatures to
    8°C above control conditions (34°C light/31°C dark). Figure 4C illustrates the
    diurnal variation in surface temperature of leaves in the control group, which
    fluctuated between 26° and 22°C. In contrast, the leaf surface temperature for
    the group under abiotic stress, as illustrated in Fig. 4D, was recorded with fluctuations
    in higher temperatures of approximately 34°C during the day and 30°C at night.
    These observed temperature patterns align well with the preset parameters for
    both scenarios, thereby affirming temperature sensing capabilities of the newly
    developed epidermal sensors. Notably, the small variations between epidermal sensors
    and chamber’s temperature setting could be attributed to the uniformity of the
    temperature in the chambers. Strain sensors were attached to three juvenile leaves
    in both the control group (labeled as A, B, and C) and the abiotic stress group
    (labeled as a, b, and c). Figure 4E presents the growth patterns of the leaves
    in the control group, demonstrating that all three leaves exhibited discernible
    growth, as indicated by the increasing relative resistance changes. This growth
    was more pronounced during the night, followed by a plateau phase during the day,
    sharing a similar growth rhythm as mentioned before. However, the results depicted
    in Fig. 4F indicate that the group subjected to abiotic stress did not exhibit
    any significant change in resistance, implying a disruption in growth. Figure
    4 (G and H) illustrates the calculated relative resistance change of the applied
    strain sensors in the control group and the abiotic stress group, respectively.
    In the control group, the relative resistance change corresponds to approximately
    30, 35, and 55% growth strain for the three leaves, while the abiotic stress group
    recorded mere 5.5% strain across all three leaves. It is anticipated that the
    growth rates of the leaves exhibit variations across plants and leaves, accounting
    for different strain levels recorded for the three leaves in the control group.
    Nonetheless, under the impact of abiotic stress, the detrimental impact pervasively
    inhibited the growth across all the leaves. These results validate a pragmatic
    strategy to monitor the leaves if they are under certain abiotic stress in smart
    farming. The developed temperature sensors can record leaf surface temperatures,
    and the strain sensors can relay comprehensive information on plant growth status.
    The integration of both sensor types offers real-time data to agricultural practitioners,
    enabling prompt intervention to avert suboptimal plant growth. Furthermore, the
    developed sensors equip plant researchers with a more efficient, noninvasive approach
    to identify heat-resistant plant varieties and establish optimal growth temperatures.
    The pragmatic applications underscore considerable potential of our innovative
    sensors in both plant research and the broader context of smart agriculture. Fig.

    communication system has been developed as a smart farmer-farm interface to enrich
    the visualization of the plants’ status. Figure 5A depicts the information flow
    of the sensing signals. The described system, diagrammatically represented in
    Fig. 5A, uses sensors positioned on plant surfaces to record leaf surface temperatures.
    The collected data undergo conditioning by an electrical circuit, followed by
    processing and analog-digital conversion via an Arduino board. The generated digital
    output governs the behavior of a digital-twin plant in the virtual reality (VR)
    environment as displayed on the personal computer (PC), thereby allowing the leaf
    surface temperature in physical space to be mirrored by the color of the digital-twin
    leaf in the VR space. Figure 5B vividly demonstrates the instantaneous transference
    of real-space plant surface temperature to the VR counterpart. The objective is
    to simulate localized overheating scenario in precision agriculture, where the
    whole farming environment maintains a constant overall temperature. In this demonstration,
    four transparent e-skin temperature sensors are independently attached to four
    separate plants and connected to the communication system. The side view provides
    a clear identification of each plant’s location, denoted as ①, ②, ③, and ④. On
    the computer monitor, a VR space displays the corresponding leaf temperatures,
    initially recorded as 297.1, 297.3, 296.7, and 296.8 K under normal conditions.
    The top view focuses on two specific plants, ① and ②, situated in the upper shelf
    region where localized heating is mostly expected to occur. Temperature thresholds
    at 300 and 302 K are set to represent warm and overheating states, respectively,
    which are visualized by changing the digital-twin leaf color to yellow and red.
    Notably, the thresholds of 300 and 302 K are only chosen to emulate the warm and
    overheating state and do not represent the actual warm and overheating state of
    any specific plant. In practical applications, the threshold temperature can vary
    significantly from different types of plants and be set accordingly. In Fig. 5C,
    a mild, localized overheat was simulated by bringing a warm object (327 K) close
    to plant ①, causing only its temperature to increase, while the other three remain
    unaffected. This leads to a color shift in the corresponding digital-twin plant,
    transitioning it from green to yellow once the temperature reached 300 K. In Fig.
    5D, as a hot object (338 K) approaches plant ②, heat transmission resulted in
    a color shift of the digital-twin plant, from green to yellow and eventually to
    red, denoting the occurrence of an extreme heat stress in that specific area.
    Upon removal of the hot object, the temperature gradually decreases, as depicted
    by a color transition in the VR space from red to yellow and finally to green.
    The dynamic recording of the whole process can be found in movie S2. The digital-twin
    plant system thus demonstrates its practicality in translating the real-world
    plants into the VR space, visualizing distinct temperature states through intuitive
    color changes of the corresponding digital-twin plants. In addition to the proposed
    localized overheating monitoring, this digital-twin plant system can encompass
    plant growth surveillance by harnessing a strain sensor to gather leaf growth
    information. This innovative system potentially provides a visual platform for
    meticulous and timely monitoring in smart farming. Fig. 5. Application of the

    We have demonstrated an all-organic plant e-skin that can be conformably attached
    to and seamlessly integrated with plants to noninvasively monitor their physiological
    status. By developing a scalable microfabrication process using only organic PEDOT:PSS
    as conductive components and PDMS as substrates, we achieved biocompatibility,
    transparency, stretchability, and conformability simultaneously in our plant e-skin.
    Our reported 4.5-μm-thick plant e-skin with more than 85% transmittance across
    the visible spectrum are optically and mechanically invisible to plants, thus
    enabling long-term and real-time monitoring without any observable adverse effects
    to plant health. Leveraging these characteristics, we configured our plant e-skin
    into strain sensors and temperature sensors and achieved long-duration real-time
    plant growth and surface temperature monitoring. The on-plant monitoring results
    revealed the day/night leaf growth rhythms and the accompanying leaf surface temperature
    variations, demonstrating the capability of our plant e-skin to measure plant
    physiological signals for practical applications. It is worth noting that such
    capability of transducing real-time plant physiological signals is especially
    crucial for accelerating desirable phenotypes during precision breeding of new
    plant varieties. Furthermore, we constructed a digital-twin plant monitoring system
    as a farmer-farm interface to visualize the thermal status of leaf surface in
    real time. While the minimum feature size we achieved in the present study is
    2 μm, it is limited by the resolution of our lithography system. In principle,
    this minimum feature size can be reduced to submicrometer range for more dense
    integration. Apart from the demonstrated strain sensor and temperature sensor,
    other types of sensors can be expected by using the morphology and design flexibility
    offered by our scalable fabrication technique. We have preliminarily demonstrated
    the possibility of developing a flexible humidity sensor for monitoring the microenvironment
    of plants (fig. S17). In the future, the use of embedded conducting coils in the
    sensors is expected to enable wireless communication between plant e-skin and
    processors. Beyond plant growth monitoring applications, our demonstrated technology
    is also broadly applicable to epidermal electronics for human wearable and implantable
    devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials All the materials and chemicals used
    in this study are commercially available. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA; molecular weight
    = 89,000 to 98,000), PEDOT:PSS (1.3 wt % dispersion in H2O), d-sorbitol, and DMSO
    were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. PDMS (SYLGARD 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit) was
    purchased from Dow Corning. Fabrication of plant e-skin The scalable fabrication
    process is schematically demonstrated in fig. S4. PVA aqueous solution (8 wt %
    in H2O) was initially spin-coated onto a clean and smooth wafer at 800 rpm for
    30 s, acting as a sacrificial layer. Then, PDMS, prepared as a mixture of the
    elastomer base and a curing agent at a weight ratio of 20:1, was spin-coated at
    8000 rpm for 4 min, creating the substrate layer for the epidermal electronics.
    A plasma treatment was carried out to render the PDMS surface hydrophilic [6 sccm
    (standard cubic centimeter per minute), 30 W, 30 s], facilitating the subsequent
    coating of the photoresist AZ-1512 at 800 rpm for 25 s. AZ-1512 was baked overnight
    at 65°C in the oven with temperature increasing and decreasing slowly to eliminate
    cracking of the AZ-1512 film caused by the thermal extension and cold contraction
    of the PDMS film under rapid and high temperature variation. Subsequently, a mask
    aligner (MA8, Micro Suss) was used to expose the micropatterns on the AZ-1512
    film, allowing the desired PDMS pattern exposed without covering AZ-1512 after
    development in the MF 319 for 40 s. Thereafter, with additional plasma treatment,
    the sensing material [p-PEDOT:PSS (mixture of PEDOT:PSS, 5 wt % DMSO and 5 wt
    % d-sorbitol) for strain sensor and PEDOT:PSS for temperature sensor] was spin-coated
    onto the wafer at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Next, the lift-off process was conducted
    to remove AZ-1512 in acetone, and the remaining region was the PEDOT:PSS-based
    pattern on the PDMS substrate. In such case, the sensing film was successfully
    micropatterned on the PDMS film. Detailed parameters of the feature size of both
    sensors are illustrated in fig. S18. The subsequent steps included encapsulating
    the sensing films and connection to the external wire, which are crucial to ensure
    a good and reliable recording of the sensory output. To partially seal the sensing
    part while leaving the connection pads exposed for external wire connection, nonadhesive
    parafilm was used to cover the connection pads before spin-coating of PDMS (8000
    rpm for 4 min) as the encapsulation layer on the sensing part. In addition, the
    parafilm was removed immediately after spin-coating to expose the connection pads
    again. Once the PDMS encapsulation layer was solidified, ultrathin copper wires
    were affixed to the two connection pads using Ag paste and liquid metal. Low-Young’s-modulus
    liquid metal was used to reinforce stability against potential cracks in the Ag
    paste or disruption to PEDOT:PSS films especially at the PEDOT:PSS-Ag paste junction
    induced by the Ag paste’s sharpness. Last, the connection pads together with the
    liquid metal and external wires were encapsulated manually with PDMS to obtain
    the final sensor. For further application, the epidermal sensors can be gently
    peeled off from the holding wafer and attached to the target objects such as the
    plant leaves. Sensor characterization The microstructure morphology of the PEDOT:PSS
    patterns on the PDMS film was characterized via the optical microscope (Nikon,
    Eclipse L200 L300). The optical transmission of the developed sensor was characterized
    by a universal measurement spectrophotometer (Agilent, Cary 7000 UV-Vis-NIR).
    The thickness of the developed sensor was measured by the surface profile (Bruker,
    DektakXT) and atomic force microscopy (Bruker Dimension Icon). Sheet resistance
    was measured by a four-probe measurement system (AiT, CMT-SR2000N). Photographs
    and videos were acquired by an iPhone 14 camera. The force gauge (Mecmesin, MultiTest
    2.5-i) was used to conduct stretching deformation for shear adhesion force and
    strain sensor characterization. The resistance of strain sensor under each strain
    level was measured by the programmable electrometer (Keithley, 6514), and an oscilloscope
    (Agilent, InfiniiVision, DSO-X3034A) was connected to the electrometer using a
    bayonet nut coupling (BNC) cable for real-time data acquisition. The temperature
    sensor was characterized using a hot plate to control its temperature, and the
    electrical resistance was recorded by a digital multimeter (Sanwa, CD800a). When
    connected to Arduino MEGA 2560 for real-time data acquisition, every temperature
    sensor was calibrated using the hot plate before applying on the plant leaves
    to obtain the relationship between sensory output and temperature. Cultivation
    of the host B. rapa plant and stress application The oilseed sarson seeds were
    sown in soil and grown under standard long-day conditions (16-hour light/8-hour
    dark period), 60% humidity and 26°C light/23°C dark. After about 3 weeks, six
    plants were selected for sensor attachment with three for the control group and
    three for the abiotic stress group. Plants in the control group were then placed
    in the chamber under standard growth conditions (16-hour light/8-hour dark period,
    60% humidity, 26°C light/23°C dark), and the other three were placed in another
    chamber where they were subjected to heat and drought stress (16-hour light/8-hour
    dark period, 60% humidity, 34°C light/31°C dark). Plants in the control group
    were watered well throughout the experiment, while the plants in the stress group
    did not receive water once the sensors were attached, to initiate drought condition.
    Demonstration of digital-twin plants in VR space Four epidermal temperature sensors
    were connected to the conditional circuit for conversion from the resistance change
    to voltage change as well as amplifying the voltage signals. The generated data
    were sent to a microcontroller (Arduino MEGA 2560) for data processing and communication
    with a laptop computer through a universal serial bus (USB) cable. The real-time
    signals received by the laptop computer were processed in Python, and the corresponding
    commands were sent to Unity 3D through Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
    Protocol (TCP/IP) communication for digital-twin plant control. Acknowledgments

  description: With the increasing demands on global agriculture, there is an imperative
    need to optimize crop yields and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Real-time
    monitoring and accurate predictions of soil health and crop yields have significant
    implications for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers. While existing soil analysis
    models offer certain predictive capabilities, their efficiency is often hindered
    by issues related to energy consumption, prediction delay, and accuracy levels.
    Contemporary soil models primarily fall short in addressing the multifaceted nature
    of soil attributes and their dynamic interactions. These models also struggle
    to provide real-time insights, frequently leading to delayed interventions, misallocated
    resources, and suboptimal yields. In this paper, we introduce an advanced, low-cost,
    and energy-aware multiparametric IoT-based soil analysis model designed to overcome
    the prevailing limitations. Our system harnesses the synergy of N, P, K, Humidity,
    and Temperature sensors, augmented with temporal datasets to offer a comprehensive
    view of the soil's current state. At the core of our analysis, an ensemble learning
    model combines the strengths of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, and
    1D CNN methods, streamlining accurate yield level predictions. To further refine
    the model's efficiency, a Q Learning approach is integrated, ensuring both energy
    conservation and heightened prediction accuracy. When deployed in various agronomic
    scenarios, the proposed model manifested a marked improvement in prediction metrics.
    Notably, we observed a 10.5% enhancement in precision, 9.4% in accuracy, 8.5%
    in recall, and 4.5% in AUC. Moreover, the model reduced the prediction delay by
    9.5% compared to its counterparts. These advancements underscore the potential
    of our model to revolutionize soil analysis techniques, paving the way for smarter,
    energy-efficient, and productive agricultural practices.

  description: 'This study aimed to investigate the impact and potential of integrating
    IoT technology, specifically the Momo Farm smart vertical farming system, in enhancing
    microgreens cultivation. The research was motivated by the need for efficient
    and automated farming solutions to address the challenges of maintaining microgreens
    on a larger scale, given their daily attention requirements and diverse maintenance
    needs. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining field trials with
    data analysis from soil humidity sensors and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors.
    The results demonstrated that the Momo Farm system effectively automated the cultivation
    process, optimizing water and lighting supply based on real-time data. The implications
    of this study are twofold: first, it offers practical value by providing urban
    farmers with a user-friendly and flexible tool to manage large-scale microgreens
    cultivation, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving resource
    efficiency. Second, it contributes to the field of IoT-based smart farming by
    showcasing how integrating various sensors and cloud-based data storage can lead
    to sustainable and technologically advanced agricultural practices. Overall, this
    study highlights the potential of IoT technology in revolutionizing microgreens
    cultivation practices and supports the broader adoption of smart vertical farming
    systems in urban agriculture.'

  description: The excellent stretchability and biocompatibility of flexible sensors
    have inspired an emerging field of plant wearables that enable intimate contact
    with plants to monitor growth status and local microclimate in real-time continuously.
    Flexible plant wearables provide a promising platform for the development of plant
    phenotypes. In this work, we have fabricated several plant wearables that can
    harmlessly and continuously monitor leaf temperature/humidity, which are critical
    parameters for analyzing the physiological status and microclimate of plants.
    Credited to the unique semi-embedded design and the selected biocompatible materials,
    we achieve ultrathin sensors with a conductive layer thickness of 7 μm, exhibiting
    excellent electrical conductivity with 9.43 × 106 S/m, bendability and fatigue
    resistance with 0.99 % change rate after 10,000 cyclic bending tests, enabling
    on-site and non-destructive testing. These plant wearables can be used as a non-invasive,
    high-throughput, low-cost toolbox with excellent potential for phenotypic analysis.

    Abstract The excellent stretchability and biocompatibility of flexible sensors
    have inspired an emerging field of plant wearables that enable intimate contact
    with plants to monitor growth status and local microclimate in real-time continuously.
    Flexible plant wearables provide a promising platform for the development of plant
    phenotypes. In this work, we have fabricated several plant wearables that can
    harmlessly and continuously monitor leaf temperature/humidity, which are critical
    parameters for analyzing the physiological status and microclimate of plants.
    Credited to the unique semi-embedded design and the selected biocompatible materials,
    we achieve ultrathin sensors with a conductive layer thickness of 7 μm, exhibiting
    excellent electrical conductivity with 9.43 × 106 S/m, bendability and fatigue
    resistance with 0.99 % change rate after 10,000 cyclic bending tests, enabling
    on-site and non-destructive testing. These plant wearables can be used as a non-invasive,
    high-throughput, low-cost toolbox with excellent potential for phenotypic analysis.

    Microclimate plays an intrinsic role in the healthy growth of plants(Holopainen
    and Gershenzon, 2010, Lee et al., 2021). When confronted with abiotic stress,
    plants employ slow and subtle signals in microclimate that are visually imperceptible
    to seek assistance(Chakraborty and Newton, 2011, Li et al., 2021, Zhou et al.,
    2018). Consequently, real-time online monitoring of changes in plant microclimate
    holds significant relevance in aiding plants to cope with stress and facilitating
    early diagnosis of plant diseases(Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010, Kolár and Machácková,
    2005, Mahlein, 2016, Martinelli et al., 2015). However, gaining a comprehensive
    understanding of the mechanisms and interactions between plants and their environment
    has long been challenging for researchers(Bahuguna and Jagadish, 2015). Traditional
    methods used in crop monitoring include rigid temperature and humidity sensors,
    portable soil moisture sensors, and meteorological instruments(Zhao et al., 2019).
    Whereas the rigid configurations of these sensors prevent close integration with
    fragile plants, leading to significant errors and hysteresis in the measurement
    results(Nassar et al., 2018). In addition, the high cost of commercial sensors
    greatly hinders their promotion and application in large fields, and achieving
    accurate control of local microclimates is impossible. Therefore, there is an
    urgent need for low-cost sensing devices that allow for portable and flexible
    in-situ microenvironment monitoring. Flexible plant sensors, characterized by
    their exceptional flexibility, lightweightness, and biocompatibility, enable in-situ,
    fixed-point, and continuous target detection(Yin et al., 2021). Owing to their
    excellent biological safety and mechanical compatibility, flexible sensors can
    fulfill this requirement by being affixed to leaves or positioned in close proximity
    for extended periods without impeding the natural growth of the plant (Westhoff
    et al., 2009). There are many studies have demonstrated the value of flexible
    sensors in plant physiology(Lew et al., 2020, Li et al., 2021, Li et al., 2019,
    Luo et al., 2021, Tang et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2019), crop stress detection
    (Genze et al., 2022), and microclimate parameters monitoring etc (Allen and Pereira,
    2009, Hackenberger et al., 2018, Li et al., 2021, Lu et al., 2020, Nassar et al.,
    2018, Tang et al., 2017). For example, novel plant electronic tattoos have proven
    to be powerful tools for capturing the loss of water content and plant electrical
    signals of objects(Qu et al., 2023); multifunctional integration circuits on substrate
    film have also proven to be reliable tools for monitoring temperature, humidity,
    and illumination in microclimate(Lu et al., 2020); there are even flexible electronics
    that enable active control of plant growth(Li et al., 2022, Qu et al., 2021).
    Consequently, flexible plant sensors are emerging as a promising tool for advancing
    research in intelligent agriculture. In this study, we developed a fabrication
    method for an ultra-thin and lightweight flexible circuit with semi-embedded silver
    and produced various sensors on demand for monitoring plant microclimate. The
    unique semi-embedded construction enhances the flexibility and durability of the
    plant sensors, enabling them to withstand up to 10,000 bending cycles. The temperature
    and humidity sensors produced by this method have excellent operating stability,
    repeatability, and sensitivity and successfully realize on-site continuous monitoring
    of leaf surface temperature and humidity over long periods. In addition, we have
    successfully fabricated semi-embedded flexible printed circuit films (E-FPCF).
    By connecting the micro-chip to various heterogeneous sensing elements, parallel,
    multiple, and continuous monitoring of plant surface temperature and humidity
    is possible. The real-time display and storage of microclimate data can be done
    through a mobile application. This technology provides a comprehensive crop information
    base for plant physiology research and modern agricultural production. By providing
    innovative tools to capture subtle changes in the plant environment, this research
    offers vital techniques to improve our understanding of plant growth mechanisms
    and their interactions with the environment. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Preparation
    of inks Five different dispersants with varying compositions were prepared. We
    take preparation of the 3 wt% hexanol (HA, Aladdin, 99.8 % GC)- polyvinyl pyrrolidone
    solution (PVP, Macklin, Mw. 130,0000, K88-96) dispersant (denoted as HA-PVP) as
    an example. Specifically, 4.5 g of PVP powers was dispersed in 145.5 g of HA solution
    and stirred until the dispersed sample solution became colorless and transparent.
    For the remaining four dispersants, HA was replaced proportionally with methyl
    propanol (PM) (Aladdin, 99.8 % GC) or decanol (CA) (McLean, 99.8 % GC). Then,
    5 g of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) powder (Shanghai Maoguo Nanotechnology Co.,
    Ltd.) with a diameter of 20 nm was dispersant in 2.5 g of the previously prepared
    HA-PVP dispersant solution, using an ultrasonic homogenizer (Sonifer 450D, Bransom,
    1968R,) equipped with a 1/8″-inch flat tip for 20 min at 150 w power. The sample
    solution tube was immersed in a bath of cold water to prevent overheating. 2.2.
    Preparation of semi-embedded flexible films with AgNP-based circuits The design
    circuit patterns were prepared onto immaculate glass plates via screen printing
    (300 mesh). The printed patterns were then coated with Polyimide (PI, Dongguan
    Zhanyang Polymer Material Co.) solution through spin equipment (with operation
    parameters of 2200 rpm for 20 s, Beijing Sedex Electronics Co. KW-4A). The cured
    PI film was achieved by heating in a vacuum oven at 200 °C, −0.88 MPa, for 3 h.
    Subsequently, the glass plate with cured PI film was submerged in deionized water
    for over 10 min to enable the complete detachment of PI film and the transferred
    semi-embedded AgNP circuit from the plate. Then, semi-embedded circuits were placed
    on a heating pad with PI tape, with the exposed side facing upwards. The heating
    pad was then elevated to a temperature of 250 °C and heated in the fume hood for
    24 h. 2.3. Preparation of semi-embedded flexible sensors 2.3.1. Preparation of
    semi-embedded resistive temperature sensors The semi-embedded resistance temperature
    sensor (ERTS) was produced following the procedure outlined in section 2.2, employing
    a 300 μm line width and line spacing. A serpentine electrode pattern was opted
    for the ERTS to provide a broader range of variation and a more sensitive response.
    The ERTS has a total width of 10.84 mm and a length of 17.4 mm. The two circular
    interfaces of the ERTS were respectively connected to 0.1 mm diameter enameled
    wires using commercially available conductive silver paste (Suzhou Beiteli Polymer
    Material Co. SF-1600). Note that the Adhesive A and Adhesive B were stored separately
    before use and mixed evenly in a 3:1 ratio when use it to ensure good adhesion,
    fluidity, and wetness. Cured silver paste at 80 °C for 2 h to provide a good connection
    between the electrode interfaces and the wires. Finally, the sensor was encapsulated
    using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) via the tilt leveling method. PDMS is hydrophobic,
    leading to more robust chemical stability for the overall sensor and consolidating
    the conductive silver adhesive soldering. 2.3.2. Preparation of semi-embedded
    capacitive humidity sensors The semi-embedded capacitive humidity sensor (ECHS)
    was prepared by depositing graphene oxide (GO) humidity-sensitive films on a PI
    substrate with an Ag interdigital electrode (IDE). The Ag IDE has 10.3 mm in length,
    0.3 mm in finger width, 0.2 mm in spacing, and 21 in fork number, respectively.
    The GO-sensitive film of uniform thickness was prepared by the drop-casting method,
    and the total film coverage area was 72.33 mm2. Before depositing, the original
    10 mg/mL monolayer GO aqueous dispersion (Hangzhou Gaoyan Technology Co., LTD.)
    was diluted to 1 mg/mL. GO has a carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 7:3, an average radial
    size of 40–50 μm, and a thickness of about 1 nm. 2.3.3. Preparation of semi-embedded
    integrated sensing systems To align the solder joints of the E-FPCF with the exposed
    stencil, the E-FPCF is secured to the clear acrylic circuit board using adhesive
    tape. Then, silver paste was applied to the edges of the stencil to cover the
    E-FPCF evenly. Note that the curing time for the silver paste is 2 h at 80 °C.
    Before installation, it is recommended to clean the chip pins with alcohol to
    ensure that dust particles do not affect the conductivity of the silver paste
    and the final welding strength. After mounting the chip with the visual assembly
    machine (Zhejiang Huaji Zhengbang Automation Technology Co., ZB3245TS-1.1), it
    needs to be heated up again to 80 °C on a heating table or in a dryer to complete
    the soldering between the chip and the E-FPCF. The silica gel (Caster P-2577,
    Fuzhou Huasheng Tongchuang Technology Co.) packages the flexible circuit. Finally,
    the E-FPCF can be cut into sizes of 35 mm × 35 mm. 2.4. Plant microclimate monitoring
    2.4.1. Model crops Plant growth conditions must be strictly controlled in this
    work. The model plants were parameterized according to the required growth conditions
    and certified as pest-free. Considerations should be maintained throughout the
    test: all plants must receive identical light and temperature conditions as the
    growth chamber; all plants should be watered the day before the experiment, and
    the soil should be kept moist throughout the research, avoiding moisture on the
    leaves. Maize (Zea mays L.): The maize variety selected for this experiment was
    ND101. The seedlings were grown in an artificial climate chamber at the Key Laboratory
    of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, China Agricultural University. The ambient
    temperature was 26 ± 1 °C, and the ambient humidity was 47 ± 2 %RH. Both ambient
    temperature and humidity were controlled. Golden brick (Philodendron con-go):
    All golden brick plants were grown at 18–23 °C with 50 mL of water daily, and
    10 g of black soil fertilizer was applied weekly. Gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii Bolus):
    Gerbera is a perennial herb of Datura''s genus in the Asteraceae family. Gerbera
    plants used in the experiment were purchased from Beijing Chaolai Chun Flower
    Market. All green plants were grown at 18–23 °C with 50 mL water daily. Alumroot
    (Heuchera micrantha): Alumroot is a compact, mound-forming perennial boasting
    decorative evergreen rosettes of round, scalloped, reddish leaves. Alumroot plants
    used in the experiment were purchased from Beijing Chaolai Chun Flower Market.
    All green plants were grown at 18–23 °C with 100 mL water weekly. 2.4.2. ERTS
    for temperature changes measuring in plants A four-wire method (Keysight 34,420A
    desktop digital multimeter) was used to measure changes in ERTS resistance, and
    stored data was recorded on a computer in real-time (Keysight BenchVue Software).
    Using the linear relationship between temperature and resistance, the temperature
    change curve caused by the sensor is plotted. 2.4.3. ECHS for humidity changes
    measuring in plants The ECHS was mounted on the leaf, and the GO humidity-sensitive
    film was next to the abaxial side of the leaf. The capacitance was measured using
    a precision LCR meter (Keysight E4980A). The changes in capacitance were recorded
    in real-time by computer software (Keysight UVE) and finally converted into a
    humidity change that was continuously tested on the leaf surface for 15 days.
    2.4.4. Semi-embedded integrated sensor for temperature and humidity measuring
    Medical-grade polyurethane tape affixed the semi-embedded integrated sensor (EIS)
    to the blades. The Sensirion SHT35 (Shenzhen Sensitech Technology Co.), which
    belongs to EISs, has the capability to record temperature and humidity data and
    subsequently send it remotely to a mobile phone application. The test was carried
    out at the South Greenhouse located on the West Campus of China Agricultural University.
    The test subject was maize during the pollen dispersal stage. The EISs were positioned
    at 60 cm, 127 cm, and 185 cm from the root at varying heights. The EIS was consistently
    placed on three leaves with the same orientation. Data can be transmitted remotely
    via antennas to application software developed for mobile phones, which can be
    stored in real time. The test commenced at 15:00 and concluded the following day.
    The changes in temperature and humidity at different parts of the blade were monitored
    in real-time for 24 consecutive hours. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Design and
    fabrication of the semi-embedded circuits A low-cost fabrication process for semi-embedded
    circuits is developed for flexible sensor systems. Fig. 1a illustrates the step-by-step
    preparation of the semi-embedded circuits, which have been discussed in the experimental
    section. The homogeneous conductive inks of AgNP are first prepared by ultrasonic
    dispersion technology and screen-printed onto a smooth and clean glass substrate
    to achieve the designed conductive patterns. Following low-temperature sintering,
    the majority of the dispersant in the ink diffuses into the air, resulting in
    a tightly interconnected network structure among the silver particles, significantly
    enhancing the circuit conductivity. The PI solution is spin-coated onto the serpentine
    track as a substrate. Lastly, the conductive paths, along with the PI layer, are
    detached from the glass plate and subjected to a 24-hour heating process at 250
    °C in a fume hood. The critical step here was to achieve the release of semi-embedded
    flexible circuits on glass plates. Innovatively, we found that the PI film could
    be easily removed from the glass plate when the glass plate was immersed in water
    for a while. Our initial assessment is that this may be due to the smooth and
    hydrophobic surface of the glass plate to which the PI solution did not adhere
    after curing, accompanied by the fact that PI has a certain degree of water absorption
    and swelling properties. In contrast to conventional direct printing, our transfer
    printing method integrated with the PI film curing process effectively enables
    the interconnected-particle embedded into the substrate, which could enhance their
    bonding and withstand repeated bending. Fig. 1b shows a detailed depiction of
    the semi-embedded flexible sensor and the serpentine conductive track based on
    AgNPs. The semi-embedded sensor is flexible, supple, and compact, weighing only
    23 mg, meeting the criteria for plant wearable sensors. Furthermore, the E-FPCF
    with a complex patterns conductive silver layer, whose thickness is about 7 μm,
    was made (Fig. 1c). Therefore, based on the semi-embedded circuits preparation
    process developed in this study, assisted by automatic screen printing, large-area
    substrate plate making, film coating, and other technologies, it is expected to
    achieve large-scale production of large-area, complex-patterned embedded flexible
    sensing circuit films. The application of the ERTS to detect the humidity of Philodendron
    tatei ''Congo, as shown in Fig. 1d, demonstrates the credible capability of our
    strategy to fabricate precise, outstanding, and convenient semi-embedded flexible
    sensors. Download : Download high-res image (304KB) Download : Download full-size

    humidity sensors. 3.2. Characterizations of semi-embedded flexible circuits The
    flexible circuit conductivity is crucial as it serves as a critical component
    of the sensors. Fig. 2a illustrates the mechanism and structure of inks. The ultrasonic
    dispersion and high-temperature sintering significantly improved the conductivity
    of the AgNP-based circuits. After ultrasonic dispersion, the ink exhibits a smooth
    and viscous consistency, making it suitable for direct utilization in screen printing.
    It is worth noting that even after prolonged periods of static storage, the ink
    does not show any signs of layering or sedimentation, thus confirming its uniformity,

    top pictures are cross-section, and the bottom images are top view. (g) Changes
    in sensor resistance by bending 0°-180°and cyclically straightening for 10,000
    cycles. The type of dispersants affects the binding between AgNPs, the encapsulation
    of nanoparticles, and the steric effect of the polymer, which further acts on
    the circuit conductivity (Huang et al., 2016). We compared the change in electrical
    resistance of inks prepared with different dispersants before and after sintering
    to highlight the effect of dispersants on the electrical conductivity of inks.
    PVP was dissolved in three other solutions: PM, HA, and CA, with the mass fraction
    of PVP in each solution being 3 % and 5 % (a total of 6 types of dispersants).
    In addition, the 3 % PVP-PM ink was eliminated due to particle settling before
    printing, and the data for this ink was not included in the resistance drop analysis.
    From the results in Fig. 2c, it is clear that the inks with 3 wt% PVP-HA as the
    dispersant have the lowest and relatively stable resistance before and after circuit
    sintering. Therefore, this particular dispersant component was selected for ink
    preparation and subsequent test analysis. Silver nanoparticles of varying sizes
    display distinct surface energies. Spherical nanoparticles possess elevated surface
    energy, leading to a significant decrease in the sintering temperature of the
    crystals (Shmigel et al., 2015). Three inks containing particles of varying sizes
    (15, 20, and 50 nm) were subjected to sintering, showing a decreasing trend in
    electrode resistance with increasing particle size (Fig. 2d). After sintering,
    the serpentine electrode displayed resistances of about 8.3 Ω, 8 Ω, and 7 Ω for
    the 15 nm, 20 nm, and 50 nm inks, respectively. We conclude that sintering alters
    the interconnections between metal particles due to cracks and pores on the electrode
    surface. In the case of slightly larger silver particles, a temperature of 250
    °C furnishes the necessary impetus for sintering and promotes the formation of
    an expanded network of conductive pathways, even with a reduced specific surface
    area. Additionally, increasing the amount of silver powder in the ink resulted
    in reduced flowability but increased conductivity. After sintering, the serpentine
    electrode printed with 33 wt% ink shows a resistance of approximately 65 Ω, representing
    an almost nine-fold increase compared to the 66 wt% ink (Fig. 2e). In contrast
    to the conventional “sandwich” structure commonly employed in prior flexible sensing
    devices (Zhao et al., 2019), we utilized an embedding transfer technology to integrate
    the AgNP-based circuits into the flexible substrate directly. This approach effectively
    prevents the circuits from detaching, particularly when exposed to significant
    deformations like bending and twisting, thereby minimizing the potential for harm.
    To thoroughly analyze the adhesion between the circuits and flexible PI substrate,
    we carried out characterization of the structure of the semi-embedded electrode
    with the scanning electron microscope. Fig. 2f illustrates the cross-sectional
    and surface features of the semi-embedded electrode. The electron microscopy confirmed
    the effective embedding of the conductive layer and substrate, resulting in the
    formation of a flexible wearable device with a total thickness of 25 μm. Furthermore,
    it is observed that upon the printing and drying of ink onto the glass substrate,
    granular protrusions arise on the surface. This occurrence corresponds with incomplete
    volatilization of the dispersant, resulting in conductive particles within the
    ink acquiring a spherical shape and accumulating. As the dispersant continues
    to evaporate, pores appear on the surface of the ink, which may be caused by the
    lower leveling of the ink and the faster evaporation of the solvent. The images
    in Fig. 2f show that the porosity of the electrodes after sintering is significantly
    reduced, small cracks are filled, the edges of large gaps are softer, and the
    ink layer as a whole shows a direction toward more densification. Last, we performed
    a series of 10,000 consecutive bending tests at 180° to assess the wear resistance
    of the semi-embedded electrodes. As data in Fig. 2g confirmed, the electrode''s
    resistance remained stable between 306 and 308 mΩ throughout the bending tests,
    with a resistance change of only 0.99 % relative to initial resistance, demonstrating
    that the resistance variation caused by bending is negligible in terms of temperature
    response. 3.3. Semi-embedded flexible temperature sensor The temperature influences
    the kinetic energy of the free electrons within the silver nanoparticles (Monachon
    et al., 2016). As the temperature increases, so does the energy requirement for
    the directed motion of free electrons, thus raising the resistance (Jasemi et
    al., 2019). Therefore, we presented the design of a semi-embedded temperature
    sensor based on this mechanism. The flexible temperature sensor was fabricated
    following the semi-embedded method, as described earlier. The two-dimensional
    serpentine structure is designed to optimize the conductive layer within a confined
    region, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of the sensor. We measured the resistance
    responses of the serpentine sensor for 15 consecutive temperature cycles. The
    output resistance (red solid line) varies systematically between 12.15 Ω and 13.9
    Ω as the temperature (black dotted line) fluctuates between −10 °C and 40 °C,
    which exhibited excellent reproducibility, as shown in Fig. 3a. To precisely determine
    the correlation between temperature and resistance, we conducted resistance measurements
    of the sensor at −10 °C, 0 °C, 10 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C, and 40 °C, recording the resistance
    output at each temperature gradient across the last 14 cycles (Fig. 3b). The repeatability
    error for tests was just 0.043 %, proving the stability and reliability of the
    sensor in long-term use under varying conditions. As depicted in Fig. 3c, the
    sensor exhibited minimal hysteresis during the temperature fluctuations, and its
    sensitivity reached 0.03462 Ω/°C. Additionally, we plotted the resistance–temperature
    response curve of the temperature sensor, which makes the sensor more accessible
    to use for practical testing. Download : Download high-res image (799KB) Download

    Temperature response of ERTS on fluffy leaves. To mitigate the impact of device
    errors on the accuracy and work range of the flexible sensor, we conducted a calibration
    of the flexible sensor by testing it alongside a K-type thermocouple under identical
    working conditions. Throughout the calibration process, the chamber parameters
    were adjusted to range from −30 to 80 °C, and nine cycles were executed. The test
    results from both devices exhibit a high degree of overlap, proving evidence of
    the flexible sensor''s accurate temperature monitoring capabilities (Fig. 3d).
    It is important to note that a notable deviation exists between the temperature
    measurement data of the flexible sensor and the thermocouple when the test temperature
    exceeds 60 °C. This discrepancy may arise from alterations in the internal structure
    of the flexible sensor when the temperature surpasses 60 °C, thereby modifying
    the resistance temperature coefficient. Consequently, the operational range of
    the sensor was ultimately established as −30 to 60 °C. Despite the typically overlooked
    nature of humidity in temperature sensor studies, it is, in fact, a crucial parameter
    that exerts a significant impact on temperature sensor output. To demonstrate
    the effects of humidity on the ERTS, we placed the detector at a constant temperature
    of 25 °C. We exposed it to three cycles of humidity reduction from 90 %RH to 30
    %RH, followed by increased humidity back to 90 %RH. The ERTS demonstrates high
    sensitivity to changes in temperature, with a sensitivity of 0.03462 Ω/°C, compared
    to its sensitivity to changes in moisture, which is significantly lower at only
    0.00233 Ω/%RH (Fig. 3e). The tests above have proven that the AgNP-based flexible
    temperature sensor offers outstanding temperature response and can detect temperature
    changes in various situations. Heat or cold stress can have an impact on the regular
    growth of the plant and even cause it to die. (Yamori et al., 2022). Thus, monitoring
    the temperature close to the plant is paramount to detect and forecast its health
    status. In this study, we have chosen Philodendron tatei Congo, an evergreen indoor
    plant, as the research subject (Fig. 3f). At 2:00 pm, which corresponds to the
    moment when sunlight contacts the leaf surface directly, the temperature of the
    leaves'' adaxial side increased quickly from 20 °C to 37 °C. Roughly one and a
    half hours later, the temperature decreased to approximately 20 °C, compensating
    for the reduction in light intensity. It is worth mentioning that the sensor showed
    sensitivity to irrigation''s impact on temperature, as illustrated in Fig. 3g.
    Additionally, to further explore the universal use of the ERTS for plant surface
    temperature detection, we specifically focused on their ability to adhere to complex
    surfaces. We selected the Bolus (Gerbera jamesonii) with fuzzy leaves as the research
    subjects and consistently monitored the temperature on the abaxial side of the
    leaves (Fig. 3h). As shown in Fig. 3i, the temperature of the underside of the
    blade varies by approximately 3 °C per day. The blade heated up due to sunlight,
    with warming occurring at the same time as exposure to sunlight. Throughout the
    testing period, the leaf surface temperature continued to rise, likely due to
    increased ambient plant temperature (verified on the same day by ambient temperature
    measurements) rather than a fault in the sensor. 3.4. Semi-embedded flexible humidity
    sensor As depicted in Fig. 4a, the IDE was selected motivated by its extensive
    applicability and simplistic structural design (Cui et al., 2023, Lu et al., 2021).
    Additionally, this interdigital structure exhibits significantly larger capacitance
    and heightened sensitivity than other more superficial structures. A custom-made
    screen-printed board was utilized to fabricate the ECHS illustrated in Fig. 4b,
    following the previously described preparation method. Download : Download high-res

    researchers who had used PI film for humidity sensing, we employed GO further
    to enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of the sensor (Oren et al., 2017, Yu
    et al., 2014). The large surface of GO resulting from the nanostructure effectively
    increases the contact area with water molecules, thus enabling the binding of
    adsorption–desorption with water molecules (Chen and Lu, 2005). Furthermore, the
    abundant active sites, including defects, vacancies, and hydrophilic groups on
    GO''s surfaces, are able to capture water molecules, contributing to the desired
    humidity perception (Lu et al., 2022). Here, we applied a GO film to the semi-embedded
    electrodes through drop-casting and analyzed the surface microstructure of the
    resulting humidity sensor. As depicted in Fig. 4c, the GO film, which covered
    the sensor uniformly and consistently, provided structural foundations for accurate
    detection. The sensitivity of the ECHS is not solely determined by the electrode''s
    geometry but also depends on the GO concentration and the frequency of the electric
    field. According to the experimental results shown in Fig. 4d, the capacitance
    value decreased with increasing frequency when the electrode size and GO concentration
    were kept constant. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the effect of frequency
    on the movement of water molecules in the humidity sensing film, resulting in
    a delayed response. Choosing a lower frequency widened the range of capacitance
    variation and increased sensitivity to humidity. However, theoretical reasoning
    and empirical observations showed that capacitors with lower capacities responded
    poorly at lower frequencies but performed better at higher frequencies. Consequently,
    frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 k Hz, and 10 k Hz were again chosen for the humidity
    response test of the sensor. The test results revealed that the ECHS exhibited
    an irregular response to humidity at 100 Hz. In contrast, the sensor showed reliable
    responses at 1 kHz and 10 kHz, and the humidity response range at 10 kHz was narrower
    than that at 1 kHz. In light of these findings, the sensor will undergo a performance
    qualification assessment at 1 kHz. The humidity response curve of the ECHS (as
    shown in Fig. 4e) underwent six test cycles. The fitting line equation equals
    and the adjusted R2 equals 0.98404. Therefore, there is a relationship of between
    the input quantity (relative humidity, RH) and the output quantity (capacitance),
    with a non-linear error of only 2.48 % covering the range of 40 % to 90 % RH.
    For the hysteresis test, the three humidity cycles were carried on, with the gray
    curve representing the change in sensor capacitance as humidity increases and
    the yellow curve representing the change as humidity decreases (Fig. 4f). It is
    evident that there is a discrepancy between the capacitance values as the humidity
    drops and rises. We attributed this phenomenon to the intrinsic properties of
    the ECHS. On the one hand, as the humidity decreases, GO and water molecules remain
    partially adsorbed, forming intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding
    and van der Waals forces. This keeps capacitance relatively high. On the other
    hand, it is plausible that the humidity conditions in the chamber did not reach
    the set value, which may have contributed to the non-coincidence of the round-trip
    curve. Despite often being overlooked in humidity sensor studies, temperature
    is a crucial factor that can significantly affect sensor performance. To further
    investigate the operational stability, we studied the influence of temperature
    on the ECHS. The test chamber was set at 0 %RH, while the temperature was varied
    from −10℃ to 40℃ and then decreased back to −10℃, with a temperature gradient
    of 5℃. Fig. 4g illustrates the temperature response variations of the sensor.
    Throughout the 10 cycles of temperature, the sensor exhibited outstanding repeatability.
    Within the range of −10℃ to 40℃, the response of capacitance did not show a monotonic
    linear correlation with temperature. The capacitance values remained fluctuating
    within the scope of 7 pF to 18.5 pF, which means the temperature variations result
    in a variation of only 0.22 %RH in a testing environment of 90 %RH. Considering
    that the temperature does not suddenly rise or fall by 50 °C in practice, the
    sensor can be regarded as insensitive to temperature changes. With the ECHS, we
    continuously monitor humidity fluctuations on the surface of fruits and plants.
    The plant chosen for testing in this experiment was the alum root (Heuchera micrantha),
    and the humidity-sensitive film of the sensor was in contact with the abaxial
    epidermis. Over 15 consecutive days, we monitored changes in humidity on the surface
    of the leaves (Fig. 4h). No additional water was supplied during the first eight
    days. During the first three days, the soil was sufficiently moist, and the RH
    on the abaxial side of the leaves ranged from a high of 63 % to a low of 20 %,
    which was very close to the RH of the surrounding air. As the soil gradually dried
    out, the RH of the leaves decreased from the fourth day onwards, transpiration
    was significantly lower than at the beginning, and the leaves began to wilt. After
    external supplementation on day 8, leaf transpiration increased on day 9, with
    RH rising from 20 %RH to 45 %RH, and again on day 13, with RH ranging from 40
    % to 65 %. All these proved the reliability and repeatability of the sensor during
    long-term use. Furthermore, the ECHS was employed to monitor surface humidity
    changes in papaya (Chaenomeles sinensis) during the decay, thus simulating respiratory
    changes in the fruit during storage (Fig. 4i). The RH on the papaya surface remained
    above 90 %RH throughout the first 3 days under sealed conditions. After unsealing,
    the RH on the papaya surface began to decrease; on the sixth day, the RH dropped
    to 60 %RH. Subsequently, there were fluctuations in the RH, which could be attributed
    to the respiratory climacteric of papaya, which occurred when there was a sudden
    increase in the respiration rate of papaya, leading to a rapid senescence stage.
    This experiment confirmed the applicability of flexible humidity sensors in providing
    data support for monitoring fruit ripening and understanding the ripening and
    senescence process. 3.5. Flexible integrated sensor based on semi-embedded circuit
    As a critical component of a flexible integrated sensor, E-FPCF was fabricated
    through flexible transfer technology outlined in Section 3.1. The electronic components
    were assembled on the E-FPCF via conductive silver paste using the surface mounting
    technique. In order to satisfy the needs of intricate agricultural applications,
    we employed commercially available Bluetooth modules and sensing elements to detect
    ambient temperature and humidity, allowing real-time data display on mobile devices.
    The Bluetooth chip features a 2.4G Hz transceiver that ensures optimum sensitivity
    and transmission rate for low-energy data transmission, enabling prolonged functionality
    even when powered by a low-capacity battery. The sensing part incorporated the
    temperature and humidity sensor (Sensirion SHT35) to accurately measure the microclimate
    parameters around the leaf surface, which offers a humidity measurement accuracy
    of ± 1.5 %RH and a temperature measurement accuracy of ± 0.1 °C. Furthermore,
    the small form factor of the Sensirion SHT35 at 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm × 0.9 mm makes
    it ideal for accommodating the flexible requirements of the integrated circuit.

    (h) Biosafety of flexible integrated sensing systems. (For interpretation of the
    references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
    version of this article.) To meet the standards for the outdoor use of plant sensors,
    the device''s packaging needs to retain the circuitry''s flexibility and ensure
    that the EIS is both solderable and waterproof. Therefore, the thickness of the
    encapsulation layer is strictly restricted to 5 mm. A commercially available organic
    silicone, which displays exceptional electrical insulation and chemical stability
    and has moisture-proof, anti-static, and anti-oxidation properties, was selected
    as the packaging material. The encapsulated integrated device is visually depicted
    in Fig. 5b. Conformability to the object serves as a vital indicator for assessing
    the flexibility of the integrated circuit. Hence, the bending performance of the
    EIS was evaluated subsequent to the completion of packaging. As demonstrated in
    Fig. 5c, the EIS was subjected to a bending test. This was achieved by firmly
    fastening the EIS to glass tubes with diameters ranging from 35 mm to 70 mm. Remarkably,
    the packaged EIS maintained its ability to record temperature and humidity readings
    even when exposed to varied bending conditions for up to 2 h. Fig. 5d displays
    the temperature and humidity change on the plant leaf surface. These changes were
    monitored continuously for 24 h with the flexible EIS in a controlled indoor environment
    during a test on a gold diamond plant. Significant temperature and humidity fluctuations
    occurred between 12:00 and 15:00 due to direct sunlight on the plants. The graph
    reveals an abrupt decline in humidity as the temperature surged, which gradually
    recovered when the temperature reduced. We conducted tests in a complex and realistic
    climatic environment to evaluate the practical application of the semi-embedded
    temperature and humidity sensor. Specifically, we examined the sensor''s performance
    on maize during the pollen dispersal stage in a greenhouse. As depicted in Fig.
    5f, the flexible EIS adhered effectively to the leaf surface even when the leaves
    had fuzz. The EIS was placed on three maize leaves at different heights: 60 cm
    (U), 127 cm (M), and 185 cm (L) from the root base. An external rechargeable battery
    was planted on the maize stalk to power the EIS. The data collected by the sensors
    could be transmitted over long distances via an antenna and stored in real-time
    on a cell phone application (Fig. 5g). Temperature and humidity changes in different
    leaf parts were monitored in real time for 24 h. As depicted in Fig. 5e, the trends
    of temperature and RH detected by the three EISs were consistent at different
    heights. From 15:00 to 20:00, the temperature fluctuated between 20 and 25 °C,
    and the RH fluctuated between 20 % and 50 %RH. We hypothesized this was due to
    transpiration and good ventilation, which results in low RH on plant surfaces.
    From 21:00 to about 4:30 the following day, the temperature dropped significantly
    to 15℃, while the RH increased to 70 ∼ 80 %RH. The increase in RH can be attributed
    to the shutdown of the greenhouse ventilation system, as well as the decrease
    in ambient temperature, which reduced the saturated water vapor pressure in the
    air and indirectly led to an increase in RH. After 5:00, the opening of the greenhouse
    supplemental light and the subsequent direct sunlight caused a rapid increase
    in leaf temperature, accompanied by a decrease in RH. Extensive maize irrigation
    occurred until 10:00, which probably contributed to reducing temperature and humidity
    by improving air exchange in the greenhouse. At the end of the test, the sensor
    was removed and left no trace on the leaves (Fig. 5h). During the continuous test,
    water mist appeared at specific positions on the E-FPCF, but there was no significant
    accumulation of coalescing water droplets. This is probably due to the high gas
    exchange effect of the waterproof and breathable polyurethane tape, which allows
    for a non-destructive and non-marking inspection of the plants. For future applications,
    it is recommended that the EIS be fixed locally to the blade, leaving some area
    for adequate gas exchange. 4. Conclusions We present a novel technique for the
    fabrication of semi-embedded flexible sensors. This method results in an ultra-thin
    flexible temperature sensor, which exhibits excellent high repeatability and stability.
    This sensor can accurately detect temperature variations ranging from −30 °C to
    60 °C, making it suitable for continuously monitoring temperature changes on the
    surface of furry plants. In parallel, we have applied the same methodology to
    develop flexible humidity sensors with excellent operating performance. The humidity
    sensors demonstrate a noteworthy increase in capacitance with a low hysteresis
    coefficient. This feature enables the tracking of plant leaf surface transpiration.
    In the final, we have developed a leaf-friendly, flexible, multifunctional integrated
    sensor system. This integrated system allows for long-term monitoring of plant
    microclimate and can record remote data output through a visual interface. Additionally,
    users can access cloud recording via their mobile phones. The flexible conductive
    substrate of the integrated sensor has a thickness of about 25 μm and can be equipped
    with miniature electronic components for functionalization. It''s worth noting
    that one of the biggest challenges facing the application of semi-embedded flexible
    sensors to plants is the rapid growth of plants, which can cause mismatching.
    By selecting proper substrate materials with good stretchability and low elastic
    modulus, such as PDMS and Eco-flex, the flexibility of the sensor is expected
    to be significantly improved. Future challenges include improving the flexibility
    and stretchability of the sensor, optimizing the programming for stable data output,
    and extending the functionality of the sensor to include biological stress monitoring.
    Long-term monitoring of plant growth is crucial, which imposes greater demands
    on the elasticity and durability of the sensors. Waterproofing is also essential
    to broaden the practical application of the sensors. Besides, it is advisable
    to use degradable and self-healing materials in sensor preparation to prevent
    secondary contamination and promote secondary recycling in agricultural production.
    Blending flexible AgNP-based sensors with other highly conductive materials to
    fill cracks and gaps is also a promising strategy to enhance their performance
    further. In conclusion, this research provides a valuable tool and guidance for
    exploring plant physiological information and improving agricultural cultivation.

  description: India is primarily an agrarian country where more than 54% of the population
    is employed directly or indirectly in agriculture. Agriculture contributes 13.9%
    to the Economy of India. Irrigation in India is mainly through rain falls, canals
    and ground water. Farmers due lack of scientific intervention and less usage of
    technology in Irrigation flooding the land with water, is not only wasting precious
    water resources but also leads to erosion of the top soil which is essential for
    healthy crop growth. Moreover, considering the areas that are un-irrigated the
    water quantity from eart is decreasing as the water from earth is been removed
    at routine intervals of time. Additionally, the climatic condition of the soil
    also contributes to the crop growth. The proposed work attempts to address this
    issue of over and under irrigation of field by the introduction of smart irrigation
    method which depends upon the measured soil moisture using Volumetric Water Content
    (VWC) and soil temperature. This prevents unnecessary wastage of water and helps
    in the regulation of soil temperature. The soil moisture content in terms of VWC
    from sensor is validated against the traditional method of VWC measurement using
    Gravimetric Water Content and Bulk Density. The measured error is found to be
    within the range of +/- 1.5 %. Using the selected sensors and the controller an
    IoT application for Smart Irrigation System has been developed which provides
    the soil moisture and temperature parameters in a real-time basis, based on which
    the water pump is controlled remotely. Further a prototype model of the system
    is developed and deployed in the field for practical validation and evaluation.

    Water Quality Monitoring System Chapter © 2023 Soil Moisture Content Detection
    Based on Sensor Networks Chapter © 2016 Introduction Agricultural practice has
    significantly transformed over the last two decades from being labor intensive
    to a high-tech industry driven by automation and smart farming [1]. A notable
    example is the application of soil moisture sensing for on demand irrigation [2].
    By measuring soil moisture and other parameters in real time such as weather condition,
    nutrient level in soil, and crop health, farmers can optimize their irrigation
    systems. Real-time soil moisture sensing for on demand irrigation can result in
    over 30% reduction in water consumption [3, 4]. In addition to water saving, there
    are many additional benefits including improved crop yield and quality as well
    as lower run off, soil erosion, and nutrient loss. Efficient irrigation is essential
    to sustainable farming, especially when water resource is variable and scarce
    [2]. On-demand irrigation can also deliver benefits beyond water saving. Agricultural
    run-off from excessive irrigation is a major source of water pollution, especially
    in large-scale crop operation [5]. For example, agriculture run-off from sugarcane
    farms along Queensland’s coastline in Australia is a major contributing factor
    to degrading and poor health of the Great Barrier Reef [6] in recent years. Accordingly,
    the Australian Marine Conservation Society has identified run-off reduction as
    an effective pollution prevention method among a suit of measures to restore the
    Great Barrier Reef. Accurate and on demand irrigation improves crop yield and
    quality. Most crops require the right amount of water at the right time. Water
    stress or excessive irrigation can lead to quality issues. Considering apple as
    an example, water stress can attribute to bitter pits (black dots), reduced fruit
    size, reduced sugar content, and low crop yield [7]. On the other hand, excessive
    watering can cause soil-borne diseases and rots, contribute to poor fruit quality,
    and can prevent the trees from absorbing necessary minerals. Inadequate or excessive
    irrigation can also increase crop susceptibility to disease and reduce its capacity
    to recover from extreme weather. Real-time soil moisture sensing has been successfully
    integrated with irrigation systems, but only for perennial crops [7, 8]. These
    are crops that can grow back after harvesting; thus, they do not need to be replanted
    each year. There is no or limited need for soil tilling; thus, the ground is not
    severely disturbed. There is also designated track for farm machinery and equipment
    to avoid damage to the crop. Thus, it is economical and convenient to deploy a
    wired soil moisture sensing network. On-demand irrigation can deliver even more
    benefit to annual crops since they tend to require more water with larger variation
    during their life cycle. However, a wired soil moisture sensing network is not
    suitable for annual crop as the frequent tillage is required and there is no designated
    track for farm equipment. Wiring and underground moisture sensors are likely be
    damaged when tilling. Recent years have seen significant progress in the development
    of wireless soil moisture sensing for smart agriculture [9]. Major challenges
    to commercial realization of wireless soil moisture sensing are equipment cost
    and more importantly the ability to wirelessly power the sensors and data transmission
    equipment. The former is achievable through volume production and further optimization.
    The latter will soon be feasible with significant progress in wireless power transfer
    (WPT). WPT is the process of transmitting electrical energy from a power source
    to an electrical load at a distance away across an air gap or soil. WPT has been
    used known for a long time. Nikola Tesla pioneered the transmission of electrical
    energy without wires in 1899 with the Tesla coil experiment. Since Tesla’s pioneering
    work, multiple WPT technologies have been developed and undergone substantial
    advancement. This review aims to guide future research for developing and deploying
    wireless soil moisture sensing for on-demand irrigation. Common methods for soil
    moisture sensing were reviewed to select those that are suitable for wireless
    sensing in terms of power consumption and integration. Technologies for wireless
    charging or power supply are also critically analyzed and discussed. Information
    and data corroborated from this review will guide future research and commercialization
    efforts. Moisture Sensing Technologies A range of techniques that can be used
    to measure soil moisture content have been developed, such as ground-penetrating
    radar, near-infrared reflectance, tensiometers, and dielectric methods. They rely
    on the measurement of specific physical or chemical properties of soil for calculating
    the moisture content. Figure 1 summarizes methods that have been used or are potentially
    suitable for in situ real-time soil moisture measurement. Thus, this review focuses
    specifically on measurement techniques in Fig. 1 and their potential for wireless
    soil moisture sensing applications. Fig. 1 Methods for in situ real-time soil
    moisture measurement Full size image Tensiometer A tensiometer is a device to
    measure the potential of soil to absorb water in pressure, which can then be used
    to determine soil moisture content. A typical tensiometer consists of a water-filled
    tube for insertion into the soil. There is a porous cup at the end of the tube
    to release water into the soil (Fig. 2). As the water potential inside the cup
    equals that of the outside soil, the surface tension (in negative pressure) can
    be registered on the pressure gauge. The registered pressure value reflects the
    potential of soil to absorb water—the higher the reading, the drier the soil,
    and the lower soil moisture content. The pressure gauge can be electronically
    monitored for real-time measurement of soil moisture content [10]. Tensiometers
    are widely used by farmers as handheld devices to determine watering schedule.
    They have a narrow range and are most useful when the soil is not too dry or wet.
    While reading from the pressure gauge can be digitized for data transmission,
    tensiometers are not usually used for remote soil moisture sensing because of
    the need to add water to the device and poor battery life. In addition, tensiometers
    use absorbing material or water to measure the granular pressure, and these substances
    must be dried to perform another measurement in the same location. Therefore,
    it will take a long time until another accurate measurement can be made and cannot
    be used for in situ monitoring. Most of the low-price tensiometers in the market
    also have long measurement time, which is not ideal for continuous monitoring.

    probe; c thermal pulse method; d TD method; e impedance method; f SWR method;
    g FDR method; h capacitance method; i resistance method Full size image Neutron
    Probe and Gamma-Ray Method Neutron thermalization can be used to measure soil
    moisture content. In this method, low-level radiation in the form of neutrons
    is emitted to the soil. These neutrons then collide with the hydrogen atoms in
    water and deaccelerate, forming a slow neutron cloud, which can be detected by
    a neutron probe (Fig. 2b). With a similar approach, soil moisture content can
    also be measured by a gamma ray. Energy loss from a gramma ray due to scattering
    and absorption in soil can be correlated to the moisture content. Both neutron
    and gamma-ray probes offer accurate measurement of soil moisture content with
    no hysteresis. There have been studies successfully developing the neutron probe
    as a wireless device for remote sensing [11]. However, neutron and gamma-ray probes
    are expensive and strictly regulated due to the radioactive source used to emit
    the neutrons. Thus, this technique is not suitable for most commercial operations
    where highly accurate soil moisture content measurement is not required and the
    ability to comply with radioactive material usage is limited. Thermal Pulse Method
    When the moisture content changes, the heat conductivity profile of the soil also
    changes. Thus, soil moisture content can be obtained by measuring the transient
    change of temperature in the soil. A thermal moisture sensor can be simple; it
    includes a heating element to generate heat pulses and a sensing probe that observes
    the change in the soil temperature caused by the heat pulse (Fig. 2c). Thermal
    moisture sensors offer a cost-effective, compact-size solution for in situ monitoring.
    In addition, thermal moisture sensors are not dependent on the soil salinity,
    resulting in much more reliable results within their sensitivity zone with proper
    calibration. However, the energy consumption per measurement of the thermal sensor
    is significant at about 59.4 Ws [12] and low response time [13]. Dielectric Method
    The soil matrix contains three key components, namely, water, air, and soil itself
    with very different dielectric constants (80, 1, and 4, respectively). Thus, changes
    in soil moisture content can be determined by measuring changes in soil dielectric
    constant. There are several techniques to measure the soil dielectric constant;
    they are time domain (TD), frequency domain reflectometry (FDR), capacitive, impedance,
    and standing wave ratio (SWR) methods. Devices using these techniques are collectively
    called dielectric soil moisture sensors. They are reliable, cost-effective, accurate,
    and easy to be integrated into a remote soil moisture monitoring network. Time
    Domain Method Time domain (TD) sensor consists of a parallel metallic sensor probe
    with the length \\(L\\), connected to a coaxial cable with a signal generator
    and an oscillator as in Fig. 2d. An electromagnetic signal is generated and travels
    along the coaxial cable to the sensor probe and the travel time of the wave in
    the probe will be measured. Depending on how this parameter is being captured,
    time domain sensors are divided into two types: time domain transmission (TDT)
    and time domain reflectometry (TDR). TDT method measures the travel time from
    one end to another end of the probe while TDR method measures the time difference
    between incident wave and reflected wave at the connector of the probe. It is
    proportional to the length of sensor probe \\(L\\) and the soil dielectric constant.
    The main advantage of the TD method is a very short response time with high reliability
    since it is less dependent on the soil matrix. TD sensor size can be reduced to
    3 cm in length while maintaining the fast response time and high reliability [14].
    Moreover, the sensor might fail in a high salinity soil profile, where the reflected
    wave will be attenuated. Impedance Method Working on the same principle of capturing
    the reflecting phenomenon that happened due to impedance mismatch like the TD
    method, impedance spectroscopy captures the reflection and transmission coefficients
    of the incident wave (Fig. 2e). The soil is usually put in a well-constructed
    fixture with defined properties so it can be easily de-embedded from the measured
    result. The whole fixture then got analyzed by a Vector Network Analyzer, capturing
    the scattering parameter including \\({S}_{11}\\) as reflection coefficients and
    \\({S}_{12}\\) as transmission coefficients [15]. By evaluating the system in
    impedance spectroscopy, conductivity profile of the soil is also derived, and
    the nutrient state (such as nitrate level) can also be estimated. However, this
    system is not suitable for integration on such embedded soil moisture sensor.
    The impedance method requires complicated computational and calibration process,
    a high-speed microprocessor, and a data logger. Therefore, this method is mostly
    used in the laboratory and are not ideal for field measurement. Standing Wave
    Ratio Method Standing wave ratio (SWR) method measures the reflection coefficient
    and impedance indirectly from the standing wave formed due to reflection happened
    on the transmission line as illustrated in Fig. 2f [16, 17]. The signal on both
    ends of the coaxial line is captured then passes through an amplifier for ease
    of reading. Then, an equivalent impedance of the load (which includes the soil
    as a whole) can be calculated. It is directly influenced by the change of the
    soil permittivity which means that obtaining the soil moisture content is feasible.
    The SWR method has a fast response time and a simple structure. However, since
    signal is already deviated after passing the amplifier, the SWR method is inferior
    compared to other dielectric-based methods in term of accuracy [18]. Frequency
    Domain Reflectometry Method Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR)–based sensor
    measures the change in resonant frequency of a circuit consisting of a capacitance
    embedded in the soil as described in Fig. 2g. The capacitor C is buried into the
    soil so that the soil acts as the medium between two plates of capacitor. Cautious
    installation is required to avoid air gap between the capacitor electrode and
    the soil medium. This air gap might affect the capacitor value if it is not carefully
    taken care of. This capacitor is then connected to an oscillator to form a tuning
    circuit. The equivalent resonant frequency is then captured by a high-frequency
    detector circuit. This resonant frequency is dependent on the capacitor value,
    which is proportional to the dielectric constant of the soil trapped between electrodes.
    The FDR-based sensor is extremely sensitive to the soil texture [19, 20], requiring
    specific calibration. Compared to TD, FDR offers high accuracy [21] with lower
    price. Capacitance Method Moisture sensors based on the capacitance method can
    be developed at a very low cost (Table 2). The capacitance method determines the
    soil moisture content through an output DC voltage signal. It includes a capacitor,
    which is embedded into the soil with careful installation to avoid the airgap
    as mentioned in FDR method, connected to an external resistor (Fig. 2h). Then,
    a square wave voltage is applied across the circuit, resulting in a deformation
    in output signal. The amplitude and deformation of this output depend on the value
    of the capacitor; therefore, the soil moisture content can be easily obtained
    by measuring the root-mean-square voltage of this signal. The capacitance method
    has lower accuracy compared to most other dielectric methods. However, the capacitance
    method is more energy efficient and simple for onboard integration. It can be
    printed directly onto a small circuit board about 9.8 × 2.3 cm (SEN0193 from DFRobot)
    for soil moisture measurement. Resistance Method The change in soil moisture content
    leads to the change in the conductivity profile of the soil overall; taking advantage
    of such property, resistance sensor measures the soil resistance between two electrodes
    (Fig. 2i). It usually consists of a pair of electrodes embedded into the soil
    or into granular matrix to improve accuracy. This is connected to another resistor
    with an input analogue voltage source to form a voltage divider circuit. The soil
    moisture content is obtained from the measured output voltage of the resistance
    of the sensor. Providing a measurement at an incredibly low price, this method,
    however, has the least precision above all. Moreover, corrosion is inevitable
    since a constant DC voltage is applied across the electrodes, causing them to
    produce electrolyte. Resistance sensor is mainly used in simple irrigation system
    for its convenience connecting to off-the-shelf hardware, such as Arduino board
    [22], where it only requires the relative indication of soil moisture content.
    Requirements of In Situ Wireless Soil Moisture Sensing In a network for soil moisture
    sensing, in addition to efficiently measure and collect data, there are several
    other aspects for consideration. This section will discuss the compatibility of
    each type of sensor with network construction regarding the complexity, accuracy,
    price, and power efficiency. Of all methods described above, dielectric sensor
    provides a suitable level of accuracy and sufficient response time for real-time
    monitoring of soil moisture (Table 1). As described in “Dielectric Method” section,
    there are several variances of the dielectric moisture sensor family including
    the TD, impedance, SWR, FDR, and capacitive sensors. They complement each other
    in performance depending on the soil matrix and actual application. For example,
    compared to other methods, the TD method is characterized by relatively high accuracy
    [23] and suitable to be deployed in agricultural crop; however, its utilization
    in other circumstance such as extreme saline soil is questionable [24]. On the
    other hand, the FDR sensor can be used in highly saline soil but requires soil
    specific calibration [19, 20]. Compared to TD and FDR sensors, capacitance sensor
    has lower accuracy, but it is low cost, compact, and can be suitable for real-time
    moisture monitoring where a moderate level of accuracy can be tolerated. Table
    1 Soil moisture sensing methodologies resumes for on-demand irrigation purpose
    Full size table It is desirable for underground moisture sensors to be wirelessly
    connected in a network to reduce cost and avoid damage during tilling. Therefore,
    a low power consumption is essential. In addition, because many sensors are deployed
    in the network, the cost of individual sensor must also be low. Table 2 summarizes
    the power consumption and cost of key dielectric methods for soil moisture sensing.
    Most of the available dielectric-based sensors have moderate energy consumption;
    therefore, they are very compatible in a wireless moisture sensor network. The
    TD and FDR methods are highly accurate (error of < 3%) but can be expensive. Capacitance-based
    sensors have the lowest cost. Thus, capacitance sensor appears to be most suitable
    for a large soil moisture monitoring network. Table 2 Commercial dielectric-based
    soil moisture sensor products (na: not available; data are extracted from user
    manual and technical specification of the manufacturers) Full size table Power
    Supply Solution for Wireless Underground Moisture Sensing In current on-demand
    irrigation systems, moisture sensors are buried underground, and the measured
    information is transmitted via wire to an above ground data hub. However, the
    data hub and wiring can be damaged during soil tilling; thus, this approach is
    only suitable for perennial crops. On the other hand, wireless underground moisture
    sensor can be used for any crops because no wiring is required. Each underground
    system sensor consists of a moisture sensor, memory, central processing unit,
    wireless transceiver, antennas, and a power supply. There are two main challenges
    including power supply and cost in wireless underground sensor. In this section,
    potential solutions for power supply at a low cost are reviewed and discussed.
    Underground sensors use batteries or must be wirelessly powered. Retrieving these
    sensors for battery replacement is impractical since they are buried underground.
    Extending the underground wireless sensor’s lifetime is challenging. Current practice
    involves wire connection of these sensors to above ground power supply units,
    such as battery or photovoltaic array (Fig. 3a). The current practice is not suitable
    in many agriculture applications as these units obstruct agricultural activities
    and are vulnerable to the weather. Therefore, a self-powered solution based on
    wireless power transfer (WPT) technology is a potential solution to maintain lifetime
    of underground sensor. As an alternative, the energy transmitter for recharging
    can be attached to a mobile robot (Fig. 3b) or an unmanned aerial vehicle [33••].
    The receiver of the WPT system can be enclosed in the device (Fig. 3b), which
    is more durable and robust compared to above-ground power supply units. The WPT
    solution is more flexible. By contrast, the photovoltaic charging is weather dependent,
    might be impractical under dense tree canopy, and requires regular servicing and
    attention. In most cases, energy consumption by the sensor per measurement is
    less than 300 mW (Table 2). Energy consumption by the microcontroller and data
    transmission is negligible at < 10 mW.s per data package as the system is only
    powered for less than a second to complete the transmission event [34]. Fig. 3
    Power supply solution for wireless underground sensing devices. a Photovoltaic
    charging, b WPT Full size image Current WPT technologies may already be viable
    for underground wireless sensor nodes. Robinson et al. [35•] utilized soil as
    a conductive medium to deliver the current between the electrodes of the transmitter
    and the receiver. Although the power is transferred in multiple directions over
    several meters, the excessive optimal depth of the deeper electrode pair (76.2
    and 106.68 m) results in a bulky design. A 13.56-MHz WPT system using inductive
    coupling to power a receiver located at 20 cm underground is designed in [33••].
    This system can supply 8.61 kJ in 30 min with 33.5% efficiency for fast charging
    the supercapacitor module. However, the lack of misalignment solution in [33••]
    leads in a drop of WPT efficiency in terms of coupling coefficient, which lengthens
    the charging time to roughly 100 min when the precise location of the sensor is
    unknown. Arimi et al. [36•] presented a metamaterial absorber performing both
    sensing and RF energy harvesting tasks. Two rectifiers working at 625 and 500
    MHz, which are the absorption frequencies at the minimum and maximum soil moisture
    content (5 and 25%), are added to supply power for transmitters to send the alert
    signal when the soil moisture content is outside of the acceptable range. Although
    the proposed design can utilize the electromagnetic power available in the environment,
    it can only send data when the soil moisture content is at fixed values (5 and
    25%). Annual crop has a shallow root zone of 30 to 120 cm depth. There remain
    some technical challenges such as low and variable energy transfer efficiency
    especially through soil and rock of different water content and large distance.
    Although operating at high frequency is an effective method to increase the transfer
    distance while maintaining the same transmitter and receiver size of WPT [37],
    the attenuation is greater at higher frequencies [38]. When the electromagnetic
    wave propagates from air to a depth of 30 cm underground and the soil moisture
    content is 5%, pathloss is 81 dB at the frequency of 915 MHz (typical frequency
    of far-field WPT), while it is significantly lower (35 dB) at frequency of 6.78
    MHz (typical frequency of near-field WPT). The trade-off between transfer distance
    and frequency must be considered to enhance the performance of the WPT system.
    Besides, the soil profile also has a big impact on the WPT systems. More specifically,
    the change in the medium such as moisture content or salinity content is varied
    due to weather conditions and the plant nutrient plan. The rise in soil water
    content will lead to an increase of the medium permittivity and therefore resulting
    very high pathloss [38]. The excessive ion content also makes the soil profile
    conductive, resulting in the attenuation of the signal overall. Pathloss is considerably
    higher (95 dB at 915 MHz and 42 dB at 6.78 MHz) when the soil moisture content
    is saturated (60%). Therefore, this worst-case scenario needs to be considered
    to prevent failed performance of the system. Multiple WPT approaches have been
    applied to charge underground sensors. Each approach has its own benefits and
    drawbacks. In the following paragraphs, two basic types of WPT, radiative and
    non-radiative power transfer, are discussed to point out the most suitable for
    powering underground sensor networks. Radiative Wireless Power Transfer In radiative
    WPT or far-field WPT, the receiving antenna is in the far-field region of the
    transmitting antenna. The RF power is received by the receiving antenna and then
    converted to DC power by a rectifier circuit to supply the load. The WPT can be
    omnidirectional or directional depending on the radiation pattern of the transmitting
    antenna [39]. Omnidirectional transmitting antenna allows receivers to receive
    power from any position and orientation; it is the key factor causing the extremely
    low efficiency of the omnidirectional radiation pattern type WPT system. The efficiency
    is only around 1.5% at the distance of 30 cm [40]. It is further decreased if
    the power is transferred through the ground due to high-frequency pathloss (81
    dB at the frequency of 915 MHz when the depth is 30 cm and soil moisture content
    is 5%). Moreover, the transmitted power is limited to avoid adverse effects on
    the human body. As a result, this method cannot supply adequate power for underground
    wireless sensor nodes and may only be suitable for in the air WPT applications
    where the required power is in the milliwatt range. Another type is directional
    WPT with higher efficiency in the desired direction (compared with omnidirectional
    WPT) because the radiated power is focused in only one direction. Based on the
    operating frequency, directional WPT can be divided into microwave power transfer
    (MPT) and laser power transfer (LPT). In MPT, the DC power is converted to RF
    power and fed to the transmitting antenna, and then radiated toward the receiver.
    At the receiving side, the RF power collected by the receiving antenna is rectified
    and supplied to the load. In several works [41,42,43], the rectifier circuit is
    integrated with the receiving antenna, which is called “rectenna.” Although the
    efficiency of MPT is higher than that of omnidirectional radiative WPT, it is
    typically less than 10% [44,45,46]. The efficiency is governed by five factors:
    DC-RF efficiency, transmitting antenna efficiency, transmission efficiency, receiving
    antenna efficiency, and RF-DC efficiency (Fig. 4a). Each of these elements must
    be improved to increase overall efficiency. In the transmitting section, phased
    array antenna is widely used for directional radiation, where the phase and amplitude
    of the RF power fed to each element of the antenna array are determined to broadcast
    the microwave beam in the desired direction [44, 45]. Considering the receiving
    side, the optimal number of rectenna arrays is calculated to obtain the maximum
    beam collecting efficiency in [41]. Rectifier circuit and rectenna is also interested
    in recent years. The 5.8-GHz rectifier circuit with lateral GaN Schottky diode
    proposed in [46] can achieve 71% RF-DC efficiency. Dong et al. [42] presented
    a high-efficiency rectifying surface using sub-wavelength resonant elements with
    the highest RF-DC efficiency of 66.5% at 55-cm transfer distance. Fig. 4 Diagram
    of WPT techniques. a Microwave power transfer; b laser power transfer; c inductive
    power transfer; d magnetic resonant coupling; e capacitive power transfer Full
    size image LPT is an emerging WPT technology in which electric energy is converted
    into a laser beam. A high-intensity laser beam is produced by laser diodes on
    the transmitting side and then guided toward the receiver by a beam director.
    On the receiving side, a photovoltaic array fabricated from appropriate photovoltaic
    cells, which are selected depending on the beam intensity and the laser wavelength,
    transforms energy in the form of laser into electric energy and provides it to
    the load (Fig. 4b). LPT, compared to MPT, has a higher efficient atmospheric propagation
    window and could transmit considerable amounts of power to a tiny receiver [47].
    However, it can be seen from [48,49,50] that the overall efficiency of LPT systems
    is only around 10%. As shown in Table 3, unidirectional radiative WPT technologies
    are able to transfer power up to several hundred watts over a distance up to kilometers
    with the efficiency around 10% in the air. Despite the further decrease in efficiency
    caused by significant pathloss at high frequency (95 dB at 915 Hz and 30-cm transfer
    distance when the soil moisture content is saturated), MPT might supply adequate
    power for underground sensors with an extremely poor efficiency, while it is impracticable
    for LPT due to the terahertz-range operation. In practice, the efficiency is significantly
    lower due to the reflection and scattering of electromagnetic waves in heterogeneous
    transmitting medium caused by the presence of plants, especially in dense fields.
    In addition, MPT and LPT are not suitable for simple, low-cost agricultural systems
    because of their total cost and complicated components such as the RF power generator
    in MPT system or laser power supply, beam director, and PV array in LPT system.
    Table 3 Power transfer performance by current WPT technologies (na: not available)
    Full size table Non-radiative Wireless Power Transfer Non-radiative WPT is used
    to transfer power over a short distance in the frequency range of kilohertz to
    several megahertz with very high efficiency compared to the radiative technique.
    It can be divided into three groups based on the kind of coupling technique used:
    inductive power transfer (IPT), magnetic resonant coupling (MRC), and capacitive
    power transfer (CPT). In IPT, the power is transmitted from the Tx coil to the
    Rx coil via magnetic field (Fig. 4c). The DC power is converted to AC power at
    high frequency by the inverter circuit and delivered to the Tx coil. At the receiving
    side, the Rx coil gets AC voltage at the same frequency. A rectifier circuit then
    converts this AC voltage back to DC voltage before supplying to the load. In order
    to compensate the reactive power, compensation networks comprising lumped inductors
    and capacitors are added at two sides. The IPT system functions similarly to an
    air-core transformer; the leakage inductance is very large. Consequently, the
    efficient transfer distance is typically smaller than the coil diameter [51].
    Park et al. [52] attempted to transfer power over several meters using IPT at
    20 kHz. The coils are 3 m in core length and 1 m in winding length. When the Rx
    coil is 3 m away from the Tx coil, the efficiency is only 29%. However, at short
    transfer distance, IPT system could achieve a relatively high efficiency, which
    is up to more than 90% [53]. IPT can transfer power up to several kilowatts over
    several meters (Table 3). Moreover, due to the lower operating frequency compared
    to radiative WPT, the pathloss is significantly smaller (42 dB at 6.78 MHz compared
    to 95 dB at 915 MHz over 30-cm transfer distance when the soil moisture content
    is saturated). Therefore, IPT can supply enough power for sensors buried at the
    depth of 30–120 cm. Although the effective operating range of IPT is typically
    smaller than the coil diameter, its simplicity and capacity to deliver adequate
    power to Rx located at a few tens of centimeters away from Tx [33••] make it suitable
    for charging WUSN. To overcome the drawback of short efficient transfer distance,
    a special type of IPT called MRC has been developed. In MRC, the intermediate
    coils are utilized to extend the transfer distance (Fig. 4d). These coils are
    tuned to the same resonant frequency by external or parasitic capacitors to form
    resonant tanks, so that the magnetic field is significantly improved. In 2007,
    Kurs et al. [54] pioneered the idea of MRC when using 4-coil system to brighten
    a 60-W light bulb. The system could achieve 40% efficiency over a 2-m transfer
    distance, which is eight times greater than the coil radius. Duong et al. [55]
    regulated the coupling factors between the resonant coil and load coil or source
    coil to achieve the matching condition. The experiment showed that efficiencies
    are developed to 46.2 and 29.3% at distances of 60 and 100 cm, respectively. Moreover,
    a new method but with similar approach to resonate the coil in the WPT system
    was presented in [56]. They utilized three coils to resonate frequency of the
    system: Tx, Rx, and an intermediate coil. It is applied to transfer 150 W at 250
    kHz with 85% efficiency. Similar to IPT, MRC benefits in lower loss compared to
    radiative WPT. Despite the ability of transmitting power up to several kilowatts
    over a distance several times greater than the coil diameter with higher efficiency
    compared to IPT, the increase in the number of coils could lead to the complexity
    and high-cost MRC system. Another type of non-radiative WPT is CPT. In contrast
    to IPT and MRC, which transmit power through magnetic fields, CPT uses electric
    fields to transfer the power from the Tx plates to the Rx plates as can be seen
    from Fig. 4e. Since the two plates of the coupled capacitor are close together,
    the electric field is directed from the positive plate to the negative plate.
    Therefore, CPT has lower electromagnetic interference (EMI) and heat loss caused
    by eddy current. However, due to the loose coupling, CPT can only be utilized
    in applications with very short charging distance, even only a few millimeters.
    Li et al. [57] employed the electric field resonance method, which combines inductive
    coupling and capacitive coupling. The system is similar to a 4-coil WPT system;
    however, the inductive coupling between two resonators is replaced by capacitive
    coupling. A 91% DC–DC efficiency can be achieved over a 17-mm transfer distance.
    Liu et al. [58] presented a matrix-type transmitter to maintain a steady output
    voltage when the position of the receiver varies. However, the efficiency is only
    54% under the maximum coupling when the transfer distance is 0.5 mm. Despite the
    low cost, simple implementation, and low-EMI characteristic, the extremely short
    transfer distance and the requirement of exact alignment between Tx and Rx are
    the primary obstacles to applying CPT for WUSN. Power Based on Wireless Charging
    Methods WPT technologies vary widely in terms of working distance, power transfer
    efficiency, and power density (Table 3). Although WPT has reached technical maturity,
    most research works in the literature employ a resistor as a load instead of an
    actual battery. Therefore, the charging time is not usually explicitly reported.
    Directional radiative WPT benefits in far-distance transmitting, while omnidirectional
    radiative WPT does not require the exact position and direction of the receiver
    (Table 4). Generally, these far-field methods show several limitations: clear
    space between transmitter and receiver, extremely poor efficiency, and the complex
    implementation. Therefore, far-field WPT could not be applied for charging underground
    devices. Table 4 Summary of wireless power transfer and its ability to use in
    WUSN Full size table CPT is unsuitable for underground sensors due to the millimeter-range
    transfer distance and the requirement of alignment between transmitter and receiver.
    MRC is a potential candidate for underground wireless charging. The lower operating
    frequency compared to radiative WPT could reduce the loss caused by reflection
    and absorption when the electromagnetic waves propagate through different media
    (air–soil) or through the soil. The ability to transfer power over a large distance
    that reaches several times the coil size with high efficiency is the greatest
    advantage of MRC. However, the complexity due to the increase in the number of
    coils might result in a bulky and high-cost system. IPT appears to be the most
    suitable option for WPT in a wireless soil moisture sensing network. Although
    IPT has a shorter power transfer range than that of MRC, the system is simple
    and can be used for agricultural applications. IPT could provide sufficient energy
    to power sensors when only a few watts are needed, and efficiency is not the main
    priority. In addition, compared to other WPT technologies, IPT has been developed
    and commercialized for a long time in many applications. In conclusion, IPT is
    the most qualified candidate to supply power for underground sensors in an agricultural
    system. However, this approach presents several challenges. Pathloss is significantly
    higher when the electromagnetic waves propagate over the soil, which is a conducting
    and heterogeneous medium, or through different media (air–soil). This leads to
    a substantial decrease in the efficiency of the WPT system. Besides, the absence
    of precise position information of receivers cause misalignment, which might result
    in unstable output power [59, 60]. Therefore, these issues need to be resolved
    when applying IPT to supply power for wireless sensors embedded in the soil. Future
    Outlook As discussed above, there are two major aspects that need to be considered
    for the development of wireless soil moisture sensors: sensing method and self-powered
    solution. In the process of constructing the sensing network with real-time measurement,
    a low-power-consumption device with acceptable accuracy is favorable; therefore,
    technology such as capacitive sensor is preferred over others. Nevertheless, there
    are a few aspects for further research and development. Capacitive sensor requires
    meticulous installation since insufficient contact surface of the plates will
    lead to dramatic change in measured result. Consequently, careful calibration
    is needed to minimize the effect of improper contact between the soil and the
    capacitor. Moreover, the output signal of the sensor is usually small and poor
    in resolution; thus, a quality post-processing algorithm is recommended to improve
    the precision of measurement. WPT-based IPT has been identified as the most suitable
    option for powering underground wireless sensors. However, there are two remaining
    challenges. First, due to the attenuation of the electromagnetic wave when it
    travels from air to soil, the impact of soil on the system’s performance must
    be comprehensively analyzed to determine the optimal operating parameters. Second,
    existing localization technologies struggle to pinpoint the location of underground
    sensor nodes with centimeter-range accuracy. This may affect the system’s performance
    because of the misalignment between transmitter and receiver. Therefore, further
    research work on misalignment solutions is highly recommended. Conclusions In
    this work, current soil moisture sensing and wireless power transfer technologies
    were reviewed and evaluated. The evaluation focused on the compatibility of the
    methodologies for a wireless underground sensor network to support on-demand irrigation
    for water saving and pollution prevention. Information and data corroborated from
    this study show that capacitive sensor for soil moisture sensing and inductive
    power transfer for wireless charging can be combined for constructing a rechargeable
    underground wireless sensor network. The combination of capacitive sensing and
    inductive power transfer can meet all requirements for an underground wireless
    soil moisture sensing network including affordability, measurement reliability,
    power consumption, ease of wireless charging, and power transfer capability and
    efficiency. This combination is also effective for eliminating waste caused by
    dead sensor nodes and reducing cost while still ensuring adequate accuracy. This
    review also suggests several critical improvements and further research to enhance
    the performance of the proposed wireless soil moisture sensing network. Data Availability

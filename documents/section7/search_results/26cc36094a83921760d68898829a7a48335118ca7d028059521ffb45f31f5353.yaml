    media analysisTechnology adoptionEmerging technologies 1. Introduction In the
    rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), generative large language
    models (LLMs) have emerged as a pivotal innovation. Language models are probabilistic
    models that enable the processing of natural language through algorithms, and
    they are the core of the natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The term
    ‘large’ refers to the huge number of parameters needed to train these models,
    whereas the term ‘generative’ indicates a subset of LLMs specifically designed
    to generate text. Generative LLMs are at the forefront of numerous applications,
    ranging from summarisation to translation, typically delivered through dialogue-like
    interactions with the user (Zhao et al., 2023). The dynamic of the dialogue eases
    the interaction of users on the system (Dang et al., 2022). According to the Technology
    Acceptance Model, perceived ease of use and usefulness are the factors that influence
    user acceptance of technology (Davis, 1989). Indeed, these systems are engendering
    an unprecedented impact in terms of user numbers, estimated to be over 100 million
    in January 2023 (Huang et al., 2023). The rise of generative LLMs has been led
    by ChatGPT, the openAI conversational system built on the generative pre-trained
    transformer (GPT) model launched in late 2022. Other relevant generative LLMs
    are Microsoft''s Bing, which focuses on interacting with the web to provide answers
    based on present information, and Google''s PaLM, known for its improved multilingual,
    reasoning, and coding capabilities. Meta''s LLaMA is another contender in the
    space, with an approach to multi-modal learning that integrates both text and
    image data. Despite already reaching millions of users, generative LLMs are still
    in their infancy, aligning with what innovation literature defines as emerging
    technologies. These are characterized by radical novelty, rapid growth, coherence,
    prominent impact, and a degree of uncertainty and ambiguity (Rotolo et al., 2015).
    Moreover, these new generative models have found applications across a wide spectrum
    of fields, making them general-purpose technologies (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg,
    1995). Earlier NLP models were often highly task-specific, whereas newer NLP technologies
    exhibit remarkable versatility and can seamlessly handle a variety of tasks (Bouschery
    et al., 2023). The success of these models is not solely determined by the quality
    of their output and their general-purpose nature (refer to Section 2 for more
    details), but primarily by the way users can interact with them. Fig. 1 elucidates
    this interaction. A user starts by defining a task. The user then interacts with
    the model by describing a task (e.g. writing a research paper, generating novel
    ideas for a market advertising, or debugging a Python code) via a prompt (i.e.,
    a request made to the generative system), which is then sent to the model. The
    model analyses the prompt and responds with a textual output. Since the user expects
    a certain result, the result is compared with the actual output. The user is then
    able to iterate a new prompt to refine the output, thus engaging in a form of
    conversation with the system until the output does not match the expected result.

    Fig. 1. A model for the interaction between a user and a Generative LLM. Verbs
    on the arrows. At present, generative LLMs have characteristics that limit the
    possibility to study their behaviour and how users are interacting with them.
    First, the systems are black boxes in the sense that their huge size (i.e., 175
    billion parameters for ChatGPT) limits their explainability, a problem largely
    studied in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) (Barredo Arrieta
    et al., 2020). Second, the prompts and responses of the models are proprietary
    to the owner companies. Some websites that are collecting this information are
    emerging, but the information stored is still limited and unable to give a full
    understanding of LLM behaviour. LLMs are poised to change people''s relationship
    with technology and with AI, a phenomenon that is challenging to study. Considering
    the growing importance of the topic of AI for the innovation management community
    (Mariani et al., 2023), innovation researchers are expected to better elucidate
    the evolution of generative LLMs. Given the challenging characteristics of the
    technology, we identified a research gap that lies in the point where the user
    interacts with the systems: the tasks (i.e. what generative LLMs are asked to
    do). This problem has been identified for AI in general, but no clear research
    path has been identified to solve it (Cho et al., 2023). We aimed to address this
    gap by analysing descriptions of task that users are asking generative LLMs. Specifically,
    we sought to answer the following research question: Which are the tasks that
    users are asking generative LLMs? Answering such a question has implications both
    for theory and practice. A clear map of LLM tasks, can enable researchers to study
    how users are interacting with LLMs while this technology is emerging. A quantitative
    view in this direction is essential to complement the scientific discourse on
    the topic, that given the impossibility to have access to first hand data, risks
    to focus only on opinion papers and qualitative research. Also, companies can
    explore the map to understand how LLMs can be used in their context, and to spot
    priorities of users that are early adopters of the technology. Given the paste
    at which LLMs has pervaded the market, companies are missing maps to explore this
    unknown territory. From the theoretical side, developing the correct metrics on
    the collection of tasks can enable to very if and how much emerging and general-purpose
    technologies as LLMs fit to consolidated innovation theories. We conducted a case
    study based on textual analysis of Twitter data (renamed X from July 2023 but
    called Twitter in the rest of the paper for the sake of simplicity) on ChatGPT.
    Textual analysis of Twitter has been adopted in literature using various methods
    for analysing emerging technologies. Some methods are based on bibliometric data,
    such as citation analysis (Small et al., 2014), whereas others are based on textual
    data (Porter et al., 2019; Ranaei et al., 2020), such as patents, scientific paper,
    and social media. The analysis of textual data with NLP outperforms bibliometric
    analysis (Arts et al., 2021), and Twitter has been confirmed to be a reliable
    source to explore trends in product development (Ozcan et al., 2021). The choice
    of Twitter was also informed by our aim to concentrate on the tasks users assign
    to ChatGPT. Many researchers have utilized Twitter to capture this user feedback,
    even to analyse user opinions on emerging technologies (Kohl et al., 2018; Li
    et al., 2019, 2022). Finally, we selected ChatGPT considering its widespread adoption.
    We collected 3,821,843 tweets talking about ChatGPT published between November
    2022 and May 2023. Using named entity recognition (NER) techniques, a branch of
    NLP, we filtered the tweets describing tasks assigned to ChatGPT and isolated
    the textual description of these tasks. Next, we clustered the tasks using a topic
    modelling technique based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
    (BERT), namely, BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), to identify groups of similar tasks.
    We thus obtained a map of the uses of ChatGPT and discussed the emerging areas
    of its application. With this map, we identified the business areas where ChatGPT
    is having an impact in terms of users’ requests, as well as the opportunities
    for research and innovation in the realm of generative LLMs. Our findings show
    that NLP can help having a clear view of the dynamics that stands at the intersection
    of an emerging technology and users. NLP has proven to be a proper method to identify
    relevant part of texts from large social media databases (thanks to NER) and to
    synthesise this information to give a map of LLMs tasks (thanks to topic modelling).
    Empirically, the proposed map will help orient towards LLMs applications in business.
    Our findings uncover a broad spectrum of ChatGPT applications, ranging from programming
    assistance to creative content generation, underscoring the versatility and potential
    of LLMs in revolutionizing business processes and services. We identified six
    emerging areas of significant application: human resources, programming, social
    media, office automation, search engines, and education. The integration of the
    results with the phases of innovation, will help researchers focus on promising
    areas that are having an impact on users practice with LLMs. In fact, we synthesized
    the research opportunities in a preliminary research agenda and highlighted future
    research challenges that innovation management scholars will need to face to answer
    the proposed questions. Finally, our study also contributes to open research on
    the topic, to incentivise quantitative research, by opening the collected dataset
    and analysis (https://github.com/NutrientAxis/tasks_asked_to_ChatGPT). 2. Technological
    advancement of large language models LLMs represent a class of NLP technologies
    that leverage extensive textual data for both understanding and generating natural
    language. To elucidate how these models operate and their key features, we conducted
    a review of the major technological advancements in NLP from its inception. One
    of the first and simplest algorithms applied to extract information from texts
    is the bag-of-words (BoW). It operates by representing a document as a collection
    (‘bag’) of its constituent words, with no consideration for the order or structure
    of the words in the document (Hofmann et al., 2019). To address this limitation,
    researchers have used two-dimensionality reduction techniques, namely, latent
    semantic analysis (LSA) and singular value decomposition (SVD). Another commonly
    used dimensionality reduction technique is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
    LDA is employed to extract topics from a collection of documents and then classify
    them based on the distribution of these topics (Hannigan et al., 2022). Recently,
    NLP research has shifted its focus towards word-embedding algorithms, which are
    trained on large amounts of textual data to capture the semantic meaning of words.
    These algorithms can be categorised as LLMs, representing a significant leap in
    NLP technology (Ameye et al., 2023; Just, 2024; Song et al., 2023). Word-embedding
    techniques leverage artificial neural networks to represent words as dense semantic
    vectors of real numbers (i.e. vectors that embed the meaning of words) (Mikolov
    et al., 2013). Traditional word embeddings provide a single vector for a given
    word, regardless of context and possible polysemy. In the past few years, a novel
    class of LLM algorithms has been created, transformers (or contextual word embeddings),
    of which BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is one of the first and more popular architectures.
    Transformers address previous system limitations by considering the textual context
    of words or phrases. One of the first generative LLMs was GPT. Introduced by OpenAI
    in 2018, GPT employs the power of transformer architecture, such as BERT, to generate
    natural language. Over the years, the LLM field has witnessed significant advancements,
    leading to the emergence of a new category of GPT technologies, notably OpenAI''s
    GPT-3 (Ouyang et al., 2022). GPT-3 stands out as a large, task-agnostic model
    capable of performing a wide range of NLP tasks based on user prompts presented
    in natural language (see Section 1 and Fig. 1 for more details). Models like GPT-3
    are trained on extensive document corpora, enabling them to learn the distribution
    of words in text and generate new text sequences (Reynolds and McDonell, 2021).
    In November 2022, OpenAI launched a conversational AI, called ChatGPT (Van Dis
    et al., 2023), built on GPT-3 technology. Following the success of GPT-3 and ChatGPT,
    several other companies have ventured into the development of generative LLMs.
    Notably, Google introduced PaLM2, and Meta unveiled LLaMA. In March 2023, OpenAI
    released GPT-4, a powerful language model trained on a substantial number of documents
    (Sanderson, 2023). OpenAI is actively working on launching another model, GPT-5,
    which is expected to be trained on an even larger and more extensive dataset.
    Generative LLMs are in their infancy, aligning perfectly with the definition of
    emerging technologies in innovation literature. These are characterized by radical
    novelty, relatively rapid growth, coherence, prominent impact, and a degree of
    uncertainty and ambiguity (Rotolo et al., 2015). The radical novelty of LLMs is
    evident in the model''s ability to understand and generate human-like text, pushing
    the boundaries of natural language processing and artificial intelligence. This
    is not a mere incremental improvement over existing technologies but a significant
    leap forward, introducing capabilities previously thought to be exclusive to human
    intelligence (Makridakis et al., 2023). For what concern rapid growth, Generative
    LLMs reached millions of users in just a few months (Burtsev et al., 2023), a
    pace of adoption that is both remarkable and indicative of their transformative
    potential. The rapid growth of Generative LLMs can be attributed to several factors.
    Firstly, the technology itself is highly scalable. Once developed, deploying these
    models to serve additional users often requires relatively marginal increases
    in resources compared to the initial investment in training and infrastructure.
    This scalability allows LLMs to be made accessible to a broad audience swiftly.
    Moreover, the growth of LLMs is pushed by the network effects in the technology
    ecosystem. As more users engage with LLMs, more data becomes available, which,
    in turn, can be used to train and refine the models, making them more accurate
    and effective. This self-reinforcing cycle contributes to the rapid improvement
    and adoption of LLMs, making their growth trajectory even faster. Finally, the
    versatility and broad applicability of LLMs have powered their rapid adoption.
    The last aspect is also linked to another characteristic of emerging technology:
    prominent impact. In fact, these new generative models have found applications
    across a wide spectrum of fields, such as scientific writing (Else, 2023; Stokel-Walker,
    2023), chemistry (Hocky and White, 2022), journalism (Pavlik, 2023), psychology
    (Lee et al., 2022), human resources management (Budhwar et al., 2023), healthcare
    (Sallam, 2023), and education (Graham, 2022; Stokel-Walker, 2022). Other reports
    have used these models in experiments, such as programming code, writing songs,
    and writing cover letters (Chatterjee and Dethlefs, 2023). While its potential
    is vast, there are also significant challenges and uncertainty regarding its future
    development, governance, and broader implications. Issues related to bias, fairness,
    accountability, and the potential for misuse (Abadie et al., 2024; Ali et al.,
    2024) necessitate careful consideration and ongoing research. This uncertainty
    nature is typical of emerging technologies. When considering the four distinct
    phases of the innovation process identified by Salerno et al. (2015), namely,
    idea generation, idea selection, development, and diffusion, generative LLMs have
    been employed for diverse purposes. In the idea generation phase, Piller et al.
    (2023) employed generative LLMs to enhance the creative process. Moving to the
    idea selection phase, Hong et al. (2022) introduced systems for screening ideas
    to facilitate the early stages of technological development, leveraging patent
    analysis and Word2Vec. In the context of the development phase, Deloose et al.
    (2023) created systems that classify failures within industrial contexts. As for
    the diffusion phase, Arts et al. (2021) discovered that NLP technologies outperform
    other approaches in assessing the impact of new technologies on the market. In
    recent years, an increasing number of literature reviews have explored the adoption
    of NLP and LLMs in innovation. Antons et al. (2020) conducted a comprehensive
    review of the state-of-the-art NLP systems employed in innovation research. Siddharth
    et al. (2022) delved into the literature to examine NLP applications in design,
    shedding light on their role in enhancing the creative and design processes. Just
    (2024) reported deeper insights into how NLP approaches enrich intermediation
    in the early stages of innovation search. These reviews collectively underscore
    the growing significance of NLP and LLMs in innovation research and their capacity
    to revolutionise each of the innovation phases. 3. Methodology Fig. 2 presents
    the methodological steps for analysing the tasks performed by ChatGPT. First,
    we collected tweets related to ChatGPT; second, we used NER techniques to identify
    the tasks that users assigned to ChatGPT; third, we normalised the identified
    tasks; and finally, we clustered the tasks using BERTopic. Download : Download

    of the adopted methodology. 3.1. Twitter data collection We collected 3,821,843
    tweets using the Twitter API. Twitter queries used for data extraction included
    the following keywords: ‘chat-gpt’, ‘chat gpt’, ‘chatgpt’, ‘#chatgpt’, and ‘#gpt3’.
    Other generative AI systems, such as AgentGPT and Google Bard, exist, and new
    ones may emerge in the future. Nevertheless, given that OpenAI, with its product
    ChatGPT, is the first mover in this field, we hypothesised that replicating the
    success and popularity of ChatGPT could be challenging. For instance, in May 2023,
    the tweets about AgentGPT (searched as #agentgpt) and Google Bard (#googlebard)
    were only 2399 and 11,688, respectively. For this reason, we assumed that our
    search strategy would be robust. The data collection addressed tweets published
    from November 3, 2022, when OpenAI''s ChatGPT was launched, to May 16, 2023. The
    dataset we collected from Twitter spanned a period of six months. The dataset
    included only English tweets. Twitter is recognised as a reliable tool for studying
    emerging technologies (Kohl et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019, 2022). The temporal
    perspective can vary widely, ranging from recent monthly analyses to decades-long
    timeframes (Lacasa et al., 2003). Compared with these studies, our research analysed
    3,821,843 tweets, much larger than that in other studies that adopted similar
    approaches: 3646 tweets in Li et al. (2019), 29,272 tweets in Li et al. (2022),
    and 1,963,905 tweets in Kohl et al. (2018). This comparison illustrates that despite
    the relatively short temporal window (about six months) of our study, our research
    aligns with other works that utilize Twitter to analyse emerging technologies.
    3.2. Task identification with named entity recognition We analysed the Twitter
    data collected in Section 3.1 using NER techniques to identify the tasks assigned
    to ChatGPT. We used NER, an NLP technique to sort specific entities in the text
    into specific categories. For a comprehensive understanding of the different NER
    techniques, refer to the work of Puccetti et al. (2023), section 3.2. To the best
    of our knowledge, the literature on NER systems for extracting tasks performed
    by technology is limited. The NER methods aiming at categorising technical entities
    focus on extracting technological concepts, such as technologies (Giordano et
    al., 2021), functions (Yoon et al., 2013), chemical compounds (Ohms, 2021), and
    biomedical entities (Huang et al., 2020). None of these works attempts to recognise
    the entity ‘task’ in the textual data. Only the work of Choi et al. (2021) used
    rule-based NER to identify actions performed by humans in procedures. Nevertheless,
    they tailored their system to recognise tasks exclusively within a specific textual
    domain (procedures), within a particular context (the nuclear field), and for
    a distinct case study. This specific design limits the applicability of Choi et
    al.’s (2021) system to our Twitter dataset. Indeed, tweets have a conversational
    tone different from the formal text structure of procedures. For these reasons,
    we developed a new rule-based NER instead of using state-of-the-art systems, given
    that existing systems may not have been specifically trained to identify the specific
    entities (‘task’) that are the focus of our research. We manually analysed 1000
    tweets and then identified a recurring pattern for expressing a task in natural
    language: [ChatGPT TECHNOLOGY] + [CONNECTION ELEMENT] + [ACTION VERB] + [OBJECT]
    This pattern indicates that users tend to express tasks for ChatGPT by writing
    the name of the technology, followed by a variable sequence of words (the ‘connection
    element’), an action verb (expressed through a verb and other optional words,
    e.g. adverb, articles, and adjectives), and a direct object. Table 1 lists all
    the identified terms and sequences. We created the rule-based approach by creating
    all possible combinations of these elements. Table 1. Rules used for building

    Compound Direct Object (excluding: me, you, it, him, her, us, them, this, that,
    those, these) We measured the precision and recall performance of the rule-based
    NER system (Tsai et al., 2006) using a sample of 1000 tweets that was manually
    checked as a golden set. We specified whether a tweet discussed a task performed
    by ChatGPT. The system had a precision of 0.59 and recall of 0.44. The lower recall
    performance did not negatively affect our research, which aimed to elucidate the
    utilisation of LMMs, not to create the most effective NER system for task identification.
    In other words, the low recall performance is not a problem given that the macroscopic
    phenomena can still be observed. Regarding precision, the pre-processing phase,
    described in Section 3.3, was designed to address the challenges posed by informal
    language, misspellings, and colloquial expressions, which can lead to incorrect
    task identification. Moreover, for the clustering of similar tasks in the next
    step, we filtered the noisy ones with a manual revision of the clusters, reaching
    a theoretical precision of 100% of the overall process (i.e. only actual tasks
    performed by ChatGPT were manually included in the analysis). Finally, we applied
    the rule-based NER to the tweets.1 We extracted 526,861 tasks from 496,099 tweets,
    and we collected 232,449 unique tasks. The NER method has proven to be effective
    in achieving the desired outcomes. However, some limitations should be highlighted.
    Firstly, if there is a shift in the type of entity being extracted (for instance,
    from tasks to technology), it will be necessary to modify the extraction rules
    accordingly. For guidance on extracting technology entities, one can refer to
    Puccetti et al. (2023); for user entities, to Bonaccorsi et al. (2021); and for
    user needs, to Spada et al. (2023). Secondly, NER systems that utilize machine
    learning and LLMs for text representation have been shown to outperform rule-based
    extraction methods across various NER tasks, as highlighted by Puccetti et al.
    (2023). However, adopting this approach requires the creation of a gold standard
    dataset, and the costs associated with this process are deemed to exceed the potential
    benefits in terms of increased precision and recall for the system needed in the
    present work, as previously discussed. 3.3. Data pre-processing pipeline We then
    processed the list of 232,449 tasks with a data pre-processing pipeline for removing
    noise and normalising its text. The process consisted of the following steps:
    1. Lemmatisation; 2. Removal of adverbs as terms that do not provide any meaningful
    information about the task; 3. Identification of the groups of tasks in our set
    that were synonyms (terms written with a different spelling but having the same
    meaning) using semantic similarity methods. These algorithms mapped each task
    to a vector in a 1024-dimensional semantic space using the BERT model stsb-distilbert-base2
    (Devlin et al., 2018) and calculated cosine similarity between each task pair.
    Tasks were grouped together if their cosine similarity was greater than 0.92;
    4. Automatic removal of tasks occurring less than six times; 5. Manual removal
    of entities that could not accurately be classified as ‘tasks performed by ChatGPT’
    but were nonetheless extracted by our algorithm. The entities list was manually
    screened by three of the authors. Subsequently, the list of tasks consisted of
    31,747 unique tasks identified in 262,192 tweets, representing 6.86% of the starting
    database of tweets. The pre-processing steps used in the proposed methodology
    are largely used in text-mining techniques and have been proven effective in the
    context of technology and innovation (Antons et al., 2020). 3.4. BERTopic We clustered
    the 31,747 tasks using the BERTopic algorithm (Grootendorst, 2022). BERTopic is
    a clustering technique leveraging word embeddings and has excellent effectiveness
    for the topic modelling of tweets (Egger and Yu, 2022). The method has also been
    used in the context of technology mapping and exploration (Jeon et al., 2023).
    Details on the mathematical model and usages of the approach have been reported
    by Grootendorst (2022). In our study, the algorithm first generated document embeddings
    using the transformer all-MiniLM-L6-v2, which could map each task into a 384-dimensional
    dense vector space. Second, it reduced their dimensionality and clustered them
    based on semantic similarity (calculated through the cosine similarity between
    vectors). Finally, it provided a topic representation. In this way, we obtained
    a set of topics, with each topic referring to a group of semantically similar
    tasks. We then analysed the distribution of these topics on a semantic map and
    the number of tweets associated with each topic for measuring popularity and relevance.
    BerTopic proven to give the desired output. Anyway, the decision to utilize the
    transformer model, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and its corresponding 384-dimensional dense
    vector space is based on empirical evidence. As of now, there are no studies that
    definitively prove this approach to be the optimal solution for the task at hand.
    Furthermore, like the constraints encountered with rule-based NER, the performance
    of the grouping task could be enhanced by having a golden set of similar tasks
    for reference and switching from clustering to classification. However, the creation
    of such a labelled dataset falls outside the scope of this paper. We also believe
    that the potential improvement in performance would not justify the costs associated
    with manually annotating the data. Furthermore, adopting classification instead
    of clustering would require specifying the classes for grouping tasks a priori,
    information that was not available before our study. Lastly, the semantic map
    employed to present the results relies on dimensionality reduction via the Uniform
    Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, as described by McInnes
    et al. (2018). This choice, too, is based on empirical judgment. It''s worth noting
    that other visualization techniques might reveal additional nuances of the data,
    offering further insights into our findings. 4. Results and discussion By applying
    the methodology outlined in Section 3, we identified 262,192 tweets that described
    a task (6.86% of the starting database of tweets) and a total of 31,747 unique
    tasks. These tasks were then clustered using the BERTopic algorithm into 389 topics;
    a topic consisted of a group of semantically similar tasks (e.g. Writing a poem,
    Writing a haiku, Generating a poem, Writing a sonnet, and Creating a poem). The
    label of the topic was assigned based on the task with the greatest number of
    tweets. Table 2 shows the top 10 topics, in terms of the number of tweets citing
    a task in the topic, along with the total number of tweets, number of different
    tasks, and top five tasks in terms of the number of tweets. In this section, we
    explore each line of the table, establishing connections with theories of innovation.
    To ensure brevity, we discuss some lines collectively. The methodology for grouping
    tasks for discussion was determined by the authors, who evaluated the task descriptions
    reviewing the whole set of tasks available in the dataset and considered the characteristics
    of the document cited in the task, such as its length, the technical nature of
    its content, and its specific field. Table 2. Top 10 topics of tasks mentioned
    in tweets. # Topic Number of tweets Number of tasks Task (number of tweets citing

    an email (1,001), generate emails (232), draft an email (96), write work emails
    (90), write blogs newsletter (57) Lines 1 and 3 contain the topics Write code
    and Write a poem, respectively, that properly represent the versatility of ChatGPT
    and its span of uses. This variety of tasks demonstrated its widespread acceptance
    across different domains. This aligns with Diffusion of Innovations (Rogers, 2004),
    indicating that ChatGPT is traversing the first stages of the innovation adoption
    lifecycle. Write code shows that in the Information Technology and Software Development
    sectors, AI-driven code generation and optimisation is significantly streamlining
    development processes, reducing the time and resources required for debugging
    and optimising code. In parallel, the impact it will have on creativity-intensive
    document production, such as poems, poses big challenges for creative tasks. Line
    2 shows the topic Write article, a generic one that contains abstract tasks (e.g.
    Write something). Thus, many users are describing tasks with a high level of abstraction
    and are playing with ChatGPT to explore its performance. They are having their
    first interaction with generative LLMs through ChatGPT. ChatGPT''s purpose is
    to open up the power of generative AI—already well-known by researchers (Radford
    et al., 2018)—to a wider public. The high level of abstraction points to the initial
    exploratory stage of technology adoption, reflecting the perceived ease of use
    and curiosity-driven engagement, which are core aspects of the Technology Acceptance
    Model (Davis, 1989). The next topics on lines 4 and 6 are focused on one of the
    tasks that ChatGPT has proven to be good at (i.e. Answer questions and Give Answers),
    so much so that it poses a threat to search engines, such as Google. These tasks
    are so important that ChatGPT is perceived by users as a potential game changer
    in the search engine market, which has been a monopoly. Owing to a large investment
    in OpenAI, Microsoft is seeking to gain market share in this context, threatening
    the leading position of Google. Although ChatGPT is not a search engine, the conversational
    interaction (i.e. without the need to write a query but asking the engine questions)
    it uses shows a potentially new class of products, indicating potential for disruptive
    innovation. By providing conversational interaction, ChatGPT may redefine user
    expectations and behaviours in information retrieval, challenging established
    players in the market (Bower and Christensen, 1995). Lines 5 and 8 give the results
    for the tasks Write story and Write essay, respectively. These tasks pertain to
    two different types of content (the first related to narrative writing, the second
    to technical writing) that are longer than the ones described before. This shows
    the ability of ChatGPT to cope with longer texts. ChatGPT (and all LLMs in general)
    has some limitations in terms of the length of the output texts (Zhao et al.,
    2021), which may be surmounted in the future. Notably, the potential improvements
    in handling longer text outputs suggest incremental innovations in the capabilities
    of transformer-based systems like ChatGPT. Also, its ability to impact diverse
    fields, such as software development, creative writing, and search engines, hints
    at radical innovations that could reshape entire industries (Dewar and Dutton,
    1986). For example, in the Publishing and Education sectors, AI''s ability to
    generate longer, complex texts can transform content creation. For publishers,
    the technology introduces questions of authenticity and copyright in AI-authored
    works. In education, it presents opportunities for personalised learning materials
    but also challenges in assessing students'' original work amidst AI-generated
    content. Line 7 gives the topic Write a tweet, which reflects the impact that
    the tool could have on social media. The fact that ChatGPT can generate social
    media posts can destroy the content industry, by making content creators into
    prompt creators. Impacts, which also emerge from other tasks we analysed, can
    be negative in the production of disinformation pieces or generally low-quality
    content. This diversity of tasks—from creating social media content to writing
    stories and essays—shows how users are adapting ChatGPT for their unique needs
    and aligns with the concept of user-driven innovation, where the users themselves
    play a critical role in the development and application of new technologies (Von
    Hippel, 1986). As more users engage with ChatGPT for a variety of tasks, the better
    would network effects come into play. The value of the AI system increases with
    the number of users, as it learns from diverse input and improves its performance
    across tasks (Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1997). Finally, lines 9 and 10 give topics
    in the realm of office automation. The topic Replace developer highlights a common
    perception among users that AI could potentially substitute humans in performing
    tasks in various fields (see topic 1). Indeed, AI can automate certain tasks.
    However, AI is not intended to replace humans but rather augment their capabilities.
    For example, the ability to generate, draft, and even personalise emails can greatly
    enhance office productivity, allowing workers to dedicate more time to tasks that
    require human creativity and strategic thinking. The idea that AI can replace
    certain tasks but not entire jobs is reminiscent of the job-task approach (Autor,
    2013). This theory suggests that automation is more likely to replace specific
    tasks within a job rather than the entire job itself, leading to a change in jobs
    and the skills required. Fig. 3 shows the results of the topic modelling represented
    as a scatter plot, offering a bird''s-eye view of the collected topics of tasks
    and their similarities. In the figure, all the 31,747 extracted tasks are located
    in a bi-dimensional space and grouped in topics represented by colours. We performed
    dimensionality reduction through the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
    technique (McInnes et al., 2018). In Fig. 3, each task is represented by a dot,
    and the topics of tasks also present a label, indicating the main task that represents
    the group. The distances between the tasks (and between the topics, which are
    clusters of tasks) in the scatter plot are calculated through their semantic similarity.
    If two topics are semantically similar, they are represented close to each other
    in the graph. The grey dots represent the outliers topic, which are 8156 tasks
    for which BERTopic could not find a suitable cluster. Download : Download high-res

    mentioned by users on Twitter. The map in Fig. 3 offers data-driven views of the
    different business areas of development of tools such as ChatGPT, highlighting
    six emerging areas of application: related to tasks able to improve productivity
    (automation for repetitive office tasks), tasks belonging to human resources (write
    a resume), programming (writing and explaining code), social media (from tweets
    to blogs to jokes), education (pass exams, write essays, generate academic paper),
    and search engines (answering questions, replacing Google search). 5. Research
    agenda Building on the empirical evidence of Section 4, we formulated a series
    of research questions to guide further studies on the potential impacts of generative
    LLMs on innovation management. To transition from our empirical findings to a
    structured research agenda, we performed an in-depth analysis of each topic (the
    top 10 shown in Table 2, and the 379 in others). We adopted a dual-dimensional
    framework, intertwining the six emerging areas of application shown in section
    4 with the four main phases of the innovation process as defined by Salerno et
    al. (2015). This approach allowed us to map a matrix that captures the intersection
    of generative LLMs’ applications with the stages of innovation, from ideation
    to market penetration. Table 3 synthesises the proposed research questions. Each
    emerging area is linked to the empirical evidence by showing the two most related
    topics (Table 2). Table 3. Opportunities for future research on generative LLMs

    Will generative LLMs open new markets in the education field? How can generative
    LLMs affect access to education and the digital divide? Scholars and practitioners
    have already engaged in discussions surrounding some of the points in the identified
    agenda, as shown by Mariani et al. (2023). Nonetheless, we expected the proposed
    research agenda to contribute to the literature. First, previously identified
    challenges were unrelated to generative LLMs but were discussed for AI in general.
    This specific type of technology was our focus, given its impact in the technology
    development field and on society in general. Second, the challenges that we identified
    in relation to generative LLMs emerged from a quantitative study. This will give
    the opportunity to the research community to monitor these challenges and compare
    them with others derived from different research approaches (e.g. qualitative
    ones). 5.1. Business-area challenges Human Resources: HR is a knowledge-intensive
    area. Thus, it will be challenging to guide and monitor the impact that generative
    LLMs will have on the production of HR-related documents (e.g. job postings, job
    profile descriptions, and curricula). Given also that this kind of document is
    private, researchers must monitor and help companies in adapting to the ever-evolving
    HR practices and regulations of AI-generated solutions in HR. The dynamic nature
    of HR practices, legal regulations, and ethical standards can be expected to increase
    in the next decade, requiring continuous updates and fine-tuning of both HR practices
    and AI models. Programming: Elucidating the impact of generative LLMs on software
    innovation will required multidisciplinary research that integrates the domains
    of management, innovation, and computer science. The integration of generative
    LLMs could impact the industry of integrated development environments and other
    software development tools that could revolutionise the way developers work. AI-generated
    code suggestions, real-time debugging, and code optimisation could become standard
    features in these tools, improving productivity and reducing the time needed to
    bring new software products to market. In turn, barriers to entry for software
    development become lower. Social Media: Researchers working on the use of generative
    systems for innovating the social media content production process should balance
    the potential of automated content generation with ethical concerns, such as the
    spread of disinformation, filter bubbles, and manipulation of public opinion.
    When studying novel business models, researchers should ensure that the new approaches
    respect user privacy, adhere to data protection regulations, and avoid intrusive
    data collection. Office Automation: The ability of generative AI to support specific
    office tasks, especially knowledge-intensive and domain-specific ones, will depend
    on how much companies can train generative LLMs on proprietary data. The lack
    of domain-specific data can limit the accuracy and effectiveness of these technologies
    in performing certain tasks, which can hinder its adoption and impact. Scholars
    will need to investigate approaches for acquiring and sharing domain-specific
    data, including data-sharing agreements and incentives for companies to share
    their data. Search Engines: Generative AI is progressively integrated with search
    engines, which will pose an important challenge for innovation researchers who
    are monitoring the rapid evolution of this market. In this business area more
    than the others, researchers will need to use various methods ranging from qualitative
    strategies (e.g. case studies and in-depth interviews) to empirical experimental
    designs (e.g. surveys, text mining, and data analytics). Qualitative approaches
    could allow researchers to explore the involvement of generative LLMs in the innovation
    process, uncovering contextual factors and human—AI dynamics that may be difficult
    to capture through quantitative approaches. In contrast, quantitative studies
    could offer a broader perspective on the impact of generative AI, enabling generalisation
    across various contexts and industries while overcoming biases from expert judgments
    often found in qualitative approaches. Education: Innovation management researchers
    will face the challenge of helping the educational sector adapt to generative
    AI, to mitigate the barriers to the adoption of these methods (Kaplan and Haenlein,
    2016). Research should elucidate the potential for digital divide issues and develop
    strategies to ensure that all learners can benefit from AI-driven educational
    innovations. The digital divide poses challenges to adoption and use of generative
    LLMs, particularly in developing countries with limited access to technology,
    infrastructure, and resources. Insufficient internet infrastructure, varying digital
    literacy levels, language barriers, and socioeconomic disparities are factors
    that can hinder widespread adoption. Investigating these challenges and factors
    could be valuable to bridge the digital divide and promote global digital inclusion,
    thereby ensuring that the benefits of generative LLMs are accessible and equitable.
    5.2. Innovation-phase challenges Idea generation: Innovation management researchers
    will need to learn to integrate AI-generated ideas into the ideation process effectively.
    This includes tackling challenges around managing the volume of ideas, ensuring
    their relevance, and integrating them into existing innovation processes (Verganti
    et al., 2020). To do so, they must address two main challenges. First, researchers
    must ensure that LLMs-generated ideas are free from cultural, social, and political
    biases—this requires a comprehensive analysis of training data and continuous
    model fine tuning. Second, to generate innovative ideas in various business areas,
    researchers must train and adapt generative LLMs to comprehend industry-specific
    language, concepts, and requirements, which may involve specialised training data
    and domain expertise. Increasing the ability in simulating the human creativity
    of machines can help researchers understand creativity phenomena. LLMs must be
    made explainable, and their decision, comprehensible (Guidotti et al., 2019).
    However, as stated in the Introduction, access to generative LLMs’ engine is limited
    to their website and API, owing to their black-box nature, which also hinders
    explainability. The billions of parameters of LLMs require significant computational
    power, posing challenges to scalability and efficiency. There are currently no
    reliable tools to audit deep learning systems. Screening/Idea selection: Determining
    the quality and relevance of LLMs-generated ideas in various business areas can
    be challenging. Generative AI systems are more useful to exploring the solution
    space than to selecting the best ideas (Bouschery et al., 2023). To understand
    how generative AI can be used also in the screening/idea selection, researchers
    must develop methods to quantify and evaluate the quality of ideas, considering
    factors such as feasibility, impact, and novelty. In this context, decision-making
    frameworks may emerge, which can help practitioners incorporate insights from
    AI. These, in turn, might require new methods of idea valuation and risk assessment
    tailored to AI-generated ideas. These frameworks will face the challenge of determining
    to balance human judgment and AI in idea selection. This involves understanding
    when to rely on AI and when human intervention is necessary. Development: Researchers
    need to ensure that LLMs-generated solutions can be seamlessly integrated in existing
    systems and workflows. To foster product development, companies will need to share
    good practices in collaboration with AI. Here, scholars and practitioners may
    meet the challenge of working with limited open databases of prompts. For example,
    access to ChatGPT''s proprietary prompts and responses is restricted by OpenAI''s
    terms of service. Although some websites are collecting this information, the
    data stored remain limited and unlikely to be made open to researchers. This limits
    research on generative LLMs and impedes the convergence on best practices for
    product development using generative AI. Lastly, as AI contributes more to product
    development, questions about IP rights emerge. Researchers will face the challenge
    of navigating IP issues related to AI-generated designs or solutions, potentially
    necessitating new approaches to IP. Diffusion/Market/Sales: Innovation management
    researchers will need to develop new methods for evaluating the market potential
    of AI-generated innovations, which may require new market analysis techniques
    and the theorisation of new business models. Generative LLMs can create platforms
    around which developers can create a shared value for customers (Trabucchi and
    Buganza, 2020). Researchers will also face the challenge of managing the adoption
    and diffusion of AI innovations, including understanding and overcoming barriers
    to adoption, developing strategies for effective market diffusion, and managing
    bundles of different technologies to solve real-world industrial problems (Cho
    et al., 2023). Finally, researchers interested in studying the diffusion of generative
    AI technologies may focus on different characteristics of companies adopting these
    solutions, such as firm size. As reported by Mariani et al. (2023), the literature
    on innovation has highlighted the importance of firm size in AI adoption, as it
    affects a company''s resources and abilities to pursue innovative activities,
    as has been emphasised by Chen and Hambrick (1995). 6. Conclusion and limitations
    This study has explored the evolving landscape of generative Large Language Models
    (LLMs), with a particular focus on ChatGPT, through the analysis of over 3.8 million
    tweets. Our data-driven approach, leveraging Named Entity Recognition (NER) and
    BERTopic algorithms, has provided a granular understanding of the tasks assigned
    to generative LLMs, highlighting their versatility across various business areas.
    Our findings indicate that ChatGPT, among other generative LLMs, is being utilized
    in a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from programming assistance to creative
    content generation. The identified emerging areas of application—human resources,
    programming, social media, office automation, search engines, and education—underscore
    the potential of LLMs to revolutionise business processes and services. Furthermore,
    this study contributes to the field of innovation management by proposing a research
    agenda focused on exploring the intersection of generative LLMs with the innovation
    process. Our proposed agenda outlines key research questions that span across
    the phases of idea generation, screening and selection, development, and diffusion
    and marketing. Our results can assist managers in understanding how to implement
    generative LMMs within their own innovation processes, taking into account the
    unique characteristics of each business area. Moreover, policymakers can benefit
    from our research agenda, which offer preliminary insights into tasks users request
    from generative AI. Understanding these tasks is vital for anticipating potential
    applications and shaping technology adoption. With this knowledge, policymakers
    can make informed decisions and design regulations supporting responsible AI development
    and deployment, thereby ensuring an alignment between AI-driven innovation and
    societal goals. The research agenda can also bridge the gap between academia and
    practice, generating actionable insights and evidence-based recommendations for
    real-world application. Our results should be read considering the limitations
    of our approach. Our method relied heavily on Twitter, which may have introduced
    potential biases and limited the representativeness of the sample. Twitter users
    may not fully capture the diversity of opinions of the broader population. Furthermore,
    the prominence of certain topics or trends on Twitter may not accurately reflect
    their importance in the wider context of the research question, since they may
    be influenced by trends and hype. To address this limitation in future work, researchers
    could consider incorporating data from other sources (e.g. scientific papers or
    alternative sources to Twitter, such as Reddit) to provide a more comprehensive
    view. Nonetheless, our study did not aim to establish an empirical setting suitable
    for addressing the dynamic landscape of generative models. Rather, our goal was
    to present a snapshot of the current situation, thereby assisting researchers
    in conducting quantitative and rigorous studies on an emerging technology that
    is currently discussed in qualitative terms. In particular, as newer models of
    generative LLMs emerge, new tasks may also be introduced. Although we collected
    31,747 tasks, we do not assume that we have saturated the realm of possibilities
    for generative systems. Future studies may demonstrate the expanse of such a realm
    in the context of innovation management as well as quantify the delta of the tasks
    performed by generative LLMs. Funding This work was partly funded by the ENCORE

    Flow Theory To Mobile Shopping Chapter © 2015 1 Introduction 1.1 Sales Force Automation
    (SFA) Sales force automation (SFA) promises great benefits to sales organizations
    by improving salesforce productivity and efficiency [1], as the cost-per-call
    and the number of sales calls needed to register sales transactions successfully
    have risen [2]. SFA enables organizations to automate sales activities and administrative
    responsibilities for higher productivity [3]. SFA can also help to enhance communication
    and provide faster access to accurate and relevant information to improve the
    quality of the sales effort [4]. Salespeople can reallocate their time from routine
    administrative activities to more critical and complex tasks [5]. Extending the
    sales technology to mobile applications is possible through smart gadgets like
    smartphones and customized SFA solutions [6]. The COVID-19 crisis has resulted
    in a “blackout” period for many sales organizations. They could not interact with
    retail customers or had to reduce their interactions due to mobility restrictions
    [7]. They had to turn to unfamiliar digital communication channels [7]. These
    prolonged business disruptions have made sales organizations rethink their resilience
    and competitive edge [2]. 1.2 SFA Adoption Challenges While SFA promises benefits
    to sales organizations, its deployment and use are time-consuming and costly,
    and its adoption among salespeople only sometimes translates into better sales
    performance [9]. Statistics also show that up to 75 percent of SFA projects fail
    to meet the expectations of organizations [10]. Managing organizational change
    and transformation is the biggest challenge, including poor project planning,
    a mismatch between technology and business needs, lack of support from senior
    management [11], the project’s cost exceeding the planned budget, and dissatisfaction
    of users [12]. Between 55 percent to 80 percent of organizations reported performance
    after introducing SFA as being worse off or having no improvement [13]. Large-scale
    SFA implementations commonly receive resistance and subsequent opposition from
    employees [17]. Researchers’ most common explanation for SFA failure is the lack
    of SFA adoption and acceptance by salespeople [14]. The low adoption rate is mainly
    caused by users’ unfamiliarity with the technology [15]. The factors cited impacting
    SFA adoption are the sales peoples’ organizational commitment, job satisfaction,
    person-organization fit, and person-job fit across organizations [16]. 1.3 Research
    Gap Literature review shows that most studies on SFA adoptions and implications
    are done through the framework and lens of the salespeople [5, 18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25].
    Some studies are centered around management and sales leaders’ commitment [26,27,28]
    but are limited from the viewpoint of customers and retailers (see Fig. 1). By
    extending mobile sales technology to retailers, organizations can rethink their
    sales force objectives, structure, and capabilities required to sharpen their
    competitive edge and improve salesforce productivity [31]. The first study on
    the benefits of SFA from a customer’s perspective was reported in 2009 [29]. In
    2020, another study investigated the antecedents of customers’ acceptance of a
    knowledge-based software application in the supply chain, focusing on how customers
    can use digital sales technologies for improved effectiveness and perceived value.
    Ease of use and system adaptability contribute strongly to customers’ perceived
    effectiveness and usefulness [30]. FMCG organizations are expanding SFA deployment
    beyond internal salespeople to retailers through mobile SFA. Retailers are expected
    to voluntarily take over a wide range of the salespeople’s daily tasks, including
    order management, reviewing sales history, retrieving product and promotion information,
    and making payments online. Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge regarding
    the customer or retailer’s perspective on adopting sales technology. The main
    research questions addressed in this study are as follows: 1. What is grocery
    retailers’ acceptance of mobile SFA technology? 2. What is the level of use of
    mobile SFA technology by grocery retailers? 3. Is there any variance in the acceptance
    and use of mobile SFA technology between urban and rural grocery retailers? Fig.
    1. Research on SFA use from different users’ perspectives. Full size image 2 Theoretical
    Foundation 2.1 Background Technology adoption and use by salespeople are strongly
    connected between technology investment and performance [33]. Low adoption of
    SFA among salespeople is always the leading cause of sales organizations not realizing
    the benefits of SFA investments [34], and resistance to using SFA is one of the
    major hurdles [8]. Generally, most salespeople consider themselves to have limited
    technology experience and create an inner fear of unfamiliar technology and low
    motivation to use SFA [36]. The varying research contexts based on technology,
    user type, location, adoption time, and task performed gave rise to many competing
    theories and models [37]. SFA implementation success was critically linked to
    use acceptance and motivation for SFA use [42]. The technology acceptance model
    (TAM) is a widely cited IT technology acceptance framework [39]. Venkatesh et
    al. integrated core elements from eight models and prominent theories to develop
    the UTAUT [40]. The UTAUT model emphasizes organizational users’ utilitarian value
    after eliminating common constructs to predict or explain new technology adoption,
    acceptance, and usage [37]. With the deep penetration of consumer technologies
    supported by the advent of the internet and smartphones in the 21st century, the
    UTAUT model was extended to the UTAUT2 model to include the hedonic value of technology
    users. The voluntariness of use was dropped as a moderator since consumers’ behavior
    is voluntary [41]. The model can explain 74 percent of the variance in consumers’
    behavioral intention and 52 percent in consumers’ technology usage [42]. IRT studies
    the resistance toward user innovations and behavior toward adopting and using
    any innovation [43]. It offers a theoretical framework to help understand users’
    resistance-oriented behavior [44]. Innovation resistance results from rational
    thinking and decision-making to maintain the status quo and resist deviating from
    the current belief system [43]. Consumer resistance plays a prominent role in
    determining the success of innovation implementations caused by user behavior
    [45]. It is important to examine the effects of flow experience on users and incorporate
    these findings in designing engaging user experiences in smart device mobile applications
    [46]. Flow experience is a psychological state of an individual sensation in reaction
    to environmental stimuli and is created when individuals concentrate effortlessly
    and experience enjoyment while completing a certain task [47]. Control, attention
    focus, and cognitive enjoyment are three important dimensions of flow that help
    digital developers create sites and games that are more responsive to users [37].
    2.2 Research Model The proposed research model (see Fig. 2) integrates UTAUT2
    and IRT models with modifications to validate and predict mobile SFA technology
    acceptance and use by grocery retailers. Grocery retailers’ mobile SFA adoption
    and use are voluntary, and the mobile SFA application is free. Hence, two modifications
    are made to the UTAUT2 model. Price-Value (PV) construct was removed, and retailers’
    education level was added as a moderate factor. The education level of grocery
    retailers is added as a moderate factor in the study. Riddell and Song found a
    causal relationship between education level and the probability of using computers
    on the job [49]. An additional year of schooling increases the probability of
    using a computer in the workplace by six percentage points and increases computer
    use time by 1.4 h per week. In Malaysia, nearly 20 percent of the population above
    25 received no or only up to six years of basic formal education [50]. The research
    framework also includes the flow experience of grocery retailers to help understand
    their level of control and engagement when using the mobile SFA. Fig. 2. Proposed
    research model. Full size image 3 Case Study Coca-Cola is one of the market leaders
    in the non-alcoholic beverages industry in more than 200 countries, with 700,000
    employees globally. In Malaysia, it commands nearly 20 percent of the total industry
    value [51], with 400 salespeople servicing all retail channels, including supermarkets,
    convenience stores, traditional grocery retailers, and food stores [52]. In 2015,
    Coca-Cola decided to digitalize its sales operation by introducing SFA technology
    to improve sales productivity and performance. It extended its SFA technology
    to grocery retailers through the mobile SFA application in 2021. Grocery retailers
    could self-administrate a wide range of traditional daily tasks of the salespeople,
    like re-viewing sales history, reviewing stock level status, and executing stock
    replenishment routines. The technology was deployed to 17,000 grocery retailers.
    Tracking shows that the usage rate was low at 30 percent despite multiple efforts
    to incentivize the retailers. Without a deep understanding of the level of acceptance
    and use of mobile SFA technology and why there is a lack of mobile SFA technology
    acceptance and use by these retailers, it is challenging for Coca-Cola to improve
    the results. 4 Research Methodology and Design A quantitative research method
    involved 400 grocery retailers using the mobile SFA of Coca-Cola through an online
    survey. The survey questionnaire was designed and obtained Human Research Ethics
    Approval. Through the mobile SFA app push mail system, an e-survey form and survey
    questionnaire were sent randomly to grocery retailers who use the Coca-Cola mobile
    SFA and reside in the targeted cities and sub-urban/rural locations. Partial least
    squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) regression will be used to test
    and validate the proposed model and the results will be analyzed as part of future
    work. 5 Intended Contribution This is the first application that combines UTAUT2
    and IRT to validate and predict mobile SFA technology acceptance and use by grocery
    retailers. The inclusion of the flow experience will help understand the level
    of control and engagement when using the mobile SFA. The research will also explore
    the variance in grocery retailers’ acceptance and use of mobile SFA technology
    in urban and sub-urban/rural areas. This allows customization deployment programs
    to improve mobile SFA deployment’s adoption and usage rates. The findings could
    impact other major developing countries in Asia like India, Vietnam, Philippines,
    and Indonesia. References Shoemaker, M.E.: A framework for examining IT-enabled

  description: Governments worldwide are taking actions to address the construction
    sector's sustainability concerns, including high carbon emissions, health and

    to construction (also referred to as Construction 4.0) could address some of these
    concerns. However, current understanding about this is quite limited, with previous

    actions to address the construction sector''s sustainability concerns, including
    high carbon emissions, health and safety risks, low productivity, and increasing
    costs. Applying Industry 4.0 technologies to construction (also referred to as
    Construction 4.0) could address some of these concerns. However, current understanding
    about this is quite limited, with previous work being largely fragmented and limited

    bottom line of sustainability perspectives. The focus of this article is therefore
    on addressing these gaps by proposing a comprehensive multi-dimensional Construction
    4.0 sustainability framework that identifies and categorizes the key Construction
    4.0 technologies and their positive and negative impacts on environmental, economic,
    and social sustainability, and then establishing its applicability/usefulness
    through an empirical, multimethodology case study assessment of the UAE''s construction
    sector. The findings indicate Construction 4.0’s positive impacts on environmental
    and economic sustainability that far outweigh its negative effects, although these
    impacts are comparable with regards to social sustainability. On Construction

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction With More than two-thirds of the world''s
    population expected to live in urban areas by 2050, the construction industry
    is expected to play a critical role in the economic development of most countries
    [8]. However, it has traditionally been low-tech with significant reliance on
    craft-based methods and is associated with poor performance and quality [26].
    Its productivity has remained nearly flat for the past several decades, and part
    of the reason has been its conservative approach to project design and delivery
    [61]. This slow pace of innovation matters because of the industry''s significant
    negative economic (e.g., low-profit margins, significant project delays, and budget
    overruns), environmental (e.g., high resource, energy, and water consumption and
    waste generation, accounts for 30% of the world''s greenhouse gas emissions as
    per [26]), and social (e.g., high worker deaths/injuries and poor working conditions)
    impacts [8], [17], [70], [79]. Industry 4.0 technologies (referred to as Construction
    4.0 for the construction sector) that are enabled by data, digital technologies,
    and automation have gained momentum in academic, managerial, and policy circles
    in recent times [13]. While they are seen as a solution to address the sector''s
    sustainability-related challenges (e.g., reducing material usage and waste with
    3-D printing of buildings), there are also significant concerns about their adverse
    effects, such as increased energy requirements and job losses [19]. However, unfortunately,
    the previous literature is unable to provide much clarity on the relationship
    between Construction 4.0 and sustainability. For instance, a recent literature-review-based
    study on Industry 4.0 and sustainability by Beltrami et al. [13] did not find
    any studies on construction. Similarly, other studies that have discussed sustainability
    in relation to Construction 4.0 (e.g., [17], [18], [67]) have largely focused
    on social sustainability rather than taking a triple bottom line (TBL) perspective,
    in which economic, environmental, and social elements are considered together.
    A TBL perspective is important as the different sustainability impacts from Construction
    4.0 technologies could conflict with each other. For example, blockchain could
    improve operational efficiency and reduce costs (greater economic sustainability)
    but also increase the energy requirement that is needed to power the associated
    algorithms (lower environmental sustainability) [31]. Another weakness of these
    studies is that most of them are also desk discourse analysis based [19], [31]
    or secondary review based [4], [42]; first-hand empirical insights are sadly missing.
    Finally, even without the sustainability aspect, knowledge of Construction 4.0
    technologies itself is quite limited; most studies have narrowly focused on one
    or a few technologies (e.g., Ibrahim et al. [42] on building information modeling
    (BIM) and Reinhardt et al. [61] and Moon et al. [54] on robotic technology), although
    there have been some recent attempts at a more comprehensive approach (e.g., [58],
    [80]; and Forceal et al., 2020). Overall, this means that there are significant
    knowledge gaps that could hamper Construction 4.0’s large-scale acceptability
    and implementation both technologywise as well as vis-à-vis its sustainability
    impacts. These gaps suggest the need for a comprehensive enabling framework that,
    in turn, can facilitate an associated empirical investigation. The specific research
    objectives of this study are, therefore, as follows. To identify and integrate
    various isolated Construction 4.0 technologies into meaningful and managerially
    relevant categories. To develop a “Construction 4.0 Sustainability Framework”
    that conceptualizes the interconnectedness between the various Construction 4.0
    technologies and the economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions.
    To test the applicability and usefulness of the framework in a real-world setting.
    While meeting the above objectives, the study seeks to answer the following research
    questions. What is the current and future state of Construction 4.0 technologies,
    and how are they disrupting the sector? What are the positive and negative implications
    of these Construction 4.0 technologies for the sector''s environmental, economic,
    and social sustainability? This required, first, a systematic review of the (scattered)
    Construction 4.0 studies to develop the framework, followed by testing the framework''s
    applicability and usefulness through an empirical, multimethodology case study.
    The United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s construction sector was used as the research
    setting because the construction intensity there is high, and the country is also
    associated with some of the most innovative buildings and projects globally [8].
    The UAE is also strongly committed to realizing high economic, social, and environmental
    sustainability outcomes (Vision 2021, 2019). It is also at the forefront of using
    innovative technologies in the construction sector (Dulaimi, 2021). UAE''s construction
    sector, therefore, provides an appropriate setting to assess opportunities and
    challenges associated with Construction 4.0 and sustainability. The article makes
    a significant contribution. It is the first comprehensive empirical investigation
    to link Construction 4.0 with economic, environmental, and social sustainability
    dimensions. The article framework and the case study findings, therefore, are
    both novel and significant. Although UAE''s construction sector is used as the
    case context, the fact that other advanced countries’ construction sectors are
    similar means that insights from this article can be applied elsewhere. This also
    includes the framework, the conceptual comprehensiveness of which enables it to
    be suitably adapted and applied to other country and sectoral contexts. The rest
    of this article is organized as follows. In Section II, we outline the research
    framework used. In Section III, the literature review leading to the Construction
    4.0 sustainability framework development is discussed. The research setting and
    the case study method used to evaluate the framework''s applicability are detailed
    in Section IV. The case study findings are discussed in Section V. We conclude
    in Section VI with the study implications, limitations, and suggestions for future
    work. SECTION II. Research Framework The research framework adopted in this study
    is given in Fig. 1 below, which can be seen to have two main stages: 1) The literature
    review stage of developing the “Construction 4.0 Sustainability Framework,” and
    2) the case study of UAE''s construction sector stage to test the framework''s
    applicability and usefulness. These are discussed in detail in the following sections.
    Fig. 1. Research Framework. Show All SECTION III. Literature Review and Framework
    Development The literature review involved a systematic review of Industry 4.0
    studies in the construction sector or Construction 4.0 followed by a generic review
    of studies that explored the link between Industry 4.0 and sustainability. A.
    Systematic Literature Review of Construction 4.0 The objective of the systematic
    review was twofold. The first objective was to identify and integrate the various
    isolated Construction 4.0 technologies disrupting the sector. The second objective
    was to synthesize the positive and negative impacts of Construction 4.0 technologies
    on the environmental, economic, and social sustainability dimensions. The systematic
    review was undertaken using the Scopus database because of its broad coverage
    of journals. The keywords used to identify the initial list included “industry
    4.0” and “construction” or “Construction 4.0” or “industry 4.0” and “building.”
    In order to ensure rigor and quality, conference proceedings, working papers,
    and book chapters were excluded. The initial search identified over 1000 studies.
    After removing duplicates and limiting the studies to only articles from peer-reviewed
    academic journals, the list was narrowed to 387 articles. The articles were then
    screened on the basis of their title and abstract, and only those with a primary
    focus on construction and Industry 4.0 were shortlisted. A brief content (full-text)
    review of these articles was carried out to exclude studies that are too technical,
    such as those on modeling, simulation, Industry 4.0 architecture, and algorithms
    (e.g., [69]). Also, articles published in leading construction journals, such
    as the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management and the International
    Journal of Construction Management, were checked to ensure there are no important
    omissions. Finally, references cited in the shortlisted studies were also reviewed
    to identify additional articles, leaving 29 studies on Construction 4.0 for detailed
    analysis. Fig. 2 summarizes the systematic review process followed. Fig. 2. Systematic
    review of Construction 4.0. Show All Our syntheses of the shortlisted studies
    (see Table I) revealed several gaps. First and foremost, most of these studies
    are narrow in scope, focusing on one or just a few specific technologies; for
    example, Sacks et al. [63] have focused on Digital Twins, while Ahmed [3] has
    focused on augmented and virtual reality technologies. Next, studies have made
    little effort to explicitly link Construction 4.0 with the various dimensions
    of sustainability. Most studies have explored or discussed Construction 4.0 and
    sustainability aspects as an auxiliary concern rather than the main topic. Also,
    these studies have mostly covered only some aspects of Industry 4.0 and sustainability
    (as well as failing to cover all of their interrelated dynamics). As evident from
    Table I, very few studies have simultaneously discussed the Construction 4.0 impact
    on all three dimensions of sustainability. In many cases, the primary focus is
    on the social sustainability dimension, so a balanced perspective based on the
    TBL concept is missing. Further, most studies are either descriptive or conceptual
    and are based on secondary data or literature review. Empirical investigation
    to gain first-hand insights into different aspects of Construction 4.0 via interviews
    and/or case studies and/or surveys appears to be limited. Overall, although despite
    these gaps, the synthesis of the studies in Table I provided the conceptual base
    for the development of the Construction 4.0 sustainability framework; it enabled
    us to understand the key Construction 4.0 technologies disrupting the sector and
    their implications for the TBL sustainability dimensions. TABLE I Summary of Studies
    on Construction 4.0 B. Review of Generic Studies on Industry 4.0 and Sustainability
    Despite their differences, the construction sector could still benefit from “borrowing”
    innovative ideas and technologies from other sectors, provided they are carefully
    assessed and contextualized [8], [9]. The objective of this generic review was
    threefold. First, the review sought to ensure that there are no important omissions
    of technologies relevant to construction within the larger body of Industry 4.0
    literature, especially those from high application sectors such as manufacturing.
    Second, the review sought to critically examine the studies that have explicitly
    examined the link between Industry 4.0 and the TBL of sustainability (e.g., [13]),
    including from both the problems and the opportunities perspectives. Finally,
    the review was undertaken to gain insights into the thematic classification of
    Construction 4.0 technologies into meaningful and managerially relevant categories.
    Table II summarizes the key studies on Industry 4.0 and Sustainability identified
    from the generic literature. TABLE II Generic Review of Studies Examining Industry
    4.0 and Sustainability The following insights were gained from the literature
    review. With the exception of a few new but related technologies such as hologram
    and cloud manufacturing, the key technologies identified in Table I (Construction
    4.0) and Table II (Industry 4.0) are similar. This assured that we have not missed
    out on any key Industry 4.0 technologies relevant to construction. However, unlike
    Construction 4.0 literature, the generic literature is more mature in examining
    the direct relationship between Industry 4.0 and TBL of sustainability. Studies
    have examined the direct impact of Industry 4.0 on different stages of the product/project
    life-cycle, starting from sustainable design, procurement, manufacturing/remanufacturing,
    operations and maintenance, and end of life management [7], [13], [34], [38].
    Some studies have even explored the relevance of Industry 4.0 for broader sustainability
    goals, such as green/sustainable supply chain management, closed-loop supply chain,
    and circular economy [6], [13], [34], [38]. Also, several studies in the generic
    literature have started examining the positive and negative implications of Industry
    4.0 on TBL of sustainability (e.g., [13], [34], [38]). Further, studies in the
    generic literature provided the conceptual base for the thematic classification
    of Industry 4.0 technologies into managerially relevant categories such as digitalization
    (Beltrami et al., 2020; [34]), automation [7], [13], [34], advanced manufacturing
    [39], integration and collaboration [13], [39], [44], and intelligent environment
    [7], [13], [44]. Finally, a few studies have proposed generic frameworks to conceptualize
    the various relationships between Industry 4.0 and Sustainability. For instance,
    Beltrami et al. [13] proposed a framework for researchers and practitioners to
    examine the direct impact of Industry 4.0 on TBL of sustainability and mediated
    impact through practices such as sustainable design, procurement, and manufacturing.
    Similarly, Ejsmont et al. [34] proposed a Sustainable Industry 4.0 reference framework
    to conceptualize the impact of Industry 4.0 on sustainability practices such as
    sustainable manufacturing, TBL of sustainability, circular economy, and sustainable
    supply chains. Bag et al. [7] proposed a research framework linking Industry 4.0
    and remanufacturing and green manufacturing capabilities mediated through instrumented,
    interconnected, and intelligent logistics. Kamble et al. [44] proposed a framework
    interconnecting Industry 4.0 and TBL of sustainability outcomes mediated through
    process integration (human–machine collaboration and equipment integration). However,
    except for Bag et al. [7], none of these frameworks are empirically tested and
    validated. Although these generic frameworks are by no means comprehensive, they
    provided a good theoretical background on the meaningful relationships that need
    to be assessed for our proposed Construction 4.0 sustainability framework. According
    to Carter and Easton (2011), combining existing frameworks into a comprehensive
    framework allows investigation of multiple theoretical perspectives simultaneously
    and helps to define the field''s boundaries more rigorously. C. Development of
    the Construction 4.0 Sustainability Framework The systematic review of Construction
    4.0 combined with the generic review provided the insights necessary for developing
    the Construction 4.0 sustainability framework. 1) Components of the Framework
    The central task of developing any technology framework is carefully identifying
    the key technologies for inclusion [56], [79]. As seen in Table I, the systematic
    review enabled us to understand the key Construction 4.0 technologies disrupting
    the sector. In the next stage, through careful syntheses of studies in Tables
    I and II, we have grouped these Construction 4.0 technologies into four dimensions:
    digitalization, automation and advancement manufacturing, integration and collaboration,
    and intelligent environment. This simplified conceptualization of Construction
    4.0 is critical for the progress of the field, given that the scientific contours
    of Construction 4.0 are not clearly defined. These dimensions are discussed as
    follows. a) Digitalization Digitalization, or converting the physical ecosystem
    to a digital ecosystem and then managing it virtually, is the foundation of Construction
    4.0 [50]. The aim is to digitize and centrally store the information captured
    through the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and other devices across the different life
    cycle phases of construction, starting from the project inception to the end of
    life, including the commissioning, operation, and maintenance phases to facilitate
    real-time monitoring and to undertake advance analytics to identify patterns for
    improvement. Smart digital technologies such as the IoT, big data analytics, cloud
    computing, virtual and augmented reality, blockchain, and 3-D laser scanning and
    photogrammetry enable a new phase of digitalization of the sector. Also, construction
    digitization was adjudged as a catalyst that would facilitate the holistic application
    of other technologies such as BIM, artificial intelligence, machine learning [47],
    and holography. b) Automation and advanced manufacturing It was evident from the
    literature review that construction process automation is mainly driven by or
    facilitated by advancement in robotics, 3-D printing, autonomous vehicles and
    machinery, prefabrication and modularization, and blockchain technology [4], [28].
    For instance, drones can be deployed for remote inspection and for taking aerial
    photographs to obtain information from the site, thus monitoring construction
    progress [56]. Similarly, advanced manufacturing such as additive and 3-D printing
    enables the manufacturing of buildings layer-by-layer by an automated machine
    based on digital 3-D models [4]. Further, construction has the potential to benefit
    from cloud manufacturing, a networked manufacturing mode that utilizes online
    manufacturing resources to provide a spectrum of on-demand manufacturing services
    according to users’ needs (Singh et al., 2021). c) Integration and collaboration
    Identification of Construction 4.0 technologies that integrate different technologies
    and facilitate collaboration among stakeholders is essential. Lack of early engagement
    and collaboration of various stakeholders is identified as a key challenge facing
    the construction sector [8], [9], and integration of different technologies can
    provide unique benefits that are not available with the use of individual technologies
    on a standalone basis [79]. BIM is a collaborative working methodology involving
    key stakeholders (developers, designers, contractors/subcontractors, and suppliers)
    to design, construct, and operate construction projects [56]. BIM provides all
    stakeholders with a digital representation of a building''s characteristics throughout
    its life cycle. Similarly, BIM-Cloud is an integrated technology that allows project
    teams to work together in different locations to monitor and control the project
    progress in real-time [42]. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are mechanisms that establish
    bidirectional integration between physical and virtual components. Similarly,
    blockchain is an “immutable distributed ledger” that records all validated discrete
    and encrypted digital data events and transactions that are executed or shared
    among participants in a network, thereby increasing greater accountability, transparency,
    trust, and collaboration among stakeholders. The integration of blockchain and
    BIM ensures change tracking and data ownership [17], [18]. Similarly, digital
    twins provide a realistic digital representation of assets, processes, or systems
    that integrates the physical and virtual worlds. It has three main elements: a
    physical artifact, a digital counterpart, and the connection that binds the two
    together. The connection is the exchange of data, information, and knowledge between
    the physical and virtual counterparts [63]. Finally, advanced geographical information
    systems (GIS) provide real-time information to automatically track and localize
    material throughout the construction supply chain, thereby improving material
    and information flow [27]. d) Intelligent environment Construction 4.0 technologies
    have the potential to take the sector to an intelligent construction era. Advances
    in machine learning and artificial intelligence enable the sector to track, monitor,
    and respond to situations like humans do and learn from each other''s experiences.
    Further, an intelligent environment can be created by combining various Construction
    4.0 technologies. A smart construction site combines various technologies such
    as drones, IoTs, automated machines that are able to function with little or no
    human intervention and act according to the environment. For instance, a robot
    on a construction site should be able to stop construction activities itself after
    recognizing that the weather is about to change [60]. Machine learning enables
    systems to evolve as if they were learning [79]. Advanced simulation techniques
    utilize real-time data to simulate the execution of the remaining tasks based
    on the current working status [79]. Similarly, the discrete event simulation (DES)
    method could be used to verify project feasibility, progress, potential conflicts,
    productivity dynamics, and resource utilization, while alternative changes to
    construction planning can be evaluated with agent-based simulations [79]. Finally,
    cyber-security is critical for countering cyberattacks and systemic breaches,
    such as data thefts in construction projects that use digital infrastructure and
    intelligent environments [50]. e) Relationship between Construction 4.0 and environmental,
    social, and economic sustainability The final component of the framework is to
    examine the impact of Construction 4.0 on TBL of sustainability. While the common
    expectation is that Construction 4.0 supports the broader sustainable development
    goals, the technology could potentially exacerbate some of the issues facing the
    sector. Our generic review (see Table II) shows that Industry 4.0 has both positive
    and negative impacts on all three dimensions of sustainability. The limited evidence
    from Table I also supports that Construction 4.0 has both positive and negative
    impacts on sustainability. For example, 3-D printing could significantly reduce
    material usage and onsite waste. On the other hand, machine learning and artificial
    intelligence algorithms consume significant energy, negatively impacting the environment
    [31]. 2) Proposed Sustainability Framework for Construction 4.0 Fig. 3 shows the
    proposed Construction 4.0 sustainability framework. Central to the framework are
    the various interconnected Construction 4.0 technologies. These technologies are
    categorized into four meaningful and managerially relevant dimensions. Finally,
    the framework captures the multifaceted impact of Construction 4.0 on environmental,
    social, and environmental sustainability dimensions. We expect practitioners and
    policymakers to find this framework a valuable tool for assessing their current
    and future readiness of the sector in Construction 4.0. Fig. 3. Systematic review
    of Construction 4.0. Show All SECTION IV. Application of the Framework in the
    Construction Sector A. Research Setting Having developed the Construction 4.0
    sustainability framework, the next stage was to test its applicability in a real-world
    setting. While it could be tested anywhere, choosing a setting where the construction
    intensity is high but at the same time making significant efforts toward TBL of
    sustainability and implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies could be more practically
    relevant. The UAE was carefully chosen as the case country for the investigation
    due to the following reasons. The UAE construction sector has experienced an unprecedented
    construction boom, growing at more than 9% per annum in the last few decades [8].
    Some of the largest construction projects in the world, including the tallest
    structure (Burj Khalifa), the tallest hotel (JW Marriott Marquis), and the largest
    mall (Dubai Mall), have taken place there recently [9]. Unfortunately, this unprecedented
    growth has placed a substantial environmental burden on the country (around 75%
    of all the solid waste generated in UAE is from construction, including carbon
    emissions), and is the main contributor to UAE''s status as one of the most polluting
    countries in the world in terms of carbon emissions. From a social standpoint,
    the UAE construction sector accounted for the highest number of employed persons,
    especially blue-collar workers in the UAE, at around 1.64 million [68] and constituted
    33.9% of the total private-sector workforce [73]. From an economic standpoint,
    construction is a critical sector for the country''s diversification from an oil-based
    economy. Of the non-oil-based sectors, construction is one of the top contributors,
    with a contribution of 8.5% to UAE''s overall GDP. Therefore, the construction
    sector needs to keep pace with the UAE''s ambition to foster an ecosystem of modern,
    productive, and technology-driven construction. The UAE is among the few countries
    globally to have adopted a national strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution
    [72]. The UAE aims to become a global hub and the world''s first open lab for
    experimenting and adopting the Fourth Industrial Revolution''s technologies. The
    UAE''s strategic vision defines a path to establish the country as the most competitive
    nation in the world by its 100th birthday [71]. Also, UAE has taken several sustainability
    initiatives to become one of the most sustainable countries. Sustainable development
    is at the heart of the UAE''s vision and the country is fully committed to its
    2030 national agenda toward achieving the United Nations sustainable development
    goals [57]. Thus, the UAE provides an ideal setting to assess opportunities and
    challenges associated with Industry 4.0 in the construction sector in achieving
    environmental, economic, and social sustainability. B. Case Study Methodology
    The case study methodology was deemed to be the most appropriate for examining
    a contemporary topic in a real-world situation [78]. Although the study adopted
    was a single case design (UAE construction sector), it featured an embedded case
    design with multiple units of analysis [78]. In terms of methods, a pragmatic,
    sequential multimethodology approach combining both quantitative and qualitative
    methods and utilizing both primary and secondary data was adopted for the case
    study. This enabled the authors to develop a comprehensive understanding of various
    strands of the framework and, in the process, answer the research questions. The
    use of a pragmatic approach was justified, given that practical realistic solutions
    are needed to inform practice, especially considering the newness of the topic.
    The primary research was conducted using both interviews and surveys. 1) Interviews
    The interviews (in line with our research questions) aimed to understand the respondents''
    experience and perception of Industry 4.0 technologies, their opportunities and
    challenges, and their positive and negative impact on the UAE construction sector''s
    social, environmental, and economic sustainability aspects. A semistructured interview
    approach was preferred because the scope of the interviews revolved around these
    themes. The detailed interview protocol used in this study is given in Appendix
    1. Purposive sampling, a nonprobability sampling technique, was used to recruit
    the participants [46]. This is because to get quality and in-depth information
    on the research questions, it was not possible to recruit any construction industry
    professional at random for interviewing; instead, it was necessary to ensure the
    designation and experience of the interviewees were relevant to the questions
    that were posed. Also, purposive sampling ensured that interview participants
    represented cross sections of the construction sector stakeholders (i.e., developers,
    architects/consultants, contractors/subcontractors, and material suppliers), as
    well as academics and government officials. In terms of the strategy used to recruit
    participants, more than 50 potential participants who met the qualifying criteria
    were contacted by e-mail with a brief description of the intended study. A total
    of 12 semistructured interviews were conducted with senior professionals (who
    expressed their willingness to be interviewed), most of whom had more than 10–15
    years of experience in the construction sector. The sample size falls within the
    recommended minimum 5–25 sample size for semistructured interviews [64]. Previous
    studies have shown that semistructured interviews with a minimum of 8–12 participants
    can provide meaningful insights and sufficient generalizability [29]. The depth
    of knowledge and experience of interviewees ensured quality answers were received
    to the questions posed, safeguarding the reliability of the data [15]. The purposive
    cross-section sampling ensured the participants were representative of the constructive
    sector [64]. The demographic profile of the interviewees is provided in Table
    III. Due to COVID-19 constraints, most of the interviews were conducted virtually.
    Each interview lasted approximately 45–60 min, with a focus on “how,” “what,”
    and “why.” Most were digitally recorded, and where this was not possible, detailed
    notes were taken and cross checked with the respondents for accuracy. Thematic
    analysis (guided by the framework) was used to analyze the interview data. Information
    related to the Industry 4.0 technologies was categorized under the four categories:
    digitalization, automation and advancement manufacturing, integration and collaboration,
    and intelligent environment. Codes were assigned to an individual Industry 4.0
    technology within these subcategories. For example, big data was assigned a specific
    code within category 1 (Digitalization). Similarly, the social, environmental,
    and economic sustainability implications of Industry 4.0 were coded and categorized
    under six categories: positive environmental; negative environmental; positive
    social; negative social; positive economic; and negative economic implications.
    Further, to improve the reliability of data analysis, the coding was conducted
    independently by two authors. TABLE III Key Informants for Interviews 2) Survey
    In the next stage, a short survey was conducted to assess the current and future
    state (in the next five years) of the adoption of Construction 4.0 in the UAE
    construction sector. Only key Construction 4.0 technologies identified during
    the interviews were included in the survey. Emergent Construction 4.0 technologies
    in which the interviewees showed limited knowledge and awareness (e.g., holography,
    cloud-manufacturing, digital twins) were excluded from the survey. A sample question
    to capture the present state of adoption of Construction 4.0 technologies is “Please
    rate the extent of adoption of ‘blockchain’ in the UAE construction sector.” Regarding
    the survey scale to capture the present state, a Likert scale (1–5) ranging from
    “not considered at all (1)” to “highly considered (5)” was used. Similarly, a
    sample question to capture the future state of adoption of Construction 4.0 technologies
    is “Please rate the extent to which ‘blockchain’ will be adopted over the next
    five years.” The corresponding Likert scale (1–5) ranged from “not at all (1)”
    to “very high extent (5).” The survey instrument used is provided in Appendix
    2. The survey was administrated via Qualtrics, a leading online survey platform,
    for a period of two months (January–February 2021). In terms of sampling, a random
    sampling approach was used in which the survey was sent to a random sample of
    1000 respondents from a database of 3000+ industry professionals (Zawya database,
    which we paid to access, and one of the authors’ personal LinkedIn contacts of
    construction sector professionals). Overall, a total of 121 useable responses
    were obtained, an effective response rate of 12.1%. 3) Secondary Data In the next
    phase, secondary data from reliable sources relevant to Industry 4.0 adoption
    in the UAE construction sector and elsewhere were assembled, coded, and analyzed
    to complement the primary research findings. To ensure reliability and rigor in
    the secondary data, we considered only reports from leading consulting firms,
    governments, and global organizations. SECTION V. Findings and Discussions The
    findings are organized and discussed in line with the research questions (RQ)
    stated initially. RQ 1: What is the current and future state of Construction 4.0
    technologies, and how are they disrupting the sector? RQ 2: What are the positive
    and negative implications of these Construction 4.0 technologies for the sector''s
    environmental, economic, and social sustainability? A. Current and Future Prospects
    of Construction 4.0 in the UAE In this section, the survey and interview findings
    are discussed in relation to the current and future prospects of Industry 4.0
    in the UAE construction sector. Table IV summarizes the survey findings. A paired
    t-test was used to check for statistical differences in the current and future
    state of Construction 4.0 technologies. As seen in the table, the results show
    that there is a significant difference (p<0.001) across all technologies, with
    survey respondents perceiving that these technologies will be widely adopted in
    the future (in the next five years). TABLE IV Current and Future State of Industry
    4.0 in Construction 1) Digitalization As seen in Table IV, the current state of
    digitalization in the UAE construction sector is 3.24 out of 5.00. However, in
    the next five years, respondents believe this will significantly increase to 4.21.
    Most interviewees said they expect an acceleration in the digitalization drive,
    largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the sector
    to find safer and smarter ways to build. In the words of one interviewee: “Construction
    4.0 technologies have allowed us to continue working in a virtual and digital
    environment despite being unable to meet in person.” At the individual level,
    IoT emerged as the most implemented technology, with a mean score of 3.64, and
    is also the technology that is forecasted to be the most implemented in the future
    (4.59). This is in line with the findings of Forcael et al. [37], who found IoT
    to be the most discussed Construction 4.0 technology. The promising outlook was
    reflected during the interviews. According to the interviewees, most contracting
    firms are using RFID tags to have real-time visibility of their materials and
    equipment. A few of the respondents (from the main contractor) mentioned that
    they continuously track their materials and equipment from warehouse to construction
    site. This allows them to efficiently plan their deliveries to the site, as well
    as to share equipment and machinery across multiple project sites and to reduce
    mishandling and theft. This echoes the findings in the literature that highlighted
    the application of RFID tags to automatically identify, geolocate, and track materials
    and machinery for their control at construction sites [56]. In addition, a respondent
    from the main contractor highlighted the onsite use of smart sensors to continuously
    monitor dust, noise, vibration level (such as during piling), motion detection
    to capture unauthorized access to project sites, hazardous fumes, among other
    technologies. The system will send automated notifications (as e-mail and SMS)
    if the values are greater than the threshold levels. Previous studies have reported
    the use of sensors in construction to monitor the structural health of buildings
    and infrastructures, to check the correct operation of machinery, workers, equipment,
    systems, thermal comfort, among other applications [4], [56]. In addition, interviewees
    highlighted the growing importance of smart wearables for construction workers
    to enhance worker safety, with uses including monitoring their vital signs and
    detecting if workers are tired or overworked. In the words of the respondent:
    “Some of the technologies such as smartwatches are already there and not very
    expensive, and we can roll them out fast.” Recent studies in construction have
    also reported the use of wearables devices with sensors, cameras, and mobile locators
    to collect the real-time status of workers on site [56], [79]. Virtual and augmented
    reality emerged as the second-most implemented technology (3.50) at present and
    in the future as well (4.52). Providing an immersive virtual experience of the
    construction project for stakeholders and clients is fast becoming the norm in
    the construction sector. Similarly, respondents (from contracting/subcontracting
    firms) highlighted that the COVID-19 social distancing constraints mean fewer
    employees at construction sites. This has forced them to use augmented reality
    to solve onsite issues remotely by experts without being physically present. This
    is facilitated by the smart camera attached to the helmet of the onsite workers.
    Most respondents also highlighted the increase in the use of virtual and augmented
    reality solutions for training programs, project reviews, and planning meetings.
    Previous studies have reported the use of virtual and augmented reality in architectural
    design, maintenance and repair work at construction sites, quality and defect
    management, employee training, and safety management [3], [37]. Big data analytics
    emerged as the third most implemented technology in this category (3.39). The
    future prospects of big data analytics also look promising, with a mean score
    of 4.23. One of the interviewees (a project manager) mentioned that they are looking
    to hire a data scientist (for the first time) to join their project team, echoing
    the growing importance of data analytics in the construction sector. However,
    a few of the interviewees admitted that they are not fully utilizing the data,
    especially those captured by their IoT networks, and would like to see more advanced
    predictive and prescriptive analytics in the future. This lack of data utilization
    is a concern, given that big data analytics can identify valuable patterns, trends,
    or correlations for the optimization of the processes of design, construction,
    and building maintenance ([56]). Blockchain emerged as the fourth most implemented
    technology in the category (3.12). However, among other technologies in this category,
    blockchain is expected to get the biggest push in the future (4.32). This is echoed
    in the interviews. According to respondents, this is because of the UAE government''s
    support of blockchain technology, particularly its Blockchain Strategy 2021 [74].
    Many public sector entities in the UAE are already adopting blockchain solutions
    [77]. Some of the interviewees from the government entity highlighted the use
    of blockchain by the land department to record all sales and lease transactions
    in the secure blockchain ledger, thereby enhancing transparency, as these transactions
    are immutable. This is important given the delay, ambiguity, and legal concerns
    related to the construction contacts. It also supports the Dubai government''s
    “Paperless Strategy,” which aims to build an integrated paper-free government
    framework by the year 2021 and, in the process, eliminate more than a billion
    pieces of paper used for government transactions [10]. Previous studies have also
    advocated using blockchain in construction to improve safety and efficiency by
    providing automatic verification of design codes and regulations, security and
    greater ease in tracking change control and permit management, and developing
    smart contracts [56]. The integration of blockchain and BIM ensures change tracking
    and data ownership. It could make construction industry contracts more trustful
    and less prone to claims or change orders [17]. Surprisingly, cloud computing
    emerged as the second-least implemented technology (2.96) in this category and
    the least likely technology to be implemented in the future (3.71). It was evident
    from the interviews that construction firms in the UAE have started using the
    cloud for data storage and sharing across different stakeholders. This is because
    of the scalability of the cloud to store heavy file sizes of high-resolution images,
    3-D simulation models, animations, etc. The central management of files in the
    cloud environment allows better manageability and real-time anywhere access. Further,
    the use of cloud systems reduces infrastructure complexity and also reduces cost.
    However, respondents were either not aware or had a limited understanding of distributed
    computing, sharing of information technology capabilities, or delivering applications
    as a service. The fact that cloud computing means different things to different
    people may explain the relatively lower score in the survey. Low adoption of cloud
    computing is a concern, given that it can reduce the total cost of ownership of
    construction projects via services modes such as infrastructure-as-a-service,
    which provides users with virtual computers and servers; platform-as-a-service,
    which provides users with services such as operating systems, databases, and programming
    languages; and software-as-a-service, which allows users to access their applications
    through the Internet [79]. Although 3-D laser scanning and photogrammetry emerged
    as the least implemented technology in this category (2.80), respondents indicated
    that it is likely to get a significant push in the future (3.86). This is echoed
    in the interviews. Most respondents agreed on the potential of this technology.
    A few interviewees highlighted that they have already started using laser scanning
    in their projects to develop 3-D models to determine project progress and compare
    against the original 3-D design. According to them, the use of laser scanning
    and photogrammetry, techniques to obtain geometric properties of objects and their
    spatial locations, is likely to increase due to COVID-19, as it will reduce the
    number of onsite workers and project managers. This is because laser scanning
    and photogrammetry enable remote inspection and monitoring [56]. Other laser scanning
    applications evident from the literature include real-time feedback for quality
    control [63]. For instance, laser scanning can be used to precisely position construction
    materials as they are placed using a crane, which eliminates costly rework and
    variations. 2) Automation and Advancement Manufacturing The present state of automation
    and advanced manufacturing in the UAE construction sector is 3.33 out of 5.00
    and has the highest score across the four categories. Moreover, this is expected
    to increase to 4.33 in the next five years. At the individual technology level,
    automation using robotics (offsite) emerged as the most implemented technology
    with a mean score of 3.92 and is also the technology that respondents predict
    will be the most implemented in the future as well (4.66). This is not surprising,
    given the significant advancement in robotics in the manufacturing sector. This
    is echoed in the interviews with respondents from steel and aluminum manufacturing
    firms. According to them, 80%–90% of the manufacturing process is automated. The
    other respondents underlined the significant (recent) increase in the modular
    design in the UAE construction sector as the reason for the rise in the offsite
    prefabrication of components using robotic technology, as it offers faster production,
    lower cost, and more efficient assembly of elements compared to in situ construction.
    Previous studies have also advocated using off-site construction as it only requires
    assembly and installation on-site and hence optimizes time, logistics, and quality
    of finishes. Moreover, it facilitates manufacturing in a controlled environment
    using rigorous quality-control principles, eliminating exposure to uncertain weather
    conditions at the building construction site [56]. According to one of the interviewees
    (a developer), it is cheaper to use prefabrication in housing development projects
    involving identical houses or villas. Most components, including ceilings, walls,
    and balcony and bathroom pods, can be prefabricated offsite using automation.
    For example, DuBox, a Dubai-based modular construction company, designs and delivers
    single- or multistory concrete buildings using modular methodologies. It shifts
    85% of the construction activities offsite and is the first company in the Middle
    East and North Africa to apply offsite modular manufacturing methods to concrete
    construction projects (DuBox, 2020). However, two respondents (one architect and
    one consultant) cautioned that the growing need for construction projects to be
    unique (different from others) would become a roadblock for modular construction
    and offsite prefabrication. Also, respondents were relatively unaware of the cloud
    manufacturing possibilities for the construction sector. Onsite use of automation
    emerged as the second-most implemented technology (3.74) and in the future as
    well (4.66). According to respondents, most construction sites use some degree
    of automation. According to some interviewees (main contractors), they use onsite
    robotic technology for plastering and panel installation. The use of automation
    has significantly reduced manual waste and reworks from errors, along with effecting
    a reduction in project completion time. One respondent (a developer) mentioned
    their use of automated robots for cleaning windows of high-rise buildings compared
    to manual window washers using ropes. This significantly increases construction
    worker safety. This echoes the growing calls in the literature to use robotics
    and automation to reduce the number of lives lost due to fatal accidents at construction
    sites [70]. However, respondents did acknowledge that it may not be feasible for
    small-scale developers and individual building owners, as robotics are pricey
    to procure and require costly maintenance. Drones emerged as the third most implemented
    technology in the category (3.56) and are also expected to get a significant push
    in the future (4.65). It is also the third most implemented technology across
    all categories. The interviewees also revealed the growing significance of drones
    in the UAE construction sector. According to them, drones significantly reduce
    the time and effort required in the onsite monitoring and physical supervision
    of construction projects and reporting procedures. Drones fitted with cameras
    provide significant cost savings, eliminate safety risks associated with climbing
    in a high-rise building for inspections, and reduce the time required to assess
    the site conditions. Some respondents highlighted the use of drones for aerial
    transport of lightweight materials and tools during the construction of high-rise
    buildings. Secondary evidence also supports the growing usage of drones as the
    drone market in the UAE is currently among the most advanced and developed in
    the Middle East (Gulfnews, 2017). Evidence in the literature supports the growing
    use of drones in the construction sector since they can capture large amounts
    of data through multiple sensors, such as cameras, laser scanners, and radio-frequency
    identification (RFID) readers [26]. Three-dimensional printing or additive manufacturing
    emerged as the fourth-most implemented technology in this category (3.11) but
    emerged as the one to grow the most significant in the next five years (4.40).
    The interviews supported this finding. Most respondents were confident that 3-D
    printing would become the new norm in the post-COVID-19 era as the sector is trying
    to reduce its dependence on blue-collar workers. They stressed that the UAE is
    one of the first countries to promote 3-D printing, and most construction firms
    will use 3-D printing, as this is an integral part of the UAE''s Industry 4.0
    strategy [72]. Dubai Electricity and Water Authority lab is the first 3-D-printed
    laboratory building in the world [30] and is also collaborating with prestigious
    research centers and universities worldwide. Unlike modular prefabrication, 3-D
    printing facilitates building complex or unique concrete structures and shapes
    and therefore provides significant value-add to contractors. The results mirror
    the increasing popularity of 3-D printing in the literature due to its benefits
    such as greater quality control, unlimited shapes and geometry configurations,
    and cost-effectiveness because parts can be created at a fraction of the price
    compared with standard means of construction due to less waste, use of recycled
    materials, and decrease in transport costs [4], [58]. Smart contracts emerged
    as the second least implemented in this category (2.99). However, similar to drones,
    this is also expected to grow significantly in the coming years (4.12). Most interviewees
    were optimistic about the potential of smart contracts, as these will save time
    (avoid follow-up) in contracting, and their obligations will be fulfilled automatically
    when the predefined conditions are met. Moreover, the growth of blockchain will
    increase the adoption of smart contracts, as most of them are powered by blockchain
    technology. Calvetti et al. [17], [18] reported the significant application of
    blockchain-powered smart contracts in the construction sector. Autonomous construction
    vehicles emerged as the least implemented technology in this category (2.68),
    and despite its growth potential, it is likely to remain as the least implemented
    in the future (3.54). According to a few respondents, autonomous construction
    vehicles are better suited for road projects and pavements and do not have much
    potential in building projects. A few respondents had contrasting views as they
    highlighted the significant progress made in driverless dozers and cranes (which
    can be operated remotely). In our literature review also, autonomous vehicles
    have witnessed relatively less interest than other technologies. 3) Integration
    and Collaboration The current state of integration and collaboration using Industry
    4.0 technologies scored 3.18 out of 5.00. However, it is poised to improve significantly
    in the next five years (4.14). Of these, BIM emerged as the most implemented technology,
    not only in this category but across all categories (3.99). It is set to grow
    even further in the coming years (4.75). Evidence from the literature supports
    the growing use of BIM in the construction sector vis-à-vis other Construction
    4.0 technologies [52], [60], [80]. For instance, Mansouri et al. [49] found BIM
    as the most implemented technology in the construction sector. Almost all interviewees
    agreed on the benefit of BIM as a 3-D modeling tool. However, some participants
    acknowledged that BIM technology is not fully utilized in most cases. According
    to them, BIM is used mostly at the design stage by architects, and the 3-D models
    are not further utilized by the consultants (for project scheduling), contractors
    (during the construction phase), and developers (during the operation and maintenance
    phase). In other words, the additional benefits of BIM, such as scheduling (4-D),
    cost (5-D), sustainability (6-D), and operations and maintenance (7-D), are not
    utilized. However, interviewees were optimistic that BIM would further enhance
    collaboration across stakeholders. CPS emerged as the least implemented Industry
    4.0 technology (2.44). Although it is set to grow in the next five years, it will
    remain the least popular (3.35). This echoes the bibliometric review findings
    of Zabidin et al. [80], who reported CPS as the least discussed in the literature.
    One of the interviewees acknowledged the potential of CPS to integrate different
    Industry 4.0 technologies. For instance, the data from the IoT network can be
    integrated with CPS, and blockchain can be used to store these data in a secure
    cloud environment for advanced data analytics. However, in general, respondents
    are of the view that the integration of various technologies will take time, especially
    when it comes to creating an ecosystem in which machines will communicate with
    other machines and make autonomous decisions without human interventions. According
    to them, the likely benefit of CPS in the near future will be the enhanced human–machine
    interface. In the words of one of the interviewees: “The role of humans in construction
    projects will become even more critical in the future, and we must learn to work
    with these machines just like we are working with our colleagues.” From an integration
    and collaboration perspective, it was evident from the interviews that contractual
    collaboration, which is supported and automatized with smart contracts, can decrease
    the number of claims and disputes significantly, thereby improving stakeholder
    relationships. 4) Intelligent Environment The present state of the intelligent
    environment in the UAE construction sector is 2.92 out of 5.00 and is the lowest
    across the four categories. From the current levels, it is expected to improve
    in the coming years (3.81). Of the various technologies under this category, smart
    construction sites emerged with the highest mean score of 3.50 out of 5.00 at
    the current level and 4.51 in the future. According to the interviewed contractors,
    IoTs, sensors, and cameras are critical for developing smart construction sites.
    The real-time data generated from the sensors can then be used for monitoring
    and predicting likely events. Application of geofencing emerged a few times during
    the interviews. According to respondents, the use of GPS-enabled geofencing in
    large development projects enables site managers to set up triggers or alerts
    for unauthorized entry or exit of equipment, machinery, and workers. One of the
    interviewees (a subcontractor) mentioned the use of smart mobile applications
    to track the movement of workers and vehicles within the construction site, including
    the time spent by employees in a particular location. Similarly, other respondents
    (main contractors) highlighted their use of speed-detecting radar on the construction
    site to track the speed of vehicles. The result echoes the growing trend in the
    literature for smart construction sites [60]. Machine learning (2.87) and Artificial
    Intelligence (2.85) emerged as the second and third most implemented technologies
    in this category, although their scores are relatively much lower compared to
    other technologies. This is echoed in the interviews. According to interviewees,
    the UAE construction sector is in the transitioning phase toward Industry 4.0,
    and machine learning and artificial intelligence require a certain level of maturity.
    The current technologies are not able to fully substitute human capabilities and
    abilities such as self-monitoring and self-correction. However, they did acknowledge
    the fact that even at the current level, machine learning capabilities will enable
    better prediction and modeling using data from various sources. According to one
    respondent, advancement in machine learning and AI algorithms in image/photo recognition
    will add value, as the onsite images captured from drones and other means can
    be analyzed by machines, leading to a reduction in human bias and error. The algorithms
    could also determine project progress based on photos. Evidence from the literature
    suggests greater adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the
    near future, as they are already advanced in other sectors such as manufacturing.
    For instance, industrial robots are already being trained to learn how to perform
    a task [61]. Artificial intelligence could automate many aspects of the design
    in the construction sector, based on data from previous works and the study of
    their behavior over time [56]. Smart materials emerged as the least implemented
    technology in this category and second least implemented overall (2.47). This
    was reflected in the interviews as well. According to respondents, developers
    and contractors are reluctant to use innovative materials. They highlighted concerns
    related to the longevity of smart materials. In the words of one interviewee:
    “some of these materials are only a few years old, and only time will tell how
    this will perform for the next 20–30 years.” They also highlighted the challenge
    of getting regulatory approval for using these smart materials for projects. However,
    some of the respondents from contracting firms expressed optimism in adopting
    smart materials soon. They highlighted how green materials such a recycled concrete
    are now widely used in the sector after the initial reluctance. Conmix, a leading
    ready-mix concrete supplier in the UAE, has signed an agreement with Basilisk,
    a bacteria-based self-healing concrete manufacturer based in the Netherlands,
    to bring this technology to the UAE [20]. One of the respondents (a consultant)
    highlighted the potential of nanotechnology-based smart materials, such as self-cleaning
    glass facades for tall buildings, which could significantly reduce the window-cleaning
    costs of high-rise buildings. B. Impact of Construction 4.0 on Environmental,
    Social, and Economic Sustainability The findings from the interviews and secondary
    research were used to map the Construction 4.0 impact on the TBLs of sustainability,
    although some of them are discussed in the above sections. The results revealed
    both positive and negative impacts on TBL of sustainability. This is in line with
    previous studies in the literature that reported positive and negative implications
    of Industry 4.0 on TBL of sustainability (e.g., [13], [34], [38]). Table V summarizes
    the Construction 4.0 impact on environmental, social, and economic sustainability.
    The key implications are discussed in the following sections. TABLE V Mapping
    the Construction 4.0 Impact on Environmental, Social, and Economic Sustainability
    1) Environmental Sustainability Implications As seen in Table V, Construction
    4.0 technologies have both positive and negative environmental implications, although
    the overall results show that the positive impacts outweigh the negative ones.
    a) Positive environmental implications According to interviewees, one of the advantages
    of Industry 4.0 technologies on the environmental front is its ability to gather
    precise, real-time data and then use analytics to garner deep insights on material
    usage and waste statistics, thereby cutting back on water and energy consumption.
    This includes sensor-based IoT networks that could facilitate early detection
    and real-time leakage alerts. Previous studies have reported the application of
    IoT in the construction sector to gather and share big data streamed from materials,
    machines, and humans over a network system without human intervention to obtain
    actionable insights for resource optimization, energy conservation, and emission
    reductions [58], [79]. Some of the interviewed architects highlighted the significant
    reduction in 2-D paper-based drawings due to the advancement in 3-D modeling and
    wider acceptance of BIM software, thereby supporting the environment. Similarly,
    another interviewee (a procurement manager) highlighted their use of AI-based
    e-tenders for shortlisting and selecting suppliers, significantly reducing the
    paperwork. He was also optimistic about blockchain-powered smart contracts'' potential
    in further reducing paper works, related travel, and courier services. This echoes
    the growing relevance of Industry 4.0 technologies in supporting sustainable purchasing
    [13]. Few other respondents (along similar lines) also mentioned that they are
    exploring the potential of VR and AR technology to showcase their work to prospective
    clients, thereby significantly reducing the travel-related and event-related environmental
    footprint, highlighting the opportunities of augmented and virtual reality in
    the construction sector [3]. Several respondents highlighted the advances in modular
    designs that facilitate offsite prefabrication of building components that significantly
    lower onsite construction waste, one of the major environmental concerns of the
    construction sector. According to them, prefabricated materials in a controlled
    environment are likely to have lower embodied energy than onsite construction.
    This echoes the growing trend in applying off-site construction practices [54].
    Further, developers and architects/consultants are using BIM for building design
    that allows easy disassembly at the end of life, maximizing recovery and recyclability
    of materials and components. One respondent (the main contractor) shared his experience
    using photo-voltaic glass facades that generate clean energy in one of their high-rise
    building projects. Other respondents highlighted the advances in solar panel technology
    for harnessing clean energy in project sites and buildings. Other respondents
    highlighted the potential of AI in facilitating intelligent, heating, ventilation,
    and cooling solutions, thereby lowering the environmental footprint. b) Negative
    environmental implications Industry 4.0 technologies have some adverse impacts
    on the environment. Interviewees highlighted the power-hungry nature of these
    technologies. For instance, machine learning and AI algorithms require a significant
    amount of computational power, thereby increasing the need for powerful servers.
    Large data centers with extensive cooling requirements are required for storing
    and computing the significant amount of data generated. However, most respondents
    mentioned that they have either migrated or are in the process of migrating to
    cloud data centers instead of on-premises data centers. Some respondents are particular
    in selecting cloud service providers such as Microsoft, which is committed to
    100% renewable energy in all of its data centers by 2025, thereby reducing their
    organizational footprint. Previous studies have reported similar concerns about
    the high computational energy demand for AI and big data analytics [13]. The other
    problem highlighted by respondents is the significant electronic waste (e-waste)
    generated at construction sites. Ironically, most IoT devices (some of them deployed
    to manage construction waste) end up in landfills after their useful life. Also,
    most of them are battery-powered, leading to a significant increase in toxic battery
    waste. Other sectors have also reported similar negative impacts on the environment,
    such as increased electronic waste and increased energy consumption [34]. 2) Social
    Sustainability Implications Comparable positive and negative impacts of Construction
    4.0 technologies are identified for social sustainability. a) Positive social
    implications In terms of positive implications, the consensus among interviewees
    was that Construction 4.0 does improve the health and safety of workers. This
    is promising because the construction sector constituted the largest percentage
    (47%) of the total number of worker deaths by accidents in the UAE [65]. The primary
    reasons for these deaths are fall from height, being hit by moving objects, being
    caught, crushed, squeezed, compressed, or pinched between two or more objects
    (caught-in or caught-between accidents). According to interviewees, accidents
    and injuries will significantly reduce with the use of technology. One respondent
    pointed out their use of drones for distant inspections and lifting of objects
    in high-rise towers. Similarly, another respondent highlighted the use of “climbing
    robots” for cleaning windows of high-rise buildings, thereby replacing humans
    in this high-risk occupation. Automation of onsite construction activities by
    intelligent machines can facilitate sensing the presence of workers in dangerous
    proximity and can warn the operator or the machine involved can stop itself, significantly
    reducing caught-in or caught-between accidents. Previous studies have advocated
    using Construction 4.0 technologies to eliminate human error as much as possible
    and prevent accidents [4], [70]. Similarly, sensor-based smart construction sites
    that can detect noise levels and pollution levels can improve onsite workers''
    mental and physical well being. One respondent highlighted the use of smart wearables
    such as digital wrist bands and smartwatches that can detect if workers are tired
    or overworked. On similar lines, another respondent noted their use of smart cameras
    attached to workers'' helmets, which are used for remote supervision and training
    programs. Interviewees also expressed their optimism in shifting all the manual
    repetitive, and heavy lifting jobs from humans to robots at construction sites,
    thereby minimizing the sector''s high dependence on blue-collar workers, which
    has been a subject of heavy criticism in the past. One interviewee (the main contractor)
    mentioned that they had initiated a comprehensive program for upskilling blue-collar
    workers to knowledge workers. This echoes the evidence from other sectors related
    to Industry 4.0’s positive impact on employee morale, safer working conditions,
    less intense workload, and job enrichment [38], [51]. Another positive theme that
    emerged during the interviews is the overwhelming potential of Construction 4.0
    in enhancing gender diversity in construction. At present, more than 90% of the
    UAE workforce in the UAE construction sector are male [25]. Most of the female
    jobs are back-office jobs in administrative or secretarial posts. According to
    interviewees, this gap is largely due to the stereotypes and social perceptions
    that the construction sector is tough and dangerous for women. However, with Construction
    4.0, respondents believe that the nature of new jobs in the construction sector
    will be more attractive and conducive for women. This will support the UAE''s
    vision of becoming one of the top countries for gender equality [59] as well as
    keeping to the country''s overall UN sustainable development goals. This is also
    in line with previous findings that Construction 4.0 could help reduce the gender
    divide of the sector through increased participation of females [11]. Counterfeit
    building materials continue to represent a threat to the construction industry
    in the UAE and elsewhere (Construction Week, 2017). The stiff competition and
    low-profit margins are reasons for the increasing unlawful trading of cheap and
    counterfeit products. The interviewees highlighted that the advancement in IoTs,
    4G/5G mobile technology, and blockchain could significantly improve the end-to-end
    supply chain traceability of illegal and counterfeit goods, thereby improving
    construction quality. The interviewees also expressed optimism in the advancements
    in BIM and blockchain in enhancing early collaboration between different supply
    chain stakeholders. Previously, lack of stakeholder collaboration was identified
    as one of the key challenges of the UAE construction sector [8], [9]. Examining
    the broad application of Construction 4.0 at the supply chain level (which was
    missing in the construction literature) is encouraging for the sector. Previous
    studies in other sectors have highlighted the potential of Industry 4.0 in achieving
    sustainable supply chains [13], [34]. Further, blockchain-enabled smart contracts
    can ensure that construction contractors and suppliers are paid on time after
    receiving the confirmation of completion. This significantly increases the transparency
    and trust across supply chain stakeholders in a sector that is plagued with payment
    delays and disputes. In the words of one of the interviewees (a subcontractor):
    “Cash flow is the essence of our business; already the payment terms are 90 to
    180 days, and if these payments are further delayed or caught up in lengthy arbitration,
    we go out of business.” Finally, at the societal level, Construction 4.0 technologies
    will significantly improve the quality of buildings, and advances in design and
    smart technology will improve occupants'' quality of life, such as improved indoor
    air quality, natural lighting, and ventilation. Also, Construction 4.0 will create
    several new classes of jobs for the economy, such as industrial data scientists,
    drone pilots, remote operators, machine learning, and artificial intelligence
    professionals. This is in line with previous studies that reported the potential
    of Industry 4.0 in creating new jobs for the economy [28], [67]. b) Negative social
    implications There are several adverse social implications of Construction 4.0
    at the employee level, supply chain level, and societal level. Almost every interviewee
    expressed their concerns related to the loss of jobs, especially those of blue-collar
    workers. In the words of one of the respondents: “We hear buzz words such as upskilling
    and reskilling workforce and that only the nature of jobs will change… the reality
    is millions of unskilled blue-collar workers will lose not only their jobs but
    also their livelihoods as they become unemployable… it is difficult to train them,
    especially if they are old.” One respondent highlighted that most blue-collar
    workers are not even aware that they will become redundant soon, and no one has
    even warned them. Another respondent added that in addition to blue-collar workers,
    several site inspectors and supervisors would also lose their jobs as these roles
    can be easily replaced with technology as well. At the broader societal level,
    the main concern is that these expatriate blue-collar workers are the sole breadwinners
    of their families back in countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal,
    and the roll-out of Industry 4.0 technologies will lead to mass repatriation of
    these workers. Previously, a number of authors have identified the loss of jobs
    as a key threat to the implementation of construction 4.0 [1], [19], [37], [49].
    For example, implementing digital twin technology will reduce the number of employees
    needed by automating or augmenting several functions in construction currently
    performed by people, such as planning, coordinating, communicating, measuring,
    checking, and inspecting [63]. The other emergent theme from the interviewees
    is the increase in employee surveillance. Most respondents are concerned that
    these technologies can be used to increase surveillance, such as tracking their
    movements at construction sites. This will be a significant deterrent to employee
    freedom and morale. This also raises questions on employee privacy as many of
    them are unaware that they are closely monitored. The other theme that emerged
    from the interviews is the fact that the creativity of employees is adversely
    affected by technology. The interviewed architects and consultants, in particular,
    expressed their concerns about how their creativity, free-thinking, and skills
    are being influenced and shaped by these technologies (e.g., designers are forced
    to design in the way the system permits). Intentionally or unintentionally, such
    technologies are weakening the professional autonomy and creativity of employees,
    adversely impacting their perceived self-worth at the workplace. The results support
    the notion in the literature that employees'' privacy will be overrun by technology-based
    monitoring/surveillance and that employment relationships can be negatively affected
    [1], [17], [18]. The other concern expressed by interviewees is that Construction
    4.0 technologies will further enhance the digital divide. Those with information
    and communication technology (ICT) skills and expertise are likely to benefit
    more from these advancements than others. This will lead to inequalities at the
    workplace in terms of wages and career advancements. Employees from developed
    countries will have an unfair advantage over those from developing or underdeveloped
    countries [39]. At the firm level, one of the main concerns of Industry 4.0 technologies
    is cybersecurity. According to interviewees, cyber-attacks, as well as intentional
    and unintentional internal and external data breaches, pose a significant challenge
    to data privacy and loss of technological knowledge intended to stay within the
    firm. Previous studies have highlighted cyber-security threats as one of the main
    concerns of Construction 4.0 [50], [58]. One of the respondents noted that the
    collaborative nature of technology such as BIM, in which numerous stakeholders
    are connected, increases the data security breach risks. In the words of one interviewee:
    “…the security is only as strong as its weakest link in collaborative projects.”
    Previous studies have reported that the Industry 4.0 technologies such as the
    blockchain and IoT-based ecosystem are immature, with multifaceted trust issues
    at all levels, from technology providers to users and governments [48], [75].
    The other unique concern that emerged from the interviews is that “technology
    owners” such as Autodesk are becoming more powerful and are driving the sector
    in the direction they envision, which is driven more from an economic standpoint
    and less from a socioenvironmental perspective. A few respondents (from SME) highlighted
    the widening digital divide between large and smaller firms in implementing Industry
    4.0. Large firms are better positioned than smaller firms to benefit from Industry
    4.0 technologies because of their superior financial and human resources. The
    interviewee expressed his concern that smaller firms may not keep up with the
    latest technologies, which can require a significant upfront investment. Given
    that SMEs make up more than 95% of firms in the UAE, the inclusion of SMEs in
    the Industry 4.0 discourse is critical for sector-wide adoption (Dubai SME, 2019).
    Along similar lines, the digital divide between foreign and local firms is a concern.
    When probed, several respondents from local firms expressed their worries that
    foreign firms (from developed countries) are likely to benefit more from Industry
    4.0 because of their superior capabilities, technical and managerial know-how.
    3) Economic Sustainability Implications Similar to environmental sustainability,
    the overall results (see Table V) show that the positive economic impacts from
    Construction 4.0 outweigh the negative ones. a) Positive economic implications
    The positive economic impact of Construction 4.0 is mainly because the positive
    environmental benefits get translated as economic benefits. For example, significant
    savings in energy, water, materials, and human resources from Industry 4.0 technology
    will reduce the cost of construction projects and the operational costs of buildings.
    Similarly, social benefits also get translated as economic benefits. For instance,
    improvement in health and safety from Construction 4.0 will significantly reduce
    the downtime in construction sites due to injuries or fatalities. According to
    respondents, one of the main benefits of Industry 4.0 technology is the reduction
    in costs, including manual labor costs, inspection and supervision costs, and
    savings from the automation of routine administrative tasks, which will also bring
    down the overall construction costs. Further, advanced modeling and simulation
    allow building design to be value-engineered and optimized for every stage of
    construction, operation, and end-of-life demolition. It also allows designers
    to simulate various scenarios and check for any conflicts in materials or processes
    during the implementation phases, significantly reducing the costly design variations
    and reworks at advanced stages of the project. During construction, AI-based tools
    could detect possible crashes, delays, and changes in the construction process
    by comparing the digital twin of the building against the physical one. Previous
    studies have reported that artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms
    can accurately predict project costs [35]. Similarly, interviewees reported using
    drones to take images and conduct laser scans of the project site, which were
    used to check project progress, errors, and variation from the digital twin stored
    in the BIM cloud. The results support the growing use of drones at construction
    sites, as it significantly reduces the efforts required in conventional construction
    monitoring and reporting procedures [1]. Construction 4.0 technologies were found
    to improve employee productivity. One respondent (the main contractor) highlighted
    their use of asset tagging using RFID technology at the construction site to reduce
    the time spent searching/acquiring equipment for project teams, thereby improving
    employee productivity. It also enables them to share resources across different
    projects efficiently. The same respondent also noted the potential of asset tagging
    and other technologies such as geofencing in reducing theft and misplacement of
    materials. The findings support the overwhelming evidence in the literature that
    Construction 4.0 can improve employee productivity and efficiency [16], [18],
    [52]. Similarly, the use of advanced materials such as self-healing concrete can
    considerably reduce the life-cycle costs of buildings by eliminating costly retrofits
    during the operational phase. One respondent noted the significant cost-reduction
    potential of self-cleaning glass facades. Similarly, advances in solar panel technology
    will also reduce the operational energy costs of buildings. Two respondents highlighted
    the potential of VR and AR technology in creating immersive training programs
    for employees, significantly reducing the cost of face-to-face classroom-based
    training. Advanced analytics enable real-time monitoring and detection of resource
    wastages and inefficiencies in the construction project. Real-time monitoring
    of project progress enables just-in-time procurement and inventory optimization.
    Also, during the operational phase, machine learning and AI algorithms can detect
    parts of buildings that are currently not being used and automatically deactivate
    the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in these parts, drastically reducing
    energy consumption costs. Similarly, IoT sensors can facilitate predictive maintenance
    instead of routine preventive maintenance, which significantly reduces the total
    cost of ownership by avoiding unnecessary maintenance of unused or less used parts
    of the building. Previous studies have reported lifecycle cost savings due to
    preventive and predictive measures afforded by Construction 4.0 technologies [37],
    [56]. b) Negative economic implications There are a few adverse economic implications
    of Construction 4.0. The interviewees noted that the cost of cyber-attacks and
    data breaches would be huge, including reputational loss. One respondent reminded
    that the integrated nature of technology means that any failure could have a cascading
    effect on others, leading to significant disruptions and delays. This was echoed
    by another interviewee who highlighted the over-reliance on BIM technology. Further,
    given the collaborative nature of BIM across the developer, designer, contractor,
    and subcontractor, in the case of design failures, who takes responsibility and
    liability for claims is blurred. Also, conflicting interests among collaborative
    teams could lead to a lack of consensus and project delays in the design approval.
    These results support the notion in the literature that uncertainty about the
    Construction 4.0 technologies may affect its acceptance [58]. The other common
    concern that emerged from the interviews is the high upfront cost of implementing
    the Construction 4.0 technologies, echoing the concerns in the literature [1].
    As mentioned earlier, smaller firms may struggle both on a financial and human
    resource front to implement Construction 4.0 technologies. One of the respondents
    (in the small and medium firms category) expressed his concern about the return
    on investment of Construction 4.0 technologies, as smaller firms do not have adequate
    scale economies compared to large firms. Another respondent expressed concern
    over the hidden and recurring costs of technologies, such as annual subscription
    charges, employee training costs, cyber-security costs, and ICT upgrade costs.
    Some interviewees highlighted the significant increase in the human resource budget
    for hiring and training technology professionals. The results resonate with the
    concern in the literature that adoption of Construction 4.0 may lead to high costs
    in possessing and operating technology since some technology may require constant
    enhancement or evolution [58], [60]. Similarly, Karadayi-Usta [45] reported a
    lack of financial resources as one of the key adoption challenges of Industry
    4.0. SECTION VI. Conclusion It has only been a few years since the construction
    sector started taking Industry 4.0 technologies seriously. Yet, no comprehensive
    evidence-based and structured approach has been made, first to identify the various
    isolated technologies and then to assess their current and future implementation
    potential as well as their contribution toward sustainable development. In line
    with the research questions, the study identifies various Construction 4.0 technologies
    along with their future prospects and examines their impact on environmental,
    social, and economic sustainability. A comprehensive Construction 4.0 sustainability
    framework with the potential to be applied to any country context was developed
    in this article. The usefulness and applicability of the framework were demonstrated
    in a real-life setting through a case study of the UAE construction sector. In
    the process, the authors have identified several trends, consensus, conflicts,
    approaches, methods, and gaps, all of which help to understand better and improve
    the adoption of Construction 4.0 technologies and guide future research. The implications
    of this study are manifold. For its research implications, the study is the first
    comprehensive attempt to link Construction 4.0 with all three dimensions of sustainability
    (environmental, economic, and social). Also, the study is the first comprehensive
    empirical investigation of Construction 4.0 in the UAE construction sector. First,
    the authors were able to identify and integrate various isolated Industry 4.0
    technologies into meaningful and managerially relevant categories, namely, digitalization,
    automation and advancement manufacturing, integration and collaboration, and intelligent
    environment. Moreover, unlike previous studies, a balanced approach was taken
    to assessing both the positive and negative implications of Construction 4.0 technologies.
    The findings are, therefore, both novel and significant. The study also provides
    some degree of consensus as to the scientific contours of Construction 4.0. In
    terms of practical implications, this research demonstrates that Construction
    4.0 has enormous potential to transform the sector and address some of its pressing
    environmental and socioeconomic problems. Given that most of the underlying issues
    in construction are similar in most countries, the insights obtained from this
    study can be used as a good starting point for practitioners and policymakers
    in other countries to leverage Construction 4.0 technologies while addressing
    its negative environmental, social, and economic implications. However, not all
    the Industry 4.0 technologies and sustainability implications mentioned in the
    study may be relevant for developing or underdeveloped countries. For such countries,
    cost-effective technologies such as RFID may be more suitable. Similarly, the
    focus of such countries may be predominantly on economic and social aspects. Therefore,
    the study findings and framework may require adaptation to their respective country
    contexts. The results are helpful for governments and professional associations
    for defining roadmaps and developing supportive regulations, policies, and guidelines
    for the sector-wide adoption of Construction 4.0. The article is also timely,
    given that the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the construction
    sector worldwide to find safer and smarter ways to build using Construction 4.0
    technologies (e.g., 3-D printing, use of drones for site surveillance) due to
    the increasing cost of raw materials, forced reduction in onsite labor to implement
    social distancing measures, budget constraints, project delays, and other factors.
    From the environmental sustainability standpoint, it was found that the benefits
    of Construction 4.0 far outweigh its negative impact on the environment. Its ability
    to gather precise real-time data and then use analytics to garner deep insights
    on material, water, and energy consumption patterns and waste statistics could
    significantly improve the sector''s environmental sustainability. However, the
    sector needs to address the challenges of e-waste generated at the site, including
    recycling and safe disposal, rather than sending it to landfills. Similarly, the
    sector must take actions to minimize the environmental impact arising from the
    power-hungry nature of these technologies, such as by using renewable energy to
    power the datacenters. With regard to social sustainability, we found both several
    positive and negative implications. The positive implications include the improved
    health and safety of workers. This is promising because construction is one of
    the sectors that constitute the largest percentages of worker death by accidents
    and injuries in the UAE and elsewhere. Moreover, Construction 4.0 will generate
    several new types of jobs, especially jobs in science and technology. Many of
    these will be more attractive to and conducive for women, thereby enhancing the
    much-needed gender diversity in construction, a sector in which more than 90%
    of the workforce in the UAE is male. Further, at the supply chain level, advances
    in technology such as blockchain could significantly improve the end-to-end supply
    chain traceability of illegal and counterfeit goods, thereby improving the build
    quality of construction. However, there are several adverse societal implications
    of Construction 4.0. More discourse from an ethical and humanitarian perspective
    is required on the potential loss of jobs of unskilled blue-collar workers and
    their future role in the sector due to Construction 4.0. An increase in the surveillance
    of employees raises questions on employee freedom and privacy. Also, more discourse
    is required on the data-related privacy, cyber-security, and data breaches surrounding
    Construction 4.0. Similarly, the sector needs to examine the potential weakening
    of employees'' professional autonomy and creativity, especially that of designers,
    and the subsequent implications in terms of impact on such employees’ perceived
    self-worth at the workplace. Further, Construction 4.0 is widening the corporate
    divide between large firms and small firms due to the differential ability of
    these firms to invest in innovative technologies. Specifically, large firms exhibited
    significantly greater levels of Construction 4.0 adoption than smaller firms.
    Given that SMEs make up more than 90% of firms globally, the inclusion of SMEs
    in the Construction 4.0 discourse is critical for sector-wide adoption. Governments
    must provide support mechanisms, such as financial support, incentives, tax discounts,
    and training, to increase their adoption of Construction 4.0 technologies. A similar
    corporate divide between foreign and local firms is witnessed. Therefore, to promote
    sector-wide Construction 4.0 implementation, policymakers and industry groups
    must initiate various programs and collaborative partnerships to facilitate the
    transfer of relevant knowledge, expertise, and skills from foreign firms to local
    firms, such as through local–foreign joint ventures and foreign firms mentoring
    local firms. From a foreign policy perspective, this shows that countries looking
    to promote Construction 4.0 should encourage foreign firms, especially those from
    developed countries, to establish subsidiaries there. Finally, from an economic
    sustainability standpoint, again, the benefits of Construction 4.0 far outweigh
    its negative impact. However, given the collaborative nature of Construction 4.0,
    such as BIM, mechanisms must be devised to share the profits or losses from the
    project based on the extent of collaboration. This can significantly improve the
    inherent concerns related to accountability and the low-profit margin of the sector.
    The article has some limitations. Although the proposed framework was developed
    based on an extensive review, it may not cover every facet of Construction 4.0.
    Also, the application of the framework was tested only in a single country. Furthermore,
    the application was demonstrated through a predominantly qualitative approach,
    and therefore statistical/quantitative precision in validating the framework is
    missing. For future research, given the framework''s conceptual comprehensiveness
    and generic nature, researchers in different industrial settings could adapt and
    use the framework in their respective contexts. Also, given the complexity of
    the construction sector, which includes architects/consultants (service providers),
    contractors/subcontractors (integrators), and (material and equipment) suppliers,
    the study mirrors a broad spectrum of different sectors and industries, and therefore,
    the potential applicability of the framework to other sectors is high, provided
    applications are carefully crafted and contextualized. Furthermore, future research
    could apply more rigor in the primary investigation and potentially involve conducting
    a large-scale survey-based study to test the statistical appropriateness and generalizability
    of the framework in different settings and to examine the causal link between
    Construction 4.0 implementation and its impact on environmental, social, and economic
    sustainability. Moreover, given that Construction 4.0 is a relatively new and
    promising domain, future studies could attempt to strengthen and complement the
    proposed framework and study findings through refinement and validation across
    countries and test its usefulness and applicability. Despite these limitations,
    we believe the proposed framework and its successful application will significantly
    enhance the understanding of Industry 4.0 in the construction sector. We anticipate
    that this study will encourage more research on Construction 4.0 and Industry
    4.0 in general and contribute to the theoretical advancement in the field. Appendixes

    systemCompaction path planningGuidance system 1. Introduction The majority of
    roads in the world use Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) as the main material, due to its
    favorable mechanical and financial characteristics [[1], [2], [3]]. The efforts
    to further improve the functionality, durability, and sustainability of HMA through
    the refinement of the mix design is ongoing research in the construction materials
    research community [[4], [5], [6]]. Nonetheless, the previous research indicated
    that the quality of the HMA road is also significantly impacted by how it is constructed
    [7,8]. This is mainly because as a viscoelastic material, HMA is very sensitive
    to how much and at what temperature it is compacted. Over- or under-compaction
    at temperatures above or below the optimal threshold, i.e., compaction window,
    could contribute to not achieving the desired layer density/thickness or even
    premature failure [9]. This creates an extent of time sensitivity for compaction
    operations that is almost unique across all construction operations. In other
    words, compaction operations have a very low margin for error because mistakes
    during the operation can be very costly and difficult to recover from. Conventional
    compaction of HMA relies heavily on the implicit knowledge of roller operators
    and their operational skillsets [10]. Operators are expected to consider many
    operational, logistical, environmental factors, e.g., the temperature of the asphalt,
    the ambient temperature, paver speed, number of required compaction passes, etc.,
    spontaneously and concurrently to ensure homogenous and efficient compaction.
    This combined with the time-sensitivity of the compaction procedure inevitably
    renders this operation susceptible to a high degree of quality variability [11].
    That is why equipment manufacturers and researchers have been trying to address
    this issue through the development of compaction Operator Support Systems (OSSs)
    [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. Asphalt compaction OSSs, in principle, are aiming to
    help roller operators better assess the condition of HMA in real-time by (1) collecting
    an array of data about the compaction operation, e.g., the temperature of the
    mat, ambient temperature, current number of roller passes, etc., and (2) presenting
    these data to the operators in real-time [16,17]. By doing so, asphalt compaction
    OSSs try to transform a highly intuitive and experience-driven operation into
    evidence- and information-based practice. In theory, asphalt compaction OSSs should
    reduce operational variability and previous research amply indicates this [11,12,15].
    However, the long-term field observation of the authors suggests that there has
    been very little change in the magnitude of compaction variability in practice.
    This can be attributed to many different factors, including, but not limited to,
    technology-aversion of construction professionals, legislation and liability issues
    surrounding the use of OSS, and disconnect between operators'' needs/expectations
    and the functionalities of OSSs, among others [18]. While much can be achieved
    through reforming HMA contract schemes, re-engineering organizational culture,
    and technology trust-building practices, there is still one major technical limitation
    with asphalt compaction OSSs. The current asphalt compaction OSSs are inherently
    and by design descriptive, meaning that they are designed to solely inform operators
    about the as-is state of the HMA layer and the environment. In doing so, they,
    typically, only present the raw, i.e., minimally processed, sensory data, e.g.,
    temperature, compaction count, and (estimated) achieved density plots [7,15].
    Operators need to analyze these data in real-time to develop/finetune their compaction
    strategy. Therefore, the current asphalt compaction OSSs have a strong tendency
    to overwhelm operators with the information that needs to be processed rapidly
    and instantaneously. This leads to the classic problem of information overload
    or infobesity [7,19]. Overwhelmed operators would either develop reluctance against
    OSSs, and thus start to ignore the system, or get distracted by them, which may
    even have a negative impact on the compaction operation [20]. The construction
    OSSs are not limited to paving equipment [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25]]. There
    are many examples of OSSs for excavators [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30]], cranes
    [[31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]], and trucks [[37], [38], [39], [40]]. In
    general, the support provided by OSSs can be categorized into (a) micro-planning
    of equipment trajectory, i.e., path planning [[41], [42], [43], [44]], (b) macro-planning
    of equipment activities, e.g., sequence of digs/lifts [[45], [46], [47], [48]],
    and (c) alerting the operators about the safety hazards [38,[49], [50], [51],
    [52], [53]]. Alternatively, based on the loose adaptation of the concept of levels
    of automation in the automotive industry [54], construction OSSs can be classified
    as descriptive, prescriptive, or interventional systems. Descriptive OSSs are
    committed to monitoring/scanning the operation/environment using sensors in order
    to provide operators with pieces of information that are otherwise impossible,
    or very difficult, to gather in real-time using human sensory faculties. This
    includes, for instance, blind spot detection systems [55], and real-time compaction
    density measurement systems [56]. At a higher level of automation, prescriptive
    OSSs process the sensory data into more actionable guidance, e.g., stop, turn,
    speed up, etc., that (partially) relieve operators of the task of translating
    sensory data into operational strategies. Examples are path/trajectory planning
    systems that aim to recommend the shortest and/or safest trajectories for construction
    equipment [[57], [58], [59], [60]]. Finally, interventional OSSs act at a higher
    level of automation and fully or partially take over equipment control. Examples
    include autonomous excavators [[61], [62], [63]], graders [64], and loaders [65].
    In general, the research and development of OSSs with higher degrees of automation
    for construction equipment suggest that the transition towards more prescriptive
    systems can have a positive impact on the applicability of the OSSs [58,60]. The
    authors have previously presented a framework for a semi-guidance asphalt compaction
    OSS that translates the sensory data into a compaction priority heatmap [7]. Although
    this heatmap integrates various sources of data, i.e., asphalt temperature, compaction
    pass count, and ambient temperature, into a single compaction priority index,
    it still requires operators to process the data and develop a compaction strategy/trajectory.
    In line with OSSs of other types of construction equipment, a higher level of
    automation can be envisioned for rollers, where operators are provided with a
    compaction trajectory. At this level of automation, asphalt compaction OSSs would
    resemble a typical navigation system for passenger vehicles. However, prescriptive
    OSSs are still very much uncharted territory for compaction operations. There
    are a few research where efforts have been made to apply trajectory planning in
    paving operations. But there are four main limitations to how compaction trajectory
    is determined in the existing methods: (1) the trajectory is proposed based on
    the fixed predefined trajectory parameters (e.g., fixed length) that are not dynamically
    changing with respect to natural variations during the paving operations [66,67],
    (2) the focus is primarily placed on achieving the target number of compaction
    passes and therefore the intricate interplay between compaction pass and asphalt
    temperature is ignored [67], (3) they rely on manual inputs of the operators for
    the adoption of trajectory during the operation [66], and (4) they are framed
    in the context of autonomous compaction systems, assuming full compliance of the
    operation with the optimized planned trajectory. In doing so, they do not deal
    with dynamic issues that may arise due to the non- or mal- compliance of the operators
    and do not look at the problem as an adaptive system [67,68]. Therefore, to the
    best of the authors'' knowledge, there is currently no method for the guidance-level
    asphalt compaction OSSs that translate the raw sensory data into an easy-to-follow
    compaction trajectory that considers (1) the interplay between asphalt temperature
    and compaction pass in determining the quality of the paving operations and (2)
    the application in non-autonomous systems. A more detailed discussion of this
    research gap will be provided in Section 2.3. To this end, this research aims
    to propose a novel method for the generation of prescriptive guidance-level asphalt
    compaction OSSs that presents operators with a potential compaction trajectory
    based on consideration of parameters that impact the quality of compaction (i.e.,
    compaction effort, and temperature). It is hypothesized that such an asphalt compaction
    OSS will result in improved efficiency of compaction operation, in the sense that
    operators achieve a higher degree of compaction homogeneity at the proper asphalt
    mixture temperatures. It should be noted that this research focuses on the method
    to generate such a compaction trajectory from the data analytics and software
    perspective. The hardware required for this OSS remains the same as more descriptive
    asphalt compaction OSSs, which is extensively discussed in the previous work of
    the authors [7]. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. First,
    the core principles and assumption of an efficient compaction strategy is presented.
    Next, the proposed method is elaborated in detail. Subsequently, the implementation
    and case studies will be presented. Finally, the discussions and conclusions are
    outlined. 2. Related work 2.1. Intelligent compaction systems For a number of
    years, asphalt compaction OSSs have been marketed under the umbrella term of Intelligent
    Compaction (IC). It is an umbrella term because it incorporates both asphalt and
    soil compaction support systems [69,70]. While there are some similarities, the
    compaction of soil and asphalt are drastically different, given the viscoelasticity
    of asphalt (bitumen) and the sensitivity of the compaction operation to the asphalt
    temperature [71]. That is why the OSSs developed for these operations need to
    be treated differently. Asphalt ICs predominantly focus on the presentation of
    descriptive guidance to the operators, which is commonly presented in terms of
    temperature and compaction count plots [[71], [72], [73], [74]]. More advanced
    variations of ICs exploit Machine Learning methods to indirectly measure the density
    of the asphalt [[75], [76], [77]]. In these systems, Intelligent Compaction Measurement
    Value (ICMV), which is a measurement of asphalt stiffness based on the drum accelerometer''s
    reading, is correlated with the in-place density to develop a real-time density
    measurement methodology [77]. Other than ICMV-based methods, density measurements
    have been also pursued through the use of Non-Nuclear Density Gauge (NNDG) [78],
    and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [79]. However, to the best of the authors''
    knowledge, these measurement techniques have two limitations: (1) these systems
    commonly have accuracy and scalability issues on the account of ICMV being very
    sensitive to a wide range of parameters (e.g., make and type of the roller, asphalt
    temperature, asphalt mix type, grade and subgrade layer, asphalt layer thickness,
    etc.). Due to this high context dependency, developing an accurate generic model
    is challenging [77], and (2) the use of GPR and NNDG-based methods as part of
    OSS is challenging given that these devices cannot be easily mounted on rollers.
    So, although they can be used for density measurements after the project, their
    use during the project is questionable. Therefore, it can be stated that, on one
    hand, density measurement as part of asphalt compaction OSS is still premature
    and both technically and practically challenging and, on the other hand, the type
    of guidance that can be provided to the operators by asphalt ICs has never gone
    beyond the descriptive level. This would leave a gap in terms of providing the
    operators with a real-time trajectory that can help improve the quality of the
    compaction operation. 2.2. Path-planning in the construction industry The research
    in construction equipment path/trajectory planning is long-standing and substantial
    [27,[80], [81], [82], [83], [84]]. Specific focus has been placed on finding the
    collision-free, safe, and most economical path for cranes [34,36,41,42,58,81,82],
    excavators [27,39], trucks [85,86], bulldozers [87], and inspection drones [88].
    Many different advanced algorithms were considered, including but not limited
    to, A*, Dijkstra, Coverage Path Planning (CPP), Complete Coverage Path Planning
    (CCPP), and Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) [27,80,87,89]. While the technical
    elaboration of these algorithms is out of the scope of this paper, there are a
    few fundamental differences between path/trajectory planning for asphalt rollers
    and other types of construction equipment that practically render these methods
    less applicable to the compaction operation: (1) Determination of asphalt compaction
    trajectory is predominantly governed by the compaction quality [7] rather than
    safety (i.e., collision-freeness) or productivity (fastest trajectory). This is
    mainly because, on one hand, on-foot worker traffic on road construction sites
    is far less than in other types of construction, and equipment collision seldom
    happens on road construction sites. On the other hand, given the fact that if
    the compaction is deemed inadequate, the contractors are commonly required to
    perform exorbitantly costly repairs or pay a high penalty, the quality of compaction
    is almost never sacrificed for high productivity. (2) Due to the kinematics of
    rollers and several operational constraints (e.g., the overlap between two adjacent
    compaction passes), a single compaction pass follows a highly standardized pattern,
    as shown in Fig. 1. This means that trajectory planning in compaction operation
    is not inherently a point-to-point path-planning problem that is normally addressed
    by most of the existing path-planning algorithms. Instead, it is more about finding
    the quality-optimal values for the parameters of the trajectory pattern shown
    in Fig. 1. In this way, the proposed trajectory is ensured to be practical and
    feasible. This is quite different from path planning for equipment such as cranes
    and excavators. (3) Because of the asphalt cooling behavior, pavement operations
    are highly time-sensitive, which means that there is very little room for delaying
    the operation for planning a fitting trajectory. This would set a strict requirement
    on the real-time-ness of the path-planning method. Besides, operationally, it
    is not ideal to continuously modify the compaction trajectory for the operators
    since it becomes unactionable. Therefore, compaction trajectory planning must
    be perceived as an intermittent/periodic yet real-time parametric trajectory planning
    problem. That is why retrofitting the existing methods to the case of rollers
    is not ideal and specific in-depth research into prescriptive asphalt compaction
    OSSs is needed. Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Typical compaction trajectory pattern. 2.3. Trajectory
    planning in asphalt paving operations There are a few efforts to apply trajectory
    planning to asphalt operations. Krishnamurthy et al. [66] developed a pipeline
    for the generation of a trajectory for roller operators. However, this system
    only used Global Positioning System (GPS) to track rollers and generate a path
    only based on pre-determined parameters (e.g., length of the rolling zone) or
    the real-time manual input from the operators. In doing so, the system does not
    offer any adaptiveness with respect to variation in the temperature profile of
    the asphalt and also does not consider the fact that efficient compaction should
    take place in a specific temperature window. Kuenzel et al. [67] proposed a trajectory
    planning method for rollers as part of an autonomous compaction system. Like the
    previous study, the main components of trajectory planning are fixed parameters
    determined beforehand. Although this study considers temperature thresholds, it
    is only considered as hard stopping criteria (i.e., if the temperature of the
    asphalt is below the lower threshold, turn back) rather than an active element
    that would consider the cooling rate to ensure the entire asphalt layer would
    receive proper compaction. Additionally, since the method is developed as part
    of an autonomous system, and mainly tested in a simulated environment with no
    human operation interaction, it assumes full compliance with the generated path.
    In a descriptive OSS, this is a wrong assumption as operators can always decide
    not to comply with the prescribed trajectory and therefore a new trajectory needs
    to be generated based on real-time changes. Finally, Husemann et al. [68] proposed
    a trajectory planning approach for asphalt paving operations as part of an autonomous
    rolling system. So, once again the assumption of full compliance will render this
    method less suitable for asphalt compaction OSSs. On the other hand, although
    the temperature of the asphalt is considered to prioritize the compaction task
    of different parts, it is integration with the compaction pass count and how the
    combination of the two constitutes an efficient compaction is not well-defined.
    Finally, the length of each compaction section is determined based on predefined
    values and assuming a constant temperature of the delivered material, which is
    not very realistic. Therefore, again an adaptive approach that considers the current
    condition of the asphalt in the determination of the compaction trajectory is
    missing. On the premise of the above review, it can be stated that currently there
    are no methods that can consider the intricate interplay between the asphalt mix,
    compaction efforts, and mix/ambient temperature in the provision of real-time
    trajectory planning (i.e., prescriptive guidance) for the roller operators as
    part of asphalt compaction OSSs. From a scientific standpoint, there is an absence
    of knowledge on how to perform real-time trajectory planning for asphalt paving
    operations and this research tries to fill this gap. 2.4. Autonomous paving equipment
    On top of the above-mentioned solutions for trajectory planning, autonomous equipment
    has also started to find its way into the paving industry. Autonomous rollers
    are designed to operate without human intervention, utilizing sensors, cameras,
    and GPS systems to navigate and perform tasks efficiently. Among the actively
    involved manufacturers are Bomag [90], Hamm [91], XCMG [92,93], and Semcon [94].
    However, there are a few key issues that need to be raised with respect to autonomous
    rollers, which highlights the exigency and the relevance of the proposed method
    in this research: (1) While commercial autonomous paving equipment is claimed
    to be available, the penetration of the technology into the practice is very low.
    This is because this equipment is still expensive and requires a major investment
    from the contractors. The majority of contractors are willing to, and for a foreseeable
    future will, deploy their existing fleets. In addition to financial barriers,
    the adoption of autonomous equipment in asphalt paving operations raises significant
    legal, regulatory, and contractual concerns. This is more intensified in the case
    of asphalt paving operations where the window of time for remedial action is very
    small, and the cost of repair/penalty is exorbitant. Safety is also a major concern,
    given that many paving operations occur in close proximity to normal traffic (i.e.,
    not all project demands the full closure of the entire road). Furthermore, resistance
    from users, fueled by job security fears, adds to the challenges of testing and
    implementing autonomous equipment. The combination of economic, legal, safety,
    and user acceptance issues makes the transition to autonomous paving sites highly
    complex and time-consuming. These multifaceted obstacles indicate that the quick
    adoption of autonomous equipment in paving operations is unlikely. However, descriptive
    and prescriptive systems can be employed on the existing equipment. This is a
    significant practical advantage of prescriptive OSSs over autonomous solutions,
    in the short to mid-term; (2) To the best of the authors'' knowledge, the majority
    of the existing solutions focus on the autonomous control of rollers to complete
    a predefined and highly regulated compaction trajectory based on several assumptions.
    While this is valuable, they do not consider the dynamic nature of the asphalt
    material and do not re-evaluate their compaction trajectory in view of logistics
    and the variable temperature profile of the asphalt, which is inevitable given
    the ambient condition and inhomogeneous asphalt temperature at the point of delivery
    to the site. Therefore, the authors believe that the proposed trajectory planning
    method not only can offer a significant advantage during the transition period
    to an autonomous site but also can help the autonomous paving equipment manufacturer
    to further develop their solutions in view of the dynamics of asphalt behavior.
    3. Theoretical departure point Before elaborating on the proposed method, it is
    important to discuss the theoretical departure point that defines and steers a
    viable and near-optimum compaction trajectory. This section is split into two
    subsections: (1) a theoretical description of what constitutes efficient compaction,
    and (2) the basics of the data collected by asphalt compaction OSSs. 3.1. Principles
    of efficient compaction trajectory The principles of efficient compaction can
    be discussed in terms of 8 axioms. These axioms are derived from many field visits
    of the authors and also relevant literature that discuss asphalt compaction planning
    [66,68,95]. These axioms are: 1. The efficient compaction is defined as compaction
    that ensures a given part of the asphalt layer (i) has been subjected to the required
    number of roller passes (N), (ii) at the appropriate temperatures, which are marked
    by the lower (Tmin) and higher (Tmax) temperature thresholds [7], as shown in
    Fig. 2. Both criteria are highly dependent on the mixture type, geometry of the
    asphalt layer, and ambient weather. Given that the asphalt layer cools down rather
    quickly, operators have a relatively short window of time to perform the compaction,
    as shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (77KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Cooling curve of an asphalt mixture with optimal compaction
    window (adapted from [99]). 2. Compaction follows a predefined pattern [66], as
    shown in Fig. 3, and commonly starts from one edge to the center or to the other
    edge of the road. Depending on the width of the road, cooling rate of the asphalt,
    asphalt delivery rate, and the mix type, the common practice is to split the road
    into several compaction corridors (CC) and assign each corridor to a number of
    rollers that only move along that corridor. The assumption of this research is
    that the width of the corridor is determined prior to the compaction operation
    by the tactical planners. The length of corridors changes over time, as the paver
    advances. Another assumption made in this research is that the movement of rollers
    in each corridor is independent and there are no dependencies between compaction
    in each corridor. Download : Download high-res image (199KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Schematic representation of compaction process. 3. Because
    asphalt cools down quickly and a paver moves slowly, rollers tend to perform the
    compaction in sections [67,68], as shown in Fig. 3. In other words, each corridor
    is decomposed into a number of sections. The width of the section is equal to
    the width of the corridor but the length (L) should be determined in order to
    ensure efficient compaction. Note that, unlike width, the length of sections is
    not a constant value. Depending on the cooling rate of the asphalt, the compaction
    speed, and the paving speed, each section can have a different length in order
    to ensure compaction efficiency. This makes the determination of L a real-time
    problem. As will be explained later, the entire compaction trajectory planning
    boils down to the real-time determination of the length of each section. 4. Other
    than efficiency-related constraints, the length of each section should be more
    than a minimum threshold (Lmin) to make sure the compaction is actually feasible
    considering the kinematics of the roller and also concerns about fuel economy
    [67]. The minimum length of the compaction section is normally determined heuristically
    by the operators. 5. Another important consideration in the determination of section
    length is the continuation of the compaction operation. If the available section
    length is too small, then when the compaction of the section is finished, there
    is not enough asphalt available (i.e., paved and cooled down to the upper limit
    of the compaction window) for the compaction to continue. In that case, rollers
    either have to wait or work in a section that covers part of the already compacted
    section. Both scenarios are undesirable because the earlier leads to point stress
    on the asphalt and the latter overstress part of the asphalt and wastes fuel.
    6. Depending on the ratio of the corridor width (W) to the width of the roller
    (Wr), each roller needs to travel back and forth along a number of lanes, as shown
    in Fig. 3. It should be noted that the distance between the centreline of compaction
    lanes (D) is always less than the roller width to ensure that there is sufficient
    overlap between compaction lanes [95]. The value of D is also easily determined
    by considering W, Wr, and the required overlap between compaction lanes, which
    is normally around 20%. 7. If more than one roller is expected to compact the
    same section, the total number of required passes is split between the roller
    team. In this case, too, the trajectory planning for each roller is done independently
    for the designated number of passes. 8. Once the designated compaction section
    is compacted fully, the roller moves forward and compacts the next part of the
    asphalt. Considering the above axioms, the problem of planning a fitting compaction
    trajectory can be simplified to finding the length of each section in real-time
    in such a way that (a) asphalt in the section can be compacted within the temperature
    window, (b) it is more than the minimum section length (Lmin), and (c) after the
    completion of the compaction of the section, there is enough paved asphalt for
    the next compaction section to begin immediately. The proposed method, which will
    follow next, aims to present a novel mechanism to determine the section length
    in view of the constraints mentioned above. 3.2. Data collection and structure
    in asphalt compaction OSSs Before elaborating on this method, it is important
    to discuss what and how data are collected in common asphalt compaction OSSs.
    As mentioned in Section 1, it is important to note that the hardware and raw data
    required for the proposed prescriptive guidance remain the same as more descriptive
    asphalt compaction OSSs, since the focus of the prescriptive guidance is on the
    novel real-time analytics and data processing that are applied on the same sensory
    data. Most asphalt compaction OSSs collect temperature data of the surface and
    the compaction count. More advanced OSS, developed by the authors, can also develop
    a real-time cooling curve of the asphalt using embedded thermocouples inside the
    asphalt layer [7]. These data are normally mapped to a cell-based grid where each
    cell represents the temperature and compaction profile of a small area of the
    asphalt layer, as shown in Fig. 4(a). As shown in this figure, a variety of temperature-
    and compaction-related indicators are used to precisely point to the current state
    of each cell. Note that while some of the data are static and time-invariant (i.e.,
    Initial Temperature, Temperature at the first and last pass) others (i.e., Current
    temperature, Number of passes, Number of remaining passes, and Time left for compaction)
    are time-series data that need updating in (near) real-time. Also, it should be
    noted that the time left for compaction is determined based on the current temperature,
    upper and lower temperature thresholds, and cooling behavior of the asphalt, as
    explained in the previous work of the authors [7]. Download : Download high-res
    image (154KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Upscaling cell-based
    data registration into the stripped-based structure. However, data granularity
    at the cell is not suitable for trajectory planning. This is mainly because, as
    discussed in Section 2, the compaction trajectory planning boils down to the determination
    of the compaction section length. Therefore, the variation of temperature and
    compaction passes along the section width becomes less relevant because rollers
    cannot bounce and leap over individual cells. As a result, resolution upscaling
    needs to be applied to ensure rational continuity of the roller''s motion. To
    this end, the data resolution can be upscaled from cell structure to strip structure,
    as shown in Fig. 4(b). Simple averaging of cell data along the section width,
    i.e., j in Fig. 4(a), can be used to represent the status of asphalt in a strip
    structure. It is crucial to note that the width of each strip corresponds to each
    compaction section. So, in the scenario shown in Fig. 3, each of the two lateral
    sections would have its own set of strips. 4. Proposed framework An overview of
    the proposed method is presented in Fig. 5. As stated in Section 3.1, the core
    principle behind this method is to identify the section length that satisfies
    the conditions of (1) efficient compaction and (2) continuity of the operation.
    As explained before, it is assumed that operation in each corridor is independent
    of the other corridors. Therefore, the proposed trajectory planning method applies
    independently and separately to each corridor. For the sake of simplicity, the
    elaboration of the method is provided for one single corridor. The proposed method
    consists of seven steps: (1) The first step in the proposed method is to identify
    the beginning of the next compaction section (Ss). The beginning of the next compaction
    section is set at the first available strip that has not been compacted yet. This
    is because rollers cannot forgo the compaction of any part of the asphalt under
    any circumstances, even if the asphalt is cold. In this way, the continuity of
    the compaction operation is safeguarded. The only condition that needs to be checked
    here is whether the temperature of the asphalt on the first available strip is
    below the upper threshold of the compaction window. If this is not the case, the
    system waits until the strip is cooled down to this temperature. (2) Next step
    of the method tries to find the end strip of the compaction section (Se) in such
    a way that it meets two conditions of efficiency and continuity. Fig. 6 provides
    a schematic representation of how the end strip can be determined. To find the
    end strip, first, the last strip (Se), i.e., the furthest strip from Ss, whose
    current temperature is below the upper threshold of the compaction window is identified.
    Next, based on the real-time cooling curve of the asphalt, the time left for the
    compaction of Ss (TLs) and Se (TLe) are calculated. In other words, the time left
    for the strip Se to reach the lower threshold of the compaction window is calculated,
    as explained in the previous work of the authors [7]. Next, the average speed
    of the roller is used to calculate the anticipated compaction time (TRe) of the
    section between Ss and Se, using Eqs. (1), (2). Download : Download high-res image

    strip Le: Distance between Ssand Se N: Number of required compaction passes :
    Average compaction speed M: Number of compaction lanes W: Width of compaction
    section PO: Percentage of overlap between two lanes Wr: Width of the roller (3)
    In the next step, the distance between Se and Ss (Le) is compared to the minimum
    section length (Lmin). This is to make sure, the compaction is feasible from the
    perspective of the kinematics of rollers. This step basically controls if there
    is enough asphalt available for the compaction to begin. If Le Lmin, then the
    method continues to the next step. However, if Le < Lmin and the time left for
    the compaction of section (TLe) is more than the anticipated compaction time (TRe),
    the method prescribes the roller to wait until enough cooled-down asphalt is available.
    If Le < Lmin, and TLe TRe, then the method assumes that there has been a break
    in the operation of the paver (e.g., end of the road or interruption in the delivery
    of asphalt to the site). In this case, although undesirable, the method prescribes
    the proceeding of the compaction even if it means that the roller needs to over-compact
    part of the previous section to ensure the Lmin requirement is met. (4) when the
    Le Lmin, then the method checks if there is enough time for this compaction section
    to be compacted effectively. To this end, the anticipated compaction time of the
    section (TRe) is compared to the time left for the compaction of both the start
    and end strips. It is assumed that the temperatures of the middle strips fall
    within the temperatures of the start and end strips, as shown in Fig. 6. This
    is a reasonable assumption considering the movement direction of the paver. Therefore,
    if TRe TLs and TRe TLe, then it is assumed that all the strips in this section
    can receive all the compaction passes within the compaction window, and thus meet
    the requirement of efficiency. If this condition is not satisfied, the method
    will make the section shorter by moving Se one strip closer to Ss and will go
    back to Step 3. This loop continues as long as the section length is larger than
    Lmin. If in all cases, the condition of efficiency is not met, the method prescribes
    the undesirable compaction of Lmin, as explained before. (5) If the condition
    of efficient compaction is met, then the method controls the continuity condition.
    To this end, the strip P (Sp) ahead of Se is found in such a way that the distance
    between Se and Sp is equal to the distance between Ss and Se. This is called the
    look-ahead section (LS). Then, the time left for the compaction of the start and
    end strips of LS is calculated. Like the previous step, the time needed for the
    compaction of LS (TRp) is calculated. Then, the condition of continuity is checked
    by making sure that the time left for the compaction of strips in LS is more than
    the summation of TRp and TRe. If this condition is also satisfied, the compaction
    section is confirmed and the operator is instructed to proceed with the compaction.
    If the condition is not met, the method will make the section shorter by moving
    Se one strip closer to Ss and will go back to Step 3. (6) Once the section length
    is determined, the standard pattern of the compaction trajectory is mapped to
    the planned section, as shown in Fig. 7. The compaction trajectory is determined
    based on the required number of lanes (i.e., M in Eq. (2)). The distance between
    two lanes (i.e., centre to centre) can be calculated as shown in Eq. (3). Download

    of compaction pattern on the selected section. (3) where: D: Distance between
    lanes W: Width of compaction section M: Number of compaction lanes (7) Because
    trajectory planning is a near-real-time process, the method explained above needs
    to be repeated at a certain frequency. To this end, the proposed method keeps
    track of the actual compaction executed by the operator and as soon as 80% of
    the required compaction passes are made, the trajectory planning of the next section
    will commence. The reason for introducing this delay in trajectory finding is
    two-fold. On one hand, given the time sensitivity of the compaction process, it
    is not reasonable to continuously update/modify the compaction trajectory based
    on real-time temperature and compaction data while the operator is busy in the
    same section. This could also exacerbate the infobesity problem and lead to disruption
    of fluidity and continuity of the compaction process. Therefore, once a compaction
    trajectory is planned for a section, practically it is more reasonable to wait
    until the compaction of that section is completed before a new trajectory is planned
    for the next section. On the other hand, given that the proposed method wants
    to ensure compaction continuity, the new trajectory for the next section should
    be available as soon as, or even before, the previous section is completed. That
    is why the threshold of 80% is chosen. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the
    authors, this threshold offers a sufficient time window for trajectory planning
    without disrupting the process. As explained above, the proposed method considers
    the real-time cooling rate of the asphalt (which means it accounts for the mix
    type and ambient condition), the real-time temperature of the asphalt, and the
    compaction passes to plan a trajectory that can meet the requirements of efficiency
    and continuity. Also, because it continuously checks the progress of the work
    by the operators and periodically generates a new trajectory based on the real-time
    condition of the asphalt, it does not assume full compliance and therefore fits
    the application in asphalt compaction OSSs. 5. Implementation and case studies
    To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, it was
    implemented and tested in two case studies. To demonstrate the feasibility of
    the proposed method as part of asphalt compaction OSS, a prototype was developed
    and tested on a construction site. However, this case study focused only on the
    feasibility of the system and not on a comparative assessment. This decision is
    driven by three reasons: (1) Because operators feel liable for the quality of
    the work, there is a very strong chance of non-compliant behavior when it comes
    to testing more descriptive systems. So, to make sure the assessment of the descriptive
    OSS is objective and reliable, it needs to be performed in an environment where
    the operators feel safe and comfortable following the provided guidance. (2) A
    fair comparison of the system with other levels of OSS would require a controlled
    environment. Given that asphalt paving operation is very sensitive to weather
    conditions and the skillset of the operator, compassion across different projects
    may result in biased results. (3) Given the time sensitivity of the paving operations,
    it is not feasible/ideal to have different systems tested by different operators
    in the same project. On these premises, a second case study was designed where
    the proposed method was implemented in a Virtual Prototype (VP) platform, as explained
    in the previous work of the authors [96]. The VP-based platform allows an objective
    comparison between prescriptive and descriptive asphalt compaction OSS in a highly
    controllable, consequence/risk-free, repeatable, and fair environment. 5.1. Case
    study 1: testing on an actual roller 5.1.1. Implementation The first case study
    was set up on the premise of SOMA College where an operator was asked to perform
    compaction on a stretch of 70 m. Since compaction on the hot asphalt was not possible
    to arrange, it was done on the cold asphalt. To replicate the behavior of the
    hot asphalt, temperature data from a hot mix asphalt project was projected onto
    the cold asphalt layer in real-time. Given that the focus of this case study was
    to only gauge the functionality of the system, this was an acceptable simplification.
    Fig. 8 shows the setup of the case study and the real-time presentation of the
    prescriptive guidance in the cabin. It should be noted that in this version of
    the prototype, since the focus was on the compaction of one lane, the trajectory
    was not mapped to the sections. Instead, the section was shown by a moving box
    that indicated the length of sections that need to be compacted at any point in
    time. Download : Download high-res image (823KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. The setup of the feasibility test on actual equipment. During the
    operation, the real-time feasibility and implementability of the system were assessed
    and the system proved to be functional. The operator could easily identify the
    location of the roller, as shown in Fig. 8(g), and compare it with the proposed
    compaction section. In this prototype, the option was provided to overlay the
    compaction section on the temperature plot, so that the operator can make the
    association between the current temperature and compaction strategy. 5.1.2. Results
    and analysis The results of this case study suggest that through using the proposed
    descriptive guidance, the rate of ineffectively compacted cells declined from
    27% to 23%. However, for the reasons mentioned in Section 3 and because the temperature
    of the asphalt in this case study was simulated, the results of this case study
    should only be interpreted as an indication of the feasibility of the proposed
    method and the fact that it can be incorporated with the existing OSSs without
    requiring intervention or disruption of the current hardware setup. A more in-depth
    analysis of the contribution of the descriptive asphalt compaction OSS will be
    presented in the next case study. 5.2. Case study 2: VP-based testing 5.2.1. Implementation
    Fig. 9 provides an overview of the components of the VP platform and depicts the
    system setup. As shown in this figure, the VP consists of a seat, an LED screen,
    a joystick, and a steering wheel. The scene was developed in Unity 3D [97] and
    the proposed trajectory planning method was implemented inside Unity using the
    API. Fig. 9 (b) and (c) show the interface before and during the experiment session.
    At the beginning of each session, the user chooses the level of guidance and then
    the appropriate form of guidance is provided on the in-cabin display shown in
    Fig. 9(c). To be able to accommodate multiple users in one session, the training
    simulator facilities at the SOMA college, i.e., the largest construction operator
    training school in the Netherlands, were used. At SOMA, six training simulators
    were equipped with the developed VP set-up, as shown in Fig. 9(d). Download :

    components of VP platform [93] (b) user interface for the selection of guidance
    mode at the beginning of each session, (c) user interface during the session,
    and (d) the setup of VP platform for the case study. It is worth mentioning that
    the previous work of the authors [96] solely focused on the usability (i.e., user-experience)
    aspect of asphalt compaction OSSs and, therefore, did not investigate the effectiveness
    of different asphalt compaction OSSs (including trajectory planning) in improving
    compaction efficiency. As a result, it should be noted that although the platform
    is the same, the case study and subject of investigation are different in the
    present research. 5.2.2. Experiment The case study was organized at SOMA college
    where six novice learners and three expert instructors, each with many years of
    field experience, participated in an experiment. The reason why two different
    groups were considered in this case study was to explore the possible impact of
    years of experience (in the case of instructors) and better affinity with digital
    technologies (in the case of novice learners) on the effectiveness of different
    guidance modes. The novice learners are included in the case study because it
    is indeed interesting to see the differences in how new technologies are being
    perceived between younger (technology-native) and older generations (technology-averse).
    In general, OSS can be perceived as intricate sociotechnical systems whose success
    depends not only on technical soundness/efficiency but also on the manner in which
    there are used/adopted. While the former is user-independent, the latter is significantly
    culture-sensitive. With that in mind and knowing that today''s novice learners
    will be future professionals, it is interesting to capture this intricate multidimensionality
    in the analysis of the proposed system. The intention is to also investigate whether
    the OSS system adoption is better pursued through the imposition of the system
    onto the existing generations of operators or through the training and sensitization
    of the younger generation, or even both. A simulator training room at SOMA college
    was used. The case study took place in two different sessions, one for the students
    and one for the instructors. Fig. 10 shows the case study session. Each participant
    was assigned the task of compacting a single corridor in a straight road. The
    length of the road was set to 50 m and the number of needed compaction passes
    was set to 4. The movement of the paver was programmatically controlled and set
    at the constant speed of 8 m/min. The scenario would roughly take 5–8 min to complete.

    times each time using a different mode of guidance, which was presented to them
    on the VR in-cabin display shown in Fig. 9(c). As shown in Fig. 11, the three
    different modes included (1) Descriptive Guidance, which only shows the temperature
    and compaction plots of the asphalt mat, (2) Semi-prescriptive Guidance, which
    combines the temperature and compaction profile of each cell of the asphalt into
    an index representing the compaction priority of that cell [7], and (3) Prescriptive
    Guidance, which presents the compaction trajectory plan proposed in this research.

    At the end of each session, the compaction efficiency was calculated and stored
    in the VP platform. The details of how compaction efficiency is calculated are
    presented in the previous work of the authors [7]. Briefly, the Efficient Compaction
    Rate (ECR) index is defined as the ratio of cells (in the cell-based structure)
    that has definitively received a predefined portion of the target number of passes
    (e.g., 80%) within the compaction window to the overall number of cells. Cells
    that are not efficiently compacted are accounted for Over-Compaction Rate (OCR)
    and Under-Compaction Rate (UCR). 5.2.3. Results and analysis Table 1 and Fig.
    12 present the results of the case study. Table 1 compares the performances of
    different participants in terms of ECR, OCR, and UCR. Fig. 12 plots the ECRs of
    different participants. As the results clearly indicate, overall, the efficiency
    of the compaction has increased considerably by moving upward along the prescriptiveness
    of OSSs. Looking at the average ratio of ECR, Descriptive Guidance, Semi-prescriptive
    Guidance, and Prescriptive Guidance scored 0.52, 0.61, and 0.79 respectively.
    To further investigate whether or not the variation in the data is statistically
    significant, a pairwise two-tailed t-test at the significance level of 0.05 was
    applied to the ECR of different groups. As shown in Table 2, when all participants
    are considered together, while the variation between Descriptive Guidance and
    Semi-prescriptive Guidance is not significant, Prescriptive Guidance is significantly
    different from Semi-prescriptive Guidance and Descriptive Guidance. This clearly
    demonstrates the tangible improvement in the compaction efficiency brought by
    the application of trajectory planning. Table 1. Performance of different participants.

    to Prescriptive Guidance, as shown in Fig. 13, in 8 out of 9 cases, ECR improved
    when Prescriptive Guidance was used, i.e., compared to Descriptive Guidance the
    average ECR improvement is 0.27. When looking at the standard deviation of ECR
    scores per guidance mode, it becomes apparent that while Descriptive Guidance
    and Semi-prescriptive Guidance scores have relatively high variance (i.e., the
    standard deviation of 0.14 and 0.19 respectively), high scores in the case of
    Prescriptive Guidance is considerably more consistent among participants (i.e.,
    the standard deviation of 0.07). This attests to the fact that Prescriptive Guidance
    led to consistently high ECR regardless of background and experience. Semi-prescriptive
    Guidance also had an overall positive impact on the compaction efficiency, with
    an average improvement of 0.09 compared to Descriptive Guidance. The case of Semi-prescriptive
    Guidance is quite interesting because the impact it has on instructors (i.e.,
    0.21 average improvement in ECR) is noticeably greater than the impact on novice
    learners (i.e., 0.03 average improvement in ECR). It can be argued that while
    for experts who already have developed skillsets and dexterity, the priority information
    is easy-to-digest and actionable, for novice learners this can still be too much
    to handle in real-time. Download : Download high-res image (236KB) Download :

    to Descriptive Guidance. When the two groups are further analyzed separately in
    Table 2, Table 3, it becomes apparent that while improvement caused by Prescriptive
    Guidance is statistically significant among students, the same does not hold for
    instructors. Table 3 presents the results of comparisons between the two groups.
    As shown in this table, the difference between the performances of students and
    instructors is not significant in the case of Descriptive Guidance. However, in
    Semi-prescriptive Guidance and Prescriptive Guidance modes, there is a significant
    difference between the two groups, which corroborates the previous observation
    that the magnitude of the impact of more advanced guidance modes depends on the
    background and experience level of participants. All instructors performed better
    in Semi-prescriptive Guidance mode, as shown in Table 3. This can be attributed
    to the fact that for more experienced operators it is more comfortable to have
    certain degrees of freedom in developing their compaction strategies, as shown
    in the previous research of the authors [96]. This aversion to blind compliance
    with automatically generated guidance can have a negative impact on ECR. Although
    the extent to which each participant complied with the planned trajectory was
    not calculated in this study, the significant difference in the performance of
    the instructors can only be explained by a degree of non-compliance in the instructors''
    group. This is because, in the case of Prescriptive Guidance, all students except
    one performed better than instructors. Table 3. Comparison of ECRs between students
    and instructors. Group Descriptive Guidance Semi-prescriptive Guidance Prescriptive

    = 0.023) Another interesting observation in the data is about the variation in
    the tendency of participants to over- and under-compact in different guidance
    modes. The analysis of the data, presented in Table 4, suggests that while there
    is no significant difference between OCR and UCR in Descriptive and Semi-prescriptive
    Guidance modes, participants gravitate towards over-compaction when Prescriptive
    Guidance is used. This is an expected pattern because as explained in Section
    3, the proposed trajectory planning method quite purposefully refrains from sacrificing
    the number of compaction passes for higher productivity and operators mostly try
    to ensure that the asphalt has received the required number of passes under any
    circumstances. The results confirm the functionality of this design philosophy.

    Discussion Considering the results of this research, a few significant points
    can be raised for discussion. The proposed method possesses a few unique characteristics
    when it is compared to earlier research work in the domain of roller trajectory
    planning [[66], [67], [68]]. First of all, because it is not developed as part
    of an autonomous system, it does not assume that the trajectory followed complies
    necessarily with the trajectory devised. Therefore, it offers a highly adaptive
    mechanism that periodically updates the trajectory in view of the work done. Second,
    it considers both the temperature and compaction pass count to determine which
    trajectory could offer better efficiency. This is a considerable advantage to
    existing work where the trajectory was planned either based on predetermined fixed
    parameters, operators'' manual inputs, or only the compaction pass count. In terms
    of validation, also, although the proposed method was tested in a VP platform,
    it actively included human operators in the loop. It is a considerable advantage
    to some similar work where the system was tested in a predominantly simulated
    environment [67,68]. The results presented in this research corroborate the authors''
    earlier findings concerning the comparison of descriptive and semi-descriptive
    OSSs [7]. While the authors did not test the prescriptive system in their previous
    work, the alignment between the findings observed in the VP platform and the real-world
    outcomes for the other two OSS modes provides a degree of confidence in the reliability
    of the VP-based findings reported in this study regarding the prescriptive system.
    It is evident that the proposed trajectory planning method, which is embedded
    in the Prescriptive Guidance mode, is capable of improving the compaction efficiency
    to a considerable degree while significantly reducing variability among the performances
    of different participants, i.e., compared to other modes of guidance. It is also
    demonstrated that the proposed method is quite successful in reducing under-compaction,
    which is commonly accountable for the lower-than-target density. This finding
    needs to be interpreted considering the limitations of VP-based platforms. However,
    the research brings to the fore, once again, the dilemma of automation (i.e.,
    level of control/guidance) [[98], [99], [100]]. On one hand, higher levels of
    control/guidance are expected to drastically reduce the problem of infobesity,
    i.e., through the provision of more processed and actionable guidance that requires
    less processing from the roller operators. On the other hand, lower levels of
    control/guidance are more favorable to technology-averse, i.e., experienced, operators
    who view technology as a threat to their job security and a strong de-professionalization
    agent/catalyst [18,[101], [102], [103]]. The negative attitude towards prescriptive
    systems, which normally manifests itself in the form of non-compliance, can limit,
    or even counter, the effect of the technology. The present research has shown
    quite clearly that even though prescriptive systems can safeguard more consistently
    higher operational quality for even inexperienced trainees, without an open mind
    to the technology transition, the effectiveness of the technology can be noticeably
    compromised. This highlights the significance of continuous on-the-job training
    and technology trust-building exercises for the contractors. Also, given that
    the prescriptive system is shown to resonate very well with the novice trainees,
    it is highly recommended to incorporate the use of these systems in the curriculum
    of compaction training not only to make sure that the future generation of roller
    operators is ready for the technology, i.e., when it becomes market-ready but
    also to create a strong push and demand for this technology from within the industry.
    On a similar note, and to further substantiate the previous discussion point,
    it should be stressed that the authors have already developed a functional physical
    prototype system for the prescriptive compaction guidance system and have tried
    to implement and test it on a number of actual paving projects, as shown in case
    study one. However, the efforts to objectively assess the effectiveness of the
    descriptive guidance on compaction efficiency have met with failure primarily
    because roller operators have consistently refused to follow the guidance of the
    prototype system. This is because, according to operators, they remain liable
    for the quality of the compaction in the eyes of their employers and improper
    compaction can entail heavy penalties. This renders operators very risk-averse
    and leaves them with a very small risk margin for experimentation with a prototype
    system. This problem was less severe and visible for more descriptive OSSs because
    these systems would not demand blind trust in and compliance with the technology
    [7]. Therefore, while for research purposes, the VP platform proved effective
    in addressing the issue of fair and consequence-free experimentation, the main
    risk in the technology''s further testing and even implementation, of the technology
    remains. Again, this underscores the importance of adapting legal and liability
    restrictions in form of new contractual frameworks that support technology development.
    With the short to mid-term horizon in mind, contractors and equipment manufacturers
    are advised to consider Semi-prescriptive Guidance seriously to tackle the problem
    of operational variability. As shown in this study as well as the previous research
    of the authors [7], priority mapping is capable of significantly improving compaction
    efficiency while appealing to the operators from a usability perspective. Yet,
    the authors strongly believe that this should be perceived as a short to mid-term
    solution before cultural and organizational transformations are made for the adoption
    of prescriptive systems. 7. Conclusions and future work Different types of heavy
    construction equipment (e.g., excavators and cranes) have long been benefiting
    from automated solutions that prescribe safety-and productivity-optimized guidance
    to the operators. Yet, OSSs for asphalt roller operators have remained largely
    descriptive, resulting in cognitive overload and, in turn, lower-than-expected
    contributions to the improved efficiency of compaction operations. This research
    presented a novel trajectory planning for asphalt compaction operation to address
    this gap. The proposed method leveraged an array of sensory data, which is common
    in descriptive OSSs, to plan a compaction trajectory that ensures (1) compaction
    efficiency, and (2) operational continuity. The method was first tested on a piece
    of actual equipment for feasibility. Then, a VP platform was used to implement
    the proposed method and conduct a comprehensive case study, where the performance
    of the Prescriptive Guidance was thoroughly compared to that of Semi-prescriptive
    and Descriptive Guidance. Although the method was tested only for straight stretches
    of road and more complex cases (e.g., roundabouts) were not tested, it can be
    posited that the results of case studies, within the limited bound of certainty
    a VP-based validation can offer, suggest that the proposed Prescriptive Guidance
    method can significantly improve compaction efficiency and reduce variability
    in the performance of operators (i.e., all operators with different levels of
    experience delivered very comparable compaction efficiency). Please note that
    this should be perceived as an early indication of the proposed method''s potential
    and more rigorous testing in more realistic conditions and for different kinds
    of paving projects (e.g., roundabouts and curved roads) is advised to achieve
    higher statistical significance. However, it is shown that the impact of the Prescriptive
    Guidance on the efficiency of the compaction operation is correlated with the
    experience level of the operators. While novice learners performed considerably
    better when Prescriptive Guidance was used, instructors performed better using
    Semi-prescriptive Guidance. The authors hypothesize that this is attributable
    to the propensity of skilled operators to primarily base their compaction strategy
    on their experiential base and to ignore guidance that requires blind compliance.
    It can be concluded that while Descriptive Guidance can improve compaction operations,
    a (long) transition period is required to be able to build trust in asphalt compaction
    OSSs and address the liability issues surrounding the use of systems that require
    compliance. The main contribution of the present work is the development of a
    novel approach to compaction trajectory planning that can constitute Prescriptive
    Guidance in asphalt compaction OSSs. To the best of authors, this is the first
    research work that tried to push the boundaries of asphalt compaction OSSs into
    the realm of prescriptive guidance while accounting for the relationship between
    compaction efficiency, compaction effort, and asphalt temperature window. Besides,
    the present research provides a unique insight into the intricate interplay between
    the experience level of the operators and the effectiveness of OSSs. In the future,
    more rigorous testing on actual construction sites will certainly help in building
    trust in compaction Prescriptive Guidance OSSs. Additionally, the number of participants
    in the second case study was low. Further testing of the system with more participants
    would lend more credibility to the research findings. The proposed trajectory
    planning can be further extended to become compatible with multi-phase compaction
    operations as well as operations where multiple teams of rollers are needed. Another
    important direction for future work would be to build a data-driven model that
    can correlate compaction efficiency and ambient condition with the density progression
    of the asphalt. Such a model can substitute compaction efficiency-based trajectory
    planning for density-oriented planning. Given that achieving the target density
    is the ultimate goal of compaction processes, this approach can have a more tangible
    impact on the quality of the work. As for the VP-based platform, given the success
    of the tool in this study and beyond, the authors are planning to further improve
    the platform by focusing on a more realistic asphalt physics model. The enhanced
    realism of the platform can improve the engagement of the user with the tool,
    leading to more focused attention on the task at hand. Finally, as mentioned in
    Section 2, while the proposed method is looking at the compaction primarily from
    a compaction efficiency point of view, integration of other dimensions such as
    safety can be considered in the future. Declaration of Competing Interest The
    authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
    relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this
    paper. Data availability Data will be made available on request. References [1]

  description: Offsite construction, also known as industrialized/prefabricated construction,
    is an alternative approach to delivering construction projects, compared to the
    on-site stick-built/built-on-site construction approach. Today's offsite construction
    processes often use technology systems (e.g., digital design tools and automated
    machinery) to increase productivity and improve product quality. These systems
    operate collectively and rely on information generated in different operating
    environments. Therefore, information interoperability is critical to achieving
    overall construction efficiency and economics. This creates a need to study the
    impacts of information loss and transfer due to information interoperability,
    specifically for offsite construction processes. Given this, the paper uses a
    qualitative (case study) approach to document the offsite construction processes
    and the information requirements for each process. The efforts spent on information

    known as industrialized/prefabricated construction, is an alternative approach
    to delivering construction projects, compared to the on-site stick-built/built-on-site
    construction approach. Today’s offsite construction processes often use technology
    systems (e.g., digital design tools and automated machinery) to increase productivity
    and improve product quality. These systems operate collectively and rely on information
    generated in different operating environments. Therefore, information interoperability
    is critical to achieving overall construction efficiency and economics. This creates
    a need to study the impacts of information loss and transfer due to information

    Applications This research proposes some practical implications specifically for
    the offsite construction industry that intends to adopt new technology systems
    and/or evaluate the efficiency of information handling in their existing practice,
    through a case study. For example, offsite construction firms can develop their
    own evaluation metrics to assess the information loss and transfer before investing
    in new technology systems, by following a similar approach to this case study.
    This may include comparing different technology systems from the perspective of
    return on investment. The approach can also be used to evaluate existing technology
    systems and set a baseline/benchmark. This will help management to understand
    the potential losses in effort due to poor information interoperability and set
    targets for enhancing these systems. Lastly, the proposed phases of technology
    adoption and strategies can help the offsite construction industry to set targets
    for progressive technology transformation and serve as a reference for setting
    expectations from a business perspective. It also helps the company to identify
    the required talents and know-how in the technology transformation process. Introduction
    Offsite construction, which is also referred to as industrialized/prefabricated
    construction, offers an alternative approach to the traditional stick-built construction
    method. With this approach, construction components like wall panels and volumetric
    modules are prefabricated in controlled indoor environment (e.g., production line),
    and shipped to the site for installation. This allows overlapping of on-site and
    offsite construction tasks and creates economics of scale in production, thereby
    shortening the on-site construction schedule and reducing the overall project
    budget. Additionally, it can help to address local labor and resource shortages
    by manufacturing building components at resourceful locations and installing them
    in resource-limited sites. The offsite construction products are categorized by
    material (wood, concrete, steel, and others) and the complexity of the prefabrication
    (2D panels, 3D volumetric, and special-purpose construction items like industrial
    vessels). Fig. 1 provides an example of a wood wall panel production and on-site
    construction installation. Fig. 1. Examples of wood wall panel production and
    on-site installation: (a) wood panel production; and (b) installation of pre-assembled
    wood roof component. Offsite construction involves not only the production of
    construction products, but also the underlying construction processes. A typical
    offsite construction project includes project procurement, design, manufacturing,
    shipping, and on-site installation. Given that these processes occur in a controlled
    environment, technology systems can be leveraged to enhance productivity and efficiency.
    Despite the numerous technology systems employed in offsite construction, they
    can be broadly classified into two categories: digitalization and automation (hereinafter
    referred to as “D&A”): (1) digitalization (virtual space) refers to the use of
    digital technologies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the offsite
    construction processes. This include the use of Building Information Modeling
    (BIM) (Darko et al. 2020; Yin et al. 2019), virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR),
    decision support systems, and other digital tools to design, plan, and coordinate
    the offsite construction (Almashaqbeh and El-Rayes 2022; Gan 2022; Rausch et al.
    2017); and (2) automation (physical space) involves the use of robotics and other
    automated machinery to perform tasks that are traditionally performed manually
    (Martinez et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2022). In offsite construction, automation can
    be leveraged to aid in the manufacturing of building components, such as walls,
    floors, and modules, with improved precision and speed, as compared to manual
    processes. Through the incorporation of sensors, automation systems can be used
    for material and inventory tracking, quality control, and ultimately reducing
    human involvement in the management process, thereby maximizing the efficiency
    and safety. The authors have compiled a summary of definitions of D&A in offsite
    construction, which are presented in Table 1. Table 1. Definitions of digitalization
    and automation (D&A) Definitions Examples Digitalization Databases, data-based
    decision support systems, Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Virtual Design
    and Construction (VDC), project management platforms Automation Robotics, Internet-of-things
    (IoT), sensors, machinery The majority of D&A systems involve data generation
    and exchange, whereby data is taken in as inputs at a given process, and new data
    is generated as outputs for the subsequent system. For example, during the project
    procurement process, a unique project ID is generated as a unique identifier for
    downstream systems to recognize and properly associate with the project. Another
    example involves the design of offsite construction projects, which commonly utilizes
    computer-aided design (CAD) to generate design shop drawings for manufacturing.
    These data, existing within a virtual space, are closely intertwined with the
    physical space of machines and people. Specifically, workers rely on shop drawings
    to comprehend the designs and produce the offsite construction component, while
    machines utilize computer numerical control (CNC) programming language to initiate
    actions and complete tasks. The evolution of technology in both virtual and physical
    spaces has led to an increase in productivity, quality, and safety in the offsite
    construction industry, similar to the changes that occurred in the manufacturing
    industry (e.g., Industry 4.0 and digital twin). Furthermore, the technology systems
    are often viewed as capital investments for offsite construction companies, and
    understanding the information sharing among these systems is critical from a business
    decision-making perspective. One challenge of integrating different technology
    systems is the interoperability of information, as technology systems are typically
    supplied by various vendors with different file formats. Another factor contributing
    to this challenge is that the generated information is managed by different project
    stakeholders, leading to poor interoperability among different technology systems
    and information loss among processes. For instance, the architectural and structural
    design model must be converted to production-ready models such as shop drawings
    and CNC code for machinery to use in production. This conversion process often
    requires the offsite construction companies to devote effort in the Building Information
    Modeling (BIM) environment to add more details to the original designs, which
    is reflected as an increase in the Level of Details (LODs) in the BIM environment
    or an increase in refinement in the modeling process. Additionally, some of the
    original design models provided by engineering firms may not allow offsite construction
    companies to directly tailor their designs to the needs of manufacturability.
    In these cases, offsite manufacturers would need to remodel the entire project
    in their own BIM environment to prepare it for manufacturability. Furthermore,
    if the software utilized for generating shop drawings is deficient in functionality,
    such as lacking structural analysis capabilities, the offsite construction companies
    may have to produce models using structural analysis software to meet that requirement.
    This iterative process of creating and modifying models can become laborious,
    resulting in an increase in efforts expended for offsite construction operations.
    Whilst the issue of information interoperability has been studied in the construction
    digital technology domain, such as with BIM (Wu et al. 2019, 2020), there is currently
    a dearth of research on the impacts of interoperability on information loss and
    transfer within offsite construction processes. This gap in knowledge has led
    to the research problem addressed in this study: how does interoperability of
    various D&A systems affect the economic performance of offsite construction processes?
    To address this problem, this study employs a qualitative (case study) and quantitative
    (Monte Carlo simulation) approach to quantify the impacts of information loss
    and transfer due to interoperability issues in D&A systems. This study contributes
    to the body of knowledge by: (1) documenting the information requirements of a
    wood panelized construction company and the technology systems involved as an
    example of practical application; (2) using a case study approach to demonstrate
    the process of documenting information efficiency due to information interoperability
    in offsite construction; (3) developing a Monte Carlo-simulation-based method
    that can be applied generically to other offsite construction companies to assess
    the information loss and transfer impacts, as well as to provide strategies for
    offsite construction companies to adopt D&A systems. Literature Review Off-Site
    and Industrialized Construction Offsite construction, also known as prefabricated
    or industrialized construction, represents an alternative construction approach
    to the traditional stick-built construction approach that aims to shorten project
    schedules and reduce construction costs (Razkenari et al. 2020). In an offsite
    construction context, the projects are subdivided into smaller units (e.g., panels,
    modules, etc.) that are prefabricated in a controlled offsite environment (e.g.,
    factory) and transported to the construction site for installation. Technology
    has become a fundamental component in offsite construction, playing a crucial
    role in improving productivity, safety, and quality. Current practices in the
    offsite construction industry range from manual-driven production to fully automated
    machine-aided production systems (Altaf et al. 2018). Robotics have demonstrated
    significant value in prototyping automated production systems (Bodea et al. 2021;
    Kasperzyk et al. 2017; Yang and Kang 2021). Emerging technologies, such as Internet
    of things (IoT), are also being utilized to increase the trackability and traceability
    of the products in supply chain management (Ho et al. 2022; Li and Mao 2017).
    In terms of offsite construction products, their complexity or degree of modularization
    dictates the composition of the product and production processes, such as 2D panel
    and 3D volumetric modules. In North America, wood and light gauge steel (LGS)
    are primarily used in residential projects (e.g., single-, and multi-family projects)
    (An et al. 2020), while precast concrete and steel structure are often employed
    in commercial, infrastructure, and heavy industry projects (Benjaoran and Dawood
    2006; Lee et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2018). Past research on offsite construction
    research can be categorized into the following types: (1) overall benchmarking
    of offsite construction industry (e.g., benefits, challenges, etc.) and case studies
    (Hosseini et al. 2018; Kamali and Hewage 2016; Razkenari et al. 2020); (2) digital
    technology to aid design and manufacturing in offsite construction; (3) decision
    support systems utilizing algorithmic methods for offsite construction planning;
    and (4) automation using robotic and sensor technologies to accelerate production
    processes and increase management situational awareness. These past efforts are
    further discussed in sections “Digitalization in Off-site Construction” and “Automation
    in Off-site Construction,” respectively, from the digitalization and automation
    aspects. Section “Interoperability of BIM and Related Technologies” will focus
    on the review of work for the interoperability of BIM and related technologies,
    which helps to address the research gap between past work and this paper and highlights
    the research contributions. Digitalization in Off-Site Construction Digital technologies
    play a crucial role in offsite construction, starting from the design process
    and extending to the entire supply chain. Similar to the manufacturing industry,
    the design process for offsite construction often follows a design for manufacture
    and assembly (DfMA) approach. In this approach, the project is conceptualized
    into a virtual model that is broken down into pieces and packages with design
    details, i.e., shop drawings or machine languages (Bakhshi et al. 2022; Gbadamosi
    et al. 2020). BIM is commonly used in the industry today as a repository for design
    information (An et al. 2020; Bakhshi et al. 2022; Jang and Lee 2018). However,
    as traditional BIM software is designed for general construction projects, such
    as Autodesk Revit, separate Application Programming Interface (API) or third-party
    software is often used to generate shop drawings in offsite construction. Similarly,
    for production involving machines that require machine language to process design
    information, the computer-aided design (CAD) is integrated with a computer-aided
    manufacturing (CAM) component to generate machine language files for production.
    It should be noted that the detailing process, compared to the traditional engineering
    design, requires additional efforts that can be an extra burden on the design
    process. To address this, research efforts have been made to incorporate automation
    in design for offsite construction, for example, through algorithm-based computer
    applications. Recent efforts have uncovered the potential of using computational
    and generative design approaches to shorten offsite construction design turnaround
    cycles (Gan 2022; Wei et al. 2022). For on-site installation and coordination,
    the BIM model is also useful in simulating the installation sequence, analyzing
    the crane locations, and enhancing constructability (Han et al. 2021; Lei et al.
    2013, 2015; Wei et al. 2022). Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
    are also helpful for end users to understand the installation process, for example,
    a Unity game engine prototype was developed to simulate modular construction (Sydora
    et al. 2021). Another research area of digitalization in offsite construction
    is to use data analytics to facilitate decision-making. Specifically, this approach
    is focused on determining and optimizing the installation sequence, resource allocation,
    and savings (Altaf et al. 2018; Benjaoran and Dawood 2006; Yang et al. 2022).
    The foundation of these decisions is based on the collection and analysis of data
    related to various aspects of offsite construction, including productivity, quality,
    and safety. This data can be collected manually or through the use of sensors
    such as radio frequency identification (RFID) and other IoT applications (Altaf
    et al. 2018; Mohsen et al. 2022; Zhai et al. 2019). These collected data are usually
    stored in a database environment, where it can be processed by decision making
    mechanisms and algorithms. For example, simulation (e.g., discrete-event simulation)
    is a common approach used for decision-making that analyzes the performance of
    modular construction operations such as resource utilization (ElNimr et al. 2016;
    Goh and Goh 2019). Another commonly used approach for processing collected data
    for decision making is optimization algorithms. These algorithms use objective
    functions with constraints to optimize the offsite construction scenarios Automation
    in Off-Site Construction With the advent of digitalization, automation has emerged
    as a key driver to increase productivity and efficiency in offsite construction
    by reducing human efforts. By adopting certain degrees of automation, construction
    firms can overcome labor shortage and boost their production capabilities (Saad
    et al. 2021). In the current offsite construction market, there are various levels
    of automation applications in industry, ranging from manual assembly processes
    to robotic or fully automated productions. For example, HOMAG WEINMANN and RANDEK
    products are two examples in manufacturing robotic production systems for wood
    and light gauge steel panel production (Randek Machines, Arvika, Sweden; WEINMANN
    Machines, HOMAG, Schopfloch, Germany). Their systems are close to fully automated
    production systems where minimum human components are needed for production, while
    Triad Machines specializes in machines for panel production in wood and LGS in
    a semi-automatic/manual manner (Triad Machines, Alda, Nebraska). Efforts have
    also been made in the research space to explore new frontiers of automation, such
    as utilizing robotics to accomplish complex prefabricated construction tasks (Kasperzyk
    et al. 2017; Pan et al. 2022). Additive manufacturing has been used to uncover
    the potential of alternatively producing offsite construction components, such
    as 3D printing (Anton et al. 2021; Tošić et al. 2022). This research has shown
    that machinery can assist with offsite construction and is able to complete complicated
    tasks, in conjunction with digital design tools and algorithms. For instance,
    integrating IoT and BIM technologies with machinery are other areas of research
    for improving production quality and efficiency: a vision-based approach is proposed
    to automatically track the progress of panel production using closed-circuit television
    (CCTV) (Martinez et al. 2021); BIM modeling was used to check machine capability
    for production in offsite construction (An et al. 2020); 3D scanning was used
    to capture an as-built model to compare with an as-designed model to check production
    tolerances (Rausch et al. 2019). Overall, offsite construction has greatly benefitted
    from the development of technologies in the areas of digitalization and automation:
    (1) improving design efficiency using BIM-based design tools (Gan 2022; Gbadamosi
    et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2020); (2) enhancing decision-making
    in offsite construction using data analytics and algorithms (Gbadamosi et al.
    2020; Lee et al. 2022; Wong Chong and Zhang 2021; Yang et al. 2022); and (3) boosting
    production efficiency using automation (Kasperzyk et al. 2017; Martinez et al.
    2021; Tošić et al. 2022; Wagner et al. 2020). However, the interoperability of
    different technology systems in offsite construction has rarely been studied,
    which highlights the need for further research in this area. In the section “Interoperability
    of BIM and Related Technologies,” the importance of interoperability will be further
    discussed to address this research gap. Interoperability of BIM and Related Technologies
    Compared to the manufacturing industry, the construction industry is characterized
    by products of larger volume, longer development cycles, and relatively greater
    investment. As a result, collaboration among different project stakeholders is
    necessary (Cheng et al. 2023). Proper information exchange and integration are
    fundamental needs of the construction industry (Ramaji and Memari 2015). The effectiveness
    of data sharing during cooperation among fragmented participants is the determining
    factor affecting the productivity and efficiency. With the increasing adoption
    of BIM in the construction industry, project-related details are stored in the
    object-oriented models (Shoieb et al. 2020), and the data sharing in the offsite
    construction industry is predominantly BIM-driven. Eastman et al. (2010) identified
    the major challenges to the advancement of BIM, which are associated with export
    and import functions for the same data, which is referred to as interoperability.
    The IEEE defines interoperability as “the ability of two or more systems or components
    to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged” (de
    Gaetani et al. 2020). Currently, BIM technologies for specific needs and disciplines
    are flourishing, bringing with them different types of software packages, file
    formats, and extensions. While these technologies can enhance working capabilities
    and efficiency within their scope of work, the diversity of file formats leads
    to poor interoperability among BIM systems. Shoieb et al. (2020) conducted the
    interoperability test by importing and exporting among 15 mainstream BIM software
    using the same model case. They found that without prior processing, geometry,
    materials, coordinates, and other model-related parameter information were unreadable
    or incorrect to varying degrees during the transfer process. In addition, Gaetani
    et al. (2020) conducted the interoperability test from a project management perspective,
    which showed that, in addition to interoperability issues related to geometric
    properties information, transferring project management data among different software
    systems also has defects. According to a study by Wang et al. (2023), software
    and data technology issues were identified as barriers to data sharing, based
    on expert interviews and an online survey. NIST, RTI International, and Logistic
    Management Institute found that inadequate interoperability in the US capital
    facilities industry resulted in approximately $15.8 billion in extra costs per
    year (Gallaher et al. 2004). The studies indicated that this extra/duplicated
    work resulting from inadequate-interoperability-related is the main reason for
    the inefficiencies. To quantify the impact of interoperability, Autodesk developed
    a calculation model to reveal the first-year return on investment (ROI) of BIM
    products applied to design activities. The variables for calculation include cost
    of hardware and software, training time, productivity before and after training,
    and monthly labor cost (Salih 2012). The first four variables are hardware/software-related,
    and the last variable, monthly labor cost, can be calculated by manhours multiplied
    by salary. Therefore, when focusing on one specific hardware/software, the reduction
    of manhours caused by its interoperability improvement is the determining factor
    for increasing ROI. Offsite construction is a market niche that combines both
    construction and manufacturing techniques (Ramaji and Memari 2015). The concept
    of DfMA has gained momentum in this heterogeneous industry (Gao et al. 2020) to
    simplify the overall manufacturing and assembly process by pre-considering component
    or module design. This approach extends BIM-based design throughout the entire
    project lifecycle to minimize waste and reduce resources. In the actual production
    process, the operators and their locations involved in these three tasks (design,
    manufacturing and assembly) are fragmented. Therefore, offsite construction projects
    require a high degree of information accuracy, completeness, and integration,
    which essentially demand high interoperability of BIM (Cheng et al. 2023). Shoieb
    et al. (2020) pointed out that the lack of interoperability among BIM-based applications
    is mainly due to inconsistent semantic representation among applications. Industry
    foundation classes (IFCs) is a method introduced to standardize BIM, described
    as “a standardized, digital description of the built environment, including buildings
    and civil infrastructure” (Gaetani et al. 2020). Objects defined in the IFC data
    model allow the sharing of intelligent information included in BIM (Grilo and
    Jardim-Goncalves 2010). Bai et al. (2021) built an IFC-based BIM library for the
    design of prefabricated structures. They introduced IFC data as the underlying
    data to extend IFCs by using semantic and geometric elements, thereby improving
    information transfer among systems and interoperability. Jiang et al. (2020) also
    introduced IFC format to establish a standardized methodology of information delivery
    to capture and specify the processes and information flow during the whole lifecycle
    of prefabricated projects. However, the original purpose of DfMA can only be achieved
    if manufacturing and assembly comply with the design requirement and can provide
    feedback to achieve real-time synchronization and modification of the design plan
    (Sun and Kim 2022). IoT is an advanced digital technology to enhance the flow
    of information along the supply chains of offsite construction businesses. It
    creates a digital interconnected environment that provides seamless integration
    between design and the supply chains of offsite construction businesses (Kazmi
    and Sodangi 2022). Wu et al. (2022), Xu et al. (2018), Zhao et al. (2022), and
    Zhong et al. (2017) have all combined IoT with BIM technologies to enhance the
    interoperability of BIM in offsite construction and reduce extra manhours and
    potential risks associated with information exchange. Meanwhile, poor interoperability
    can lead to difficulties in data sharing, limit collaboration, hinder the workflow,
    and adversely affect productivity (de Gaetani et al. 2020; Grilo and Jardim-Goncalves
    2010; Shoieb et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2023; Wu et al. 2020). As a result, it has
    become a relevant research area and industry consensus. Most of the existing research
    in construction management has focused on interoperability itself, i.e., ways
    to realize better data-sharing, productivity, and efficiency gains, rather than
    quantifying the impacts of interoperability. Furthermore, there has been a lack
    of studies focusing specifically on interoperability in offsite construction.
    The aim of this paper is to fill the gap by quantifying interoperability influence
    of interoperability in the offsite construction industry, specifically in two
    areas: (1) information transfer impact, which refers to difficulties in data transfer
    between different formats due to poor compatibility, such as additional effort
    required for conversion, maintenance, verification, recreation or reinput of data
    (Gaetani et al. 2020); and (2) information loss impact, which occurs when the
    receiving application is unable to interpret the design intent, and the original
    shape composition (Venugopal et al. 2012), for example, inconsistent and incompatible
    semantic and geometric representation of data (Shoieb et al. 2020). Proposed Methodology
    Fig. 2 illustrates the case study methodology used to measure the impacts of information
    loss and transfer impacts resulting from insufficient interoperability. The authors
    conducted interviews with representatives from an offsite construction company
    to collect qualitative data such as production processes and D&A systems, along
    with quantitative data such as historical production data and manhours required
    for specific work tasks. Following that, a qualitative analysis was performed
    to: (1) develop a model to simulate the impact of information loss/transfer with
    manhours, and (2) map D&A to the actual process and analyze the information loss/transfer
    impact (type, effort, and cause) that occurred at each step. Finally, an information
    loss/transfer impact (ILTI) model using Monte Carlo simulation was developed to
    quantify the impacts. This model was used to obtain the manhours spent/month/project
    due to poor interoperability. Fig. 2. Proposed methodology. Case Study Methodology–D&A
    Roadmap This research falls under the category of descriptive case study research,
    with an objective of using qualitative research methods to capture the D&A workflow
    from the perspective of an industry partner (Tellis 1997). The industry partner
    is located at Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and specializes in the production of wood
    single- and multi-family building panels. The authors adopted a phased approach
    to conduct interviews with the company’s representatives to understand their current
    practices: (1) Phase 1: the key steps involved in the company’s daily production
    were identified, resulting in the identification of six steps: sales/procurement,
    design/planning, manufacturing, shipping, on-site construction, and post-construction;
    (2) Phase 2: the D&A systems used in these identified six steps were captured
    through interviews and mapped to each step; (3) Phase 3: assumptions and data
    were collected with regard to resources for the information loss/transfer impact
    calculations for a given period of production time; and (4) Phase 4: the findings
    were shared with the company to obtain feedback and the study was concluded with
    a future D&A roadmap. While this case study is conducted based on a North American
    wood panel offsite construction company, the knowledge gained and approach applied
    have broader applicability to the offsite construction industry. For example,
    this approach can be used to capture the D&A roadmap for a given offsite construction
    company and quantify the potential losses in efforts due to poor information interoperability
    and set expectations for D&A system improvements. Information Loss/Transfer Impact
    Modeling Using a qualitative analysis approach, this research constructs a D&A
    map to illustrate the cradle-to-grave operation processes of an offsite construction
    company, along with technology systems used for each process. The interoperability
    of these systems is primarily reflected in the number of manhours taken, which
    serves as the variable used to calculate cost and schedule. To measure the loss
    incurred, this paper defines manhour as the unit of analysis. This is further
    divided into two components: (1) manhours spent among systems impacted by transfer
    due to system incompatibility; and (2) manhours spent among systems to recreate
    data due to information loss from preceding systems. The ILTI model is developed
    to capture the total impacts resulting from the information loss and transfer
    in the D&A map. The information in the D&A map is identified as the data or information
    needed to complete the offsite construction production, such as design shop drawing
    made by the draftsmen, the bill-of-material from the BIM model extracted for material
    purchase. The efficiency or inefficiency of the D&A process is determined by the
    utilization of this information. For instance, re-entering data from one system
    to another can lead to a decrease in efficiency, and there is also a probability
    of information loss between systems due to human error. The utilization of information
    is determined by the existence of data transfer mechanism between systems and
    their degree of automation in data transfer, such as data export and import formats,
    and/or database integration. The ILTI model is developed to capture the effort
    spent by users to transfer/recreate data among various systems in the D&A map,
    with manhours serving as the key measurement unit, which reflects the efforts
    expended. The total ILTI value is calculated using Eq. (1) I L T I = ∑ i = 0 n
    h r i + ∑ j = 0 m h r j (1) where I L T I = the value of information loss/transfer
    impact; h r i = manhours spent between system i and its subsequent system i +
    1 for data transfer (the h r i = 0 when i = n ); and h r j = manhours spent within
    system j to recreate data due to data transfer loss from preceding systems. Monte
    Carlo simulation is a technique that employs random variables drawn from a specific
    distribution to obtain numerical results. In this study, the Monte Carlo simulation
    is utilized to sample values for h r i and h r j in Eq. (1). The Monte Carlo simulation
    involves sampling from a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). Specifically,
    the manhours resulting from information loss and transfer impact in a D&A system
    follow a uniform distribution U ( a , b ) , where a and b are the lower and upper
    bounds of the distribution, respectively. The probability of a given value failing
    within the interval ( a , b ) can be expressed as in Eq. (2), and the CDF is defined
    as the integral of its Probability Density Function (PDF), as shown in Eq. (3).
    A random number between (0, 1) is generated to invert the probability and obtain
    the sampled x ′ , using the inverse CDF function is x ′ = F − 1 [ U ( a , b )
    ] , where x ′ can be the manhour values for Eq. (1). Other types of distributions
    can used for analysis, but it may require larger data sets to define the distribution.
    For this study, the authors based the analysis on the interview results with the
    company’s practitioners and assumed that the values follow uniform distributions
    p ( x ) = 1 b − a , a ≤ x ≤ b (2) P ( x ) = ∫ a x x − a b − a (3) where p ( x
    ) = the probability of a given value x between ( a , b ) ; and P ( x ) = probability
    of sample values ≤ x in PDF. Case Study The case study examines a medium-size
    Canadian wood panel production company (approximately 150 employees) located in
    Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, whose primary market is wood residential construction
    for single- and multi-family housing. To gather data for the case study, the authors
    conducted interviews with the company’s practitioners to gain insights into the
    current workflow from the D&A perspectives. To protect the confidentiality of
    technology systems used by the company, the exact system names are anonymized
    in this study using antonomasia, such as “Production system 1” and “software 1.”
    The primary objective of the case study is to provide an overview of the D&A map’s
    overall structure, which serves as a foundation for developing an information
    loss model to capture the information transfer and losses among various systems
    and drawing conclusions of the future D&A roadmap. Fig. 3 shows the general process
    of the company’s factory production processes. The machines used in the factory
    are HOMAG WEINMANN, known for their high degree of automation (WEINMANN Machines,
    HOMAG, Schopfloch, Germany). Fig. 3. Production processes in offsite construction.
    Fig. 4 depicts the key steps of the D&A map, comprising six steps in the offsite
    construction, namely sales/procurement, design/planning, manufacturing, shipping,
    on-site construction, and post-construction. The inclusion of sales/procurement
    in this D&A map is justified by the fact that this process generates information,
    including project basic information, which is subsequently utilized by downstream
    D&A systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. These six steps
    allow for the identification of both D&A components. Although the process is defined
    in the context of North American wood residential panel construction, the workflow
    steps can be defined similarly in other types of offsite construction scenarios.
    After defining the workflow, the authors proceeded to identify the D&A software
    and hardware used along with their purposes, as represented by blue cloud symbols
    for digitalization systems and orange cloud symbols for automation system in Fig.
    5. The D&A systems are summarized in Table 2. For example, DS–1 (P1) refers to
    Design System–1, with Purpose 1 (BOM Take-off/Estimating) in Table 2, as shown
    in the mapping between system name and purpose of the system in Table 2 and Fig.

    Off-the-shelf Wall Panels Handling (P18) Automation RFID–1 (Radio-Frequency Identification–1)
    Off-the-shelf Production Tracking (P19) In terms of D&A systems, the majority
    of the technologies used by the company are off-the-shelf solutions that have
    been directly implemented. However, an in-house ERP system (ERP–2 in Table 2)
    has also been developed by the company. The rationale for the development of this
    system is related to the unique nature of the offsite construction product. While
    the ERP–1 off-the-shelf technology was developed for the manufacturing industry,
    where identical products are produced in most scenarios, in offsite construction,
    the products vary, with each residential house being different in design. As such,
    the ERP–1 cannot fully meet the exact requirements of the company’s operations.
    The in-house developed ERP–2 system also handles many company-specific management
    tasks, such as job costing. Additionally, there are two design systems utilized
    in the process (DS–1 and DS–2), each with distinct functionalities that cannot
    be fully addressed by the other. For example, while DS–1 is primarily designed
    for roof truss manufacturers and can perform structural design (roof and floor
    design), DS–2 is specifically designed to convert the shop drawings to machine
    files that are required for production. However, DS–1 lacks the functionality
    to generate the machine files. The implementation of off-the-shelf solutions has
    resulted in disconnections among the various systems, and data duplications often
    occur due to the decentralized database structures in which each solution has
    its own database. Results To quantitatively demonstrate the impact of interoperability
    of D&A systems, historical project data was collected from the company that consists
    of the production and on-site sq ft for both wall and floor components for a given
    period of time. The data structure includes the job name, job type (e.g., duplex,
    townhome, etc.), production and on-site lifting productivity (e.g., square feet/sq.
    ft of wall produced in the factory per day), as well as time information (date
    of completion for jobs). The company produces a variety of job types, including
    single-family housing [e.g., bungalow, duplex, residential small lot (RSL) zone,
    and planned lot residential (RPL) zone, etc.]. These job types differ in terms
    of production size (e.g., wall and floor sq ft). The average size of the job is
    2,188 sq ft, based on which the monthly job completion is shown in Fig. 6 (from
    June 2016 to August 2022). All jobs are completed using a panelized offsite construction
    approach. The minimum jobs completed per month is four and the maximum is 59 jobs
    with an average of job completion of 31 jobs. Fig. 6. Job count per month. To
    assess the impacts of information transfer and loss on the performance of D&A
    systems, a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using uniform distributions to
    randomly sample a value within the given effort value range. The software package
    @Risk was used to implement the simulation (Lumivero, Raleigh, North Carolina).
    Data inputs for the simulation model were obtained through interviews with the
    company to evaluate the effects of data transfer and losses among D&A systems
    (see Table 2). The five types of time efforts identified during the interviews
    are summarized in Table 3. One example is the recreation of the BIM model for
    generating machine files that are compatible with WEINMANN machines (DS-2). Moreover,
    data exchanges occurred between ERP-1 and ERP-2 due to differences in their respective
    databases. For each type of effort identified in Table 3, a corresponding value
    of effort [i.e.,  h r i and h r j in Eq. (1)] was obtained. For instance, recreating
    the BIM model typically requires 3–6 h per job. Assuming that the effort values
    follow a uniform distribution, the re-creation of the BIM model can be represented
    as x ′ = F − 1 [ U ( a , b ) ] = a + ( b − a ) u , where a and b = lower and upper
    bounds, 3 and 6 h, respectively, and u = random variable generated between [0,
    1]. This approach enabled the computation of the total value of efforts per month
    based on the job count in Fig. 6. Appendix I presents a sample breakdown of one
    iteration of simulation results of the total value of time efforts monthly, while
    Appendix II summarizes the output statistics from a 1,000-iteration simulation.

    data from ERP-2 for procurement purposes Fig. 7 illustrates the total hours (efforts)
    from the Monte Carlo simulation, using an average of 31 jobs completed per month.
    The simulation indicates that 310 h of efforts are spent on data transfer and
    loss. This implies that, on average, the company expends 310 h [with a range of
    253 h (5% percentile) and 367.8 h (95% percentile)] on transferring data among
    the D&A systems, which adds little or no value to the overall operations of the
    company. By summing up the monthly results, the total effort for the given time
    period can be obtained as ∑ i = 1 n I L T I i , where I L T I i is the monthly
    value of information loss/transfer impact at the month of i . Fig. 8 presents
    the total lost effort in hours for the given data spanning from June 2016 to August
    2022. The mean lost effort is 23,519.87 h [with a range of 19,435 h (5% percentile)
    to 27,667 h (95% percentile)]. Fig. 7. Total hours (effort) spent in data transfer
    and losses—average month. Fig. 8. Total hours (effort) spent in data transfer
    and losses—entire time period. The simulation results reveal that the company’s
    D&A systems suffer from losses due to information interoperability. The primary
    causes of these issues are twofold: (1) off-the-shelf technologies are challenging
    to integrate, such as BIM software without open Application Programming Interfaces
    (APIs); and (2) customized technologies developed internally can help the company
    overcome interoperability issues to some extent, but the company’s limited research
    and development budget constrains such efforts. To improve productivity and efficiency,
    the company can invest in research and development projects. However, the company
    must accept that some innovations may not offer immediate returns on investment.
    In conclusion, the case study recommends that the company considers the following
    perspectives when implementing D&A systems: (1) adopting a centralized database
    approach to integrate different data systems and prevent unnecessary data transfers,
    and (2) adopting a DfMA approach to enable the customization of BIM software through
    open APIs, allowing for direct exportation of data into machine files and linking
    with the centralized database. However, this leads to different practical scenarios
    for different offsite construction companies varying in sizes and stages in implementation.
    For instance, small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) may start off with constraints
    from a budgetary perspective to customize technological solutions to achieve a
    high degree of automation but can benefit from off-the-shelf technologies in the
    near term. As they grow in size, like the company of this case study, challenges
    of interoperability emerge and signs of inefficiencies occur. Naturally, the company
    would seek for customized solutions in two possible alternatives of (1) having
    an in-house development team to support the customization, of which expenses are
    considered overhead, and (2) having external development partners such as technology
    vendors and academic institutions. The formal alternative is sort of a long-term
    play for the offsite construction companies, with benefits of technology innovation
    and continuous internal improvements, but it requires these companies to remain
    profitable to support the effort and retain the know-how. However, traditionally,
    the construction industry is cyclic, thereby requiring companies to be nimble
    in business to be competitive and innovative. The second alternative for offsite
    construction companies seeking customized solutions involves establishing strategic
    partnerships with external entities. However, to successfully pursue this option,
    it is crucial to first establish trust between the internal and external parties.
    Additionally, support systems must be put in place to ensure that any developed
    technology innovations can be effectively implemented and utilized. Based on the
    above discussion, the authors have summarized the findings in Fig. 9, which illustrates
    a three-stage process for D&A system automation and integration in the offsite
    construction firms. The first stage, on the left-hand side, represents the early
    phase of the D&A system integration where off-the-shelf technologies are commonly
    used; as the size of the company increases, more resources can be allocated towards
    the development of the D&A system integration. For instance, the company of this
    case study has hired a team of research-based employees over the years to develop
    customized solutions, e.g., databases, decision support systems, and so on. Furthermore,
    the company has also established ongoing research collaborations with local universities
    to support R&D development externally. Section “Conclusions and Future Work” will
    provide conclusions and suggestions for future D&A system development. Fig. 9.
    Phases of D&A system integration and automation. Conclusions and Future Work This
    research presents an overview of the D&A systems in an offsite construction company
    through a case study and proposes a Monte Carlo simulation-based approach to capture
    the efforts spent in information transfer and losses among various systems to
    demonstrate the impacts of poor interoperability. The approach can be used generically
    by practitioners to assess their own organizations in terms of D&A efficiencies
    and develop roadmaps and strategies for future improvement. The identified D&A
    systems have reference values to other offsite construction practitioners in similar
    businesses and setups. This case study contributes to the body of knowledge in
    several aspects: (1) documentation of the current offsite construction processes
    based on wood panelized construction and the information requirements for all
    involved technology systems; (2) a case study approach that can be generically
    applied in other offsite construction companies to capture the information efficiency
    due to information interoperability; and (3) a generic simulation-based approach
    to measure the impacts of information loss and transfer between processes. In
    this case study, a wood panelized construction company provides data of completed
    jobs in a two-year window, based on which the effort spent to transfer data among
    systems is captured. The feedback was obtained from the industry partner for the
    unit rate of effort for each job, which is used as a uniform distribution as inputs
    for the Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation results revealed that the company’s
    D&A systems suffer from information interoperability. Although the case study
    provides a comprehensive analysis, there are limitations: (1) the case study analysis
    is conducted based on a single company, and the conclusions cannot represent all
    industry practices in the offsite construction; however, the approach is generic
    for this type of analysis for other offsite construction companies; and (2) certain
    input information from the partner company is estimated, such as the feedback
    of rates of effort spent among D&A systems based on the companies practitioners’
    experience. For future study, a data collection mechanism can be established to
    obtain more data to support similar studies, which may require a broader collaborative
    effort between the industry, academia, and government. Based on a discussion with
    the industry partner in this case study, it is clear that offsite construction
    companies rely on off-the-shelf-technologies as well as certain customization.
    For example, open APIs allow users to customize certain design functions and achieve
    automation and integrations among D&A systems. To reduce the effort spent on data
    transfer and re-creation of data due to information losses, it is essential for
    offsite firms to move towards a heavy customization portion. However, more investments
    would be required, such as onboarding IT staff to support the R&D efforts and
    continuing with system maintenance. Fig. 9 illustrates three distinct phases of
    adoption for D&A systems. During the early stages, which typically applies to
    small-size firms and start-ups, off-the-shelf technologies continue to dominate
    implementation due to a lack of experience and know-how in technology customization.
    As companies grow and reach medium size, they begin to recognize the inadequacy
    of system interoperability and the benefits of integration, and therefore proceed
    to onboard the necessary talent for customization. Finally, larger corporations
    possess greater resources and capabilities to include the development of D&A systems
    as part of their core business operations. Appendix I. Sample of Simulation Results

    compliance checking (ACC) systems have been developed. However, ACC is still not

    today; little is known as to how ACC can be better accepted by the end users.

    managers in the industry to develop appropriate adoption plans for the ACC technology.
    Introduction Every phase of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
    project life cycle is subject to compliance with a variety of requirements, including
    contractual, regulatory, and standards (Soliman-Junior et al. 2022). The process
    of checking the compliance of a building to these requirements is a highly complex
    task that relies on human recognition and experience (Beach et al. 2015). In recent
    years, there has been momentum in the development of automated compliance checking
    (ACC), a process of using software to assess building designs against compliance
    requirements without modifying the designs (Eastman et al. 2009). First, new ACC
    approaches have been developed to digest legal requirements in natural language
    (Zhang and El-Gohary 2019) and make the technology more practical and easier to
    use by end users (Dimyadi and Amor 2019). Furthermore, the advent and increased
    uptake of building information modeling (BIM) provides the opportunity to describe
    the AEC projects through object-oriented data models (Eastman et al. 2011). Generally,
    rules representing compliance requirements are either hard-coded into checking
    software or represented for both human-readability and machine-processability
    (Amor and Dimyadi 2021). With the advancement and maturity of ACC technology,
    there is a pressing need to understand how wide adoption of ACC can be facilitated.
    To meet this need, Zou et al. (2022) investigated New Zealand (NZ) off-site manufacturing
    industry’s readiness for ACC and developed a high-level ACC adoption roadmap with
    key actions for NZ. Another study by Beach et al. (2020) conducted a survey within
    the UK, which suggested a set of obstacles that prevented the adoption of ACC
    and proposed a vision for future ACC development and implementation. However,
    both efforts were regional studies and failed to explain the interrelationships
    among these obstacles (i.e., mechanisms of ACC adoption). These limitations prevent
    technology firms, policymakers, and practitioners from understanding how and why
    ACC can be adopted in the AEC industry. To investigate what determining variables
    and mechanisms influence the ACC adoption in the AEC industry, this paper reports
    a multiple-case study that focuses on learning valuable lessons and experience
    in adopting ACC systems from the international efforts and interpret evidence
    from these global attempts into theoretical understanding. Related Work ACC has
    been an active research topic for more than 50 years. A number of ACC implementations
    have appeared over the last two decades and have been extensively reviewed (Dimyadi
    and Amor 2013). Examples of these include CORENET’s ePlanCheck in Singapore, Solibri
    Model Checker (SMC) in Europe, SMARTcodes, UpCodes, and AutoCodes in the US, DesignCheck
    in Australia, KBIM in Korea, and ACABIM in NZ. The ePlanCheck was considered the
    most successful recent implementation at the government level because it was commissioned
    by the Building Construction Authority of Singapore and involved many industry
    stakeholders (Goh 2007). Prior to the turn of the millennium, researchers and
    software vendors dedicated years of effort to developing various digital representations
    of buildings, creating a challenge for downstream software applications, including
    traditional ACC systems, to access the right data from proprietary digital models.
    The historical issue of lacking a platform-neutral open digital data exchange
    is being addressed by the emergence of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC),
    standardized as an ISO standard for open BIM (ISO 2018). The immaturity of technology
    was considered as the main barrier leading to the lack of ACC adoption (Beach
    et al. 2015), which can be explained through two aspects (Eastman et al. 2009).
    First, the ACC systems are limited in capabilities in checking both regulatory
    and nonregulatory requirements. Secondly, the data generated from the design stage
    are insufficient to support the derivation properties and relations for ACC. To
    address these technical barriers, new ACC methods and systems were recently developed.
    These efforts include the automated compliance audit of building information models
    (ACABIM) system developed in New Zealand that employs a human-guided automation
    philosophy for compliance checking (Dimyadi and Amor 2019), and artificial intelligence
    approaches to requirements interpretation for compliance checking (Zhang and El-Gohary
    2019). A number of studies (Dimyadi and Amor 2013; Eastman et al. 2009; Hjelseth
    2015; Krijnen and Van Berlo 2016) have extensively reviewed the technological
    development of ACC. Evidently, ACC technology is becoming mature and will likely
    be used in the day-to-day working environment in the industry in the coming years.
    According to the literature (Lee et al. 2003; Tornatzky et al. 1990), success
    factors toward the adoption of new technologies include not only technological
    development but also human perception and policies. Most of the existing ACC literature
    focused on technology but failed to consider the current ACC adoption challenges.
    To better understand these adoption challenges from an end-user perspective, Beach
    et al. (2020) recently conducted a survey study within the UK. This study ascertained
    a set of obstacles that prevented the wide adoption of ACC in the AEC life cycle
    and proposed a vision for future ACC development and implementation. However,
    this research has three major limitations. First, it only surveyed industry professionals
    who might not be familiar with ACC. Secondly, the study failed to explain the
    interrelationships among these obstacles. Thirdly, it only focused on the UK context
    and ignored important ACC adoption attempts in other countries, e.g., Australia,
    the US, NZ, and South Korea. To summarize, there has been no existing study that
    has analyzed the global efforts of ACC adoption and can explain what determining
    variables and mechanisms influence ACC adoption in the AEC industry. Research
    Methodology A multiple-case study (Yin 2011), which involves eight different cases,
    was conducted to explore the key variables and mechanisms that influence the adoption
    of ACC technology in the AEC industry. This method was selected because (1) it
    enables the exploration of a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life
    context, and (2) compared with a single case study, the multiple-case study is
    recognized as being more robust, and its results are more compelling (Yin 2011).
    In addition, the eight cases described ACC adoption in eight different countries.
    As a result, the method employed in this research could also be seen as a multicountry
    analysis. A multicountry analysis involves the collection, analysis and comparison
    of data from multiple countries and enables researchers to uncover patterns, attitudes,
    similarities, differences, and new opportunities (Sunström 1999). Case Selection
    A case study is defined as an in-depth, detailed examination of a particular case
    (or cases) within a real-world context (Yin 2013). It has been widely used for
    research in both natural and social sciences. Gerring (2017) pointed out that
    the units in case studies can vary according to different research nature and
    subject areas, ranging from social groups (for sociologists), the individual (for
    psychologists), the firm (for economists) to nations or organizations (for political
    scientists). For ACC adoption, each country has its unique contextual characteristics
    in terms of policy, building code, regulatory environment, building typology,
    building consent processes, stakeholder requirements, and so on. All these embedded
    factors influence and shape the development of ACC technologies, leading to the
    emergence of various ACC systems that can fit into the existing compliance workflows
    for each country [e.g., Korea BIM (KBIM) ACC system in South Korea (Kim et al.
    2020) and ACABIM system in NZ (Zou et al. 2022)]. Based on this observation, this
    study treats the experience and lessons of ACC adoption in each country or region
    as an individual case. Purposeful sampling (Palinkas et al. 2015) was used to
    identify and select information-rich cases related to ACC adoption. To ensure
    the cases can be situated within the context of this research, three main sampling
    criteria were developed to govern the selection of case studies, as follows: 1.
    The ACC technology reported in the case study should be at least a functional
    prototype system that can fully or partly automate the compliance checking processes
    in the building life cycle. 2. The ACC systems should have been used in a real
    working environment or been tested in at least one pilot project. This will ensure
    the selected case study contains some lessons and experience on the adoption of
    ACC systems. 3. The case study must have multiple key stakeholders involved. This
    will help unveil not only technology-related experience but nontechnology adoption
    lessons in the organisational, multidisciplinary, collaborative, environmental,
    and other contexts. Data Collection Table 1 provides an overview of the sources
    that were used to collect data for the case studies. The profile of interviewees
    and key interview questions can be found in Tables 2 and 3. In total, 18 interviews
    with 20 experts involved were conducted with key stakeholders. Sixteen interviews
    (with 18 participants) lasted varying from 45 to 90 min (average of 60 min) and
    two interviews (with Interviewees P and Q) were conducted via email due to language
    and availability issues. The stakeholders who were invited to attend the interviews
    were involved in ACC adoption in their countries, held important positions in
    their organizations (e.g., chief technology officer leading the development of
    ACC systems and building consent officer conducting the pilot testing of ACC systems),
    and had in-depth knowledge of ACC adoption experience. A semistructured method
    was adopted to allow adaptation of questions and accommodate the interviewee through
    follow-up questions and further explanations relevant to the adoption experience
    (Rowley 2012). All the interviews were recorded and transcribed. Table 1. Overview

    Note: Two interviews involved two interviewees (G/H and J/K) each time; and the
    interviews with interviewees P and Q were conducted via emails due to language/availability
    issues. Table 3. Key interview questions No. Questions 1 What were the specific
    reasons motivating the development/use of ACC technology? 2 What were the challenges
    in promoting the use of ACC? How did you solve the problems? 3 What technology
    improvements will enhance the ACC adoption? 4 What were the top factors to the
    success of ACC uptake? 5 What were the main barriers that prevented ACC uptake?
    Along with these interview data, documents, ACC product information, and other
    textual data were provided by the interviewees or collected through the Internet
    to validate the emerging findings and enrich the interview data to describe the
    big picture, narratives, and characteristics of each case (Creswell 1999). Data
    Analysis A within-case analysis was firstly conducted. In qualitative research,
    data analysis refers to the process of systematically searching and arranging
    the interview transcripts, observation notes, or other nontextual materials to
    draw an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon (Sari and Bogdan 1992). In this
    study, the content analysis included an iterative process of coding the interview
    data using Nvivo 12 (Edhlund and McDougall 2019) qualitatively in two cycles,
    as recommended by Saldaña (2015). To reduce the individual subjectivity and ensure
    the reliability of the coded data, using multiple coders is recommended (Berends
    and Johnston 2005; Evans 1996). In this project, the coding process involved two
    independent coders and another supervisor. Both coders were key researchers of
    this project and had good knowledge in the subject area of BIM and ACC. The first
    cycle of coding was structural coding, which applied a content-based or conceptual
    phrase representing a topic of inquiry to a segment of data that relates to a
    specific research question used to frame the interview. It resulted in defined
    codes from the data matrix being associated with multiple subcodes. For example,
    “the accuracy of the results from existing ACC technology is questionable” was
    coded as “Inefficiency of technical capabilities.” The latter cycle of coding
    was focused coding, which categorized coded data based on thematic or conceptual
    similarity. For example, the codes of “Inefficiency of technical capabilities”
    and “Manual practice of building code compliance” were grouped into the theme
    of “Technological barriers of ACC.” In addition, the possible contextual relationships
    in the interview quotes were highlighted to support further analysis. For instance,
    “The industry does not have money and time to train professionals to use BIM;
    (Government) funding is needed to facilitate ACC adoption” revealed a possible
    relationship among the industry, policymakers, and ACC adoption. Through this
    step, the most outstanding codes were identified, themes were developed, and possible
    contextual relationships were highlighted. The agreement between the two coders
    on allocating text segments into categories was measured by Cohen’s kappa (Cohen
    1960) k = p o − p e 1 − p e where p o = relative observed agreement between the
    coders; and p e = hypothetical probability of chance agreement. According to Landis
    and Koch (1977), in most cases, the values of k range between 0 and 1, and agreement
    is considered as sufficient based on strength when k ≥ 0.8 . The k values for
    the eight cases analyzed were 0.90 (Australia), 0.89 (China), 0.98 (Estonia),
    0.95 (NZ), 0.94 (Singapore), 0.86 (South Korea), 0.85 (UK), and 1.00 (US), respectively,
    with an average of 0.92. Then, the two coders discussed all inconsistencies and
    discrepancies to improve mutual understanding. During this process, most inconsistencies
    and discrepancies were easily resolved when one coder pointed out the other coder
    lacked sufficient understanding of the context or had overlooked or interpreted
    the language differently. For the remaining inconsistencies and discrepancies
    that the two coders were unable to reach an agreement after joint discussion,
    the supervisor was involved, all three participants reviewed and discussed these
    inconsistencies and discrepancies, and finally a resolution was reached. Once
    the data for each case were analyzed and refined, a cross-case analysis took place
    following the recommendations of Miles et al. (2018). The case-specific determinants
    were extracted and compared with each other to reach generic conclusions regarding
    the adoption variables. Twelve adoption variables were obtained after iteratively
    analyzing the case data and repeating the cross-case analysis (Table S1). Meanwhile,
    a further analysis on possible interrelationships between adoption variables was
    conducted. Based on this analysis, three path models that can determine the adoption
    of ACC systems were deduced, and 10 propositions that can guide future adoption
    of ACC systems were developed from the eight cases. Data Validation The interview
    transcripts were sent back to the interviewees for checking, which is a critical
    technique for building credibility in qualitative research (Lincoln and Guba 1985).
    No major modifications were suggested to make. To validate the results of this
    study, the adoption variables, path models, and propositions were summarized and
    sent back to the interviewees for verification and feedback. Their feedback was
    used to further improve the research results until a consensus was reached. Findings
    Case Description In this multiple-case study, eight countries were selected for
    comparative analysis: Australia, China, Estonia, NZ, Singapore, South Korea, the
    UK, and the US. Table 4 summarizes the approaches of digital technology adoption
    in AEC industries of the selected countries. It can be found that Australia, Estonia,
    NZ, and the US implemented a bottom-up approach, whereas the remaining countries
    (China, Singapore, Korea, and the UK) adopted a top-down approach. According to
    Jiang et al. (2022), a bottom-up (i.e., industry-driven) approach requires a lower
    level of government intervention while the industry takes an active part; in contrast,
    a top-down (i.e., government-driven) approach means that the government takes
    the lead and launches a series of policies (e.g., BIM mandates) to get industry
    stakeholders involved. Although these two digital technology adoption approaches
    exist, we have also observed a similar pattern across the selected countries,
    which is to build alliance of government, industry stakeholders, industry associations,
    and academics to promote the research and development (R&D) and adoption of digital
    technologies. Each country is discussed separately next. Table 4. Approaches of

    (ABAB) was established around 2017 to build an alliance of key industry stakeholders,
    government, and industry associations to coordinate and provide advice on harmonization
    of BIM development across Australia and New Zealand (Built Offsite 2017). ABAB
    has no powers but focuses on integrating a whole of built environment approach
    to support best BIM practices, developing strategies, roadmaps, and standards,
    and providing advice to both governments and industry. Around 2019, the Australian
    BIM Strategic Framework was published as the first key step to establishing a
    basis for governments to adopt a consistent national approach to BIM in major
    building and infrastructure construction projects (ABAB 2019). Liu et al. (2017)
    reviewed the BIM adoption in China. Firstly, the central government has provided
    strong policy signal to encourage more use of BIM. For example, in 2011 the Ministry
    of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) issued an outline of Development
    of Construction Industry Informatization (2011–2015) and highlighted that the
    nation will take BIM as core enabling technology to support digital transformation
    in Chinese AEC industry. Almost at the same time, the Ministry of Science and
    Technology (MOST) announced BIM as a national theme in its 12th Five-Year Plan
    on Science and Technology Development. Various BIM national conferences, BIM seminars,
    BIM design competition, and BIM training have been organized raise the AEC industries’
    awareness on BIM. In addition, local governments and companies provided incentives
    (e.g., reward of extra points for BIM applications in design competitions) to
    encourage them to adapt to the digital age. The Estonian Digital Construction
    Cluster (EDCC) was launched in 2019 to improve the digitalization of the AEC industries
    in Estonia (ECSO 2020). EDCC was in partnership with four government departments
    [Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, Estonian Road Administration,
    Tallinn City Council, and Enterprise Estonia (national investment agency), and
    the Estonian Association of Information Technology and Telecommunications (ITL)]
    and brings together a broad range of key stakeholders in the construction life
    cycle value chain. The main objectives of EDCC include helping AEC industries
    better understanding and use digital technologies, improving collaboration between
    different stakeholders, and enhancing digital skills across the whole AEC sector.
    In New Zealand, a nationwide alliance between the construction industry and government,
    known as BIM Acceleration Committee (BAC), has been established in 2014 to promote
    the update of BIM in New Zealand (BAC 2017). BAC has five main roles: (1) developing
    and maintaining the NZ BIM Handbook (which is a nonmandatory document to guide
    practitioners to use BIM); (2) conducting an annual BIM update survey; (3) providing
    case studies to demonstrate the capability and successful experience of BIM use;
    (4) providing training; and (5) organizing conferences and events. In Singapore,
    policies of the central government are easy to implement; as a result, Singapore
    has taken a government-driven approach to increase the BIM use in the industry
    (Jiang et al. 2022). Since 2015, the Building and Construction Authority has mandated
    all new building projects with gross floor areas of 5,000 m 2 and above to submit
    their architectural, structural, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP)
    plans in the format of BIM (Liao et al. 2020). The Building and Construction Authority
    of Singapore also developed the second Singapore BIM roadmap to encourage the
    local construction value chain to adopt BIM in a more collaborative way (Shen
    et al. 2016). South Korea is among the most proactive countries of developing
    and using BIM and digital technologies (Lee et al. 2015). In 2017, the Ministry
    of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of Korea provided around US$25 million
    funding to support the Korean BIM Standards (KBIM) project (buildingSMART Korea
    2022), which was the largest ever BIM R&D project in the history of Korea. KBIM
    was led by buildingSMART Korea, with participation of more than 100 companies,
    universities, government agencies, and research institutes. It includes three
    phases: (1) OpenBIM standard platform and application technology development;
    (2) development of OpenBIM-based automatic rule-checking (ARC) technology; and
    (3) OpenBIM-based integrated facilities management technology. The UK government
    announced its Construction 2025 strategy (HM Government 2013) in 2013, aimed to
    meet objectives of reduction of initial and whole life costs of built assets,
    improvement in project delivery and service export, and reduction of carbon emissions.
    This document clearly defines a national strategy to invest in digital technologies
    to transform the whole sector as efficient and technologically advanced. To support
    this vision, the UK BIM Task Group (2011) has further developed a report that
    outlines milestones, strategies for academic support, training, industry involvement,
    and legal issues resolution. UK government policy is in place to mandate Level
    2 BIM from 2016 (Georgiadou 2019). The Construction Innovation Hub, a new partnership
    among industry bodies, policymakers, practitioners, and academics, has been recently
    established to drive innovation and address key challenges in the construction
    industry (Construction Innovation Hub 2022). The US has selected a bottom-up approach
    in promoting BIM due to its unique BIM adoption culture: various local state governments
    and different organizations are developing separate approaches. Even so, some
    joint efforts across the whole country have been also observed. According to Jiang
    et al. (2022), the US General Services Administration (GSA) established the first
    National three-dimensional (3D)-four-dimensional (4D)-BIM Program in 2003, which
    require that all GSA-funded projects that used BIM should be submitted to the
    office for final approval in fiscal year 2007 and beyond. Between 2006 and 2017,
    GSA published eight series of BIM guidelines to cover the whole life cycle of
    construction projects. The National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) has
    collaborated closely with governments, industry, researchers, and practitioners
    to develop and maintain its BIM guidelines, build alliances, and provide BIM training
    and forums. Table 5 presents the characteristics of ACC systems, and the context
    of the adoption in each country. For all selected countries, adopting ACC to help
    the Building Consent Authority (BCA) conduct building consent/permit assessment
    faster, more easily, and more reliably was the primary business interest. BCAider
    and DesignCheck of Australia were among the earliest ACC systems in the world;
    however, they have not stood in the test of time and have no further development
    plans in place. Although ACC has not been fully adopted in practice in all cases,
    these countries have transitioned or are in the process of transitioning from
    paper-based workflows to e-submission systems (i.e., submission, assessment and
    approval using digital data). In addition, they have plans to develop new ACC
    systems or improve existing e-submission systems, translate their building codes
    into machine-readable rules, and build a partnership with relevant stakeholders
    to demonstrate the benefits of ACC systems. Table 5. Brief descriptions of ACC
    adoption in the eight selected countries Case ACC system ACC adoption Multiple
    stakeholder involvement References Australia In 1991, an expert system, BCAider,
    that can help designers, building surveyors and educational trainers to apply
    the Australian building code to buildings, was released by the Commonwealth Scientific
    and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). In 2006, CSIRO announced DesignCheck,
    a new system based on IFC for compliance assessment against building codes. DesignCheck
    used Express Data Manager (EDM) as the software integration platform for encoding
    design requirements from building codes. BCAider was licensed for distribution
    by Butterworths from 1991 for about 6 years and then by CBH, who stopped distribution
    around 2005. DesignCheck was not commercially used and there has been no plan
    for further development. Yes Dimyadi and Amor (2013); Ding et al. (2006); and
    Ward (2014) China Since around 2015, the local governments (e.g., Shanghai and
    Nanjing) started the transformation from paper-based documents to e-submissions
    (i.e. submission, assessment, and approval using digital data). The government
    of Nanjing led the development of a BIM-based e-submission system in collaboration
    with software firms, consultants, and construction companies. ACC has been integrated
    into the system to check those rules that can be easily quantified. There has
    been a plan for further development of the system. The BIM-based e-submission
    system of Nanjing has been commercially used. The first building consent approval
    using the system was granted in 2021. Yes Nanjing Government (2021, 2022) and

    Insight Group, cooperated with European Commission’s Structural Reform Support
    Service and demonstrated a BIM-based process for building permits in Estonia.
    The building permit assessment system is a web platform based on open BIM components
    (e.g., BIM Server, BIM Surfer, and Voxel Server). It has embedded with smart algorithms
    to automate some labour-intensive manual checks. An Estonian proof of concept
    was conducted using the system developed by Future Insight Group. Yes FIG (2019)
    New Zealand In 2019, Compliance Audit Systems Limited (CAS) introduced ACABIM,
    a cloud-based automated compliance audit system. ACABIM is built upon the philosophy
    of human-guided automation, taking IFC model, Business Process Model and Notation
    (BPMN)-compliant workflow model, and Legal Knowledge Model (LKM) as input to assist
    human against the information in the BIM model is audited. Since 2019, CAS has
    conducted a couple of pilot projects, in collaboration with building consent authorities
    and construction firms, to test the feasibility and prove the benefits of ACABIM
    system in New Zealand. Yes CAS (2019) and Dimyadi et al. (2020) Most recently,
    a project to translate a number of priority consenting documents from the NZ Building
    Code (NZBC) and associated normative standards into open legal interchange standard
    LegalRuleML (LRML) was undertaken by the University of Auckland in 2019, under
    the NZ government-funded National Science Challenge: Building Better Homes, Towns,
    and Cities (NSC BBHTC). Singapore In 1995, the Building Construction Authority
    (BCA) introduced the Construction and Real Estate Network (CORENET) system to
    check 2D plans for compliance. It upgraded the system in 2002 as CORENET ePlanCheck
    to enable the processing of 3D IFC models. The system implements ACC against two
    major domains: architectural and building services. The CORENET ePlanCheck was
    commissioned by the BCA and has been commercially used. Yes Amor and Dimyadi (2021);
    Goh (2007); and Khemlani (2005) Recently, the Singapore government has been collaborating
    with local vendors to develop the next generation of ACC system, called CORENET-X.
    South Korea The South Korean government started accepting nonvisit digital submissions
    for building permit assessment in 2008. A system called SEUMTER was developed
    and expanded for nationwide use in 2012. Recently the government is in collaboration
    with buildingSMART Korea and a number of institutions to improve SEUMTER to be
    a new ACC system, called KBIM. KBIM employs KbimCode, computer-processable rules
    translated from building codes. The KBIM building e-submission system has been
    tested through several real projects. Yes Amor and Dimyadi (2021) and Kim et al.

    Checking Processes in the Built Environment (D-COM) network was established around
    2018 to create a new digital ecosystem to support automated and easier regulatory
    compliance in the UK. In 2014, the National Building Specification (NBS) completed
    a pilot project, in collaboration with Butler & Young, to demonstrate the systems
    to perform ACC using BIM models. Yes CDBB (2019) and NBS (2014) US SMARTreview
    was introduced around 2013 and has been used by architects to check compliance

    to employ natural language processing to read from building code database and
    check BIMs against those code requirements. Both software tools work as plug-ins
    of Autodesk Revit. Both SMARTreview and UpCodes AI have been commercially used.
    In addition, a close collaboration between academia and ACC technology firms has
    been observed to explore artificial intelligence ACC solutions. Yes Amor and Dimyadi

    Variables and Path Models During the process of coding interview data and comparing
    cross-case results, a total of 12 key variables that affect the adoption of ACC
    systems were identified. The variables and their quotes in each case study are
    presented in Table S1. In the meantime, interrelationships between some of these
    variables were found in the context of these quotes. Through evaluating these
    variables and their possible interrelationships in each of these eight case studies,
    three path models that can explain the mechanisms of ACC adoption in the AEC industry
    were deduced (Figs. 1–3). The rest of this section describes the three paths and
    formulates associated propositions. Figs. S1–S3 give details about the path development
    with supporting interview quotes and literature. Fig. 1. First path explaining
    how growing innovativeness of the AEC industry leads to ACC adoption. Fig. 2.
    Second path model explaining how building stakeholders trust on ACC systems leads
    to adoption. Fig. 3. Third path model explaining the improvement of ACC maturity
    leads to adoption. Throughout its history, the global AEC industry has not been
    generally innovative, and there is much room for improvement (Blayse and Manley
    2004). Many advanced construction markets, like those in Singapore and Germany,
    are facing challenges with declining productivity and low safety standards (Lim
    and Peltner 2011). As a result, it was observed from the global adoption of digital
    technologies that the government can play an important role at a macro level (V1:
    Government support). For example, an important lesson we can learn from the successful
    national deployment of BIM from Finland is that a national BIM strategy can facilitate
    the evolvement of the building and infrastructure sectors (Aksenova et al. 2019).
    The continuous government-led BIM adoption efforts in the UK, such as the BIM
    Level 2 mandate, have helped the UK maintain a leader in implementing BIM on a
    national scale. The UK BIM standards (BS/PAS 1192 series) have now been accepted
    globally and have become ISO standards (BSI 2018; ISO 2018). Similarly, the important
    role of the government can be found in facilitating the use of blockchain technology
    in the AEC industry (Perera et al. 2020). For the adoption of ACC systems, a primary
    interest is to make the building consent/permit assessment easier, faster, and
    more reliable. The BCA is a core end-user, but adopting ACC systems in this process
    will also directly benefit other stakeholders such as designers and construction
    firms. The BCA could consider providing incentives (e.g., a fast-track pathway
    and lower costs for building consent/permit assessment) to encourage, for example,
    designers to submit their applications in the required format (e.g., IFC). Simultaneously,
    policymakers can work out new guidelines and policy recommendations (e.g., new
    guidelines about preparing BIM-based e-submissions and new policies of ACC-based
    building consent procedures) to support this transformation. Additionally, Beach
    et al. (2020) pointed out that wide adoption of ACC requires the government to
    provide sufficient upfront investment and funding to support the research and
    development, pilot tests of ACC systems, case studies, and transformation of the
    whole AEC industry. Such funding will be paramount to influence small and medium
    enterprises (SMEs). The AEC industry’s innovations can be enhanced with sufficient
    support of the government (Suprun et al. 2021) (V3: Industry readiness and innovativeness).
    It can be learned from the UK experience that when the government proposes a national
    strategy of facilitating the adoption of BIM, stakeholders will tend to follow
    such a big move and benefit from consistent and common requirements and standards
    (Piroozfar et al. 2019). At the individual level, human resistance (people having
    a negative attitude toward accepting new technologies) has a negative influence
    on industry innovativeness (Mohd Ishak and Newton 2016) (V2: Human resistance).
    To address this issue, education and training provided through universities, industry
    associations, and other commercial institutions could help enhance knowledge and
    skills (V4: Education and training), which makes a positive contribution to innovative
    AEC industry. The analysis has led to the development of the following propositions
    (Fig. 1): • Proposition 1a. Government support (through the means of funding,
    incentives and policy) has a positive effect on the innovativeness of the AEC
    industry, which increases the adoption of ACC systems. • Proposition 1b. Education
    and training have a positive effect on the innovativeness of the AEC industry,
    which increases the adoption of ACC systems. • Proposition 1c. Human resistance
    has a negative effect on the innovativeness of the AEC industry, which decreases
    the adoption of ACC systems. Tangible benefits of ACC systems can be proven through
    early stakeholder engagement and multiple pilot projects and case studies (V7:
    Tangible benefits). First, involving stakeholders from the early stage will ensure
    the real industry needs are addressed (V5: Stakeholder engagement). Once the technology
    is developed for real needs, stakeholders can see the benefits of the technology
    and will be more willing to accept it. Furthermore, pilot projects can be conducted
    on a small scale and tested for different sections of the building code (V6: Pilot
    projects and case studies). The main aims of such a pilot (Ciribini et al. 2016)
    will be to (1) test the new technology in solving real problems and gain experience
    for further technology improvement, (2) gain implementation experience, and (3)
    validate the potential benefits of the new technology. More case studies are recommended
    to be conducted at this stage after the pilot projects. These efforts will help
    the AEC industry to gain more trust and confidence in adopting ACC systems. Meanwhile,
    an appropriate marketing function contributes to building stakeholders’ trust
    and understanding (Yisa et al. 1996) (V8: Appropriate marketing). A common problem
    in current AEC industry is that marketing for new technologies trends to oversell
    and promise for functions that are not yet fully developed. The second path links
    the following propositions (Fig. 2): • Proposition 2a. Early stakeholder involvement
    has a positive effect on proving the benefits of ACC systems. • Proposition 2b.
    Conducting pilot projects and case studies has a positive effect on proving the
    benefits of ACC systems. • Proposition 2c. Tangible benefits and an appropriate
    marketing strategy contribute to building stakeholders’ trust and understanding,
    which has a positive effect on the adoption of ACC systems. The maturity of Industry
    4.0 technologies, including ACC, is paramount for technology acceptance and adoption
    in construction (Oesterreich and Teuteberg 2016). Any insufficiency of ACC systems
    has a negative impact on its technology maturity. Four main paths were identified
    in this research that generate positive effects on improving the maturity of ACC
    systems. Firstly, the integration of ACC and other technologies has a positive
    effect on ACC maturity through improved ease of use and data exchange (V9: Technology
    integration). For example, four main modules (code-checking module, submission
    module, prechecking module, and automated rule-making module) have been integrated
    into the South Korean KBIM e-Submission system (Kim et al. 2020). End-users tested
    this system and their positive feedback on this integration included (1) IFC-based
    submission set no requirement on specific BIM tools for designers, (2) the system
    improved collaboration through managing documents, project data and personnel
    information in a unified platform, and (3) the automation of extracting input
    data from KBIM system reduced input time and increased accuracy of information.
    Secondly, due to the lack of modeling standards (Kong et al. 2020), BIM models
    are often generated in different ways by people in the building design process.
    The inconsistency in creating BIM models (e.g., naming objects between different
    software) will leave an issue for ACC to work. A BIM modeling standard that guides
    professionals on how to prepare the BIM models for ACC purposes can address this
    challenge (V10: Modeling standards). ACC will benefit from consistent and good-quality
    BIM models. In addition, such a standard can improve modeling quality and reduce
    efforts of fixing and enriching BIM models for ACC purposes. Thirdly, Amor and
    Dimyadi (2021) argued that the model for ACC to check should contain sufficient,
    correct, and consistent information. Setting up a standard on information requirements
    (e.g., level of details and minimum data requirements) can lead to more accurate
    and better quality BIM for ACC purposes (V11: Information standard and requirements).
    Fourthly, paper-based building codes and standards are written in natural language
    by human experts and are published openly (Eastman et al. 2009). To enable ACC
    to work, it is critical to create a computer-processable version of building codes.
    However, this interpretation of building codes is conducted by human experts,
    which is a time-consuming process. It was found from the NZ experience that it
    takes approximately a day of an expert’s time to translate a page of a code and
    undertake quality control processes on the translation (Zou et al. 2022). Finding
    a standard approach to do the translation, and conducting quality assurance on
    the translation work will contribute to a good-quality and consistent digital
    version of building codes (V12: Standard of interpreting building code). Through
    analysing these insights and observations, the following propositions can be developed
    (Fig. 3): • Proposition 3a. Integration of ACC and other systems contributes to
    improving the technology maturity, which has a positive effect on ACC adoption.
    • Proposition 3b. Development of a BIM modeling standard contributes to improving
    the technology maturity, which has a positive effect on ACC adoption. • Proposition
    3c. Development of an information standard contributes to improving the technology
    maturity, which has a positive effect on ACC adoption. • Proposition 3d. Development
    of a standard for interpreting building codes contributes to improving the technology
    maturity, which has a positive effect on ACC adoption. Discussion Contribution
    The research outcomes contribute to the existing body of knowledge on ACC technology
    adoption from three aspects. Firstly, many theoretical models, e.g., Technology
    Acceptance Model (Lee et al. 2003) and Technology, Organization, and Environment
    (TOE) framework (Dewi et al. 2018), have been developed to explain technology
    adoption process at both macro and micro levels. Most of these models are focused
    on high-level concepts and fail to illuminate details about adopting a specific
    technological innovation. For instance, TOE framework describes the process of
    adopting technological innovation as being influenced by technological, organizational,
    and environmental contexts. However, it does not specify the factors that might
    exist in each context or explain the interaction of these factors. The present
    study brings real-world lessons about ACC adoption experience from Australia,
    China, New Zealand, the UK, Singapore, South Korea, Estonia, and the US, where
    12 key variables and three path models that influence the adoption of ACC systems
    are identified. This multiple-case study is the world’s first to investigate the
    adoption mechanisms of ACC systems in the AEC industry. By using ACC as example,
    it successfully demonstrates that interrelationships exist among key variables
    in technology adoption process and taking advantage of these interrelationships
    leads to better technology acceptance and adoption, thereby complementing existing
    technology adoption models (e.g., TOE framework). Secondly, the research outcomes
    enriched our understanding on key variables that influence ACC adoption in the
    global AEC industries. Nearly all previous efforts (Dimyadi and Amor 2013; Eastman
    et al. 2009; Hjelseth 2015; Krijnen and Van Berlo 2016) that reviewed the ACC
    development and implementation were technology-focused. Beach et al. (2020) investigated
    ACC adoption in the UK but only focused on a single country. The present paper
    reports a further-step study that extracts empirical lessons on ACC adoption from
    eight countries, finding 12 key variables (technology integration, BIM modeling
    standards, BIM information standards and requirements, standards of interpreting
    building code, government support, human resistance, industry readiness and innovativeness,
    education and training, stakeholder engagement, pilot projects and case studies,
    tangible benefits, and appropriate marketing) that affect ACC adoption in all
    these countries and also provided many new insights in addition to the work by
    Beach et al. (2020). For instance, Beach et al. (2020) indicated that lacking
    artificial intelligence to interpret building code is a main barrier, whereas
    this study found it is more important to develop a standard approach to improve
    consistency of this interpretation. This study also highlights the importance
    of appropriate marketing as the ACC adoption is still at its early stage. Overselling
    or overpromising will lead to negative impacts on practitioners’ trust on this
    technology. ACC needs to be further improved in terms of technical capability
    as well as be integrated into existing systems and workflows. Although the eight
    countries chose different digital technology adoption strategy (bottom-up approach
    or top-down approach), collaboration among academia, policymakers, and the AEC
    industry is key. Thirdly, the new path models developed in this research address
    the gap that no knowledge exists that can explain the interrelationships among
    key ACC adoption variables. Specifically, the first path reveals the importance
    of establishing an innovative AEC industry to facilitate the adoption of ACC systems.
    In this process, policymakers can play an important role through the means of
    funding, incentives, and policy. According to the TOE framework (Dewi et al. 2018),
    it can be explained that the support from policymakers can catalyze an environment
    to adopt ACC. Adopting new technologies in AEC projects often benefits multiple
    stakeholders (Hall et al. 2013). Similar evidence on the importance of the policymakers’
    leading role can be observed from the adoption of BIM, blockchain, and so on (Aksenova
    et al. 2019; Perera et al. 2020). The first path also reflects that improving
    education and training through tertiary and industry institutions has a positive
    effect on ACC adoption, which is in line with previous studies that investigated
    the relationship between innovation and education in the construction sector,
    e.g., Liu et al. (2010). The second path shows that building stakeholders’ trust
    and understanding on ACC systems is a critical step toward adoption. The trend
    of overselling the benefits of new technologies in construction (Andresen et al.
    2000) will harm trust. Early stakeholder engagement and conducting pilot projects
    and case studies will prove the benefits of ACC systems, thus bringing positive
    impacts on building trust. The third path reflects that improving the maturity
    of ACC systems can lead to adoption. Although previous studies (Amor and Dimyadi
    2021; Eastman et al. 2009) already discussed the technical challenges (some are
    to be addressed in the next decades), this research found technology integration,
    BIM modeling standards, BIM information standards, and good-quality machine-readable
    building code are among the most important technical factors from a technology
    adoption perspective. Management and Policy Implications A number of management
    and policy implications can be drawn based on the variables and path models. Firstly,
    there are many ACC systems in the market; however, most of them have limited technical
    capabilities (Häußler et al. 2021). For instance, how to check qualitative statements
    has still not been fully addressed. An implication of this study for R&D managers
    in ACC technology firms is that the developed path models and propositions can
    support improving the adoption potential of their ACC systems in the market. From
    a technological perspective, they may collaborate with academics, legislative
    bodies, and pilot users and consider improving the maturity of ACC systems through
    (1) enhancing the checking accuracy and consistency, and expanding ACC capacity
    to check more standards and requirements (e.g., qualitative statements of building
    code, urban planning, and green building standards), (2) developing methods for
    checking the quality of BIM and semantically enriching BIM for ACC purposes, (3)
    extending ACC to check non-BIM formats [one possible way is through two-dimensional
    (2D) drawing-based BIM reconstruction (Zhao et al. 2021)], (4) integration of
    systems and tools, and (5) developing a consistent, transparent, and standard
    method of interpreting building code. From a nontechnological perspective, obtaining
    end users’ trust on using ACC systems needs a step-by-step strategy, including,
    e.g., engaging BCAs and pilot users throughout the whole process of developing
    ACC systems, conducting pilot tests and case studies, and proving tangible benefits
    (not overselling). Secondly, potential early adopters (e.g., BCA, architects,
    and engineers) should investigate the state of practice of ACC systems and develop
    their own adoption plans or roadmap to ensure the use of ACC systems will bring
    tangible benefits to their own businesses. There is also a need to balance the
    investment costs and expected benefits of adopting ACC systems. Thirdly, it requires
    an innovative AEC sector to enable adoption of new technologies such as BIM and
    ACC. Tertiary institutions are important because they nurture AEC professionals
    for the next a few decades. Tertiary institutions and other education providers
    might consider (1) transforming the existing curricula to meet new needs of digital
    technologies, and (2) offering short courses to help practitioners understand
    how to prepare BIM models for ACC (e.g., BIM modeling recommendations and minimum
    information requirements), and how to use ACC to get satisfactory results. ACC
    technology firms might also support the education sector through offering education
    versions of ACC systems and cotraining students with academics. Fourthly, the
    case studies revealed that early collaboration among ACC technology firms, policymakers,
    industry associations, and end-users is key to build stakeholders’ trust in ACC
    and increase the acceptance and adoption of ACC systems in the early stages of
    market entry. Specific actions that require close collaboration include, e.g.,
    (1) industry practitioners participating in ACC pilot tests, and (2) BCAs, ACC
    technology firms, and practitioners codeveloping and comaintaining the digital
    format of building code. Lastly, the case studies further showed that the policymaker
    plays an important role to facilitate establishing an ACC uptake environment.
    From the policy perspectives, two main implications can be drawn from the results
    of this study: • A major use case of ACC systems currently is to assist BCAs in
    assessing building consent applications and make this process faster, easier,
    and more transparent to both BCAs and building consent applicants. Our research
    indicated that the BCAs and policymakers should be open to BIM and ACC and develop
    a timeline to adopt ACC systems. It is important to integrate ACC into existing
    building consent systems to help BCA officers better accept this new technology
    (Karlsson et al. 2010). Training and education can help BCA officers to become
    more familiar with the new technology and related software tools. • The adoption
    of ACC for building consent assessment requires a systematic update of the whole
    process by all stakeholders. As an example, the BCAs’ use of ACC will rely on
    information-rich, high-quality BIM models submitted by the building consent applicants.
    Jiang et al. (2022) categorized the government efforts of BIM adoption into two
    groups, i.e., top-down and bottom-up approaches. Because BIM is the precursor
    technology of ACC and the adoption of ACC is just emerging, Jiang et al.’s (2022)
    observation is applicable to the adoption of ACC at macro level (e.g., country).
    For countries where policies and regulations from central government are easy
    to implement, a government-driven approach for ACC adoption can be used, where
    appropriate. The policymakers might facilitate ACC adoption through long-term
    R&D and implementation funding for BIM and ACC, policies (e.g., mandate of BIM
    submission of public-funded projects), and incentives (e.g., fast-track pathway
    and lower costs for building consent/permit assessment). For other countries like
    US (which is a federal union of 50 states and has many local state governments
    and different organizations working differently), a different way (e.g., industry-driven)
    may be adopted. For instance, the policymaker could play the key role as regulatory
    as well as support the establishment of alliances to guide the whole AEC industry
    to evolve. Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research This research is
    not free of limitations. Firstly, the institutional contexts of the eight selected
    countries vary from one to another because each country has unique characteristics
    in terms of policies, regulatory framework and approval processes, building typology,
    stakeholder requirements, and so on. We focused on observing the homogeneity (i.e.,
    the variables and path models that affect ACC adoption) across the eight countries;
    however, the impacts of institutional heterogeneity were not studied. Some researchers
    pointed out that institutional context can influence the diffusion of innovations
    (Papadonikolaki 2018; Tigabu et al. 2015). According to de Mello Brandão Vinholis
    et al. (2021), institutions refer to rules that frame and constrain economic behaviour
    and social interactions, where the macroinstructional level (e.g., country) is
    related to the regulatory environment. Some studies argued that the culture also
    matters in innovation adoption in the construction industry (Dorée 2004; Papadonikolaki
    2018). In addition, the UK and US are part of the Western world and share same
    Western culture; however, the UK adopted a top-down approach in BIM adoption (e.g.,
    BIM mandate) whereas the US adopted a bottom-up approach (Jiang et al. 2022).
    This might be explained that US is a federal system and its local states work
    differently in silos. It can be deduced that the political system might affect
    the adoption of innovation in AEC sector as well. So far, little is known on direct
    and indirect links between the institutional contexts and optimal ACC adoption
    pathways at the macro level. As a result, further research is recommended to further
    explore the ACC adoption paths in these countries and analyze the impacts of institutional
    heterogeneity on ACC adoption from system perspectives. Secondly, there is a large
    discrepancy in the level of ACC adoption across cases. For instance, the DesignCheck
    in Australia was developed around 2005 but was not used by the industry. The ePlanCheck
    in Singapore was used by the industry only for a few years in the beginning but
    remains as an active project commissioned by the Singapore government. Similarly,
    the KBIM system in Korea is actively being developed on a national level involving
    research institutions as well as the government. Because the adoption of ACC is
    just emerging (e.g., ACC has not been broadly used in most countries) and ACC
    is a very small field, we did not consider the maturity levels of ACC adoption
    in selected countries. Consequently, further research should consider developing
    maturity levels of ACC adoption and summarizing adoption paths of ACC in each
    country. Thirdly, 12 key variables and three path models were deduced. However,
    some case-specific features also existed and were not discussed in detail because
    it was not within the scope of this study. For instance, there are different opinions
    about whether the use of BIM and ACC should be mandated. Such a debate exists
    mostly because the AEC industry in each country has a different culture, market,
    political environment, and so on. Future research is recommended to identify those
    case-specific variables and take a closer look at the comparison of different
    cases. Conclusion The increased momentum of ACC implementations in recent years
    has shown great potential in developing this technology for wider use to address
    real-world compliance checking issues. However, there has not been a dedicated
    ACC system today that has been adopted widely in construction, although there
    are fragmented software tools being used by industry’s practitioners offering
    various degrees of compliance checking capabilities. To examine key variables
    and mechanisms that influence the adoption of ACC systems, this study conducted
    a multiple-case study. Valuable lessons have been learned from the experience
    and the adoption efforts from eight different countries. Through cross-case analysis,
    four technology-related and eight nontechnical key variables have been identified,
    and three path models have been deduced. The technology related variables include
    (1) technology integration, (2) BIM modeling standard, (3) BIM information standard
    and requirements, and (4) standard of interpreting building code. Nontechnical
    variables include (1) government support, (2) human resistance, (3) industry readiness
    and innovativeness, (4) education and training, (5) stakeholder engagement, (6)
    pilot projects and case studies, (7) tangible benefits, and (8) appropriate marketing.
    The path models revealed important interrelationships among these variables. Firstly,
    improving the innovativeness of the AEC industry through government support and
    proper training and education can lead to ACC adoption. Secondly, involving stakeholders
    and conducting case studies can prove the benefits of ACC systems. The proven
    benefits can help build the stakeholders’ trust and understanding of this new
    technology, which leads to adoption. Thirdly, whether ACC has the capability of
    addressing real-world challenges is still a main concern of the end-users. Continuously
    improving the technology maturity and addressing any insufficiency of ACC systems
    can lead to wider adoption. Supplemental Materials File (supplemental materials_

  description: Over the years, service robots and artificial intelligence (AI) have
    been gaining traction in the hospitality sector for frontline service automation.
    Although a significant body of literature exists pertinent to AI services in the
    hospitality sector, the research on the AI service encounters and factors affecting
    the acceptance (or rejection) of AI services among consumers requires further
    attention. Against this background, the purpose of this study is to explore the
    underlying factors that influence the acceptance (or rejection) of AI and robotic
    services in the hospitality industry, specifically in the context of restaurants
    in Pakistan. This study adopted a case study approach and conducted semi-structured
    interviews with the users and non-users of AI/robotic services in restaurants.
    These interviews aimed to uncover the values, motives, and reasons that affect
    consumers' decisions to adopt or resist AI services. The findings revealed that,
    in addition to customer values and global motives, there also exist context-specific
    reasons that influence the adoption (or resistance) of robots and AI services
    in restaurants. This research is one of the first studies to explore the reasons
    for facilitating or inhibiting consumers' adoption of AI and robotic services
    in the Pakistani hospitality sector. The study's contribution lies in providing
    a nuanced understanding of the factors that affect consumer behavior toward AI
    and robotic services, which can inform the development and implementation of AI
    and robotic services in the hospitality industry.

    (BRT)ReasonsHospitality industry 1. Introduction Technology has become an essential
    part of our lives, thus, improving the quality of life, health, and welfare (Webster
    and Ivanov, 2020; Zhong et al., 2020). With the increasing digital connectivity,
    the development of AI and robotics has significant implications in the services
    sector (Li et al., 2019; Makridakis, 2017). However, innovative technologies (e.g.,
    AI, robots, and chatbots) are crossing the threshold of revolutionizing different
    services, such as healthcare, education, tourism, and hospitality (Ivanov et al.,
    2019; Tussyadiah and Park, 2018; Yu and Ngan, 2019; Tussyadiah, 2020; Bowen and
    Morosan, 2018). In this vein, the debate on innovation adoption (or resistance)
    is constantly growing in the professional and academic literature (Nam et al.,
    2020). Previous studies have suggested that utilizing AI and robotic services
    in the hospitality sector offers several benefits to all stakeholders (i.e., organizations,
    employees, and consumers). For instance, hotels and restaurants may take advantage
    of cost reduction, increased revenues, and operational efficiencies with AI and
    Robots (Ransbotham et al., 2017). Likewise, it facilitates the employees in performing
    their tasks more efficiently by freeing them from repetitive tasks (e.g., order
    taking, check-ins or outs, and replying to customer queries). And it allows them
    to spend more time on other tasks that require personal interactions (e.g., handling
    the AI devices and back-office work) (Nam et al., 2020; Mingotto et al., 2020;
    Abbas et al., 2022). In addition, it also saves customers'' time as they can easily
    and quickly get information on simple problems (e.g., location, costs, and opening
    hours of the services). AI helps provide unique and personal services to consumers,
    reduces expenses, and gives efficient solutions (Nam et al., 2020; Ivanov et al.,
    2017; Ransbotham et al., 2017). Although AI offers several benefits to all stakeholders,
    recent studies have highlighted a dark side of AI that is crucial for owners and
    marketing managers (Park et al., 2021). For instance, there is still uncertainty
    about AI''s possible implications and consequences (Belanche et al., 2020). Some
    studies have reported that AI is too risky or expensive to use in contexts where
    employees and customers are less knowledgeable and lack understanding of its handling
    (Davenport and Ronanki, 2018). Similarly, consumer acceptance (or rejection) of
    AI services is crucial for marketers in the hospitality sector. However, a plethora
    of research exists examining the factors affecting consumer acceptance (or resistance)
    of AI services (Tandon et al., 2020; Ryan and Casidy, 2018; Kushwah et al., 2019).
    Despite the growing body of literature on consumer acceptance (or resistance)
    of AI services in hospitality, our understanding of the factors facilitating (or
    inhibiting) consumer acceptance (or resistance) is limited for various reasons.
    First, previous studies have mainly focused on identifying the factors that affect
    the adoption of AI/robots and their impact on customer satisfaction, service quality,
    and employee attitudes (e.g., Chi et al. (2022). However, little is known about
    the factors that drive resistance to adopting AI/robots in the hospitality industry.
    Second, previous studies have primarily examined consumer decision-making from
    the lens of behavioral theories (e.g., Kaur et al. (2020), such as the theory
    of reasoned action (TRA), the theory of planned behavior (TPB), and the technology
    acceptance model (TAM). Due to the high failure rate of innovative products and
    services, some researchers have highlighted the limitations of these theories
    on their potential to predict generalized consumer behaviors (Hagger et al., 2002;
    Gilal et al., 2019) and criticized them for ignoring the factors contributing
    to consumer resistance to innovations (Garcia et al., 2007; Antioco and Kleijnen,
    2010). Third, existing studies have primarily been conducted using quantitative
    methods, which may not completely explain the complex nature of adoption and resistance
    behaviors. Moreover, recent studies (e.g., Belanche et al. (2019) have highlighted
    that most AI research comes from developed countries, like USA, UK, and Portugal,
    thus, calling for more studies from other geographical and cultural contexts (e.g.,
    Asian countries, Jewish, Latin American) to understand the adoption/resistance
    of robots globally. Lastly, given that the findings from the previous studies
    revealed equivocal results; there are ongoing calls for further development of
    knowledge in this field of research (Tandon et al., 2020; Ryan and Casidy, 2018;
    Kushwah et al., 2019). Against these backgrounds, this study utilizes the theoretical
    lens of Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT) to explore the values, global motives,
    and reasons for consumer acceptance (or resistance) to AI services in hospitality
    in the context of a developing country (i.e., Pakistan). This study differs from
    previous studies and offers several novel contributions to the existing literature.
    First, this study contributes to the literature on innovation resistance in hospitality
    by using the theoretical lens of BRT, which helps innovation researchers and marketers
    explore the relative influence of both reasons for and against adopting new technologies.
    BRT differs from other behavioral theories as BRT considers the context specific
    reasons for the attractiveness of any innovation (Sahu et al., 2020). Second,
    by adopting a qualitative case study approach, this study seeks to provide a deeper
    understanding of the factors that drive the adoption and resistance of AI/robots
    in the hospitality industry. This can help organizations develop effective strategies
    to overcome resistance and promote the adoption of these technologies. Lastly,
    this research is one of the first to explore the reasons for facilitating (or
    inhibiting) consumers'' adoption of AI services in the hospitality sector in a
    developing country context. 2. Literature review 2.1. AI in the hospitality industry
    Technology advancements in AI, robotics, and big data are helping hospitality
    businesses to develop quickly (Attaran, 2020; Reis et al., 2020; Rosário and Dias,
    2022). The hospitality sector has implemented AI and digital processes into customer
    relationship management, revenue management systems, and property management systems
    to synthesize key performance indicators (Mariani et al., 2018; Ruel and Njoku,
    2021). AI services significantly contribute to the overall service quality in
    the hospitality sector through employee service quality, necessitating a better
    knowledge of how AI technologies can influence service quality, customer satisfaction,
    and loyalty via employee-related outcomes. Such as service quality, productivity,
    and employee engagement (Chi et al., 2020; Pillai and Sivathanu, 2020; Prentice
    et al., 2020). Moreover, all business sectors, including hospitality, are affected
    by the development of robotics, AI, and enhanced digital connectivity. Businesses
    use these trimming, intelligent technologies to streamline operations, cut costs,
    improve consumer experiences, and even suggest new ones (Mingotto et al., 2021).
    Furthermore, using robots and AI can reduce human errors and provide future predictions.
    AI and robotic services can evaluate vast amounts of data and convert it into
    valuable business information. Furthermore, due to increased business knowledge,
    hospitality businesses can offer their consumers excellent services. AI satisfies
    business consumers by supporting them in identifying and optimizing potential
    future sales possibilities (Kumar et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2021). Therefore, AI
    has a significant impact on the hospitality industry. Pakistan''s hospitality
    industry is experiencing significant growth in recent years due to increased tourism
    and business travel (Hasni et al., 2021; Kharipzhanova and Irfan, 2022). However,
    the hospitality sectorfacesmany challenges, including low productivity and rising
    operational costs (Kharipzhanova and Irfan, 2022; Khaliq et al., 2022). In this
    context, the adoption of AI/robots has the potential to address some of these
    challenges and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of hospitality operations.
    However, adopting AI/robots in Pakistan''s hospitality industry is still early.
    There is a lack of research on the factors influencing the adoption and resistance
    to this technology (Iqbal and Campbell, 2021). 2.2. Consumer adoption/resistance
    to AI services in the hospitality – behavioral reasoning perspective The hospitality
    and tourism literature has highlighted technological adoption or innovations (Couture
    et al., 2015; Randhawa et al., 2016). However, a theoretical description of consumers''
    resistance to innovations still seems lacking. Recent studies in the services
    and hospitality industries specify that consumer resistance has hampered technological
    developments and innovations. According to Szmigin and Foxall (1998), innovation
    resistance has three types: rejection, postponement, and opposition. Rejection
    is an extreme kind of resistance. Even if they find an innovation acceptable,
    consumers may postpone adopting it. In many circumstances, postponement appears
    to be triggered by situational factors (Sun, 2021; Kleijnen et al., 2009; Heidenreich
    et al., 2016). This study investigates the consumer adoption/resistance of AI/robotic
    services in the hospitality industry. Consumer acceptance of technology, particularly
    of robots/AI, will increase, providing the necessary impetus to the tourism and
    hospitality sector; thus, marketers should be aware of end-user viewpoints (Samara
    et al., 2020). Analyzing customer perception and adoption of robots/AI is a difficult
    task for service providers and marketers (Go et al., 2020). We aim to fill the
    existing knowledge gap by examining consumers'' underlying behavioral reasoning
    processes related to AI services through the lens of BRT. Many researchers have
    used BRT to study consumer behavior in multiple areas, including organic food
    (Tandon et al., 2020), favorable or resistive customer perceptions of innovations
    (Claudy et al., 2015), alcohol over-consumption (Norman et al., 2012), managerial
    policymaking (Westaby et al., 2010), and mobile banking adoption (Gupta and Arora,
    2017). BRT is a structure that allows researchers and practitioners to analyze
    the comparative effect of reasons for and against consumers'' behavioral intentions
    toward any innovation (Westaby, 2005; Sahu et al., 2020). Some researchers identified
    that the reasons for resisting any innovation are not always the same as the reasons
    for adopting those inventions (Sahu et al., 2020; Claudy et al., 2015). BRT not
    only helps researchers to differentiate both reasons for and against, but it also
    aids in analyzing the impact of these aspects on customers'' intentions by adopting
    a particular framework for making decisions (Sahu et al., 2020). BRT has four
    major components: i) values and beliefs, ii) reasoning (for and against), iii)
    attitude, and iv) intentions. The behavioral intention may be defined as the customer''s
    affinity to participate in an action, behavior, or task (Kim et al., 2018). Attitude
    is described as the degree of valuation of the negative or positive findings of
    the behavior in the past; if an attitude is favorable toward a particular behavior,
    the individual is more likely to intend to engage in a behavior, whereas an adverse
    reaction expect to translate into non-engagement (Kumar, 2019; Sahu et al., 2020).
    Values are essential in creating customers'' attitudes (Dreezens et al., 2005).
    2.3. Reasons for and against consumer adoption (or resistance) of AI services
    Consumer resistance to innovation is considered a deliberate choice that indicates
    a negative reaction to anticipated changes to the status quo, interference with
    existing happiness levels, or conflicts with belief structure (Huang et al., 2021;
    Sun et al., 2022; Ram and Sheth, 1989). Innovations require consumers to change
    their attitudes and behaviors. Some scholars have addressed the factors negatively
    influencing innovation adoption (Lian and Yen, 2014; Huang et al., 2021). The
    literature on consumer adoption usually reveals a pro-change bias, assuming that
    customers are open to change and new products (Talke and Heidenreich, 2014; Huang
    et al., 2021). Reasons are the most critical attitude indicators of behavioral
    intention (Kaur et al., 2020). Moreover, innovation resistance research is fast
    gaining significance in areas such as car sharing (Valor, 2020), mobile and internet
    banking (Kaur et al., 2020), smart technology in the retail sector (Roy et al.,
    2020), social media (Chen and Kuo, 2017), and e-commerce (Nel and Boshoff, 2019).
    According to reasoning theories, if people have a strong reason for or against
    engaging in the behavior, it helps them validate their actions (Tandon et al.,
    2020). Moreover, this activates other variables related to behavioral intention.
    BRT divides reasons into two opposed sub-dimensions, i) reasons for and ii) reasons
    against, which are similarly portrayed in the earlier literature as facilitators
    (adoption) and inhibitors (resistance) (Westaby, 2005). Drawing from the BRT lens,
    this study explores the reasons (for and against) the consumer adoption of AI/robotic
    services in the hospitality industry. For this purpose, we conduct an exploratory
    study to understand how positive and negative motivational reasons influence consumer
    adoption (or resistance) of AI services in the hospitality industry. Therefore,
    this study aims to answer the following research question (RQ). • RQ - What are
    the motivational reasons for and against the consumer adoption of AI services
    in the hospitality sector? 3. Methodology 3.1. Research design Qualitative methods
    facilitate a flexible process and allow scholars to build an in-depth consideration
    of various customer behaviors (Bernard and Bernard, 2013; Neuman, 2014). Qualitative
    methods are more appropriate for obtaining specific context motivational reasons
    as categories (Claudy et al., 2015). Therefore, the present study used an exploratory
    qualitative method. Qualitative methods are substantially utilized to obtain perceptions
    and more profound knowledge of using AI and robots in the hospitality industry
    (Nam et al., 2021; Fusté-Forné, 2021). Data collection involve in-depth semi-structured
    interviews with participants. The interview questions elicited participants''
    perceptions and attitudes toward AI/robots in the hospitality industry and their
    experiences using the technology. Questions were designed to explore the challenges
    associated with implementing AI/robots and the impact on customer experience.
    Using professional and personal contacts, we used a purposeful sampling technique
    to recruit a comprehensive range of participants for semi-structured interviews
    (Khizar et al., 2022; Yin, 2009). To better understand both i) the reasons for
    and ii) the reasons against AI adoption, we included users and non-users of AI
    in the hospitality sector in our sampling frame. 3.2. Sampling and data collection
    Following previous motivational research that considers gender differences (Bae
    and Lee, 2011; Hansen and Jensen, 2009), our study sampled a proportionate distribution
    of males and females to decrease biasing effects from the sample arrangement.
    The sample size of the customer groups is consistent with the literature on exploratory
    research, which suggests that studies with eight to twelve interviewees are enough
    to make categories (Eisenhardt, 1989; Kvale and Brinkmann, 2007; McCracken, 1988).
    As we aimed to capture reflective and real-time insights into the reasons for
    and reasons against using AI, we adopted a semi-structured interview technique
    with open-ended questions (Mason, 2006). We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews
    during January and February 2022 in Multan. The sample consisted of 11 users (FU
    = 5; MU = 6) and 11 non-users (FNU = 6; MNU = 5). Table 1 presents the characteristics
    of the sample. The interviews were conducted in person at a time and place convenient
    to the respondents. Participation in the interviews was voluntary, and the privacy
    and anonymity of the respondents were ensured. The length of each interview ranged
    from 10 to 30 min. All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed for further
    analysis using standard methods for data coding (Radez et al., 2021; Lochmiller,
    2021). Despite our efforts to diversify the sample by age, the number of older
    interviewees is not unexpected, given that younger customers are more likely to
    use new technologies for product info, search, or judgment (Papagiannidis et al.,
    2013; Wood, 2002). Table 1 below presents the sample profile. Table 1. Sample
    characteristics. Groups Frequency Age (in years) 21–30 31–40 Above 40 FU 5 3 1
    1 FNU 6 1 2 3 MU 6 4 1 1 MNU 5 1 1 3 Note: FU = female user, FNU = female non-user,
    MU = male user, MNU = male non-user. 4. Analysis and findings For our analysis,
    we employed a comparative thematic analysis supplemented with automated content
    analysis software MAXQDA (Momeni et al., 2018; Ben Youssef et al., 2019; Zhang
    et al., 2022). MAXQDA analytics pro-2022 (trial) is a complete qualitative data
    analysis software that makes it simple to use several qualitative data analysis
    techniques, including content analysis, focus groups, case studies, and word cloud
    analysis. This study used the word cloud technique of the customer responses to
    questions to supplement our thematic analysis. Fig. 1 provides a word cloud of
    37 that pass at least five times out of the 2146 words found in customer interview
    forms. Download : Download high-res image (196KB) Download : Download full-size

    through MaxQDA, we employed a comprehensive manual thematic content analysis to
    understand deeply and present interview responses. Fig. 2 exemplifies the findings
    of our manual content analysis to highlight a distinctive set of reasons for and
    against adopting AI services that emerged from the respondent interviews. Based
    on our analysis, we present the findings of this study into two main categories,
    which are i) reasons for adoption and ii) reasons against adoption. Moreover,
    our findings on the reasons for adoption are further divided into subthemes, as
    follows; i) perceived ease of use, ii) perceived usefulness, iii) perceived enjoyment,
    and iv) perceived innovativeness. Likewise, we present the reasons against adopting
    AI in the following subthemes, i) technological complexity, ii) technological
    anxiety, iii) perceived safety, and iv) privacy concerns. Download : Download

    4.1. Reasons for the adoption of AI and robot service in the hospitality 4.1.1.
    Perceived ease of use The first subtheme identified through our semi-automated
    content analysis revealed the perceived ease of use. This theme refers to customers''
    perceptions of how easy interacting with AI/robots in the hospitality industry
    is. Customers may easily place an order through a touch screen or voice-activated
    system. It includes the design of the technology and the clarity of instructions.
    In this study, we observe that some respondents feel comfortable in hotels where
    robots are used because they are easier to handle than humans. They feel that
    robotic service has no error that increases their pleasure level. “Whenever we
    plan to dinner, then I am preferred those hotels which are based on technology
    like robots, AI, and others.” (RF-01) “I need peace of mind, so I choose a technology-based
    hotel because robots are well managed and easy to handle in food ordering and
    delivering.” (RF-07) 4.1.2. Perceived usefulness The second important subtheme
    that the word cloud analysis revealed is perceived usefulness. This theme refers
    to customers'' perceptions of AI/robots'' value to the hospitality industry. To
    elaborate on this theme, you could investigate how customers perceive AI/robots
    as useful, such as improving order accuracy, reducing wait times, or enhancing
    the overall customer experience, and how customers compare the usefulness of AI/robots
    to that of human employees. Understanding consumers'' perceptions of the usefulness
    of robots and AI can help businesses to promote their adoption better. In this
    study, many responders support a dilemma that they thought technology and all
    other related things are more valuable and helpful in every aspect compared to
    traditional hotel services. “I always judge that robots perform efficiently as
    compared to humans, so that''s why I like these kinds of hotels.” (RF-10) “My
    family always suggests me to go there, especially for lunch or dinner, where properly
    orders are delivered in time efficiently, so that''s why I choose technology-related
    restaurants.” (RF-02) 4.1.3. Perceived enjoyment This sub-theme relates to consumers''
    emotional response to interacting with robots and AI in hospitality. Consumers
    may find it enjoyable to use these technologies, or they may perceive them as
    cold or impersonal. Furthermore, the novelty of relating with new technology,
    the responsiveness of the system to customer requests, or the personalization
    of the experience. Understanding consumers'' emotional responses can help businesses
    to design and market their use of robots and AI more effectively. We identified
    perceived enjoyment as an important reason for adopting AI in the hospitality
    sector. Most customers say they are very excited and feel fun when they use AI/robot
    services in restaurants because the robot interaction gives them great satisfaction
    and pleasure. “My children always insist me go to the robots serving hotels because
    they enjoy seeing the robots.” (RF-09) “I always prefer the robot serving hotels
    because it''s pleasurable when I use the robot service.” (RF-11) 4.1.4. Perceived
    innovativeness This sub-theme focuses on how consumers perceive their interactions
    with robots and AI in hospitality. Customers perceive AI/robots as interactive,
    such as providing personalized recommendations, responding to customer feedback,
    or engaging in small talk or banter with customers. Understanding how consumers
    view the role of robots and AI in hospitality can help businesses to ensure that
    their use of these technologies aligns with consumers'' expectations and preferences.
    We also identified a major technology-related subtheme, perceived innovativeness,
    as an important reason for adopting AI/robots in the hospitality sector. Everyone
    wants to try new AI/robots services to learn and understand new things in the
    current era. According to some respondents, some restaurants use robots in the
    Pakistani hospitality sector, which is a good initiative for the hospitality business.
    Customers are keen to use robotic services in restaurants. “My family and I are
    not using robot services before; it is a new thing to us” (RF-4) “I think nowadays
    everyone wants to use the robot service in restaurants because peoples are keen
    to try new technologies.” (RF-5) 4.2. Reasons against the adoption of AI and robot
    service in the hospitality 4.2.1. Technological complexity Technological complexity
    is the first important subtheme of reason against what we identified through the
    word cloud analysis. One of the main reasons consumers may resist the adoption
    of AI/Robots in the hospitality industry is the perceived technological complexity
    of these systems. Consumers may feel that AI/Robots are too difficult to use or
    understand, leading to frustration and resistance. This is especially true for
    older consumers or those less comfortable with technology. According to some respondents,
    they cannot understand the new technologies because new technologies have a large
    number of mechanisms. Therefore, they feel insecure about using new technologies
    like AI/robots in restaurants. “I try to avoid new technologies because I feel
    insecure about using these technologies like machines, robots, and others.” (RA-02)
    “I can''t understand the new technology-related matters because I don''t know
    how to use many mechanisms of machines and robots.” (RA-05) 4.2.2. Technological
    anxiety Technological anxiety is the second important subtheme identified through
    our semi-automated content analysis. This refers to the apprehension or fears
    that some consumers may feel toward AI/Robots, which a lack of familiarity or
    understanding of these systems may drive. Some consumers may feel uneasy about
    interacting with machines instead of human staff, or they may be worried about
    the implications of using AI/Robots. Some interviewees say they avoid going to
    restaurants with many technologies because they cannot keep pace with new technologies.
    Moreover, some respondents replied that when they see robots in restaurants, they
    feel anxious and think about how to use this technology. “I am trying to escape
    the use of technologies because I am unfamiliar with the new technologies used
    in restaurants.” (RA-4) “I don''t know the machines, so I cannot keep pace with
    advanced technologies.” (RA-6) 4.2.3. Perceived safety Consumers may also resist
    the adoption of AI/Robots in the hospitality industry due to safety concerns.
    Some consumers may worry about the risk of malfunction or error, potentially harming
    them or others. Additionally, some consumers may be concerned about their personal
    information and data security when interacting with AI/Robots. They may be worried
    that their data could be accessed or shared without their consent or that their
    privacy could be compromised. According to some interviewees, those machines,
    robots, and AI usage are not secure for them. Furthermore, they said the access
    usage of the machines is dangerous for humans. Moreover, some respondents believe
    it is harmful and does not use the new technologies without learning their functions.
    “Due to inexperience, I think using new technologies in restaurants is not safe
    for my family and me.” (RA-7) “I feel uncomfortable and insecure when I use the
    machines in restaurants because if I give him wrong instruction, then everyone
    laughs out loud.” (RA-3) 4.2.4. Privacy concerns The privacy concern is the other
    important subtheme of reason against, which we identified through the word cloud
    analysis. Consumers may be worried about these systems'' collection and use of
    their personal information, especially if they feel they have little control over
    how their data is used. They may be uncomfortable being monitored or tracked by
    AI/Robots, which could compromise their privacy and security, or worry that their
    data could be accessed or shared without their consent. Most interviewees do not
    like robots or those rich in technology hotels because they think their privacy
    matters are compromised in these kinds of hotels, and privacy is everything to
    them. According to some interviewees, they must sacrifice their privacies if they
    use new hotel technologies. “Robots/machines are operated or programed by some
    humans, so if I use robots for service, then it means I am going to share my details
    with the third one, and that third one can misuse it.” (RA-10) “I am scared, and
    mostly we use plastic money at these hotels, so there are bright chances to scam
    because robots can save our financial details from debit card and share it with
    another corrupt or dishonest person.” (RA-12) 5. Discussions and implications
    This study sheds light on the underlying factors (i.e., values, motives, and reasons)
    that influence the adoption (or resistance) of AI/robotic services in the hospitality
    industry. By adopting a case study approach (Yin, 2009) in the hospitality sector
    and conducting semi-structured interviews with both users and non-users of AI/robotic
    services in restaurants, this qualitative study provides insights into consumers''
    sense-making processes regarding the increasing adoption of robots and AI in hospitality.
    The study''s findings revealed that customer values and global motives play a
    crucial role in the adoption of AI/robotic services in restaurants. Moreover,
    there also exist context-specific reasons for and reasons against that influence
    the adoption (or resistance) of robots and AI services in restaurants. The underlying
    factors that promote the adoption of AI/robotic services include perceived ease
    of use, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and perceived innovativeness.
    On the other hand, factors that inhibit the adoption of these services include
    technological complexity, technological anxiety, perceived safety, and privacy
    concerns. Moreover, this study''s contribution to the field lies in its exploration
    of the reasons for facilitating (or inhibiting) consumers'' adoption of AI services
    in the hospitality sector. The study''s findings can inform hospitality businesses
    in designing and implementing AI/robotic services that align with consumers''
    values, motives, and concerns. Moreover, this study can inform policymakers and
    researchers interested in the adoption of innovative technologies in the service
    sector. In particular, the subsequent sections discusses the implications for
    theory and practice. 5.1. Theoretical implications The findings of this study
    have significantly contributed to the existing literature on the adoption (or
    resistance) of AI and robotic services in the hospitality industry. By exploring
    the experiences of hospitality customers, this study has identified unique challenges
    and opportunities that arise in the context of this industry, thus contributing
    to the literature on technology adoption in service industries. The study has
    four key theoretical implications. First, the findings provide a deeper understanding
    of the relative influence of inhibitors (both for and against) in shaping customers''
    attitudes and intentions toward the adoption (or resistance) of AI and robotic
    services in the hospitality industry. The study highlights that factors such as
    perceived ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, and innovativeness contribute to
    customers'' acceptance of AI and robot services, while factors such as technological
    complexity, anxiety, safety concerns, and privacy concerns inhibit their adoption.
    Second, the study has significantly contributed to the theoretical foundations
    of the existing literature by using the BRT to examine the adoption (or resistance)
    of AI and robotic services in the hospitality sector. This framework is useful
    for understanding the complex decision-making process involved in technology adoption
    and resistance, particularly in the hospitality industry. Third, the findings
    provide crucial insights into customer attitudes and behaviors toward adopting
    (or resisting) AI and robotic services in the hospitality industry. These insights
    can guide practitioners in designing and implementing effective strategies for
    the successful adoption of these technologies. Moreover, these findings should
    motivate other researchers to conduct similar research among other cultural and
    geographical groups to extend the scholarly debate in this field. 5.2. Practical
    implications This study provides significant implications for the policymakers
    and the management of the hospitality sector. First, understanding the underlying
    reasons for consumer behavior can inform the design of AI and robotic systems
    in the hospitality industry. By taking into account the factors influencing customers''
    adoption or resistance, these systems can be made more user-friendly and effective,
    leading to increased efficiency and customer satisfaction. Second, marketing managers
    and policymakers can use the findings of this study to develop targeted strategies
    that motivate customers to adopt AI and robot services in the hospitality sector.
    Understanding the factors that influence consumers'' attitudes and intentions
    can help to design effective marketing campaigns and to develop better customer
    service practices. Third, this study highlights the advantages of using robots
    in terms of increased efficiency and decreased service times, while also identifying
    potential reasons for resistance, such as technological anxiety and privacy concerns.
    Policymakers can use these insights to develop regulations and guidelines that
    ensure the ethical use of AI and robotics and to protect the interests of all
    stakeholders. 5.3. Limitations and future research Despite these exciting contributions,
    this study has some limitations that recommend opportunities for future studies.
    One limitation of this study is the small sample size. Purposive sampling is useful
    for identifying participants with specific characteristics or experiences but
    may not provide a representative sample. As such, the findings may not be generalizable
    to other settings or contexts within the hospitality industry. Future research
    could use larger samples and more diverse recruitment strategies to ensure the
    generalizability of the findings. There also exist a potential for social desirability
    bias among the participants, which could impact their responses. For instance,
    the participants may hesitate to express negative attitudes or experiences about
    AI/robots, especially if they believe it could impact their job security. Future
    research could use a more anonymous and confidential approach to minimize the
    potential for bias. Another limitation is the potential for interviewer bias (e.g.,
    interviewer''s preconceptions and beliefs), which may influence the interpretation
    of the data. To minimize this bias, future studies could incorporate additional
    measures to ensure an objective approach, such as training interviewers in qualitative
    research methods and reflexivity techniques. The present study only explored the
    reasoning perspective of consumers. However, future researchers can expand on
    these findings by studying the perspectives of other stakeholders, such as employees
    and marketing managers. In addition, while this study focused on the reasons for
    adoption (or resistance), future research could investigate the actual usage of
    AI and robotic services in the hospitality industry and their impact on customer
    experience and business performance. Moreover, this study only examined the adoption
    (or resistance) of AI and robotic services in the context of restaurants. Future
    studies could explore the adoption of these technologies in other sectors of the
    hospitality industry, such as hotels, theme parks, and airlines. Additionally,
    this study did not consider the impact of cultural factors on the adoption of
    AI and robotic services. Future research could examine how cultural differences
    influence consumers'' attitudes and intentions toward these technologies. Finally,
    this study was conducted in a single developing economy, which may limit its generalizability
    to other cultural and geographical contexts. Future studies could replicate this
    research in diverse scenarios in other countries, such as Dubai, Malaysia, Russia,
    and European countries, to extend the scholarly debate in this field. 6. Conclusion
    In conclusion, this qualitative research has shed light on the factors that influence
    the adoption or resistance of AI and robot services in the hospitality sector.
    Through semi-structured interviews with both users and non-users, we identified
    the perceived ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, and innovativeness as reasons
    for adoption, while technological complexity, anxiety, safety concerns, and privacy
    concerns were reasons for resistance. We believe that these findings contribute
    to a better understanding of the phenomenon under study and can inform the development
    of AI and robot services that are more user-friendly and effective for customers.
    Furthermore, this study could serve as a starting point for further knowledge
    developments in AI and hospitality scholarship. By continuing to explore the factors
    that influence the adoption and resistance of AI and robots in the hospitality
    sector, we can better understand how these technologies can be harnessed to enhance
    customer satisfaction, improve efficiency, and advance responsible innovation
    in the industry. CRediT authorship contribution statement Conceptualization; Data

  description: In this study, we analyse the value creation of Industry 4.0 (I40)
    technologies in flexible manufacturing (FM) under a sustainability perspective.
    I40 is a popular strategy that Western manufacturing organizations adopt to face
    competition from low-cost producers. Organizations adopting I40 use advanced digital
    technologies to make production processes more flexible and increasingly automated.
    Several pieces of evidence confirm how I40 leads to higher productivity and higher-quality
    products, improving the economic performance of organizations. However, increasing
    automation may also lead to the reduction of human labour in the production process,
    which may contribute to the disappearance of jobs, the reduction of expertise
    and the loss of know-how in manufacturing organizations. While the literature
    acknowledges the technical and economic advantages of I40, the sustainability
    of the value created through these technologies deserves further investigation.
    To address the gap, we complement the IT value theory with the concept of sustainability,
    including the three dimensions of economic, environmental and social sustainability.
    We perform a multiple case study analysis of four Italian manufacturing organizations
    that have successfully implemented I40 technologies in FM. The cases show that
    I40 technologies support sustainable organizational value when they are deployed
    with a worker-centric approach. In this condition, the organization leverages
    workforce activities to continuously fine-tune the technologies and to exploit
    the adaptive features of the technologies to continuously improve processes.

    value creation of Industry 4.0 (I40) technologies in flexible manufacturing (FM)
    under a sustainability perspective. I40 is a popular strategy that Western manufacturing
    organizations adopt to face competition from low-cost producers. Organizations
    adopting I40 use advanced digital technologies to make production processes more
    flexible and increasingly automated. Several pieces of evidence confirm how I40
    leads to higher productivity and higher-quality products, improving the economic
    performance of organizations. However, increasing automation may also lead to
    the reduction of human labour in the production process, which may contribute
    to the disappearance of jobs, the reduction of expertise and the loss of know-how
    in manufacturing organizations. While the literature acknowledges the technical
    and economic advantages of I40, the sustainability of the value created through
    these technologies deserves further investigation. To address the gap, we complement
    the IT value theory with the concept of sustainability, including the three dimensions
    of economic, environmental and social sustainability. We perform a multiple case
    study analysis of four Italian manufacturing organizations that have successfully
    implemented I40 technologies in FM. The cases show that I40 technologies support
    sustainable organizational value when they are deployed with a worker-centric
    approach. In this condition, the organization leverages workforce activities to
    continuously fine-tune the technologies and to exploit the adaptive features of
    the technologies to continuously improve processes. Similar content being viewed

    Chapter © 2023 The Perspectives of Integration Between Lean Manufacturing and
    Industry 4.0 Chapter © 2021 A Framework for Leveraging Twin Transition in the
    Manufacturing Industry Chapter © 2023 1 Introduction Over the last years, the
    advancement of information technology (IT) has enabled the digital transformation
    of organizations in many sectors (Matt et al. 2015). The exploitation and integration
    of IT allows the reshaping of entire business models, thus supporting the creation
    of novel forms of value for organizations (Mikalef et al. 2020). Consequently,
    data has become one of the most valuable organizational resources, and scholars
    and practitioners are particularly interested in studying how digital transformation
    can support the creation of a sustainable society (Pappas et al. 2018). In this
    context, the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry plays a crucial
    role. Manufacturing is a core industry in a nation’s economy (Li 2018) and has
    already seen a decline in employment levels due to automation (Frey and Osborne
    2017; Wright and Schultz 2018). Currently, industrial initiatives that go under
    the name Industry 4.0 (I40) are furthering the digital transformation of manufacturing
    organizations to improve the production process, support a sustainable society
    and create sustainable value generation opportunities (Thoben et al. 2017). Organizations
    employ I40 technologies to adopt flexible manufacturing (FM), thus increasing
    the level of automation, to face competition from low-cost producers (Kagermann
    et al. 2013). I40 technologies include, for example, the Internet of Things (IoT),
    robotics, big data analytics and cloud manufacturing (Bednar and Welch 2020; Günther
    et al. 2017; Kang et al. 2016) and allow the deployment of programmable, interconnected
    cyber-physical systems that control machinery automatically in assembly lines.
    The way in which organizations use I40 technologies allows addressing problems
    on the assembly line without human interaction through autonomous machines (Lee
    et al. 2015). Several studies in the literature affirm how these technologies
    improve the economic performance of organizations. I40 technologies in FM enhance
    the efficiency and flexibility of production processes and deliver economic value
    in the form of higher productivity, higher-quality products (Fatorachian and Kazemi
    2018), optimized logistics performance (Braccini and Margherita 2019; Lee et al.
    2015), improved inventory management and shorter time to market (Ben-Daya et al.
    2017). Other studies report benefits in the form of a reduced number of work-related
    accidents, improved workplace safety conditions and improved workforce morale
    (Braccini and Margherita 2019; Lee et al. 2018, 2017). While the technical and
    economic advantages of I40 technologies in FM are clear in the literature, the
    sustainability of the value created through these technologies deserves further
    investigation. I40 technologies in FM differ from traditional technologies studied
    in information systems (IS) research because they target operational activities
    rather than administrative ones and make them digital (Lasi et al. 2014). Several
    studies of I40 technologies in FM use a ‘technocentric’ approach and consider
    increasing automation as a means to reduce the workforce, thus contributing to
    the disappearance of jobs (Kang et al. 2016). Even when not replacing people with
    robots, I40 technologies in FM contribute to the impoverishment of the labour
    force, as automated cyber-physical systems take on tasks previously performed
    by human workers (Liao et al. 2017; Nurazwa et al. 2019). I40 technologies in
    FM may also eventually lead to organizations losing competencies, expertise and
    know-how (Bonekamp and Sure 2015). The progress in digital transformation changes
    how organizations work and leads to different interactions among people and in
    society (Mikalef et al. 2020). Therefore, we believe investigating the value delivered
    by I40 technologies in FM should go beyond looking at the economic outcome of
    adopting the technology to examine the sustainable value creation of I40, a perspective
    that is missing in the literature. To address the gap, we frame our work within
    the IT value debate, which mainly focuses on the economic benefits of adopting
    IT, and look at the triple bottom line (TBL) of sustainability (Elkington 1997).
    The TBL of sustainability is an analytical framework that considers how organizations
    address the economic, environmental and social impacts (Jayaprakash and Pillai
    2019). According to the TBL perspective, organizations deliver sustainable value
    and support a sustainable society when they help meet the needs of the current
    generation without compromising the possibility of future generations to meet
    their needs. To deliver sustainable value, organizations must seek a balance among
    economic benefits, environmentally friendly action and human and social capital
    development (Kiel et al. 2017; Littig and Griessler 2005). In this paper, we conduct
    a multiple case study analysis of four Italian manufacturing organizations that
    have successfully implemented I40 technologies in FM without eliminating jobs.
    The study answers the research question How do I40 technologies support sustainable
    organizational value in FM? In analysing these cases, we contribute to the literature
    in two ways. First, we describe how the adoption of I40 technology in FM leads
    to sustainable organizational value and positive economic, environmental and social
    sustainability outcomes, thus supporting the development of a sustainable society.
    Second, we employ the TBL of sustainability in the IT value discourse to analyse
    the sustainable organizational value of I40 adoption in FM. The structure of the
    paper is as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the theoretical framing of the
    paper. In Section 3, we describe the research design, the case selection criteria
    and the protocol for data analysis and collection. In Section 4, we present the
    evidence from the multiple case studies. In Section 5, we detail the results.
    In Section 6, we discuss the implications for both researchers and managers. In
    Section 7, we offer some conclusions. 2 Theoretical Background We frame our work
    within two separate literature streams that we describe in the following subsections.
    In subsection 2.1, we summarize the debate on IT value and the studies investigating
    how I40 technologies in FM deliver value. In subsection 2.2, we introduce the
    concept of sustainability as a means to extend the perspective of IT value studies.
    In subsections 2.3 and 2.4, we summarize the current state of the art of sustainable
    value generation of I40 technologies in FM and identify the gaps we aim to address
    with this research paper. 2.1 Information Technology Value There is a long-standing
    debate in the IS literature on the potential economic benefits of investing in
    IT that has engaged scholars for a long time (Braccini 2011; Melville et al. 2004;
    Shea et al. 2019). The main question underpinning the IT value debate is whether
    and under what conditions IT investments deliver economic value to organizations
    (Devaraj and Kohli 2003; Melville et al. 2004; Scheepers and Scheepers 2008).
    This question is crucial for both researchers and practitioners to guide them
    on IT investments and on calculating returns on IT investments (Grover and Kohli
    2012; Kohli and Devaraj 2003; Kohli and Grover 2008). Despite some controversial
    results that support the irrelevance of IT investments for organizational performance
    (Im et al. 2001; Wagner and Weitzel 2007), several studies confirm that IT investments
    lead to a variety of organizational benefits. Early studies pointed out that IT
    value depends on organizational expenditure on IT. More recent studies have postulated
    that the way IT is managed within organizations and the environmental context
    affect the generation of value (Kohli and Devaraj 2003). The research confirms
    that IT does create value (Grover and Kohli 2012; Kohli and Grover 2008; Melville
    et al. 2004). The value is not created by individual digital technologies alone
    but in combination with contextual conditions and in a process that generates
    value (Melville et al. 2004; Wade and Hulland 2004). The benefits of IT manifest
    in different forms that are not necessarily immediate (Barua et al. 1995; Kohli
    and Devaraj 2003). Finally, IT results in profound changes in the way organizations
    manage their business, and its capability to deliver value is mediated by several
    factors (Kohli and Grover 2008). From a theoretical point of view, IT interacts
    with organizational resources, both human and technical, to improve business process
    performance and eventually overall organizational performance (Melville et al.
    2004). Inside organizations, IT does not deliver value in isolation but rather
    in a synergic interaction between technological and organizational factors (Kohli
    and Grover 2008). Contextual factors at the industry level or country level can
    also influence the actual potential of organizations to obtain value from IT investments
    (Melville et al. 2004). To date, studies have concentrated on explaining how and
    to what extent IT delivers value to increase the efficiency and productivity of
    organizations (Schryen 2013). IT is generally seen as a driver of various economic
    benefits, such as cost reduction, business process improvement, improved productivity
    and improved operational outcomes (Trantopoulos et al. 2017). Much of the literature
    studies IS aspects such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship
    management (CRM) that create economic value by improving administrative, managerial
    and strategical activities, thus facilitating business growth, operational cost
    reduction, decision making and planning (Shang and Seddon 2000). IT investment
    at the firm level mitigates the negative effects of downsizing, increases production
    efficiency (Cespedes-Lorente et al. 2018) and improves cooperation and collaboration
    among the workforce (Aral et al. 2012). At the macro level (industry or country),
    IT investment can increase production efficiency and labour productivity (Lee
    et al. 2011). Recently, some studies relating to the debate on IT value have shifted
    the focus to the study of I40 technologies, such as robotics, big data, integrated
    logistics, and the IoT, as concerns have been raised among practitioners and scholars
    regarding their value generation potential (Günther et al. 2017; Mikalef et al.
    2020; Nicolescu et al. 2018; Pappas et al. 2018). Outside the IS literature, the
    study of I40 has moved from a technocentric perspective of the technical benefits
    vis-à-vis assembly line production to discuss the organizational benefits of I40
    technologies in FM. The evidence reveals that I40 technologies in FM deliver economic
    benefits in different ways through increased automation of assembly line production
    (Kagermann et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2015). I40 technologies in FM promise to deliver
    higher productivity, higher-quality products and valuable services, enhancing
    production process efficiency and flexibility (Fatorachian and Kazemi 2018). Furthermore,
    I40 technologies in FM improve customer satisfaction through the increased personalization
    capabilities of production processes (Kagermann et al. 2013) and by facilitating
    the rapid transfer of customer requirements into production processes (Leitao
    et al. 2016). I40 technologies help generate economic value by improving inventory
    management effectiveness and supply chain efficiency, with outcomes such as reduced
    inventory inaccuracy, reduced time to market and just-in-time inventory management
    (Ben-Daya et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018). 2.2 The Concept of Sustainability To
    develop a sustainable society, organizations must move from value generation to
    sustainable value generation by prioritizing sustainability goals (Hart and Milstein
    2003). According to the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainability is described
    as a form of economic development that ‘meets the needs of the present without
    compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’ (WCED
    1987 p. 43). The concept of sustainability encompasses the association of environmental
    protection with societal development that must be addressed by organizations together
    with their economic development objectives (Elkington 1997). Therefore, the concept
    of TBL sustainability (Elkington 1997; Jayaprakash and Pillai 2019) that concerns
    the economic, environmental and social impacts of activities is particularly relevant.
    The economic aspect relates to the organizational idea to generate economic value
    in order to guarantee the possibility of delivering products and services to the
    market with a mark-up between revenues and costs, either through increased added
    value in the production or through cost reduction during the production process
    (Kiel et al. 2017). The environmental dimension refers to the organizational idea
    to create value in order to alleviate pressure on the environment through rationalizing
    the use of natural resources, efficient energy consumption, renewal energy consumption
    and reducing emissions and pollution (Braccini and Margherita 2019; Hertel and
    Wiesent 2013). The social dimension refers to the organizational idea to create
    value in order to conduct fair business practices to benefit the workforce, the
    community and society in general. This dimension broadens the perspective of the
    organization to cover all stakeholders. It requires the organization to manage
    long-term survival and simultaneously deal with social issues related to community
    involvement, employee relations, fair wages, quality of life, social integration
    in communities, solidarity, equity and justice and equal opportunities in education
    (Kiel et al. 2017). The economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability
    are interdependent. To achieve sustainable value creation, organizations need
    to embrace all three dimensions in their business models (Jayaprakash and Pillai
    2019). However, the three dimensions are frequently in conflict, as actions in
    pursuit of environmental or social sustainability do not always turn into improved
    economic sustainability. 2.3 Sustainable Organizational Value of Industry 4.0
    in Flexible Manufacturing I40 technologies in FM deliver organizational value
    in terms of better management of resources along the assembly line, better management
    of operational activities, improved coordination on the assembly line and reorganization
    of labour within the production system (Fatorachian and Kazemi 2018; Kagermann
    et al. 2013; Kamble et al. 2018; Thoben et al. 2017). Literature investigating
    I40 technologies in FM is still emerging, but there is sufficient evidence on
    the potential economic benefits of I40 technologies measured in terms of higher-quality
    products, higher productivity, shorter lead time, improved customer satisfaction
    and timely and accurate management of the movement and allocation of resources
    along the assembly line. The implementation of I40 technologies also generates
    benefits in terms of the environmental dimension of sustainability through improved
    control over resource usage thanks to more accurate and granular information on
    energy and resource usage (Liang et al. 2018; Schulze et al. 2018). I40 technologies
    also help decrease the number of product defects and damaged products and reduce
    both waste in general and natural resource waste in production processes (Gabriel
    and Pessel 2016; Herrmann et al. 2014). Furthermore, I40 technologies help in
    extending the lifespan of products, thus helping improve consumer consumption
    of sustainable products (Bressanelli et al. 2018). However, the environmental
    dimension is known to be in conflict with the economic dimension, as environmentally
    sustainable products and processes are costly for companies, and customers tend
    not to be willing to pay more for cleaner products and services (Liu et al. 2009;
    Liu and Bai 2014). The literature shows contradictory results regarding the value
    of I40 technologies in terms of the social dimension. The positive outcomes relate
    to improved safety and healthier work conditions (Fatorachian and Kazemi 2018;
    Kagermann et al. 2013) and manifest in the form of fewer accidents, healthier
    work environments and improved worker morale (Braccini and Margherita 2019; Lee
    et al. 2018). However, the literature also describes a negative consequence of
    automation from the social sustainability perspective that conflicts with economic
    sustainability. This is that the adoption of I40 technologies in FM decreases
    the role of human resources through de-skilling and reducing the number of both
    low- and high-skilled workers as they are replaced by machines (Bonekamp and Sure
    2015; Kang et al. 2016; Liao et al. 2017; Nurazwa et al. 2019). 2.4 Gaps of Sustainable
    Organizational Value of Industry 4.0 in Flexible Manufacturing Table 1 summarizes
    the state of the art of the sustainable value of I40 technologies in FM. To date,
    most studies have considered one dimension of the TBL and have not addressed the
    three dimensions holistically. There is a large consensus on the potential economic
    benefits of adopting I40 technologies in FM, and the literature describes several
    technical and operational advantages. However, most of the studies adopt a ‘technocentric’
    approach (Kang et al. 2016). The technology is the main driver of the improved
    production effectiveness, and the workforce is just seen as an organizational
    cost. This is because with I40 the way human resources add value in the organization
    changes (Bonekamp and Sure 2015), and there is a potential risk of the loss of
    worker competencies and a reduction in employment levels (Liu and Zhong 2017;
    Nurazwa et al. 2019). Table 1 State of the art of sustainable value of I40 technologies
    in FM Full size table The risk of technology replacing people is inherent with
    any technological development and has occurred with previous innovations in production,
    such as with the adoption of computerized information systems and mass automation.
    The case of I40 technologies in manufacturing is different because, unlike computerized
    information systems used in administrative functions in organizations, I40 technologies
    are used in operational units. The number of workers employed in manufacturing
    is significantly higher than the number employed in administrative functions.
    In addition, if mass automation has reduced the number of workers it has been
    compensated for by the expansion of markets thanks to increased consumerism. A
    similar change is less likely today with saturated markets. The literature highlights
    that increasing automation positively impacts workforce activities, delivering
    positive outcomes relating to the individual dimensions of sustainability (Gabriel
    and Pessel 2016). With I40 technologies in FM, operational and decision-making
    tasks are passed to machinery, while human workers deal with machinery malfunctions
    and unexpected issues (Gabriel and Pessel 2016; Kagermann et al. 2013). I40 technologies
    in FM create healthier and safer environments around workers. The workforce benefits
    in the form of better working conditions, fewer severe accidents and improved
    morale (Gregori et al. 2018; Kembro et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2018). At the same
    time, I40 technologies in FM offer the potential to extend the tenure of senior
    workers in the workplace by reducing physical strain (Stock and Seliger 2016).
    We find a gap in the current research on the sustainable value creation of I40
    technologies in FM. One issue is the lack of a comprehensive assessment of the
    value delivered by I40 technologies in light of the TBL of sustainability. Several
    studies have focused on individual dimensions without considering rebound effects
    on the other dimensions. Few have considered the multi-dimensional aspect of sustainable
    value creation holistically. Another issue relates to the different nature of
    the three dimensions of the TBL, which can conflict with each other. The conflict
    between the economic and environmental dimensions is described in the literature,
    but we also find a conflict between the economic and social dimensions of the
    sustainable value of I40 technologies in FM that results in a trade-off. I40 technologies
    lead to increased automation and better work environments. The consequences are
    a potentially de-skilled staff and reduced staff or a longer work life and thus
    less generational change in the workforce. Under this perspective, we find the
    outcomes of adopting I40 technologies in FM contradictory. On one side, I40 technologies
    in FM contribute to putting products of higher quality and higher value on the
    market. On the other side, they contribute to a social environment with potentially
    poorer customers (as staff is reduced and new generations do not replace older
    ones). The contradiction emerges from the fact that the adoption of I40 technologies
    helps improve processes and organizational performance but at the same time contributes
    to reducing the spending capacity of the workers replaced by machines, leading
    to a society with a decreased ability to buy higher-value products. 3 Research
    Design In this paper, we performed a multiple case study analysis because it favours
    the collection of rich data in multiple contexts (Yin 2018). This methodology
    allows for cross-case comparisons to clarify whether the findings are idiosyncratic
    to a single case or apply to several cases (Yin 2018). Multiple case study analysis
    allows establishing patterns of relationships between constructs within and across
    cases with their underlying logical arguments by recursive cycling among the case
    data. The method consists of selecting multiple cases, triangulating data during
    data collection and analysing the data both within cases and across cases (Eisenhardt
    1989; Yin 2018). 3.1 Case Selection In this paper, we analyse four cases selected
    according to four criteria: 1 The case units are manufacturing organizations.
    2 All case units share similar contextual (country = Italy) and structural dimensions
    (medium-sized manufacturing organizations). 3 The case units operate in different
    industries in manufacturing. 4 The case units adopted I40 technologies to implement
    FM. Concerning the fourth criterion, we opted to include organizations adopting
    various I40 technologies for FM, which allowed us to study the different ways
    the implementation of I40 technologies in FM create value while addressing sustainability
    issues. Table 2 describes the I40 technologies adopted by the cases in this study.
    All the cases transitioned from traditional production to FM through the adoption
    of I40 technologies. Table 2 Industry 4.0 technologies in flexible manufacturing
    Full size table We consider the following exemplary cases (Yin 2018) because they
    allow us to explore how the management of I40 technologies in FM currently and
    potentially address sustainability issues. The cases are described below. Case
    A: This is a manufacturer of sanitary ceramics that implemented mechanical arms
    and automated forklifts in a fully automated and integrated process in which workers
    perform supervisory roles and fine-tune IoT-controlled machinery. The company
    also has a traditional labour-intensive process in place. Case B: This is a kitchen
    furniture manufacturer that automated part of the transformation process in which
    workers supervise IoT-controlled machinery and that deployed IS on the assembly
    line to support workers in the assembly task. Case C: This is a leather manufacturer
    that integrated digital technologies to improve the traceability of materials
    and operations on the assembly line in a tracking system that assists workers
    and provides visibility in terms of the time and costs needed to complete lots
    and to respect performance targets. Case D: This is a manufacturer industry that
    produces orthopedic prosthesis that adopted autonomous mechanical arms in the
    manufacturing process in which workers have a supervisory role and perform manual
    tasks to finalize the product. The company also integrated a tracking system for
    materials and operations using barcodes. 3.2 Data Collection In this multiple
    case study, we triangulated different data sources (Denzin 2006). We had the opportunity
    to visit each organization in 2019. Each visit lasted approximately three hours,
    during which we conducted semi-structured interviews with key informants among
    the workers and the management following the track indicated in Table 3. The management
    interviewees were the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief production officer
    (CPO), the chief information officer (CIO) or the chief human resource officer
    (CHRO) and chief quality officer (CQO). We also chose to interview the entire
    steering committee that drove the innovation in each organization. Among the workers,
    we decided to interview a representative employed before the adoption of I40 technologies
    who remained with the company after the adoption. All interviews were conducted
    face-to-face, recorded and transcribed. All the respondents are males aged 40–60,
    except the CHRP and CPO of Cases C and D, who are females aged 30–50. Table 3
    Interview track Full size table Guided by the management, we observed the production
    lines, the operation of smart machines and control systems and the activities
    performed by workers on the line. Table 4 presents the data sources in detail.
    Table 4 Details of data sources Full size table We transcribed the interviews
    and compiled field notes after the observations, which we added to the data we
    analysed. We made use of secondary data in the form of official balance statements
    of the companies that provided information on the companies’ financial performance,
    the official web sites of the companies and web articles to reduce subjectivity
    regarding the adopted I40 technologies in FM. We acquired the latter from the
    official web page of the companies and included them in the data corpus, as they
    provided further details regarding how the companies create sustainable value.
    Finally, we collected all the data sources in a data corpus and integrated it
    into a single research database for each case, which we coded following the guidelines
    for the validity and reliability of qualitative inquiry (Corbin and Strauss 2015).
    3.3 Data Analysis We conducted data analysis and cross-case analysis using computer-assisted
    qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) as a supporting tool. We joined the
    transcriptions of the primary and secondary sources of data in a single research
    database. In total, we coded about 20,000 words of interview transcriptions and
    field notes and 38,000 words of secondary data. We made use of both first, and
    second-level codes. We first analysed data from each case, identifying how managing
    the adoption of I40 technologies in FM created sustainable value. To maintain
    qualitative rigour, we followed the principles of qualitative enquiry (Corbin
    and Strauss 2015). We then conducted cross-case analyses, comparing the findings
    across cases. We explored similar concepts and relationships across cases, comparing
    the categories identified from each case. Only one of the two authors coded the
    materials in CAQDAS. Both authors regularly discussed the results of the coding
    together. The single coder coded the materials in several iterations; this was
    followed by discussions with the other author. The coding procedure stopped when
    both authors agreed on the results of the coding. We arrived at the findings after
    three iteration rounds and adopting a two-fold saturation criterion: (i) all the
    data sources could be coded with the set coding structure and (ii) the research
    team agreed on the results of the coding. When there were conflicts in the accounts
    of the participants, we organized follow-up phone calls for clarifications. Table
    5 illustrates the coding data structure used in our analysis. We provide a sample
    of the coded materials from all cases in Table 11 in the appendix. Table 5 Coding
    data structure Full size table 4 Case Description In this section, we describe
    the four cases. For each case, we describe the production process, the changes
    introduced with I40 technologies in FM and the consequences in terms of sustainable
    value outcomes of FM implementation. 4.1 Case A Case A is a manufacturer of sanitary
    ceramics. Before the adoption of I40 technologies, the company’s production process
    was labour-intensive and dangerous for the health of workers. During several production
    steps, workers were subject to inhaling soft powder (chalk). They also worked
    in a high-temperature environment (the working temperature of the oven is about
    1200°) and carried heavy loads. Workers manually operated machines and moved products
    and materials down the assembly line. Any mismanagement in terms of handling the
    materials could decrease the quality of the product or increase the defect rate.
    Information about the production process was collected manually and was limited
    to the amount of outputs. The company then adopted I40 technologies in FM and
    improved the production process with self-driving forklifts, automated robotized
    arms and fully automatic conveyors. All this machinery is integrated through IoT,
    resulting in a fully digital audit trail of operations keeping track of materials,
    workers and machines. In this integrated assembly line, the intervention of humans
    is limited to a few machine tasks that could not be fully automated. Generally,
    the workforce supervises the automatic operations and continuously improves the
    process by fine-tuning the machines to reduce the defect rate and improve output
    quality. To that end, the company introduced CAD and CAD designers to design products
    and set up an internal R&D department. The R&D department continuously experiments
    with materials and production steps to facilitate further product and process
    improvements. The transformation of the assembly line took five years. The management
    planned the innovation and discussed the plan with all workers, presenting the
    investment as necessary to guarantee the long-term survival of the company in
    a market dominated by low-cost producers in countries with low labour costs. It
    was soon evident that the innovation resulted in a significant change in workforce
    operations and competencies. The company offered workers the opportunity to leave
    if they were not willing to learn new skills, and all those who accepted were
    enrolled in vocational training courses over the course of the five-year transformation.
    At the end of the transformation of the production process, the company kept in
    place the traditional process for small batch customer orders with limited quantities.
    The transformation resulted in a number of different outcomes: output increased
    by 30%; lead time decreased, even with a broader variety of products; the defect
    rate plummeted from the original 30% down to 9%; and the use of resources (energy,
    water, heat and raw materials) was optimized. The I40 machinery monitored the
    entire production process; the tracking of goods improved, and order fulfilment
    inaccuracy decreased. The data produced are now continuously analysed, resulting
    in comprehensive reports on the status of the machinery and predictions regarding
    future production trends. The workers’ duties were also enriched. The company
    kept the old and the new assembly lines. New employees work next to skilled workers
    on the old assembly line to learn the technicalities of the work. When they are
    deemed ready, they move to the I40 assembly line and act as supervisors who optimize
    the machines. The knowledge dimension of the work increased. On the assembly line,
    workers program the machines to be more efficient and avoid defects and autonomously
    solve issues when the machines stop. They also provide feedback on any malfunctions
    of the I40 technologies to improve the production process. The company also required
    new R&D capability and therefore hired new employees with the necessary skills.
    In the study period, the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (EBITDA) remained stable and, after a decline at the beginning of the transformation
    in 2015, the workforce remained almost constant (see Table 6). Table 6 Balance
    sheet report for Case A Full size table 4.2 Case B Case B is a manufacturer of
    custom kitchen furnishings which assembles standardized furniture parts to deliver
    kitchens configured on the bases of customers’ needs. Before the adoption of I40
    technologies, workers cut components from wood panelling with semi-manual cutting
    machines. They manually picked up the components, transported them along the assembly
    line, assembled them and delivered them to the warehouse. Information on the process
    was in the form of paper-based bills of components that workers used to assemble
    the furniture. The process was inefficient due to a high defect rate caused by
    the mishandling of materials and offered limited product customization possibilities.
    The work was physically exhausting, and part of the production environment was
    potentially unhealthy due to the presence of sawdust. After adopting I40 technologies
    in FM, the cutting phase became fully automated through the use of mechanical
    arms and digitally programmable sewing machines. This machinery optimized the
    cutting phase, maximized the number of components obtainable from a standard wooden
    panel and reduced waste and dust. The outbound phase of the production process
    was also automated, and the warehouse was equipped with IoT sensors. The movement
    of furniture parts in the warehouse is now autonomous. In the warehouse, the finished
    products are sorted and grouped according to customer order and the delivery destination
    to optimize space (5,000 components are now stored in the same space previously
    used to store 1,000 components). The assembly phase is still manual. Computer
    screens are used to show workers the assembly instructions, and semi-automatic
    conveyors present the components to the workers in the right sequence to minimize
    the number of movements and simplify their work. Excluding those employed in the
    assembly phase, workers supervise the machinery, checking the production phases,
    product quality and specifications for the rest of the production process. The
    innovation took three years, and workers attended vocational training to learn
    how to work with the new machines. The innovation had several outcomes, including
    the optimization of resource usage and the reduction of waste. Exhausting and
    dangerous tasks were transferred to autonomous machinery, thus reducing work accidents
    and resulting in a safer environment free of sawdust and powder. The workforce
    activities are now more complex, and workers have greater responsibility, as they
    also act as machine supervisors. Workers are also in the change of providing feedback
    to improve the machinery operation, as they have direct experience of how the
    machinery works. Experienced workers have a further duty to teach younger workers
    to manage the technology through on-the-job training. After the implementation
    of I40 technologies, the company had to employ more workers. Table 7 illustrates
    that after the adoption of I40 technologies in FM in 2017, the EBITDA increased
    along with the sales and profits. The number of workers also steadily increased
    because the improved quality of the products increased demand. Table 7 Balance
    sheet report for Case B Full size table 4.3 Case C Case C is a textile manufacturing
    company where the production was entirely by hand before the adoption of I40 technologies.
    The process had four phases—manual cutting, dyeing, assembly and packaging. The
    list of components circulated along the assembly line on paper. The workers used
    this to manually mark production progress. The process lacked accurate information
    on time and quantity produced in each phase and in total. The company improved
    the process by adopting a traceability system with advanced analytics to accurately
    measure the time for each production step. The company developed the system in-house
    and established an IT department to manage and maintain it. The granularity of
    data is at the microphase level and traces each worker, phase and product. Furthermore,
    the IT and HR departments developed a competence pattern and illustrations to
    facilitate the production for each microphase. The management informed the workers
    about the innovation project and provided vocational training to learn how to
    work with the new technologies. In the new process, workers use a tablet that
    contains the interface of the traceability system and the target for production
    time and costs. The advanced analytics system produces performance statistics
    and displays them in real time on TV screens on the assembly line. The screens
    display the targeted performance level with a green smiley face if on target or
    a red one if not on target. Using reports produced by the data analytics system,
    the managers can identify workers who regularly perform below standards and discuss
    with them counter-measures to improve their performance, including the possibility
    to attend vocational courses, to train to improve skills or to discuss the pace
    of the work. Workers who perform well receive extra compensation. Thus, the workers
    are motivated to complete the production steps in less time. The adoption of FM
    results in more efficient production, better coordination among units, reduced
    waste and a reduced defect rate. The time spent on production steps is also reduced.
    The tablet helps workers perform better by providing detailed, visual instructions
    on the movements they need to perform to avoid mistakes. The workers can manage
    the tasks they perform by helping each other, in particular to speed up underperforming
    lines. They are supported in this by the screens showing the trends of daily production
    in real time and comparing the trends with the target set for each day. The workforce
    also becomes more proficient in the competencies required for crafting leather
    through vocational training. In fact, apprentices acquire a specialisation over
    the entire production process and experienced workers acquire competencies in
    different production steps and reinforced knowledge about the production steps
    they are in charge of. Table 8 shows the situation after the transition to FM
    in 2017. EBITDA and sales increased, while the number of employees remained almost
    stable. Table 8 Balance sheet report for Case C Full size table 4.4 Case D Case
    D is a manufacturer of orthopaedic prostheses where production was executed manually
    by workers. The prostheses must be custom designed, tested on the clients and
    refined by workers to improve the ergonomics and improve the clients’ range of
    motion to the maximum extent. Before the adoption of I40 technologies, workers
    employed production sheets to manage the production steps. These sheets also provided
    information to orthopaedists in case of production delays. The production took
    place in an unhealthy work environment with chalk powder in the air. In addition,
    the information concerning time and performance was inaccurate. The process was
    done manually by workers who used pen and paper to record the time it took to
    perform the various tasks. These records were often incomplete, as workers often
    forgot to mark time or mismarked it. This lack of information caused problems
    in administrative processes as well. Patients needed to visit the company several
    times to get their prostheses and invoices. After the adoption of I40, the process
    improved. The use of robotized arms and a tracking system to keep track of the
    time spent on each step of the production process increased efficiency. The system
    uses barcode scanners and is integrated with the digital billing system. Workers
    attended vocational training to learn how to work with the new I40 technologies.
    The management also established a new digital administration unit. The administrative
    and production information is now integrated, and the company is able to track
    the clinical history and bills of the patients. The new production process is
    semi-automated; the robotized arms develop the initial shape and surface of the
    prostheses in a separate room, and the workers refine the prostheses manually.
    The workers supervise the mechanical arms, which increased production flexibility,
    reduced the use of chalk and thus improved working conditions. Along the production
    process, workers employ a tablet to mark the start and finish time for each production
    step using barcode scanners. The system gathers data from the production process
    and provides real-time information to orthopaedists and descriptive statistics
    to the management. The system data are integrated into the digital billing system,
    which delivers a bill when the prostheses are finished. The information flow and
    traceability of the process are now improved. The improved information accuracy
    helps orthopaedists with subsequent prosthesis modification because the system
    stores the clinical history of the patients. Through the tracking system, FM has
    resulted in increased efficiency because the workers do not waste time with manually
    reporting information. In addition, the possibility of making mistakes has been
    reduced. Workers can now just focus on improving product quality. The system also
    improved the process of ensuring alignment between technical information about
    the protheses and administrative billing information for customers. Table 9 illustrates
    that following the FM adoption in 2017, EBITDA and net profit increased by 65%
    and 97%, respectively, whereas the number of workers increased by two units. Table
    9 Balance sheet report for Case D Full size table 5 Analysis and Findings Table
    10 summarizes the outcomes of the adoption of I40 technologies in FM for the case
    companies. Several outcomes are consistent across all the cases, while others
    are particular to just some. Concerning the economic dimension of the TBL of sustainability,
    the results show in all cases that the adoption of I40 technologies in FM created
    value through a more efficient production process and better circulation of information.
    The production process efficiency is manifested by different performance indexes—level
    of output, reduced defect rate, improved product quality and reduced lead time.
    In Case A and Case B, the improved circulation of information was instrumental
    in the performance improvement, as information produced by I40 machinery can be
    continuously used to scrutinize process performance and spot improvement opportunities.
    In Case C and Case D, better information circulation is evident in the integration
    of technical and administrative data, which contributes to improving accuracy
    in handling customers’ orders. Furthermore, better information circulation also
    helps workers, as they are able to view their performance and the performance
    of the whole line in real time and compare them to benchmarks or targets. Table
    10 Sustainable value of I40 technologies in FM by sustainability dimension Full
    size table Concerning the environmental dimension, the analysis revealed how the
    production processes became more efficient after the adoption of I40 technologies
    in FM, with reduced residual waste, a decrease in the number of defective products
    and rationalized use of natural resources and energy. In Cases A, B and D, the
    reduction of waste and number of defective products (which cannot be reprocessed)
    is a consequence of introducing automated machinery that can perform difficult
    tasks more easily and that can handle the materials more accurately and optimize
    the use of raw materials. In Case C, the reduction of waste is the consequence
    of the use of digital technologies that guide workers on the operations they have
    to perform to reduce mistakes. Concerning the social dimension, a main outcome
    of the adoption of I40 technologies in FM for all case companies is better work
    conditions. In Cases A, B and D, the automation through robots reduces the number
    of labour-intensive tasks for workers and reduces the likelihood of workplace
    accidents or becoming ill (e.g. as a result of inhaling fine particles of powder).
    In Case C, the tracking system helps workers keep the pace and visualise their
    performance in real time and reduces the stress of potential disputes with management
    regarding the level of performance. The workers also gain improved competencies
    and new skills for working with I40 technologies in FM in all cases. Companies
    can then defend the workers’ positions, as many employees who possessed only artisan
    skills in the traditional production process remained in the company as operators.
    In all cases, we found new positions to fully exploit the adoption of I40 technologies
    in FM. However, these positions appear to replace or transform existing ones due
    to the profound difference in competencies between traditional manufacturing and
    FM. The new positions are knowledge-intensive jobs that exploit the information
    produced by I40 digital assembly lines to run either R&D activities or continuous
    improvement activities. The social dimension differs the most across the cases,
    as we found some outcomes only in some specific cases. The analysis of the cases
    revealed different forms of empowerment of the workforce that depend on the characteristics
    of the production process and are therefore not consistent across the cases. The
    forms of empowerment are related to either the shift from operational to supervision
    roles, better knowledge of the overall production process or the possibility of
    making decisions on the content of the tasks needing to be performed, suggesting
    improvements and solving problems on the assembly line. The conflicts in the literature
    are between the economic and environmental dimensions and between the economic
    and social dimensions. We also found increased worker control over the tasks they
    perform, the possibility to self-organize to help each other in teams or on the
    assembly line and the possibility to suggest how to change the pace or other aspects
    of the production process. However, the evidence is not consistent across the
    cases, as we did not observe these outcomes in all cases. 6 Discussion According
    to the literature, I40 technologies in FM contribute to the development of a sustainable
    society by creating sustainable value in manufacturing organizations when they
    address all the dimensions of the TBL. Any technology in an organization should
    be implemented to achieve meaningful outcomes and generate business value (Mikalef
    et al. 2020). The literature shows that the creation of sustainable value through
    I40 technologies is challenging for organizations, as the three dimensions of
    the TBL are in conflict (Braccini and Margherita 2019; Kiel et al. 2017). In particular,
    the economic dimension and the social dimension conflict, as I40 technologies
    can contribute to improving the performance of a firm but also cause the social
    dimension to deteriorate due to the de-skilling of workers or a reduction in the
    level of employment (Bonekamp and Sure 2015; Nurazwa et al. 2019). Manufacturing
    organizations have already experienced automation and a consequent disruption
    of work for blue-collar workers (Frey and Osborne 2017). The adoption of I40 technologies
    continues this erosion, thus hampering the development of a sustainable society.
    The analysis of our cases revealed that I40 technologies can be adopted in FM
    to support all the dimensions of sustainability and thus can deliver sustainable
    organizational value and contribute to building a sustainable society. In line
    with the IT value theory, I40 technologies in FM deliver economic value through
    various process improvements that eventually improve organizational performance
    measured by economic performance indicators. The process improvements introduced
    by I40 technologies are in the form of increased automation, using automated machinery
    for dangerous tasks, human supervision of machinery and timely and accurate information.
    These improvements lead to sustainable organizational outcomes for all three dimensions
    of the TBL—improved process performance (economic), reduced resource usage (environmental)
    and better work conditions, new job positions and new units (social). Improved
    process performance translates into improved economic performance, as companies
    can deliver high-quality, defect-free, customized products to the market. The
    reduced resource usage promotes more sustainable products and services thanks
    to the reduced need for energy and the reduction of waste. While the better working
    conditions have a motivational effect in terms of workers’ morale (Braccini and
    Margherita 2019; Lee et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2017), the need to have skilled supervisors
    and the availability of timely and accurate information offer workers new opportunities
    to take on new roles and responsibilities, with several new knowledge-intensive
    positions appearing in organizations and new job roles on the assembly line. Such
    opportunities contribute to social sustainability, as in this way organizations
    implementing I40 technologies in FM can defend employment levels and promote a
    sustainable society. On one side, the number of workers required declines due
    to automation. On the other side, organizations can offer workers with the right
    skills and knowledge jobs operating I40 machinery or positions related to planning,
    controlling and researching that the shift to FM stimulates. Figure 1 visually
    summarizes how I40 technologies in FM support sustainable organizational value
    creation. Fig. 1 Sustainable organizational value generation by I40 technologies
    Full size image Under this perspective, data plays a crucial role in supporting
    the organizational sustainability of manufacturing companies and thus in the development
    of a sustainable society. I40 technologies on the assembly line allow companies
    to collect data on processes, which previously was unfeasible. The growing amount
    of organizational data lays the foundation for novel roles, as companies require
    a highly skilled workforce capable of analysing and managing that data. Thus,
    companies compensate for the disappearance of jobs due to automation with novel
    positions related to data management. However, we believe such results are only
    possible when I40 technologies are deployed with a worker-centric approach to
    enhance the capabilities of the workforce and thus improve the production process.
    Indeed, the management considered the features of automation delivered by I40
    technologies in FM as a resource to improve the economic sustainability of the
    companies, avoiding the mere adoption of technologies that could be easily imitated
    by competitors. Therefore, these organizations leveraged workers’ activities,
    including supervision, experimentation and feedback to improve the production
    process. The application of this worker-centric approach pushes organizations
    to automate all the tasks that are dangerous or in which workers might make more
    mistakes (resulting into an increased defect rate). The worker-centric approach
    has two consequences—increased knowledge intensity and continuous adaptations
    of I40 technologies. These consequences can further contribute to sustainable
    organizational value. The need for workers proficient in managing digital I40
    technologies and the availability of data produced by the technologies increase
    the relevance of the knowledge dimension of manufacturing as workers move from
    manual crafting activities to activities related to the utilisation of technology
    and related problem-solving. Within a knowledge-intensive organization, workers
    enjoy less alienating working conditions and a higher degree of job satisfaction.
    The composition of the workforce has changed both in the FM production process
    and within companies where several knowledge-intensive positions have appeared.
    The commitment to improve the production process has been pursued by both workers
    who perform activities with a high level of knowledge and act as primary drivers
    of continuous fine-tuning of the FM production process and by units related to
    I40 technologies. The analysis showed that in the case companies the adoption
    of I40 technologies in FM is accompanied to the insurgence of adaptive units (such
    as R&D units), production control units, or administrative units all exploiting
    the information produced by the I40 machinery. Another aspect of the social sustainability
    of I40 technologies in FM is the increase in employment levels due to companies’
    success in the market (like in our Case B). This requires companies to employ
    more workers to increase the number of work shifts to increase output levels.
    However, it is relevant to point out that such an increase requires a profound
    transformation of the workforce, as people need to learn new skills through vocational
    training. The number of employees is defended or increased, but they are not the
    same employees that were in the company before. Only in one case did the organization
    succeed in maintaining both the old and the new production processes. In this
    way, they could keep workers with old competencies. However, further research
    is needed to prove generalizability. From a process perspective, I40 technologies
    allow to easily incorporate these improvements to optimize automation of the production
    process. For instance, whether technology experts change the algorithm of the
    FM production process, I40 technologies afford the production process to receive
    and apply these new movements. Likewise, in case of the development of a new mixture
    or utensils for the production process, I40 technologies afford to harmonize movements
    and afford to handle them accordingly. To describe this feature, we employ the
    term adaptive to refer to technology possibility to easily implement these process
    improvements to optimize automation. The cases showed that this feature is applied
    in different ways in the production processes to improve the adaptability of the
    process—in essence, the change of materials and material flows in the process
    (Cases A and B), the change of the sequence of operations on the same machine
    (Case B) and the change of workers’ activities based on monitoring information
    (Case C). Hence, within the FM context continuous adaptation does not necessarily
    lead to the disappearance of jobs, as happened with mass-scale automation (Bonekamp
    and Sure 2015; Kang et al. 2016; Nurazwa et al. 2019). Moreover, the cases show
    the importance of management in choosing and undertaking a worker-centric approach
    in adopting I40 technologies. We argue that management plays a crucial role in
    the development of a sustainable society. Indeed, management could exploit automation
    to increase economic performance but at the same time reduce the level of employment.
    In contrast, the cases show management’s commitment to deploy I40 technologies
    to improve productivity, reduce natural resource usage and defend jobs. The cases
    also show the importance of management actions before the adoption of I40 technologies
    when they develop change management projects to address production issues and
    foresee the organizational opportunities associated with I40 technologies and
    the possibility of improving work conditions. We posited that the adoption of
    I40 technologies in FM generates sustainable value when deployed with a worker-centric
    approach and with continuous adaptation of I40 machinery. This approach encourages
    the transition to knowledge-intensive companies in which the core activities of
    workers shift from crafting activities to activities related to the utilization
    of technology and associated problem solving. This transition requires a number
    of knowledge-intensive positions. The workforce benefits from less alienating
    working conditions and a higher degree of job satisfaction. I40 technologies in
    FM should be designed to be continuously adapted for receiving and implementing
    improvements, thus enabling workforce activities to improve the FM production
    process. 6.1 Implications for Researchers and Future Avenues of Research Our study
    has certain implications for researchers. Future studies of I40 technologies in
    FM should adopt a broader research design and consider a more extensive and complex
    socio-technical system. Our work contradicts the statement that I40 technologies
    lead to reduced employment levels (Bonekamp and Sure 2015; Kang et al. 2016).
    The transformation induced by I40 technologies in FM encompasses the whole organization,
    and new positions appear in other units and not just on the assembly line. Because
    IT value manifests in different ways (Kohli and Grover 2008), the focus to study
    impacts of I40 technologies should be larger than the task and the tool used to
    perform it. The larger focus is necessary because the outcomes can appear in other
    tasks and tools activated by the outcomes produced by the technology (improved
    performance, timely and accurate information). Another implication relates to
    investigating the raise of novel knowledge-intensive positions consequent to the
    implementation of I40 technologies in FM. Future researchers should investigate
    how to manage knowledge within FM organizations and how organizations deal with
    the transition of knowledge when there is significant turnover. This includes
    dimensions related to the use of the data produced by the I40 technological infrastructure
    to generate knowledge. We believe this is a fruitful avenue of future research,
    particularly because the next technology that will impact FM is artificial intelligence.
    Artificial intelligence may change the interplay between the workforce and I40
    technologies, for example, by automating more substantial decision-making activities.
    Therefore, artificial intelligence can potentially harm the sustainable social
    outcomes created by I40 technologies we identified, with even more tasks moving
    from workers to machines. Thus, artificial intelligence has the potential to hamper
    the development of a sustainable society, as it can disrupt the novel knowledge-intensive
    roles created to manage I40 technologies and the associated data. Our study also
    invites IS research, which often focuses on the impact of administrative systems
    and data, to study IS in production departments and to investigate how data generated
    by I40 technologies on the assembly line can be integrated with the rest of the
    data organizations possess (Lasi et al. 2014). Future studies should investigate
    how and to what extent the I40 data retrieved from assembly lines are managed
    to create sustainable value for each dimension of sustainability. Our study is
    a starting point for further investigations, as it describes several technologies—notably
    the tablet containing the tracking system—to increase control of the workforce
    to deliver value. How does this data deliver additional value to organizations
    without raising concerns about privacy, surveillance and control of workers? In
    our study, we found forms of worker empowerment. However, they are not consistent
    across all the cases. Instead, in every case, workers are in a production environment
    where managers have a complete audit trail of their actions and performance. Analogously,
    our study extends the perspective of IT value, employing the TBL as an analytical
    framework to assess sustainability. With the TBL, researchers studying IT value
    can extend their enquiry into sustainable organizational value. Given the contextual
    societal situation, sustainable organizational value is an objective that organizations
    need to achieve. Hence, we see an avenue for future research to investigate how
    IT can contribute to delivering sustainable organizational value. In this study,
    we investigated four manufacturing companies, all located in Italy. While we acknowledge
    this as a limitation of the paper, we believe it does not reduce the significance
    of the study, as Italy is a relevant context for investigating I40 in FM because
    the country is the second-largest manufacturer in Europe 1. The results of our
    study are mostly generalizable in organizations operating in the European context
    that share similar characteristics – firm size, industry type, and level of governmental
    support to the adoption of these technologies – to the Italian context. Nevertheless,
    we encourage researchers to investigate the sustainability of the adoption of
    I40 technologies in FM in other contexts and countries, including developing countries,
    Asian countries and North and South American countries. 6.2 Implications for Practitioners
    Practitioners can use the results of our work as a guideline for FM organizations
    aiming to implement I40 technologies and to reduce resistance to change by workers
    scared of losing their jobs. Our study shows that I40 technologies in FM deliver
    sustainable organizational value, and it describes the potential outcomes that
    organizations can expect from the adoption of these technologies. Our results
    can also help practitioners address potential resistance to change by workers.
    Based on the case results, the role of the workers in a worker-centric deployment
    of I40 technologies is central for sustainable organizational value. Vocational
    training plays a crucial role and should be provided for each worker employed
    in the FM production process. The continuous improvement of the FM production
    process is also possible through the continuous action of workers with the competencies
    to manage FM technologies and provide feedback on the way they work. Thus, the
    transition to FM production processes does not automatically imply a reduction
    in the employment level. The study is also useful for policymakers aiming to develop
    incentives to improve worker conditions and boost innovation in the manufacturing
    industry. To date, most industrial initiatives provided financial support to organisations
    to buy I40 technologies through reduction of tax and favourable credit terms.
    Knowing how I40 technologies contribute to sustainable organizational value in
    FM, policymakers may develop more organic incentives that do not aim at stimulating
    the acquisition of the technologies but instead promote sustainable digital transformation
    of manufacturing. Finally, our study helps experts in the design of I40 technologies
    to shift from a ‘technocentric’ approach to a worker-centric approach where the
    workforce has a prominent role in the production process. Our study showed how
    the interplay between technology and people leads to sustainability value, increased
    production efficiency and ‘humanizing’ work by addressing the three dimensions
    of sustainability. 7 Conclusion and Limitations In this study, we investigated
    the value generation of I40 technologies in FM from a sustainability perspective.
    By combining the IT value theory with the concept of the TBL of sustainability,
    we investigated how I40 technologies contribute to delivering sustainable organizational
    value based on the pieces of evidence of a multiple case study. I40 technologies
    in FM generate sustainable value when deployed with a worker-centric approach
    and with a continuous adaptation of how the technologies work. I40 technologies
    lead to improved process efficiency and more timely and accurate process information.
    The improved performance of the process is manifest also through reduced energy
    usage and waste. I40 technologies move work from workers to machines, but they
    promote the raise of new job positions and units in the organization that either
    exploit the data produced by the technologies on the assembly line, or they further
    improve production capabilities through R&D or increasing amount of output. The
    study has some limitations. First, it is based only on four cases, all of which
    are located in Italy. However, to reduce this limitation we selected cases from
    different industries. Moreover, the cases selected are representative of the second-largest
    manufacturing country in Europe. Second, we intended to investigate all three
    dimensions of sustainability. However, our primary data mostly focuses on social
    and economic sustainability and less on environmental sustainability. To offset
    this, we enriched our analysis by triangulating different sources, which allowed
    us to obtain a clear and subjective picture of the remaining dimension. Notes

  description: Digitalization influences business processes and their management.
    Digital technologies such as Process Mining (PM) or Robotic Process Automation
    (RPA), which are becoming more and more prevalent, offer new possibilities for
    process analysis, monitoring, and automation. PM can further be helpful in identifying
    processes that are suitable for RPA. However, purely applying PM at the business
    data level often does not produce all the details required to assess RPA suitability.
    These necessary details can be supplemented by Task Mining (TM), a technology
    that can analyze tasks at a desktop data level, which opens further potential
    beyond the automation benefits. However, the currently available scientific literature
    on TM is scarce and empirical qualitative studies or case studies on the adoption
    of TM technology from a BPM perspective are missing. Therefore, this paper develops
    a fundamental framework for TM technology adoption based on a qualitative empirical
    study involving experts via semi-structured interviews, which are analyzed according
    to the qualitative content analysis based on the methodology of Mayring. The framework
    relates five potential benefits, two opportunities, four risks, and four basic
    requirements identified from the qualitative study. It thus provides a new valid
    starting point for future research efforts and serves as a guideline for managers
    in practice to evaluate a potential TM deployment in the company.

    ABSTRACT References Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT Digitalization
    influences business processes and their management. Digital technologies such
    as Process Mining (PM) or Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which are becoming
    more and more prevalent, offer new possibilities for process analysis, monitoring,
    and automation. PM can further be helpful in identifying processes that are suitable
    for RPA. However, purely applying PM at the business data level often does not
    produce all the details required to assess RPA suitability. These necessary details
    can be supplemented by Task Mining (TM), a technology that can analyze tasks at
    a desktop data level, which opens further potential beyond the automation benefits.
    However, the currently available scientific literature on TM is scarce and empirical
    qualitative studies or case studies on the adoption of TM technology from a BPM
    perspective are missing. Therefore, this paper develops a fundamental framework
    for TM technology adoption based on a qualitative empirical study involving experts
    via semi-structured interviews, which are analyzed according to the qualitative
    content analysis based on the methodology of Mayring. The framework relates five
    potential benefits, two opportunities, four risks, and four basic requirements
    identified from the qualitative study. It thus provides a new valid starting point
    for future research efforts and serves as a guideline for managers in practice
    to evaluate a potential TM deployment in the company. References R. Dubey, A.

    Performance Indicators 1. Introduction Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the digitalization
    of production processes in factories to make them more productive and efficient.
    Greater digitalization implies a greater degree of automation and data connectivity,
    allowing manufacturing processes and supply chains to focus on a variable and
    increasingly personalized demand for products. I4.0 economic benefits include,
    among others, reduced set-up times, shorter lead times, reduced labor and material
    costs, increased production flexibility, higher productivity and enhanced product
    customization (Dalenogare, Benitez, Ayala, & Frank, 2018; Rüßmann et al., 2015;
    Witkowski, 2017). The term Industry 4.0 was coined in Germany almost ten years
    ago, and in the United States it has been known as Smart Factories (Yin, Stecke,
    & Li, 2018). What is now called Industry 3.0 (I3.0) began with the development
    of electronics and computing. The automation and computerization of manufacturing
    systems started with the invention of the first MODICON 084 programmable controller
    (MOdular DIgital CONtroller) in 1969 (Dunn, 2009). The Programmable Logic Controllers
    (PLCs) in conjunction with sensors and actuators equipped with electronic conditioning
    allowed to implement more precise and repetitive control systems both in the manufacturing
    industry (metalworking, automotive, electronics, etc.) and in the process industries
    (iron and steel, chemical, petrochemical, cement, etc.) (Hugh, 2010). In the process
    industries, Distributed Control Systems (DCS) were also developed to implement
    process digital control and they required the application of industrial data communications
    protocols. From the literature survey, a number of works on readiness evaluation
    methods and I4.0 maturity is identified (Bai, Dallasega, Orzes, & Sarkis, 2020;
    Basll & Doucek, 2019; Castelo-Branco, Cruz-Jesus, & Oliveira, 2019; Chen et al.,
    2018; Ganzarain & Errasti, 2016; Leyh, Schäffer, Bley, & Forstenhäusler, 2016;
    Lichtblau et al., 2015; Mittal, Khan, Romero, & Wuest, 2017; Mittal, Khan, Romero,
    & Wuest, 2018; Nick, Kovács, Kő, & Kádár, 2021; Nick, Szaller, Bergmann, & Vargedo,
    2019; Pacchini, Lucato, Facchini, & Mummolo, 2019; Sarvari, Ustundag, Cevikcan,
    Kaya, & Cebi, 2018; Schuh et al., 2017; Schumacher, Erol, & Sihna, 2016; Stefan,
    Wienbruch, Kreimeier, & Bernd, 2018). It is important to note the difference between
    readiness and maturity, Pacchini et al., 2019 made an extensive discussion on
    this topic. However, there is a lack of tools to determine the degree of readiness
    for I4.0 implementation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Most of
    the economy of emerging countries depends heavily on SMEs that today are beginning
    to prepare to adopt the I4.0 technologies. For assisting to this challenge, effective
    evaluation methods and decision support tools can help manufacturing firms to
    effectively implement and understand the I4.0 technologies. Thus, assuming that
    the well-known I3.0 technologies are widely used and in the aforementioned SMEs,
    this study identifies precedence relationships between the I3.0 and I4.0 operational
    and information technologies, and proposes a definition of I3.0 technologies as
    prerequisites for the adoption of I4.0 technologies. The I4.0 technologies does
    not depend entirely on I3.0 technologies for their implementation, however, when
    analyzing the degree of readiness towards I4.0 implementation, it is desirable
    to know the current degree of automation and computerization of the enterprise.
    Particularly, the proposed precedence relation is required for the applicability
    of the method for measuring the degree of readiness previously proposed by Pacchini
    et al., 2019. The reviewed method shown in this work was developed as a diagnostics
    tool that can be incorporated into a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) methodology for
    technological management towards I4.0 implementation. In this way, the issue of
    jumping from the current technological state of SMEs to I4.0 can be methodologically
    addressed in such a way that it might be reasonably affordable and effective.
    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used as a means for measuring performance
    over time, for specific objectives or goals, that help people throughout the organization
    make better decisions. Continuous improvement towards the implementation of Industry
    4.0 requires the definition of such specific KPIs. The Degree of automation and
    digitalization of any enterprise can be evaluated from the automation and information
    technologies already in place. On the other hand, to evaluate the degree of readiness
    for new technological trends, precedence relationships between the new technologies
    and their precursor technologies must be defined. In this work, a performance
    indicator is proposed to measure the degree of automation and digitalization considering
    certain fundamental technologies as prerequisites. This work analyses in Section
    2 some automation and computerization technologies that were introduced during
    the period of time that now is known as Industry 3.0, and summaries some of the
    design principles and technology pillars of I4.0 in such a way that I3.0 and I4.0
    can be clearly distinguished from the technologies they use. In Section 3, the
    main challenges and opportunities imposed by I4.0 are identified and analyzed
    in order to propose a methodology for the implementation of I4.0, which is particularly
    adapted to SMEs. In addition, an automation and digitalization diagnostic algorithm
    is proposed in order to complement the aforementioned methodology and a real-world
    case study is shown as an application of the proposed diagnostics tool. Finally,
    the discussion and conclusions are shown in Section 4. 2. Evolution from Industry
    3.0 to Industry 4.0 2.1. Computer integrated manufacturing and factory automation
    The automation of discrete event processes in the manufacturing industries has
    been based mainly on the use of PLCs, and other forms of automation technologies
    such as industrial robots and Computerized Numerical Control (CNC). These Computer-Integrated
    Manufacturing (CIM) technologies (Groover, 2008) are integrated through industrial
    communication networks to automate manufacturing processes, making them more robust
    and flexible. Materials transport systems, automated warehouses and inspection
    systems using vision systems are added to form manufacturing cells. Computational
    technologies, on the other hand, allow the development of manufacturing support
    systems. The evolution of the production systems can be studied from the evolution
    of I3.0 to I4.0 (Yin et al., 2018). CIM refers to the use of computer-controlled
    machineries and automation systems in manufacturing products (Kosanke, 1995).
    Today, an industrial plant that has a certain degree of automation can be conceptualized
    as a computer network made up of a number of industrial communication networks,
    ranging from field buses to industrial Ethernet networks. As it is shown in Fig.
    1, machines and processes that use sensors and actuators are at the factory floor
    and PLC levels, supervisory control and manufacturing execution systems are at
    an intermediate level, and production and quality management functions as well
    as business and administration systems are at the upper levels. ISA-95 is an international
    standard from the International Society of Automation (ISA) for implementing interfaces
    between enterprise information systems and factory floor level control systems
    (Prades, Romero, Estruch, García-Dominguez, & Serrano, 2013). The purpose of ISA-95
    is to provide consistent terminology and information models to link the Operation
    Technologies (OT) with the Information Technologies (IT). Table 1 shows some OT
    and IT technologies. IT and OT integration is essential to achieve higher degrees
    of automation and digitalization, these technologies exist independently and cannot
    be unified all the time (Tian & Hu, 2019). Download : Download high-res image

    technologies I4.0 is supported by a series of technologies, some of them still
    emerging. Its main enabling technologies are the Internet of Things (IoT) and
    cyber-physical systems (Chen, 2018). The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
    is possible thanks to the extensive use of industrial Ethernet protocols (ProfiNET,
    Ethernet / IP, EtherCAT, etc.) that allow connectivity to sensors and actuators,
    and include them in control loops in real time. Industrial Ethernet allows horizontal
    integration of automation systems (at the same level of automation) and works
    together with other technologies such as OPC (Ole for Process Control) with client/server
    architectures. They allow vertical integration, i.e., from the factory floor levels
    to the servers of the MES and ERP systems (see Fig. 1). The industrial networks
    then play an important role in the integration of the so-called Operational Technology
    (OT) of the factory floor with the information technologies (IT) of the business
    systems. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are other fundamental technology of I4.0.
    A cyber-physical system is any device that integrates computing and communication
    capabilities to control and interact with a physical process. Cyber-physical systems
    are interconnected and in turn connected to the virtual world and digital networks.
    A cyber-physical system consists of a machine or process having its virtual model
    that can simulate the dynamic response of the physical system. The cyber-physical
    system is then a physical system extended by information and communication technologies.
    For example, a robot enabled for I4.0 has its virtual twin, in which operating
    sequences can be modified and tested, or failure scenarios can be analyzed. Other
    I4.0 technologies such as 3D simulation, Additive Manufacturing, Virtual Reality
    (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) improves the product live management cycle and
    allows product customization. There are several information technologies that
    are relevant for I4.0, they are: cloud computing, data analytics (Big Data), cybersecurity,
    vertical and horizontal integration (V&H). Cloud computing provides the function
    of decentralization of tasks and decision-making, since it enables users to configure
    the products from the Internet and, when a purchase is made, the production order
    of the item can be generated online. 2.3. From I3.0 to I4.0 Industry 4.0 is regarded
    as an industrial revolution but the required steps for its implementation can
    be seen as an evolutionary process, at least from a technological management perspective.
    I4.0 implies a higher degree of automation and digitalization than that obtained
    from I3.0 technologies. In this sense, the automation and computerization technologies
    and systems developed and implemented during the I3.0 can be considered as a pre-requisite
    for I4.0 implementation, particularly for technology lagged enterprises such as
    the case of SMEs in emerging economies. Fig. 2 describes the automation and computerization
    technologies as a directed graph showing the precedence relationship from I3.0
    to I4.0. As it can be seen, operational and information technologies have been
    developed over time and, eventually, incorporated into computer integrated manufacturing
    (CNCs, robotics, AS/AR and MHS systems) and, later, into the early vertical and
    horizontals integration, defined by the automation pyramid (SCADA-MES-ERP systems)
    and defined by the ISA-95 standard. Download : Download high-res image (435KB)

    3.1. Technology implementation stages The implementation of I4.0 must follow a
    previous stage of process reengineering and organizational challenges. In SMEs,
    prior to implement any automation or digitalization project, it is necessary to
    perform an overall review of the organization processes and, if necessary, perform
    a reengineering of the productive processes. Most of the times this is a top management
    activity and is supported by the identification and use of Key Performance Indicators
    (KPIs). The correct combination of current equipment and processes with new technologies
    is critical. Technology management must define which KPIs can be improved by adopting
    technology and then plan the technology projects. This technology adoption process
    is shown in Fig. 3, the technology management plans the automation and digitalization
    projects of I4.0 precursor technologies to be implemented and, eventually, the
    I4.0 technologies to be adopted. Download : Download high-res image (194KB) Download

    it can be seen in Fig. 3, the first two phases consist of the application of an
    “Intervention Stage” to perform competitiveness diagnoses and identify opportunities
    for improvement. This stage includes the implementation of technology management
    models and the development of roadmaps. The next phase involves the development
    of automation and digitization projects that enable I4.0. Finally, the last phase
    is the implementation of I4.0 technologies such as data analytics and artificial
    intelligence. Technology management can be done methodologically using a Deming
    cycle, or a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) method for continuous improvement, as it
    is shown in Fig. 4. The “Plan” section activities are primarily to set goals for
    improving KPIs by adopting technology, then define a list of automation and digitization
    projects and, eventually, a technology roadmap towards I4.0. In this section,
    a diagnostic tool to assess the degree of automation and digitalization of the
    company is required in order to identify and plan technological projects. The
    “Do” section is related to the development and application of technological projects.
    Each project should consider metrics directly related to the KPIs they impact.
    The “Check” section is performed for studying and analyzing the improvements of
    the KPIs to verify the success of the automation and digitalization projects.
    In this section, an increase in the degree of automation and digitalization metric
    is expected, and it should be measured. The “Act” section, also called “Adjust”
    section, is where the overall improvement of the company is evaluated and some
    possible deviations are known, as well as new opportunities for improvement are
    identified for the next “Plan” section. The diagnostic tool for evaluating the
    degree of automation and digitalization based on the use of the degree of readiness
    as a Key Performance Indicator is explained below. Download : Download high-res

    adoption (PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT). 3.2. Diagnostic tool for degree of automation and
    digitalization For applying the proposed model for I4.0 implementation described
    above, a measurement of the Degree of Automation and Digitalization of the company
    is required. Hence, for this aim, we propose the following method, which is based
    on the work of Pacchini et al., 2019. In our proposed method, I3.0 technologies
    are a prerequisite for the adoption of I4.0 technologies. 3.2.1. Methodology From
    the literature (Bai et al., 2020; Basll & Doucek, 2019; Castelo-Branco et al.,
    2019; Chen et al., 2018; Ganzarain & Errasti, 2016; Leyh et al., 2016; Lichtblau
    et al., 2015; Mittal et al., 2017; Mittal et al., 2018; Nick et al., 2019; Nick
    et al., 2021; Pacchini et al., 2019; Sarvari et al., 2018; Schuh et al., 2017;
    Schumacher et al., 2016; Stefan et al., 2018), we identify nine relevant I4.0
    fundamental technologies as follows: I. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);
    II. Cyber Physical Systems & Digital Twins; III. Advanced 3D Simulation; IV. Additive
    Manufacturing (3D Printing); V. Autonomous and Collaborative Robots; VI. Vertical
    and Horizontal Integration; VII. Big Data (Data Analytics); VII. Cloud Computing;
    and VIII. Cybersecurity. According to our study, each I4.0 fundamental technology
    comprises of a set of Ai (i = 1, 2, 3…) I3.0 technologies as prerequisites. In
    order to estimate the “degree of adoption” of these prerequisites, four levels
    are defined, each related with a number of points as: L0 = 0 points, L1 = 1 point,
    L2 = 2 points and L3 = 3 points. Thus, the degree of adoption of the prerequisite
    Ai is a function of the variable Lm, as follows: (1) Hence, the degree of readiness
    for the adoption of a given I4.0 fundamental technology can be estimated by dividing
    the number of total points obtained in the evaluation of its prerequisites (Ai)
    by the sum of the maximum possible points (Pacchini et al., 2019). This is: (2)
    where gn is the degree of readiness for the adoption of a given fundamental technology
    and Ai the degree of adoption of each of its prerequisites whose value depends
    on the number of points of its level Lm, as shown in Eq. (1), and i is the number
    of prerequisites. This calculation is performed for all the I4.0 fundamental technologies.
    Since the assumption that all of the I4.0 fundamental technologies have the same
    importance in a given company may not be reasonable, we propose a technology relevance
    factor 0 ≤ αn≤1, whose value is chosen by the user, to weight the contribution
    of each fundamental technology gn, where αn = 1 means that a given technology
    is critical for the business and αn = 0 is chosen when the technology is not relevant.
    Thus, the Degree of Automation and Digitalization of a given company is calculated
    as follows: (3) Here, DAD is the Degree of Automation and Digitalization of the
    company, g1 is the degree of readiness for adoption of the fundamental technology
    I, g2 is the degree of readiness for adoption of the fundamental technology II,
    gn is the degree of readiness for adoption of the fundamental technology n, and
    αn is its technology relevance factor. Finally, the current status of the Degree
    of Automation and Digitalization of a company is described in Table 2. The I4.0
    fundamental technologies, their prerequisites (Ai) and corresponding levels are
    defined as follows: I. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) A1. The company has

    us assume that all of the fundamental technologies have the same importance (i.e.
    αn = 1) and we analyze two scenarios: first, considering the information technologies
    are more developed than the operational technologies in a company, and, second
    scenario, where the information technologies are lagged in its implementation.
    This is, we have an “A” scenario where the Operational Technologies I to V have
    an average level L2 of adoption and the Information Technologies VI to IX have
    an average level L3 of adoption. Under this scenario the DAD is equal to 81.48%,
    which according to Table 2, this result shows that the company has an “Advanced”
    status, i.e., the company has full knowledge of technologies relevant to the business
    and most of them have already been adopted. Now consider a “B” scenario where
    the Operational Technologies I to V have an average level L2 of adoption and the
    Information Technologies VI to IX have an average level L1 of adoption. For this
    second scenario the DAD is equal to 51.85%, corresponding to an “Intermediate”
    status, i.e., the company has full knowledge of technologies relevant to the business,
    some of them have already been adopted. The strengths and areas of opportunity
    on the I4.0 technologies for this company can be studied by using a radar chart
    as shown in Fig. 5, and then the model for I4.0 implementation proposed in section
    3.1 can be applied. Table 2. Degree of automation and digitalization status. Degree

    of the proposed automation and digitalization diagnostic tool in the real world,
    we analyzed the case of a Mexican metal-mechanical industry company. This company
    manufactures automotive components, furniture, among other products; and it is
    currently venturing into developing technology-based products. The results of
    the application the diagnostic tool to this case are shown in Table 3. The technology
    relevance factor (αn) for each I4.0 fundamental technology was set as shown in
    Table 3, according to its relevance for business, where αn = 1 means that the
    technology is very critical for the business, αn = 0.75 is critical, and αn =
    0.5 is convenient to implement. However, the value of this factor can be defined
    by the user to weight the contribution of each fundamental technology according
    to the business goals. Table 3. Case study of a Mexican metal-mechanical industry
    company. n I4.0 Fundamental technology Pre-requisites levels (Lm) Degree of adoption

    Therefore, according to the results shown in Table 3 and applying Eq. (3), the
    Degree of Automation and Digitalization (DAD) of the company is 45.37%. Hence,
    according to Table 2, this result shows that the company has a “primary” status,
    i.e., the company has a good knowledge of technologies relevant to the business,
    few of them have already begun to be adopted. From Fig. 6, the strengths and areas
    of opportunity on the I4.0 technologies for this company are known. Download :

    of readiness for adoption of the I4.0 fundamental technologies. As it can be seen,
    some I4.0 fundamental technologies have prerequisites (An) in common. The calculation
    of the DAD can be simplified by using a computational script. The proposed diagnostic
    algorithm is available as a free online software tool at: http://laboratoriosvirtuales.cio.mx/encuesta/.
    Table 3, the DAD calculation and the diagram shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 can be generated
    using this tool. 4. Discussion and conclusions Current development of technology
    is described as uncertain (for the existence of multiple solutions to a single
    problem), systemic (technology as part of complex social systems), dynamic (changing
    with time) and cumulative (based on preceding knowledge) (Gudanowska, 2017). The
    latter aspect is boarded in this work, since technology development is the continuation
    and evolution of previous technologies, and an evaluation tool is proposed to
    measure the transition of a company towards I4.0. The definition of technology
    management models tends to be helpful in giving orientations for an effective
    technology management (Larios & Soto, 2017). However, specific activities to implement
    such models are generally not described openly giving excessive variability of
    interpretation. This is the case of the Mexican norm NMX-GT-002-IMNC-2008 which
    includes the aspects of market and technology surveillance, project planning,
    technology habilitation, intellectual protection and innovation implementation.
    In spite of this lack of definition of concrete activities, planning can be identified
    as one of the most common practices in technology management and a relevant factor
    for enterprise innovation, regardless of the size of the company (Cabrera, 2010),
    which supports the value of the tool suggested in this work to evaluate the easiness
    and readiness to adopt I4.0 technology. Moreover, most common benefits attributed
    to technology and innovation management is the reduction of costs and efficiency
    perpetuation (Pomaquero, Lopez, & Lopez, 2019), therefore decision and planning
    tools for the acquisition of new technology and the use of digital technologies
    [Mourtzis, 2020; Papakostas & Ramasubramanian, 2022] are important for the evolution
    and permanence of a company. From the case study above analyzed, the proposed
    automation and digitalization diagnostic algorithm shows to be useful for identifying
    the I3.0 enabling or prerequisite technologies that are relevant for the adoption
    of I4.0 fundamental technologies. For assisting to this challenge, a continuous
    improvement (PDCA) model for technology management was proposed in Section 3.1.
    Here, the technology management plans the automation and digitalization projects
    of I4.0 precursor technologies to be implemented and, eventually, the I4.0 technologies
    to be adopted. The proposed methodology is suggested for assisting SMEs in the
    identification of the degree of readiness for I4.0 implementation, because the
    economy of emerging countries depends largely on this type of enterprise (The
    World Factbook, 2022). However, it can be applied to any company size that pursues
    a continuous improvement method for adoption of I4.0 technologies. As a conclusion,
    in this work, I4.0 precursor automation and computerization technologies were
    clearly identified and described in such a way that I3.0 and I4.0 can be clearly
    distinguished from the technologies they use. The identification of precursor
    technologies of I4.0 is required for the applicability of an automation and digitalization
    diagnostic algorithm (first introduced by Paccini et al. 2019), which is enhanced
    and improved in this research work to get a more applicable measurement tool for
    the degree of readiness towards the implementation of I4.0. Main challenges and
    opportunities that I4.0 imposes on SMEs were identified and analyzed in order
    to propose a model for the adoption of I4.0 fundamental technologies. The diagnostic
    algorithm proposed in this research work can be implemented directly in an Excel
    spreadsheet or developed as a software application that can be used as a diagnostic
    tool for supporting a continuous improvement cycle (PDCA), which is proposed and
    described in Section 3.1, to improve the technology management processes, particularly
    those related to the implementation of I4.0. The proposed methodology is mainly
    aimed at small and medium-sized companies in developing countries. Future work
    is to enhance the proposed methodology for its systematic application. CRediT

    and communication technology (ICT) is rapidly developing and causing the advent
    of numerous technologies, e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) (Han et al., 2020;
    Lin et al., 2015), cloud computing (Chen et al., 2016a; Chen et al., 2016b), artificial
    intelligence (Zhang and Lu, 2021), and big data and analytics (Cai et al., 2019;
    Zhang et al., 2018). In recent years, many scholars and practitioners have been
    interested in Industry 4.0 (Liu and Xu, 2016). A recently-conducted study was
    dedicated to the identification of the basic concept of Industry 4.0 in terms
    of its key technologies, perspectives, and industrial applications and also discussed
    the challenges it has faced and future research trends in this domain (Pivoto
    et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2021). In this paradigm, the cyber-physical production
    systems (CPPSs) are considered smart manufacturing systems consisting of warehousing
    systems, smart machines, digitally-developed production facilities, and feature
    end-to-end ICT-based integration, from inbound logistics to production, marketing,
    service, and outbound logistics (Liu and Jiang, 2016). In general, smart manufacturing
    systems refer to manufacturing systems that are entirely integrated and collaborative
    and give the response in real-time to satisfy the varying demands and circumstances
    in the industry, supply networks, and customers'' requirements (Kusiak, 2018).
    In the case of smart manufacturing systems, the most important enabling technologies
    include IoT (Firouzi et al., 2021), cyber-physical systems (CPS) (Kholidy, 2021),
    cloud-based solutions (Al-Obeidat et al., 2021), Internet of Services (IoS) (Reis
    et al., 2022), big data analytics (Ranjan and Foropon, 2021), and artificial intelligence
    (AI) (Sahu et al., 2021). Industry 4.0 succeeded in considerably changing the
    face of the manufacturing industry. Industries worldwide are adapting to the ongoing
    mechanical automation trend in conventional manufacturing processes which has
    led to the rise of intelligent manufacturing (Zhong et al., 2017), one of the
    most widely researched topics these days. Cyber-physical systems and the integration
    of physical processes, storage systems, and production facilities that coordinate,
    exchange information autonomously and monitor each other form the basis of Industry
    4.0 (Colombo et al., 2017). The manufacturing industries are availing opportunities
    that follow Industry 4.0, the emerging networking technologies being machine to
    machine (M2M) communication, 5G and software designed Networking (SDN) (Xu et
    al., 2018). Industry 4.0 is known as a digital transformation in the manufacturing
    industry, which was driven by the growth of Information and Digital Technologies
    (IDT). Industry 4.0, in fact, digitally transformed the industrial markets wherein
    smart manufacturing fits (Zhong et al., 2017). As a result, applying IDT to all
    facets of manufacturing is of high strategic importance to manufacturing companies
    (Lasi et al., 2014). Several researchers working in the operations management
    and research community have studied how to adapt the generic IDT well in manufacturing
    companies. However, former researchers have defined digitalization of the manufacturing
    sector with imposing some considerable limitations when considering the generalization
    of the existing studies'' findings to the companies that are currently inspecting
    the issue of manufacturing digitalization in the age of Industry 4.0. Reviewing
    the IDT institutionalization background demonstrated that most studies have described
    digitalization in regard to the institutionalization of generic IDT, e.g., basic
    computer hardware, word processing, Internet, spreadsheets, social media, and
    virtual meetings (Giotopoulos et al., 2017). The economic growth in Asia has been
    accelerated with the help of small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) (Ndubisi
    et al., 2021). Large companies and SMMs have adopted Industry 4.0 technologies
    to enhance their performance quality. Within the realm of manufacturing technologies,
    Industry 4.0 is the state-of-the-art trend transforming the currently-used manufacturing
    systems to Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) by supporting CPS, AI, IoT, data
    exchanges, automation, big data, robotics, cloud computing, and semi-autonomous
    industrial techniques (Kamble et al., 2018). The manufacturing objectives attained
    by Industry 4.0 are accomplished in the intersection of technology, people, and
    innovation. The huge growth of the field of manufacturing and data analytics has
    accelerated it considerably (Qu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). The concentration
    of many of these developments is upon digital manufacturing systems and AI techniques
    in order to transform the systems towards more and more smartness and intelligence
    (Edgar and Pistikopoulos, 2018). Countless data are generated through SMS, though
    the utilization and the amount of these data vary across different industries,
    scales, and operations (Kusiak, 2019). SMS requires a high level of agility and
    capacity for meeting the rigorous performance requirements to succeed in the achievement
    of their defined objectives. It is obvious that the use of SMS in SMMs causes
    considerable growth in production activities and, on the other hand, it causes
    some complicated operational issues with concerns for sustainability in terms
    of the social, environmental, economic, and resource-related issues (Ndubisi et
    al., 2021). A review of the existing literature shows that despite the fact that
    Industry 4.0 has been confirmed to have remarkable potential in value creation
    and digital supply chain transformation (Kamble et al., 2020b), only limited research
    has been carried out focusing on the significant role of Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing
    supply chain, and also the sustainability-related issues have not been investigated
    adequately in this regard (Büyüközkan and Göçer, 2018). In the context of smart
    manufacturing, manufacturing digitalization refers to applying the state-of-the-art
    IDTs, e.g., Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT), additive manufacturing, Augmented
    Reality (AR), big data analytics, high-performance computing powered computer-aided
    design and manufacturing, cloud computing, industrial simulation, and Blockchain
    (Gilchrist, 2016; Li, 2018; Lu, 2017). Many researchers have attempted to make
    manufacturing systems smart; although SMSs have not been defined in a widely-accepted
    way. Based on the latest industrial reports, it can be said that smart manufacturing
    is a hit rather than hype (Kusiak, 2018). In SMS, the production system is of
    high autonomy, intelligence, reconfigurability, and flexibility (Zheng et al.,
    2018). Manufacturers nowadays are making efforts to embrace this industrial revolution
    to survive in such a dynamic market (Tao et al., 2018). The literature suffers
    from a highly-limited understanding of the mechanisms manufacturers can use to
    successfully implement these modern technologies in support of smart manufacturing
    (Kamble et al., 2018). Such low understanding is expected as smart manufacturing
    is in its initial steps, and the academic community has just recently begun addressing
    this domain. Furthermore, the few studies conducted in this domain have used literature
    review or case study approaches without empirically validating the measures. Accordingly,
    it is necessary to support this field by carrying out empirical research to seek
    the practitioners'' opinions in regard to the competence and applicability of
    the performance dimensions in the context of Industry 4.0 (Frederico et al., 2021).
    The above discussion reveals a remarkable gap in the development of an all-inclusive
    framework guiding the adoption and implementation of smart manufacturing for Industry
    4.0 in SMMs. On the other hand, there is not any systematic framework of SMSs
    in SMMs for Industry 4.0 capable of guiding industrial implementation and academic
    research. Therefore, the current paper builds a conceptual framework for Industry
    4.0 SMSs in SMMs. It encompasses a wide range of criteria applicable when implementing
    SMSs for Industry 4.0 in SMMs. To this end, the present article first examines
    the concept of SMS. After that, a state-of-the-art and content-driven review is
    carried out on the existing literature in order to explore the most important
    determinants facilitating the use of Industry 4.0 SMSs in SMMs. Then, the paper
    introduces a new fuzzy decision-making method in order to rank and analyze the
    key criteria applicable to implementing Industry 4.0 SMSs in SMMs. Yager (2017)
    pioneered the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) characterized by BD and ND.
    A constraint that is fulfilled by the theory of q-ROFSs is that the sum of the
    qth power of BD and ND are less than or equal to 1, where q ≥ 1. q-ROFSs are able
    to handle the above-noted example in an effective way. In q-ROFSs, the information
    space is wider than that of PFSs and IFSs corresponding to the variation of the
    parameter q (q ≥ 1); it is obvious that IFSs and PFSs are just two specific forms
    of q-ROFSs. Thus, q-ROFS can deal with the higher level of uncertain information
    with higher flexibility and applicability. In recent years, many researchers have
    been attracted to carry out research under q-ROFSs environment. For instance,
    an innovative q-ROFS-based model was designed by Tang et al. (2020) to address
    the three-way decision problem. Darko and Liang (2020) investigated a number of
    q-rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) Hamacher aggregation operators and also discussed
    their applications. In addition, a decision-making framework was built by Krishankumar
    et al. (2021) based on q-ROF in order to solve the renewable energy resource selection
    problem with the use of q-ROF information. With the ever-increasing intricacy
    and wide-ranging challenges of today''s environment, numerous MCDM approaches
    have been introduced by copious authors. The MCDM methods can be categorized into
    two groups: (i) Outranking approaches and (ii) utility degree-based approaches.
    The outranking approaches are limited in handling a large number of DEs and criteria
    due to complex computations. The utility degree-based methods are valuable in
    managing the MCDM problems with massive experts and criteria. However, the utility-based
    approaches only employed a single normalization technique to non-dimensionalize
    assessment values under diverse criteria. In this sense, utilizing a predefined
    normalization technique may bias the outcomes when the normalization tool is not
    appropriate. To conquer this issue, Liao and Wu (2020) intended a new utility
    value-based approach, namely, the Double Normalization-based Multi-Aggregation
    (DNMA) framework, which takes the benefits of different normalization methods
    and aggregation functions and combines them in an appropriate way. The final integration
    function of the DNMA approach widely considers the subordinate utility values
    and the ranks of alternatives, and thus, the final ranking result has high reliability.
    Nie et al. (2019) proposed a multi-expert MCDM technique by combining the DNMA
    method with a cardinal consensus-reaching process under hesitant fuzzy linguistic
    term sets the context. Wang and Rani (2022) extended the double normalization-based
    multiple aggregations (DNMA) approach under the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs)
    environment to identify, rank, and evaluate the sustainability risk factors in
    supply chain management. Also, Keshavarz-Ghorabaee et al. (2021) pioneered an
    innovative objective weighting model for assessing the weights of the criteria
    and named as “method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC)”. This approach
    utilizes each attribute''s removal effect on the assessment of alternatives to
    obtain the weights of the attributes. Considering the deviations, the assessment
    of an option based on removing attributes is a new concept for determining the
    attribute weights. Rani et al. (2022) discussed the MEREC-based ARAS method to
    treat the food waste treatment method assessment on “Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs)”.
    In this study, the MEREC model is first combined with the MULTIMOORA method under
    the SVNS context. For the subjective weighting model, a procedure of rank sum
    (RS) method was given by Stillwell et al. (1981) to help the decision-maker to
    give their ranking values for selected criteria. Until now, no one has developed
    an integrated RS weighting and DNMA-based method under the q-ROFSs setting for
    the adoption of information and digital technologies for sustainable smart manufacturing
    systems for Industry 4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs). To take
    the flexibility and efficacy of q-RFOSs, the aim of the paper is to introduce
    an innovative discrimination measure and discuss its elegant properties. Based
    on it, a WASPAS framework for evaluating the MCDM problem on q-RFOSs has been
    developed. Owing to its flexibility and efficiency, this research focuses on the
    context of q-ROFSs. On the other hand, the new methodology of q-ROF-MEREC-RS weight
    finding technique to compute the criteria weights or significance degrees of criteria.
    Then, the DNMA method is a new elegant approach to handling MCDM problems. Thus,
    in this study, we have developed a new approach to the multi-criteria decision-making
    (MCDM) method using the q-ROF-MEREC-RS and q-ROF-DNMA methods and further implemented
    for the Adoption of information and digital technologies for sustainable smart
    manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises
    (SMMEs). Accordingly, this paper aims to address the research gap in the literature
    by identifying the main criteria using a survey approach that has been carried
    out using the current literature review and experts interviews. The empirical
    validation in this study is performed on the selected industry and academic experts
    from SMMs in China. More specifically, the following research objectives were
    addressed in this study. ■ To identify the main criteria for the adoption of information
    and digital technologies (IDTs) for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for
    Industry 4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs). ■ To develop a comprehensive
    framework using a survey approach to investigate the main criteria for the adoption
    of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in small,

    approach using the q-ROF-SOWIA and DNMA models under q-ROFSs to rank the industries
    and analyze and assess the main criteria to the adoption of IDTs for sustainable
    smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises
    (SMMEs). ■ The q-ROF-MEREC-RS approach is utilized to evaluate and rank the main

    sensitivity and comparison analyses to validate the integrated q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA
    approach. The remainder of this paper is provided based on the following sections.
    Section 2 presented the literature review and related works on the adoption of
    IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in small, medium,
    and micro enterprises (SMMEs). Section 3 provided the proposed q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA
    approach and the basic concept of q-ROFSs. Section 4 presented the results of
    the study, the case study, the sensitivity investigation, and the comparative
    study. Finally, Section 5 discussed the conclusion of the study. 2. Literature
    review 2.1. Smart manufacturing in the era of Industry 4.0 The Fourth Industrial
    Revolution, which is also recognized as Industry 4.0, or Industrie 4.0, together
    with its associated technologies, has significantly evolved and transformed manufacturing
    systems. Industry 4.0 is backed by key principles such as transparency of information,
    interconnection, decentralized decisions, and real-time technical assistance for
    human operators (Axelsson et al., 2019). ICT systems play significant roles in
    modern manufacturing. The idea of Industry 4.0 is the integration of all the currently-used
    technologies, e.g., wireless networks, sensors, IoT, information management systems,
    robotics, and AI, for the purpose of creating CPSs and smart factories (Kang et
    al., 2016; Lee et al., 2015; Lu and Weng, 2018). Industry 4.0 covers several automated
    systems provided well with automatic data exchange and manufacturing technology
    capacities, with a huge power to transform the social/economic processes. In recent
    times, in developed manufacturing countries, much attention has been paired to
    the concept of Industry 4.0 as a big powerful mechanism for streamlining production.
    In a manufacturing system, all the existing parts need to be connected with each
    other and have the same data models. As a result, the manufacturing processes
    must be totally digitalized, and simulation techniques can facilitate the achievement
    of a ‘digital factory’ wherein virtual and real factory environments are mixed
    (Boccella et al., 2020). By definition, a digital factory refers to a “comprehensive
    network of digital models, methods and tools—including modeling, simulation and
    3D/virtual reality visualization—integrated by continuous data management” (Chryssolouris
    et al., 2009) to simulate the real manufacturing systems and optimize the way
    they perform their defined tasks. The digital factory uses production planning
    and control principles to optimize the production systems so that they can cope
    with environments of higher competitiveness and complexity. Different organizations
    are currently using Industry 4.0 technologies to cope with the challenges arising
    due to the increase in manufacturing complexity (Oh and Jeong, 2019). The technologies
    that work based on real-time indeed have transformed the reactive operational
    approach of the manufacturing facilities into a proactive approach (Davis et al.,
    2012). According to Jung et al. (2015), to be of high efficiency, SMSs should
    be capable of responding to information in a quick and effective way; during this
    process, they may cause some disruptions to ongoing operations. Today, the manufacturing
    industry is experiencing the initial signs of the next industrial revolution.
    The advent of the novel digital industrial transformation, recohnized as Industry
    4.0, associated with smart manufacturing, is to alter the ways businesses are
    functioning now (Qu et al., 2016). In fact, smart manufacturing is indicative
    of an entirely collaborative, integrated production ecosystem that gives real-time
    responses to the varying demands in the market and the different conditions that
    arise across the value chain (Ghobakhloo and Ching, 2019). The technological revolution
    that is induced by smart manufacturing has profound changing effects on the foundations
    of value creation and delivery within the manufacturing contexts (Lu and Weng,
    2018). Interconnectedness and fusion of digital and physical worlds are two central
    components of smart manufacturing (Ghobakhloo, 2018). In other words, integrating
    IDT into all manufacturing facets should be taken into account as a strategic
    priority for all manufacturing companies in this era (Lasi et al., 2014). The
    Fourth Industrial Revolution is known as a novel stage for manufacturing systems,
    particularly for SMSs, which are able to give quick responses to global competition
    and customization requirements. Kang et al. (2016) made some analyses on the strategies
    taken into action by a number of countries (e.g., Korea, with Manufacturing Innovation
    3.0; Germany, with Industry 4.0; and the USA, with smart manufacturing) when constructing
    SMSs and way the pertinent technologies were developed in these countries. SMSs
    are essentially aimed at quickly responding to customers'' dynamic requirements
    and shortening the products'' lifecycles. The key technology of Industry 4.0 SMSs
    is presented in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (965KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 1. Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing systems. To
    meet the customers'' dynamic requirements, autonomous SMSs need to use ICT, information
    operation technology, and IoT (Xu and Chen, 2017). These systems need to construct
    explicit models and perform efficient optimizations (Garg et al., 2017b) using
    the available data to satisfy the dynamic requirements and give correct answers
    to the questions arising due to uncertainty (Garg et al., 2017c). We are currently
    observing the more and more popularity of the implementation of AI-based technologies
    in SMSs with higher accuracy and effectiveness (Garg et al., 2017a). However,
    the conventional EISs are made from obsolete technologies; as a result, they are
    not suitable for the manufacturing system requirements. Value creation is known
    as one of the most important factors of sustainability for enterprises (Rehman
    et al., 2016). Numerous discrete manufacturers exist whose manufacturing systems
    require to be upgraded. It should be noted that SMSs often fail to attain real-time
    collaboration and business intelligence without a uniform information flow, data
    stream, functional structure, and knowledge in the framework of EISs. 2.2. Related
    work In recent years, several past works have investigated SMSs in the different
    aspects of Industry 4.0 technologies; in this regard, Sensing enterprise is proposed
    in (Santucci et al., 2012) to describe “an enterprise making use of the sensing
    possibilities provided by interconnected ‘environments’, anticipating future decisions
    by using multidimensional information captured through physical and virtual objects
    and providing added value information to enhance its global context awareness.”
    According to Brown et al. (2014), the achievement of sustainability in manufacturing
    necessitates taking into consideration four factors altogether, i.e., product
    design, manufacturing systems, manufacturing processes, and the whole supply chain.
    They also discussed the concept of case-based research for extending or refining
    the theory. Feeney et al. (2015) introduced a self-correcting, self-aware, autonomous
    method that was primarily concentrated on product design. SMS was described by
    Lu et al. (2016) as a manufacturing ecosystem in which the components are as different
    as the individuals. In another study (Lemos et al., 2013), the autonomous evolution
    mechanism of SMSs was proposed on the basis of the multilevel Darwinist brain.
    Foidl and Felderer (2016) provided an inclusive discussion on the potential opportunities
    for the implementation of Industry 4.0 within the setting of an Austrian electronic
    manufacturing services firm. In addition, they identified research challenges
    for quality management concerning the DIN ISO 9000 quality management systems
    approach. Kang et al. (2016) reviewed different articles published in relation
    to Smart Manufacturing, attempted to predict future development trends, and also
    made an analysis of the policies and technology roadmaps of three different countries
    (i.e., Korea, the United States, and Germany) with the aim of identifying the
    intelligent automation, networked sensors, multi-scale dynamic modeling and simulation,
    data interoperability, and scalable and multi-level cyber security, as some of
    the most important technologies emerging nowadays. Stock and Seliger (2016) reviewed
    the recent developments of Industry 4.0 comprehensively, together with the key
    trends and expected developments for various value-creation factors in the Industry
    4.0 domain. The study of Wang et al. (2016b) concentrated on the most important
    algorithms applied currently to operating smart manufacturing plants. They then
    designed an intelligent negotiation mechanism for the implementation of a self-organized
    manufacturing system. In addition, they introduced four deadlock prevention strategies
    employed to develop a smart factory prototype with algorithms for further system
    performance optimizations. A cloud-based framework was constructed by Wang et
    al. (2016a) to offer a self-controlled SMS through the integration of several
    technologies, e.g., cloud computing, big data, and wireless networks, for autonomously
    controlling the products, machines, and conveyors. Giret et al. (2016) used AI-based
    applications to establish Intelligent Manufacturing Systems in China. Wang and
    Wang (2016) investigate the features and relationships among Big Data, Industry
    4.0, and CPSs. In addition, there are some other researchers who have focused
    on specific industrial domains, e.g., the electronic industry (Chien and Chuang,
    2014) and automobile manufacturing (Zheng and Ming, 2017). Li et al. (2017) reviewed
    the AI-based techniques that have been applied to intelligent manufacturing. In
    another study, Nagorny et al. (2017) reviewed the literature regarding the application
    of Big Data to smart manufacturing (SM) to optimize the crucial performance indicators
    and recognize, predict, and optimize the design. Oertwig et al. (2017) suggested
    the emerging global-level value creation networks in terms of the design and control
    of partner relations in order to evaluate the services, products, and value chains
    regarding the environmental, economic, and social aspects. Chen and Tsai (2017)
    evaluated the success factors that play important roles in implementing ubiquitous
    manufacturing (UM), which is a “design anywhere, make anywhere, sell anywhere,
    and at any time” paradigm. UM essentially highlights the importance of the dispersion
    and mobility of manufacturing resources and users on the basis of the progress
    in communication, sensing, and networking technologies. In addition, their results
    showed that UM could be considered as a realizable target for Industry 4.0. The
    Smart Manufacturing System Readiness Assessment (SMSRA) was designed by Jung et
    al. (2017). This model consists of four dimensions: information technology maturity,
    organizational maturity, performance management maturity, and information connectivity
    maturity. In addition, they executed a statistical analysis, which was a part
    of SMSRA for the demonstration of the positive correlations with various types
    of performances that could be assessed at a discrete level when considering novel
    smart capacities for SMEs manufacturing systems. Oks et al. (2017) attempted to
    develop an application map for industrial CPSs. In a similar study (Giret et al.,
    2017), a framework was constructed, which helps to configure the Intelligent Manufacturing
    Systems through identifying the manufacturing components. In another research
    (Li et al., 2017), a guideline was provided to configure SMSs with the use of
    a CPS architecture. According to Kusiak (2018), there are six pillars of SMSs
    in manufacturing technology and processes; they are data, materials, sustainability,
    predictive engineering, resource sharing, and networking. Shafiq et al. (2018)
    built a framework for the intelligent CIM in the IoT context, which was composed
    of four stages, i.e., hard resource of CIM, IoTs, sensing and semantic analysis,
    and cloud CIM application. A hybrid simulation-based SMS configuration model was
    proposed by Nagadi et al. (2018) with the use of agent-based simulation (ABS)
    and discrete event simulation (DES), where agents can autonomously handle each
    resource. It offers resilience for resources to have cooperated with each other
    to accomplish the task defined. Tuffnell et al. (2019) made some analyses on cyber-physical
    smart manufacturing systems and using and replicating data from BCG, Deloitte,
    LMTPE-RWTH Aachen University, and PwC, regarding Industry 4.0 value creation,
    elements that are expected to be highly relevant along the automotive value chain
    in 2030, and how industrial companies are moving towards greater digital value
    creation, and from augmented products to serving digital ecosystems. In another
    research, with the use of the data extracted from Ad Hoc Research, BDO, BCG, EY,
    CIO, Capgemini, and McKinseyto analyses, Ludbrook et al. (2019) attempted to make
    some estimations in regard to the impacts of Industry 4.0 on the workforce. Coatney
    et al. (2019) executed an exploratory review of the existing literature of cyber-physical
    smart manufacturing systems and then made some analyses of the findings. To this
    end, they employed the data attained and replicated formerly by previously-conducted
    studies on BCG, DAA, Capgemini, Management Events, IoT Analytics GmbH, and PwC.
    In addition, they made required analyses and estimates in regard to the most important
    challenges in the formulation of smart factory strategies, which have arisen for
    companies in progressing towards the industry. Lafferty et al. (2019) used data
    from Capgemini, DAA, IoT Analytics GmbH, The Manufacturer, McKinsey, Oracle, PwC,
    US BLS, and WEF to analyze regarding smart factory transformation approach taken
    by players in different categories and drivers of technological change and time
    to impact on employee skills. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling.
    Nica, 2019 examined the relationships between cyber-physical production networks
    and advanced digitalization in the Industry 4.0 manufacturing systems. They used
    the data obtained by Active Idea, AI Group, BDO, Capgemini, CIO, DAA, EY, IoT
    Analytics GmbH, McKinsey, and PwC to perform required analyses and make estimates
    in regard to 1) top Industry 4.0 business objectives, 2) top technologies are
    taken into consideration in line with organizations'' strategic plans, 3) digital
    marketing activities with the greatest commercial effects, and 4) averaged quality
    already achieved by smart factories. The main focus of Kamble et al. (2020a) was
    on the Industry 4.0 technologies impacts upon Lean Manufacturing Practices in
    regard to sustainability issues. Gray-Hawkins and Lăzăroiu, 2020 investigated
    cyber-physical SMSs by means of the data taken from Capgemini, BCG, Deloitte,
    Kronos, PwC, MHI, IW Custom Research, McKinsey, and SME. The data were analyzed
    concerning the associations between industrial AI, sustainable product lifecycle
    management, and IoT sensing networks. A conceptual framework was constructed by
    Hawkins et al. (2021) through an inclusive systematic literature review on issues
    such as IoT-enabled sustainability, cyber-physical production networks, and smart
    factory performance within the manufacturing systems that work based on Industry
    4.0. They built their arguments on the findings taken out Algorithmia, Capgemini,
    BDV, Management Events, Eclipse Foundation, and PwC. Then, they made some analyses
    and estimates in regard to intelligent autonomous manufacturing systems. Hamilton
    et al. (2021) analyzed the available evidence on real-time big data analytics,
    sustainable Industry 4.0 wireless networks, and IoT-based decision support systems
    in the context of cyber-physical smart manufacturing. They also used and replicated
    data taken from Forrester, PwC, Microsoft, Siemens, Capgemini, and SME in order
    to make analyses and estimates concerning big data-driven manufacturing. In addition,
    they computed the descriptive statistics of compiled data from the completed surveys
    wherever it was appropriate to their research. Riley et al. (2021) attempted to
    explore IoT-enabled sustainability, digitized mass production, and big data-driven
    decision-making processes within Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems. They
    employed and replicated data taken from Forrester, Capgemini, Globant, PwC, McKinsey,
    Management Events, PAC, and Software AG in order to make required analyses and
    estimates concerning the IoT smart devices in cyber-physical manufacturing systems.
    They also computed the descriptive statistics of compiled data from the completed
    surveys wherever it was appropriate to their research. Nevertheless, few research
    studies have addressed the main criteria to adopt IDT for SMMEs; however, this
    is the first study that identifies the main criteria for IDT adoption in the era
    of Industry 4.0 in the SMMEs. The main criteria to criteria of IDT adoption in
    the era of Industry 4.0 in the SMMEs are: Access to reliable and precise information
    (c1), costs of SMIDT training (c2), the threat of losing market share to digitalized
    counterparts (c3), cybersecurity skills (c4), compatibility with preferred work
    practices (c5), improved manufacturing agility (c6), software engineering and
    application development skills (c7), fulfilling the requirements of customer/supplier
    standards (c8), IDT maturity and governance strategy (c9), threat of companies
    offering similar or substitute products (c10), survival being threatened by counterparts
    within the industry (c11), costs of new SMIDT integration and debugging (c12),
    compatibility with organizational culture and values (c13), improved response
    to internal and external changes (c14), compatibility with legal issues (c15),
    data analytics and management skills (c16), costs of required SMIDT infrastructure
    (c17), smart supply chain management strategy (c18), network engineering skills
    (c19), improved information sharing (c20), improvement of manufacturing productivity
    (c21), improvement of staff creativity and innovativeness (c22), compatibility
    with existing IDT infrastructure (c23), human resource strategy for smart manufacturing
    (c24), rapid access to the required information at the time of need (c25) requests
    for better information transmission and communication (c26), fulfilling the national
    and/or international requirements (c27) and access to the up-to-date information
    (c28). 3. Proposed research methodology 3.1. Basic concepts This section briefly
    presents elementary conceptions of q-ROFSs and similarity measures. Definition
    1 (Yager, 2017). Let Ξ = {z1, z2, …, zn} be a finite discourse set. A q-ROFS ‘M''
    in Ξ is described as follows: Here, μM and νM signify the BD and NBD of zi ∈ Ξ,
    respectively, μM(zi) ∈ [0, 1]νM(zi) ∈ [0, 1], 0 ≤ (μM(zi))q + (νM(zi))q ≤ 1, with
    q ≥ 1. The hesitation degree, is defined as . The pair (μM(zi), νM(zi)) is referred
    as q-ROFN, denoted by φ = (μφ, νφ).. Definition 2 (Liu and Wang, 2018). For three
    q-ROFNs φ = (μφ, νφ), φ1 = (μφ1, νφ1) and φ2 = (μφ2, νφ2), the operations can
    be given by Definition 3 (Liu and Wang, 2018). Let φ = (μφ, νφ)be a q-ROFN. Then,
    score and accuracy functions of φ are presented as and ℏ(φ) = μφq + νφq, respectively.
    Definition 4 (Liu et al., 2019). Let φ1 = (μφ1, νφ1)and φ2 = (μφ2, νφ2) be the
    q-ROFNs. Now, the distance measure for φ1  and φ2  is presented as (1) 3.2. Proposed
    q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA approach This section develops a q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA method
    under the q-ROFSs setting for solving decision-making applications. The calculation
    procedure of the proposed method is given by. Step 1: Generate a q-ROF-decision
    matrix (q-ROF-DM). A set of ℓ“Decision Experts (DEs)”A = {A1, A2, …, Aℓ} determine
    the sets of m optionsI = {I1, I2, …, Im} and n criteria C = {C1, C2, …, Cn},respectively.
    Owing to the vagueness of the human mind, lack of data, and imprecise knowledge
    about the options, the DEs allocate q-ROFNs to evaluate his/her decision on option
    Ii concerning a criterion Cj. Assume that ℤ(k) = (ξij(k))m×n,  i = 1, 2, …, m,
    j = 1, 2, …, n is the suggested decision matrix by DEs, where ξij(k)refer to the
    evaluation of an option Ii over a criterion Cj in the form of q-ROFN given by
    kth expert. Step 2: Compute the weights of DEs. To determine the DEs'' weights,
    firstly, the importance degrees of the DEs are assumed as Linguistic Terms (LTs)
    and then expressed by q-ROFNs. To compute the kth DE, let Ak = (μk, νk, πk) be
    the q-ROFN. Now, the expert weight is obtained by (Rani et al., 2022) (2) Here,
    ϖk ≥ 0 and . Step 3: Aggregate the all q-ROF-DMs. To create the q-ROF- aggregated
    decision matrix (q-ROF-ADM), the q-ROF weighted averaging (q-ROFWA) (Yager, 2017)
    operator is used, and then ℤ = (ξij)m×n, where (3) Step 4: Proposed q-ROF-subjective
    and objective weighting approach. Case I Determination of objective weights by
    the method of q-ROF-MEREC. All the criteria are not presumed to be of equal importance.
    Suppose w = (w1, w2, …, wn)T is the weight of the criterion set with and  wj ∈
    [0, 1]. Now, to find the criteria weights, the classical MEREC (Keshavarz-Ghorabaee
    et al., 2021) model is extended under the q-ROFSs environment. In the following,
    the procedure of the MEREC is presented by. Step 4a: Normalize the q-ROF-DM. In
    this step, a simple linear normalization is used to scale the elements of the
    q-ROF-DM ℤ = (ξij)m×n and generate the normalized q-ROF-DM ℕ = (ςij)m×n. If tb
    shows the benefit-type criteria set and tn represents the cost-type criteria set,
    then we utilize the following equation for normalization: (4) Step 4b: Find the
    score matrix. With the use of the following formula (Rani et al., 2022), the score
    matrix Ω = (ηij)m×n of each q-ROFN ςij is calculated: (5) Step 4c: Calculate the
    overall performance of the alternatives. A logarithmic measure with equal criteria
    weights is applied to obtain the alternatives'' overall performances in this step
    (Keshavarz-Ghorabaee et al., 2021). According to the normalized values obtained
    from the previous step, we can ensure that smaller values of ηijyield greater
    values of performance. The following equation is used for this calculation: (6)
    Step 4d: Calculate the performance of the alternatives by removing each criterion.
    This step involves the utilization of the logarithmic measure in a way similar
    to that of the former step. This step is different from the former step in this
    issue in that the alternatives'' performances are computed on the basis of the
    separate removal of each criterion. As a result, there are n sets of performances
    accompanied with n criteria. Si'' signifies the overall performance of the ith
    alternative concerning the removal of jth criterion. The following equation is
    used for the calculations of this step: (7) Step 4e: Compute the summation of
    absolute deviations. This step involves the computation of the removal impact
    of the jth criterion on the basis of the values attained from Steps 4c and 4d.
    Vj stands for the impact of the jth criterion removal. Formula (8) can be used
    to compute the values of Vj: (8) Step 4f: Determine the final criteria weights.
    Here, the objective weight of each criterion is computed with the use of the removal
    effects (Vj) of Step 4e. In Eq. (9),wjo represents the jth criterion''s weight.
    Eq. (9) is utilized to computewjo, as follows: (9) Case II Determine the subjective
    weights by the q-ROF-RS method. The subjective weighting system here enables us
    to reflect on decision-makers'' thoughts and intrinsic values. We hope that these
    procedures will be relevant to not only considering the alternatives taken but
    also to illustrate the importance of the prevailing criteria. In the process of
    decision-making, the decision makers'' opinion of each alternative with dependent
    criteria is very important when selecting the best choice for the given problem.
    In this critical situation, the decision-maker gives subjective weight (Hezam
    et al., 2022). Here, the procedure of the rank sum weight method is to help the
    decision-maker to give their ranking values for selected criteria. The formula
    of this method is given as follows: (10) where wjs represents the weights for
    each criteria j and n represents the number of criteria, rj denotes the rank of
    each criterion, j = 1,2,3, …,n. Case III Integrated weights using the objective
    and subjective weights: (q-ROF-SOWIA method). In the A-q-ROF-decision matrix,
    the decision maker wants to utilize both subjective and objective weights; for
    that following integrated weighted equation is given. (11) where γ ∈ [0, 1] is
    a factor of criteria weights. wjo represents the objective weight and wjs represents
    the subjective weight, respectively. Step 5: Assessment of the normalized A-q-ROF-DM.
    Here, we discuss linear and vector normalization formulae. Both the numerical
    values and q-ROFNs are managed by these formulae. The linear normalization removes
    the dimensions of attributes using the principle with the interval maximum-minimum.
    It is utilized in the VIKOR (Cheng et al., 2021) and the TOPSIS (Rani et al.,
    2022) models. A linear normalization procedure is defined by. (12) where is an
    improved score function of IVPFNs. Vector normalization has been used in the MULTIMOORA
    (He et al., 2021) and conventional TOPSIS (Chen and Hwang, 1992). We utilize it
    to normalize the A-q-ROF-DM ℤ = (ξij)m×n, with zij = (μij, νij) into ℕ(2) = (ηij(2))m×n,
    where such that (13) (14) Due to the fact that both the target-based vector and
    linear normalization hold some benefits and restrictions simultaneously (Liao
    and Wu, 2020), they are combined here using various AOs in a way to achieve various
    utility degrees of alternatives. Step 6: Using the subordinate aggregation models.
    Here, different types of aggregation models are developed using the following
    normalization procedures. Step 6.1: The Complete Compensatory Method (CCM). The
    CCM can be defined based on the q-ROFWA operator as follows: (15) where wj represents
    the attribute weight and ηij(1) shows the target-based linear normalization value.
    The alternatives can be ordered by arranging ℂ1(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, m in a decreasing
    manner, and we obtain the ranking outcomes ρ1(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, m.. Step 6.2:
    The Un-Compensatory Method (UCM). For the avoidance of a situation in which the
    chosen solution has a very improper performance in case of a certain criterion,
    the weighted maximum operator is used for the purpose of composing the second
    aggregation function, as shown below: (16) The options can be prioritized by arranging
    ℂ2(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, m in a decreasing way, and we obtain the ranking outcomes
    ρ2(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, m.. Step 6.3: The Incomplete Compensatory Method (ICM).
    We utilize the vector normalization of the third aggregation procedure as Eq.
    (17) by the q-ROFWG operator: (17) where wj signifies the attribute weight and
    ηij(2) denotes the target-based vector normalized value. The alternatives can
    be arranged by listing ℂ3(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, m in a descending manner, and we
    get the ranking outcomes ρ3(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, m.. Step 7: Combination of subordinate
    “Utility Degrees (UDs)” and priority orders. The last phase necessitates the achievement
    of an all-inclusive ranking by combining the outcomes of the given three models.
    These are considered as three parameters or criteria: CCM(ℚ1), UCM (ℚ2) and ICM
    (ℚ3). Each alternative Ii has two kinds of degrees: the “utility degree (UD)”
    ℂτ(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, m and the preference order ρτ(Ii) : i = 1, 2, ⋯, mover each
    attribute ℚτ : τ = 1, 2, 3. Evidently, we generate by two “Decision Matrices (DMs)”:
    the utility degree-DM ƛ and the ranking-DM ƛ . To preserve the inventive assessment
    of the subordinate UDs ℂτ(Ii) : τ = 1, 2, 3, the normalized versions are given
    by where (18) Step 8: Compute the “overall utility degree (OUD)” of each alternative.
    A parameter ϑ ∈ [0, 1] is taken to show the subordinate UDs and the subordinate
    preferences of alternatives. Here, we take ϑ = 0.5. The OUD of each option is
    presented by (19) where w1, w2 and w3 are the weight of the CCM, UCM, and ICM,
    respectively, such that w1 + w2 + w3 = 1. Here, the weight w1, w2 and w3are obtained
    using the developed q-ROF-divergence measure. The ultimate preference set ρ =
    {ρ(I1), ρ(I2), ρ(I3), …, ρ(Im)} is obtained in decreasing order of ℝi : i = 1,
    2, ⋯, m.. Step 9: End. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Case study In this study,
    three different stages of research methodology using empirical and exploratory
    surveys are adopted to identify the main criteria for the adoption of information
    and digital technologies for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry
    4.0 in small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs). In the decision-making method
    theory, to select the effectiveness criteria process, the data should be collected
    based on the current literature review and interviews with experts (Feldmann et
    al., 2022; Liao et al., 2019; Tirkolaee et al., 2020). An existing literature
    review and interviews with industry experts were conducted in this stage. Stage
    two implemented an initial survey to discover possible underlying the main criteria
    identified in the first stage of research methodology to finalize the criteria.
    The criteria are determined from the stage that was validated in the next stage
    of the study. In the next phase, 22 interviews with industry experts were conducted
    using questions to validate the criteria identified from the existing literature.
    The experts were nominated from six manufacturing companies with several years''
    of experience in SMMEs. Out of these five participating organizations, all of
    them are using sensor/IoT, and cloud computing-based manufacturing systems, two
    of them have adopted additive manufacturing, and one of them is using virtual
    reality for training and maintenance activities. The practitioners represented
    different functional backgrounds that included manufacturing, maintenance, quality
    and utilities. The selected practitioners varied in experience levels and held
    managerial positions like- Vice-president, Chief Manager, Associate Manager, Manager,
    Director, etc. The practitioners were interviewed on a broad range of SMMEs criteria
    (e.g., what measures they perceived to be necessary for evaluating SMMEs criteria?
    Are the criteria used for traditional manufacturing systems relevant in Industry
    4.0 environment?) A few criteria were added, and some were dropped based on the
    recommendation of the practitioners. The final list of 28 criteria was presented
    in the literature review section. Table 1 depicts the significance of the DEs
    and criteria in the form of LVs and then converted into q-ROFNs. Table 2 presents
    the DEs weight based on Table 1 and Eq. (2). Table 3 describes the importance
    of DEs to evaluate the options and the assessments of options concerning each
    criterion. Table 1. Performance ratings of alternatives over criteria and DEs

    criteria weights by MEREC method, we calculate the overall performances of the
    alternatives values based on Eq. (5), and presented as S1 = 0.538, S2 = 0.555,
    S3 = 0.549, S4 = 0.538, S5 = 0.519, and S6 = 0.581. In accordance with Eq. (6),
    we determine the alternatives'' overall performances(Sij'') by removing each criterion
    which is depicted in Table 6. Subsequently, we compute the removal effect of each
    criterion on the overall performance of the alternatives based on the deviation-based
    formula of Eq. (7). Calculation of each criterion''s weight is performed based
    on the effect of their removal on the performance Vj of the alternatives with
    Eq. (8). Using Eq. (9) and the Vj values, we calculate the weights of each criterion
    to the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry
    4.0 in SMMEs and are given in the last column of Table 5. The resultant values
    are in Fig. 2. Table 5. The implementation of the MEREC weighting approach for

    From the algorithm of the proposed q-ROF-MEREC-RS method, we have to combine the
    q-ROF-MEREC for objective weighting and q-ROF-RS weight for subjective weighting
    by using Eq. (11). The integrated weight for τ = 0.5 is shown in Fig. 2 and given
    as follows: wj = (0.0411, 0.0439, 0.0330, 0.0246, 0.0189, 0.0454, 0.0518, 0.0357,

    Here, Fig. 2 shows the significant degree or weights of different criteria to
    the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry
    4.0 in SMMEs with respect to the goal. Costs of required SMIDT infrastructure
    (c17) with a weight value of 0.0544 have become the most important criteria for
    the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry
    4.0 in SMMEs. Software engineering and application development skills (c7), with
    a weight value of 0.0518, are the second most important criteria for adopting
    IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs. Improved
    information sharing (c20) has third with a significance value of 0.0512, Improvement
    of staff creativity and innovativeness (c22) has fourth with a weight value of
    0.0499, Compatibility with legal issues (c15) with a significance value of 0.0471
    has fifth most important criteria to the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart
    manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs and others are considered crucial
    criteria to the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for
    Industry 4.0 in SMMEs. Step 5: According to the Eqs. (12), (13), (14) and Table

    normalized degrees of the subordinate UDs of CCM, UCM, and ICM are estimated,
    and their preferences are also obtained and are shown in Table 11. Next, the normalized
    subordinate UDs, and the weights of subordinate UDs are calculated and mentioned
    in Table 10. Table 10. Normalized CCM, UCM, and ICM degrees and OUDs of the HCWT

    3 0.399 6 0.6052 5 Weight of aggregation model w1 = 1/3 w2 = 1/3 w3 = 1/3 Step
    8: From Eq. (19), the subordinate normalized UDs and ranks, the OUDs, and the
    final preference orders of option are obtained and depicted in Table 11. Regardless
    of assuming w1 = w2 = w3 = 1/3, the weights can be chosen as per the preferences
    of DEs on the basis of the comprehensive accomplishment by the alternatives or
    of their poor performances. CCM is preferred if the attention of the alternatives‟
    comprehensive abilities can be drawn from DEs. If the DEs are not interested in
    taking risks, then a large weight can be attached to the UCM. It is pertinent
    to mention that ICM can be endowed by a large weight in the case when the DEs
    focus solely on the comprehensive performance as well as the decision risks. Furthermore,
    when we preserve the property that linear normalization is much more efficient
    than vector normalization, then it can genuinely be possible to attribute a large
    weight to both the CCM and UCM models and fail, which inculcates to comply with
    a big weight to ICM. Hence, the preference order of options is I5 ≻ I1 ≻ I4 ≻
    I3 ≻ I6 ≻ I2 and option I5 is with the highest UD of the appropriateness of options.

    This subsection shows a sensitivity investigation associated with the parameter
    ξ. The variation of ξ is a useful issue in helping to evaluate the sensitivity
    level of the approach, changing from subordinate UDs to subordinate preferences.
    In addition, changing the values of ξ is applied to the investigation of the sensitivity
    of the proposed method to the eminence of attribute weights. Table 11 and Fig.
    3 represent the sensitivity analysis of the alternatives for diverse values of
    the utility parameter ξ. Based on the assessments, we obtain similar preferences
    I5 ≻ I3 ≻ I4 ≻ I1 ≻ I6 ≻ I2 for ξ = 0.0 to ξ = 0.4, I5 ≻ I3 ≻ I1 ≻ I4 ≻ I6 ≻ I2
    for ξ = 0.5 to ξ = 0.9,and I5 ≻ I3 ≻ I1 ≻ I2 ≻ I6 ≻ I4 for ξ = 1.0, which implies
    I5 is at the top of the ranking for each value of ξ, while the I2 has the last
    rank for ξ = 0.0 to ξ = 0.9 and the I4 has the last rank for ξ = 1.0. Therefore,
    it is observable that the developed method possesses adequate stability with numerous
    parameter values. As shown clearly in Table 11, the developed q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA
    methodology is capable of generating stable and, at the same time, flexible preference
    results in a variety of utility parameters. This property is of high importance
    for MCDM procedures and decision-making reality. Download : Download high-res

    4.3.1. q-ROF-TOPSIS model In the current part of the study, we present a comparative
    study between the proposed and existing q-ROF-TOPSIS model (Liu et al., 2019)
    for solving MCDM problems under q-ROFSs context as follows: Steps 1–4: Follow
    the steps of the q-ROF-TOPSIS method. Step 5: Calculate the discriminations of
    each alternative from “q-ROF-ideal solution (IS)” and “q-ROF-anti-ideal solution
    (AIS)”. In this method, calculating the q-ROF-PIS and q-ROF-NIS values of each
    criterion is a key concern for DMs. Let ϕ+ and ϕ−be the q-ROF-PIS and q-ROF-NIS,
    respectively, which are computed with the use of Eqs. (20), (21) as follows: (20)
    (21) Step 6: Derive the degrees of distances of options from q-ROF-PIS and q-ROF-NIS.
    In accordance with Eq. (1), estimate the degree of distance D(Ii, ϕ+) among the
    option Ii and the q-ROF-PIS ϕ+. (22) and the degree of distance D(Ii, ϕ−) among
    the options Ii and the q-ROF-NIS ϕ− is given as follows: (23) Step 7: Compute
    the relative closeness index (CI) (24) Based on the values of CI, the most suitable
    candidate and the prioritization order of all alternatives are determined. The
    maximum value of ℂ(Ik) determines the most appropriate choice. Next, we implement
    the q-ROF-TOPSIS on the abovementioned case study. For this, firstly we have computed
    the q-ROF-PIS and q-ROF-NIS by means of Eqs. (20), (21), and then we have. ϕ+={(0.3811,

    model The q-ROF-WASPAS (Rani et al., 2022) method is implemented to handle the
    decision-making problem. The description of the q-ROF-WASPAS method is given as
    follows: Steps 1–4: As the aforementioned model. Step 5: Utilize the weighted
    sum model (WSM) ℂi(1) in the following expression (25) Step 6: Apply the weighted
    product model (WPM)ℂi(2) in the following expression (26) Step 7: Obtain the UD
    of the WASPAS model in the following expression (27) where ‘λ’ means the decision
    strategy parameter, where λ ∈ [0, 1](when λ = 0 and λ = 1, WASPAS is transformed
    into the WPM and the WSM, respectively). Step 8: Based on UD ℂi, prioritize the
    options. Using Eqs. (25), (26), the WSM and WPM values are estimated. Then, the
    UD of WASPAS for each organization to the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart
    manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs is obtained with the use of Eq.
    (27) and mentioned in Table 13. Table 13. The UD of option to the adoption of
    IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs. Options

    ≻ I1 ≻ I3 ≻ I2 ≻ I6. Thus, the industry-V (I5) option is the best one for the
    adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0
    in SMMEs. As a whole, the benefits of the q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA method over the
    extant method are given as follows (see Fig. 4): ■ In the developed method, the
    subjective weights of attributes are obtained by the q-ROF-RS method, and the
    objective weights of criteria are computed by MEREC, whereas in q-ROF-WASPAS,
    only objective weights of criteria are obtained by score function and similarity
    measure-based weighting procedure, and in q-ROF-TOPSIS, the criteria weights are
    chosen arbitrarily. ■ In Liu et al. (2019), the distance is calculated between
    the overall attribute value of an alternative Ri and the q-ROF-IS and the q-ROF
    -AIS to describe the CI of each option on the given attributes. The q-ROF -IS
    and q-ROF -AIS could be considered two benchmarks against which the performance
    of the alternatives on each attribute could be assessed. Remember that the two
    above-mentioned benchmarks it is too unrealistic to be achieved practically. On
    the other hand, it should be noted that the proposed q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA uses
    strength points of various normalization methods and aggregation functions, and
    it can integrate all of them appropriately. The final integration function of
    the DNMA approach takes into consideration widely the subordinate UDs and the
    ranks of options; this way, the final ranking results could be highly reliable
    and more realistic than the DEs could not only know about the best and worst performance
    of alternatives on the defined attributes but also compare their performance.

    Conclusions When it comes to the subject of manufacturing digitalization, a considerable
    portion of the research is dedicated to smart manufacturing, and innovation-related
    issues are indicated as priorities for future research. Particularly, the firm''s
    digitalization is highly focused on novel technologies (e.g., IoT) and some more
    innovative business models. The main focus of novel business models is on issues
    such as reduction, collection, reuse, recovery, and recycling. In case a firm
    completely executes the best practices and the principles of smart manufacturing,
    it can maximize the synergy between circular economy and digitalization. In addition,
    it will be capable of maximizing reuse, decreasing energy waste, saving capital,
    re-manufacturing and recycling its products, components, and materials. This way,
    it will succeed to enhance its overall sustainability and profit. To analyze,
    rank, and evaluate the main criteria to the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart
    manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs, this study introduced an integrated
    decision-making method using q-ROFSs. In this regard, a novel decision-making
    approach using q-ROF-MEREC-RS and q-ROF-DNMA methods called the q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA
    method is introduced to evaluate the main criteria for the adoption of IDTs for
    sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs and the industries
    to implement of Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing systems. To rank the main criteria
    for the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems for Industry
    4.0 in SMMEs, the q-ROF-MEREC-RS method is utilized, and to compute the preference
    order of different industries to the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing
    systems for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs, the q-ROF-DNMA method is used. To validation
    of the results of this study, a comparison using the q-ROF-TOPSIS, q-ROF-WSM,
    q-ROF-WPM, and q-ROF-WASPAS methods is conducted. To the best knowledge of the
    authors of the current paper, the literature lacks adequate research into the
    development of systematic methodologies to design SMSs. This paper contributes
    to the body of knowledge in two aspects: (1) analyze, rank, and evaluate the main
    criteria for the adoption of IDTs for sustainable smart manufacturing systems
    for Industry 4.0 in SMMEs and (2) a novel fuzzy decision-making methodology has
    been proposed; indeed, this study introduced an integrated decision-making method
    using q-ROFSs. In this regard, a novel decision-making approach using q-ROF-MEREC-RS
    and q-ROF-DNMA methods called q-ROF-MEREC-RS-DNMA was proposed, which can provide
    some practical guidelines for designing SMSs in certain applications. Remember
    that ‘practical’ here refers to the views of specific enterprises with given resources,
    technology accesses, and the interests of business domains, strategies, and performance
    indicators, including costs. Author contributions Li Yang: Conceptualization,

  description: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) will trigger
    disruptive changes to transportation systems via efficient driving, efficient
    use of travel time, reduced emissions and improved safety, mobility, roadway capacity,
    etc. However, these technologies might increase vehicle miles traveled (VMT),
    travel times, and ownership costs. Shared mobility systems can alleviate the high
    price of these technologies, but they will result in users' waiting time, inconvenience,
    and increased VMT. This study captures a variety of trade-offs in developing a
    fleet optimization multiclass user (with different value of travel time (VOTT))
    problem considering AVs and EVs in both private and shared mobility systems. Two
    metaheuristic algorithms are developed and compared to solve the computationally
    complex large-scale non-linear optimization problem defined in this study. The
    case study (Ann Arbor, Michigan) results are sensitive to trip lengths, VOTT,
    emissions and travel time savings (in AVs). The proposed framework provide valuable
    insights for planning of emerging technologies.

    Get rights and content Abstract Autonomous vehicles (AVs) and electric vehicles
    (EVs) will trigger disruptive changes to transportation systems via efficient
    driving, efficient use of travel time, reduced emissions and improved safety,
    mobility, roadway capacity, etc. However, these technologies might increase vehicle
    miles traveled (VMT), travel times, and ownership costs. Shared mobility systems
    can alleviate the high price of these technologies, but they will result in users''
    waiting time, inconvenience, and increased VMT. This study captures a variety
    of trade-offs in developing a fleet optimization multiclass user (with different
    value of travel time (VOTT)) problem considering AVs and EVs in both private and
    shared mobility systems. Two metaheuristic algorithms are developed and compared
    to solve the computationally complex large-scale non-linear optimization problem
    defined in this study. The case study (Ann Arbor, Michigan) results are sensitive
    to trip lengths, VOTT, emissions and travel time savings (in AVs). The proposed
    framework provide valuable insights for planning of emerging technologies. Previous

    1. Introduction Cars started as environmental saviors, clearing the streets from
    horse manure, possible fleas, and even carcasses (Kars4Kids, 2017, Keim, 2013,
    Levitt and Dubner, 2009, Nikiforuk, 2013). Later, cars turned into one of the
    significant environmental challenges. In 2018, transportation was the leading
    contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the US, with light-duty vehicles accounting
    for about 60 % of production in this sector (EPA, 2020). The shift from horses
    to cars significantly changed the transportation industry. In addition to the
    environmental advantages, the benefits of this change include but are not limited
    to increased speed, accessibility to destinations located at longer distances,
    high carrying capacity, city connectivity, and economic growth (Private Fleet,
    2010). The transportation system is facing another significant change, moving
    toward autonomous vehicles (AV) and electric vehicles (EV) technology. These technologies
    will trigger disruptive changes to transportation systems, infrastructure, and
    users'' travel behavior. Despite myriad potential benefits like improved safety
    and mobility, reduced emission, and efficient use of travel time; these technologies
    might affect vehicle miles traveled (VMT), travel time, and ownership cost (Childress
    et al., 2015, Kavianipour et al., 2020, Singh et al., 2021, Wadud et al., 2016).
    Studies indicate that AVs can promote EV adoption (Annema, 2020, Brown and Dodder,
    2019, Weiss et al., 2017). The AVs can enhance the battery performance and life
    of EVs by optimizing the driving cycles and energy recovery during regenerative
    braking (Annema, 2020), which will alleviate some of the limitations of EVs. On
    the other hand, EVs can resolve the issues of increased emissions (Wang et al.,
    2018) and operating costs (Weiss et al., 2017) associated with increased VMT due
    to the deployment of AVs on roads. Due to their low operating cost, EVs can also
    reduce the total ownership cost of Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEV) (Weiss et
    al., 2017). However, these technologies might not be affordable to the users,
    considering the added cost of AV technology and electric battery price (Hidrue
    et al., 2011, Singh et al., 2021). The additional cost of these technologies promotes
    their adoption as a shared mobility system where users are not required to buy
    these vehicles. Instead, these will be owned by transportation network companies
    (TNC). The shared mobility would also reduce the vehicle ownership and fleet size
    requirements (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014, Golbabaei et al., 2020, Singh et al.,
    2021), parking demand (Golbabaei et al., 2020), labor costs (Hyland and Mahmassani,
    2018), and the cold start emissions (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014, Singh et al.,
    2021). However, this system poses additional challenges such as waiting time and
    the emanated inconvenience (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014, Singh et al., 2021),
    increased VMT (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014, Oh et al., 2020, Singh et al., 2021),
    and increased congestion (Oh et al., 2020) due to empty miles. In light of the
    above, the crucial concern is the optimal approach and policy focus to adopt these
    technologies. The main objective of the study is to develop a modeling framework
    for optimizing the adoption of AVs and EVs in private and shared mobility systems
    considering multiclass users with different values of travel time (VOTT). This
    study aims to capture the trade-offs among the various potential advantages and
    disadvantages of AV and EV technologies, including changes in travel time, increase
    in VMT, travel and driving behavior, operating costs, and ownership costs that
    will govern the adoption of these technologies. A non-linear optimization model
    is developed to estimate the fleet configuration in a multiclass user system that
    minimizes the system cost, which includes total time (travel time and waiting
    time), emissions (running and cold start emissions), ownership cost, operating
    cost, driver cost, and crash cost. The fleet configuration is a combination of
    private manual-driven vehicles (PMVs), private manual-driven electric vehicles
    (PMEVs), private autonomous vehicles (PAVs), private autonomous electric vehicles
    (PAEVs), shared manual-driven vehicles (SMVs), shared manual-driven electric vehicles
    (SMEVs), shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs), and shared autonomous electric vehicles
    (SAEVs). The metaheuristic algorithms are developed and compared to solve the
    computationally complex real-world transportation problem. The model is implemented
    for the Ann Arbor, Michigan network to propose policies and scenarios that favor
    adopting AV and EV technologies targeting different stakeholders. The main contributions
    of the study are: • Capturing the trade-offs among the influential factors, including
    changes in travel and driving behavior, operating costs, increase in VMT, travel
    time, and ownership costs that will govern the adoption of AV and EV technologies.
    • Considering multiclass users with different VOTTs, a mathematical model for
    optimizing the adoption of AVs and EVs in private and shared mobility systems
    minimizes the system cost. • Developing and comparing metaheuristic algorithms
    to solve the non-linear computationally complex real-world transportation problem.
    These contributions will be further clarified with the gaps in the literature
    as listed below. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section
    provides the literature review on the implications of AV and EV technology. Then
    the “Problem Statement” is discussed, followed by the “Problem Formulation,” including
    the optimization problem and the cost functions. This section is followed by the
    solution approach to solve the non-linear computationally complex problem. Next,
    “Numerical Experiments” are presented for the two case studies: hypothetical network
    and Ann Arbor, Michigan. Finally, the key findings and conclusions are presented
    in the last section. 2. Literature review Many studies have investigated the impacts
    of AV and EV technologies on the transportation system. The studies have discussed
    the implication of these technologies in private or shared mobility systems. These
    implications are discussed in the following sub-sections. 2.1. Implications of
    AVs AVs will improve some aspects of the transportation system while demoting
    others. AVs will allow users to efficiently use their travel time for leisure,
    work, rest, etc., thereby reducing the VOTT (de Looff and de Correia, 2018, Singh
    et al., 2021). AVs will reduce crashes and improve system safety due to a reduction
    in human error (Wadud et al., 2016). The shorter reaction time of AVs allows for
    smaller headways and improved road capacity (Childress et al., 2015), consequently
    reducing the travel time. The platooning effect and eco-driving behavior of AVs
    will also reduce energy consumption and emission (Wadud et al., 2016). AVs allow
    non-drivers to travel independently (Singh et al., 2021). A recent survey shows
    that people with disabilities believed that AVs would fulfill their travel needs
    and are preferred over other alternatives (Hwang et al., 2020). However, the above-mentioned
    factors will also increase the travel demand, VMT, and system travel time. Dias
    et al., 2020 extended four-step modeling and estimated that AVs would increase
    vehicle hours traveled (VHT) and VMT by 2.8 % and 6.9 %, respectively, which can
    be attributed to reduced VOTT and improved roadway capacity (Dias et al., 2020).
    Other studies showed that the VMT could increase by 2–20 % due to reduced VOTT,
    usability by non-drivers, improved roadway capacity, and reduced parking cost
    (Childress et al., 2015, Kröger et al., 2019). The increased miles driven will
    increase emission production in the system, operating cost, and travel time. These
    adverse effects of increased VMT (due to AVs) can be attenuated by EVs as this
    technology can substantially reduce emissions and operating costs. 2.2. Implications
    of EVs EVs are becoming popular because of their higher energy efficiency (Annema,
    2020) as compared to gasoline vehicles. Recent growth in EV adoption has a significant
    impact on emissions and energy usage (Chen et al., 2016, Kavianipour et al., 2020).
    However, the limited driving range (Ghamami et al., 2020, Hidrue et al., 2011),
    the high purchase price (Hidrue et al., 2011), and the low density of charging
    infrastructure (Ghamami et al., 2020, Hidrue et al., 2011) has impeded the adoption
    of EVs. Studies have shown that investing in charging infrastructure, rather than
    providing purchase subsidies, further improves EV adoption (Nie et al., 2016).
    There is also a trade-off in investing the available funds in battery or charging
    infrastructure technological advancement (Nie and Ghamami, 2013). Ghamami et al.
    suggested that the smaller batteries with denser charging infrastructure might
    be more cost-effective than building long-ranged plug-in EVs (Ghamami et al.,
    2016). As infrastructure is one of the main challenges in the adoption of EVs,
    the optimal location of charging infrastructure for EVs has been of interest to
    researchers (Ghamami et al., 2020, Kavianipour et al., 2021). The AV technology
    can reduce some of the limitations of EVs, which will promote their adoption.
    2.3. Synergies and combined implications of autonomous-electric vehicles technology
    As discussed above, AVs and EVs can impact the transportation system. However,
    the synergy between AV and EV technology can ameliorate and enhance some of these
    impacts and influence the adoption of both technologies. Some features of AVs
    require a battery (Brown and Dodder, 2019), which will further promote EV adoption.
    EVs'' zero tailpipe emission can partially attenuate the environmental consequences
    of increased VMT by adopting AVs (Wang et al., 2018). EVs can reduce the operating
    cost induced due to an increase in travel demand associated with the adoption
    of AVs, which can also offset the higher purchase price of AEVs (Weiss et al.,
    2017). The induced travel demand by adopting AVs may increase gasoline fuel prices,
    promoting the adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles such as EVs (Brown and Dodder,
    2019). On the other hand, AV technology can implement efficient algorithms promoting
    a smoother drive cycle and maximizing energy recovery with regenerative braking
    (Annema, 2020). AEVs can be programmed to choose energy-efficient routes, considering
    congestion, intersection control, etc. (Annema, 2020), improving battery efficiency.
    Improved battery efficiency and driving range, as a result, will mitigate range
    anxiety and enhance the battery life of AEVs. AVs are more compatible with vehicle-to-grid
    (V2G) technology by synchronizing operating, charging, and discharging algorithms
    (Lam et al., 2016). This allows AEV owners to receive compensation for delivering
    energy to the grid during peak hours (Annema, 2020) and will encourage users to
    adopt AEVs. However, AVs and EVs have higher purchase prices due to the additive
    cost of LIDAR and battery, respectively. The AV technology cost is predicted to
    be $3000-$12,000 (Ihs, 2014, Reuters, 2022). EVs are also more expensive than
    gasoline vehicles, as the major portion of the cost is the cost of their batteries.
    Studies show that the price of Lithium-Ion batteries has reduced by 80 % from
    2013 to 2020 (BloombergNEF, 2020). However, the unit battery cost is still $137/kWh
    in 2020 (BloombergNEF, 2020). The high purchase price of these technologies questions
    the affordability of these vehicles as private modes. However, adopting these
    technologies as a shared mobility system might overcome these challenges. 2.4.
    Shared mobility with autonomous-electric vehicles The AV technology facilitates
    the deployment of dynamic ridesharing systems (Krueger et al., 2016), reducing
    fleet size, emissions, congestion, and parking demand (Golbabaei et al., 2020).
    SAVs provide guaranteed compliance to real-time changes in demand compared to
    human-driven taxis (Hyland and Mahmassani, 2018). A well-planned and demand-responsive
    system will decrease the fleet size requirement and users'' waiting time compared
    to a conventional taxi system (Spieser et al., 2016). The replacement rate of
    the SAV is defined as the number of PMVs a single SAV can replace while serving
    the same equivalent demand due to its ability to travel independently. This replacement
    is larger for SAVs as compared to SAEVs due to the long charging time and low
    range of EV batteries (Chen et al., 2016, Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014). AVs have
    the potential to partially overcome the limitation of EVs, especially in a shared
    mobility system, by automating the charging process and managing the range, considering
    the location of charging stations and real-time demand (Chen et al., 2016). SAEVs
    provide a driver-free method to efficiently relocate vehicles based on real-time
    demand and charging infrastructure availability (Chen et al., 2016). SAEVs not
    only reduce labor costs (Hyland and Mahmassani, 2018) but also reduce energy costs
    (Chen et al., 2016) of TNCs providing shared mobility services. The AV technology
    increases the vehicle utilization rate in the shared mobility system (Weiss et
    al., 2017), increasing the miles traveled and the associated operating and emission
    costs. This promotes the electrification of the fleet with substantial savings
    in operating costs (Weiss et al., 2017) and zero tailpipe emissions. The reduction
    in cold-start emissions (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014, Singh et al., 2021), and
    parking demand (Golbabaei et al., 2020) are some of the other advantages of SAVs.
    The shared mobility system increases users'' waiting time (Fagnant and Kockelman,
    2014, Singh et al., 2021), VMT (due to empty miles) (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014,
    Oh et al., 2020, Singh et al., 2021), and the total travel time in the system
    (Oh et al., 2020). The high replacement rate of SAVs or smaller fleet size exponentially
    increases the users'' waiting time and empty miles (Singh et al., 2021). The limited
    charging infrastructure is another potential barrier to the adoption of SAEVs.
    Studies have assessed the effect of charging infrastructure on the operation and
    performance of the SAEV fleet (Chen et al., 2016, Vosooghi et al., 2020). Further,
    the high charging time and limited battery size can affect service usage and increase
    waiting time for SAEVs (Vosooghi et al., 2020). 2.5. Research gap and motivation
    As discussed earlier, autonomous-electric technologies will improve the future
    of mobility while exacerbating some aspects of the transportation systems. Further,
    adopting these technologies as private or shared mobility systems will have different
    implications. The different trade-offs involved have been studied to estimate
    the generalized transportation cost and analyze the impact of AV and EV technologies.
    Some studies captured the impact of reduced VOTT (Correia and van Arem, 2016,
    Singh et al., 2021), empty miles (Correia and van Arem, 2016, Singh et al., 2021,
    Zhang et al., 2018), changes in parking cost (Correia and van Arem, 2016), and
    improved roadway capacity (Childress et al., 2015) due to adoption of private
    AVs (PAVs), while others considered SAVs and their effects on emissions (Fagnant
    and Kockelman, 2014, Singh et al., 2021) and VMT (Fagnant and Kockelman, 2014,
    Singh et al., 2021). Other studies estimate optimal policies (Nie et al., 2016),
    investment in charging infrastructure (Ghamami et al., 2016, Nie et al., 2016),
    and optimal location of charging stations (Ghamami et al., 2020, Kavianipour et
    al., 2021) for the adoption of EVs. Levin and Boyles captured the effect of improvement
    in roadway capacity and empty miles generated with the adoption of AVs (Levin
    and Boyles, 2015). The study results show an increase in the AV round trips, which
    is attributed to the shift of travel demand from transit to AVs. Singh et al.
    developed a modeling framework to minimize the transportation cost in a system
    of PMV, PAV, and SAV (Singh et al., 2021). The study captures the impact of different
    trade-off factors such as reduced VOTT, efficient driving, improved mobility,
    increased VMT, and the high purchase price of AV technology, on the transportation
    system and emissions. The study proposes different factors and functions such
    as the thresholds for the reduction in VOTT, the purchase price of SAVs with respect
    to PMVs, the replacement rate of SAVs, and the enhanced total lifetime mileage
    of PAVs. However, this study did not consider the impact of improved roadway capacity
    on travel time and the effect of EV technology on emissions and generalized transportation
    costs. A potential 2.5 % increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is estimated
    due to the deployment of AVs for 15 % of trips, which is attributed to changes
    in mode choice, travel behavior, and increased VMT (Wang et al., 2018). However,
    electrifying these AV trips can result in a 5 % reduction in well-to-wheel GHG
    emissions (Wang et al., 2018). This study did not consider the efficient driving
    behavior of AVs and the effect of AV/EV technology on generalized transportation
    costs considering ownership cost, operating cost, travel time, congestion, and
    safety. The prior research is focused on considering the limited number of factors
    influencing the adoption of AV and EV technologies. It is essential to capture
    trade-offs among all the influential factors to estimate the overall impact and
    favorable conditions for adopting these technologies. It is also crucial to capture
    and compare the effects of these technologies in both private and shared mobility
    systems together. In addition, these technologies will influence the various users
    with varying VOTT or income levels differently. Further, considering the synergies
    between AV and EV technology, it is also crucial to consider these technologies
    together to understand the impact of these emerging technologies on the transportation
    system and environment. None of the studies reviewed above has considered the
    effects of these emerging technologies (EV and AV) in private and shared mobility
    systems for multiclass users with different VOTT/income levels, to the best of
    the authors'' knowledge. This motivates us to develop a framework that will minimize
    generalized transportation costs under a system of these emerging technologies
    capturing their implications in both private and shared mobility systems. The
    different implications of these technologies are presented in Fig. 1. The study
    also considers multiclass users with different VOTTs. Download : Download high-res

    with different mobility options. 3. Problem Statement While the autonomous and
    electric vehicle technologies might improve the transportation system in different
    aspects, there are certain other aspects that might be worse off due to the implementation
    of such systems. However, the variety of trade-offs (Fig. 1) embedded in these
    options makes it challenging to determine the optimum combinations of these technologies
    required to provide a sustainable transportation system. This study aims to estimate
    the optimal fleet configuration considering AV and EV technologies in a private
    and/or shared mobility system to minimize the total system cost. This configuration
    is defined by the number of vehicles of each type and the number of PMVs each
    vehicle type replaces to ensure the feasibility of all trips. The vehicle types
    considered here are PMVs, PMEVs, PAVs, and PAEVs. Similarly, these vehicles are
    considered in a shared mobility system (SMV, SMEV, SAV, SAEV). These vehicle types
    are shown in Fig. 2. It is important to note that the shared mobility system considered
    in this study is like a taxi system or other carpooling services provided by TNC,
    which can serve multiple trips and users and allow users to carpool in the same
    vehicle. A non-linear optimization model is developed to minimize the total system
    cost considering the number of vehicles of each type, replacement rate of each
    vehicle type, and amount of interzonal trips of different user classes served
    by each vehicle type as decision variables. The system cost includes different
    cost terms in a monetary unit, estimated considering various factors, as shown
    in Fig. 3. The replacement rate for a vehicle type is defined as the number of
    PMVs replaced by one vehicle of type , serving equivalent trips. One shared vehicle
    or an AV can serve multiple trips by continuous repositioning to different pickup
    locations. Hence, these vehicles can replace multiple PMVs, which reduces the
    number of vehicles or fleet size in the system. However, a higher replacement
    rate increases the waiting time and empty miles in the system. Note that this
    study considers multiclass users'' problems with different VOTTs. Further, the
    study considers fully autonomous vehicles (i.e., Level 5 Autonomy) that do not
    require driver assistance. Download : Download high-res image (295KB) Download

    aims to capture the effects of different technologies (electrification and automation)
    on transportation systems. The adoption of these technologies has a variety of
    impacts on users'' convenience, travel behavior, travel cost, and travel time.
    These technologies will also impact the traffic flow dynamics, safety, and emission
    in transportation systems. The cost of owning and operating these vehicles is
    different than those of PMVs. Thus, this study proposes an optimization framework
    to find the optimum fleet configuration in a private and shared mobility system.
    The study considers eight different vehicle types, four in private modes (PMV,
    PMEV, PAV, PAEV) and four in shared systems (SMV, SMEV, SAV, SAEV). Note that
    both AV and EV technologies would have different implications on private and shared
    mobility systems. Further, the implications of these technologies would be different
    if considered together. Hence, this study considers all the possible technology
    combinations to propose the optimum scenario among the possible combinations in
    which these technologies can be adopted. The modeling framework, cost components,
    and factors influencing the adoption of different technologies are explained in
    the following subsections. The different notations used in this study are listed
    in Table 1. The superscripts are used to differentiate costs such as for travel
    time, re for running emissions, etc. The subscripts are used for indices in the
    sets such as for vehicle types and user classes. Table 1. Nomenclature. Sets Definition

    with different technologies and systems affect various cost types. However, it
    is crucial to estimate and minimize the overall cost of these technologies to
    the transportation system. The study objective is to estimate the optimum fleet
    configuration that will minimize the transportation cost, including time (travel
    time and waiting time cost), emissions (running emissions and cold start emissions),
    ownership cost, operating cost, driver cost, and crash costs (Equation (1)). The
    decision variables are the number of vehicles ( ) of each vehicle type , the replacement
    rate ( ) for each type, and the fraction of origin–destination ( ) trips for user
    class served by vehicle ( ). The parameters are the costs associated with the
    adoption of vehicle ( ) for the cost type . The optimization framework proposed
    is as follows: (1) s.t.: (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) ∊ (7) ∊ (8) Equation (2) ensures
    that all the trips of each user class are being served. Equation (3) ensures that
    the total time spent, which includes interzonal time (travel and waiting time),
    intrazonal time (travel and waiting time), the detour time to the refueling station,
    the refueling time, and the inconvenience time at the refueling station, is less
    than the total time available ( ). This constraint provides enough backup vehicles
    in the system to cover incidentals. If the vehicle of a particular fleet type
    requires extra time (e.g., refueling time for EVs), then those vehicles have less
    available time for serving the trips. Hence, additional vehicles of that type
    would be required to ensure all trips are served. Equation (4) certifies that
    the trips assigned to a specific vehicle type are served by providing the equivalent
    number of vehicles considering the estimated replacement rate ( ). The term is
    the number of vehicle trips per vehicle in the original system when there are
    only manual-driven vehicles. The term is the total number of vehicle trips in
    the original system (in the absence of EV/AV technology) that should be served
    by vehicle . (9) where, represents the fraction of users willing to carpool and
    is set as zero for private modes. The is the average car occupancy. The term is
    the total person trips in the original system between origin o and destination
    d, for the user class , during the time-period (peak or off-peak). Equations 5–8
    are the feasibility constraints, where the number of vehicles should be positive,
    the replacement rate for private modes is set as 1, the replacement rate for shared
    mode is set to a lower bound of 2 so that it operates as a shared mobility system,
    and the fraction ( ) should be>0. The remainder of this section is allocated to
    describe the estimation process for different cost terms in the objective function.
    4.1. Travel time cost The road network is modeled as a complete graph with zone
    centroids as demand generation and attraction points. The users are assumed to
    be selfish and tend to reduce their time. However, the study minimizes the total
    system cost considering system travel time. The average number of vehicle trips
    per hour for each vehicle type , on the path between zones and , during the peak/off-peak
    hour is expressed as follows: (10) Where the term represents the time duration
    of period . captures the increased trips due to improved mobility with the adoption
    of AVs. Adoption of AVs leads to efficient roadway utilization, hence improving
    the roadway capacity. These vehicles also allow users to efficiently use their
    travel time, consequently reducing the in-vehicle VOTT. AVs are known to enhance
    the mobility of non-drivers and reduce the parking cost due to self-parking at
    cheaper locations and better utilization of parking spaces (as no extra space
    is required for the driver to access the vehicle). All these potential benefits
    alter users'' travel behavior and increase the total trips in the system, which
    is captured by the parameter . is the decision variable representing the fraction
    of trips of user class assigned to vehicle type . This study captures the effect
    of high demand during the peak period on the utilization rate of vehicles and
    refueling/recharging requirements. However, to reduce the complexity of the optimization
    problem, it is assumed that the optimal solution is identical for both peak and
    off-peak periods. The roadway capacity during peak/off-peak hours, along the path
    between zones and , is estimated considering the fraction of different types of
    vehicles along the path, and the roadway capacity ) in a system of vehicle type
    This study accounts for the improved roadway capacity due to the adoption of AVs.
    The computer-controlled AVs operate at shorter headways (due to the reduced reaction
    time) and keep traffic flow parameters steady, boosting the maximum throughput/capacity
    (Lu et al., 2020). Considering the above effects on traffic flow, the travel time
    during peak/off-peak hours ( ) between zones and can be obtained using bureau
    of public roads (BPR) function as follows (Bureau of Public Roads, 1964): (11)
    Where, is the free-flow travel time between zones and , and and are the calibrated
    parameters of the BPR function for different roadway conditions (Bureau of Public
    Roads, 1964). Carpooling users might experience additional intrazonal travel times
    at trip origins and destinations during passengers'' pick up and drop off. The
    additional travel time per person trip experienced by the users already inside
    the vehicle, , can be obtained as follows: (12) where, is the average intrazonal
    distance between pickup/drop-off locations at zone . The is the average speed
    of vehicle type . The total travel time cost for vehicle is defined as follows:
    (13) Where is the set of zones in the network. The and are the VOTT for each user
    class and reduction factor for VOTT (RVOTT) with the efficient utilization of
    travel time in vehicle type . Unlike shared mobility systems and AVs, users of
    private non-AVs cannot utilize their travel times to perform any other activity
    inside the car besides driving. Therefore, the RVOTT is set as 1 for private non-AVs
    (PMV, PMEV). Further, the travel time savings in the shared mobility systems might
    be lesser than that in private AVs due to the inconvenience to the users. Hence,
    the travel time savings in shared mobility systems is assumed to be half of that
    in private AVs. 4.2. Waiting time cost The waiting time in a shared mobility system
    has two components. First, the time required for the empty vehicle to reach the
    origin of the first user ( ). Second, the average time required for the intrazonal
    trips (picking up the carpooling users in the same zone) ( ). The first component
    is the function of the replacement rate ) and the increased travel demand due
    to the adoption of AVs ( ) (Singh et al., 2021). The higher replacement rate would
    reduce the number of vehicles, resulting in an increased trip load on each vehicle.
    Consequently, this will increase the average waiting time (Singh et al., 2021).
    The larger number of trips in the system increases the likelihood of closer consecutive
    trips, reducing the average waiting time and travel distance (Singh et al., 2021).
    The factor for the shared mobility system is defined as follows (Singh et al.,
    2021): (14) The second component of the waiting time, defined as the average intrazonal
    time at origin zone , is defined as follows: (15) Thus, the total cost of waiting
    time is as follows: (16) where the term is the value of waiting time (VOWT) for
    the user class . 4.3. Miles traveled The VMT in a transportation system varies
    significantly with the adoption of different technologies. The AVs and shared
    mobility services generate empty rides in the system, resulting in an increased
    VMT. The improved mobility by the adoption of AVs further increases the system
    VMT. While carpooling would reduce interzonal miles, it would also add intrazonal
    miles to pickup/drop-off users. EVs may add extra detour miles for charging vehicles
    due to the limited number of charging stations in the system. The total miles
    traveled is defined for each vehicle type to capture these effects. The total
    miles traveled include three categories: interzonal and intrazonal miles traveled
    and detour miles traveled for refueling. The interzonal miles traveled per vehicle
    type , consists of the occupied miles traveled and empty miles, as follows: (17)
    where, and are the interzonal distance between zone and , and the number of vehicles
    of type present in the system, respectively. The empty miles ( ) is a function
    of the replacement rate and the increased number of trips ( ). A higher replacement
    rate increases the trip load on each vehicle, which increases the empty miles
    (Singh et al., 2021). The increased number of shared mobility trips increases
    the probability of closer consecutive trips, reducing the overall empty miles
    (Singh et al., 2021). Singh et al. estimated the empty mile function as follows
    (Singh et al., 2021), which is also adopted for this study: (18) ∊ ∊ ∊ The detour
    miles traveled ( to the refueling station is critical for EVs considering the
    limited number of charging stations in the system. It is a function of the density
    of refueling stations in the area (average distance traveled per refueling ( ))
    and the total number of times ( ) the vehicle needs to be refueled in a given
    time , which is defined as follows: (19) The number of times a vehicle needs to
    be refueled ( ) is a function of total miles traveled ( ) during time , and the
    total miles a vehicle can drive on a full fuel tank or battery (known as the range
    ( ) of the vehicle), which is defined as follows: (20) The intrazonal miles are
    traveled within all the origin and destination zones to pick up and drop off users
    carpooling in the same vehicle. The total intrazonal miles traveled per vehicle
    ) is a function of the average car occupancy, the average distance between consecutive
    pickup and drop-off locations, and the total carpooling trips, which is defined
    as follows: (21) The overall total miles per vehicle ( ) considering all the three
    components and using Equations (19), (20), is as follows: (22) 4.4. Emissions
    The emission cost is estimated considering major pollutants carbon dioxide (CO2),
    volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and particulate matter
    (PM)(Int Panis et al., 2006). The emission cost includes the societal cost of
    running and cold-start emissions in the system. The running emission cost ( )
    is a function of running emission per mile ( ) for emission type , total miles
    per vehicle ( , and the number of vehicles of vehicle type ( ), which is estimated
    as: (23) The term is the societal cost to produce a unit quantity of emission.
    The term is derived considering instantaneous emissions (Int Panis et al., 2006)
    as the function of instantaneous speed and acceleration of vehicle type , depending
    upon its driving behavior (eco-driving for AVs and non-eco-driving for other vehicles)
    (He et al., 2015, Singh et al., 2021). The cold-start emission cost ( ) is a function
    of normalized cold-start emission per mile ( ), and the occupied interzonal vehicle
    miles. It is important to note that the factor accounts for the reduction in cold-start
    in a shared mobility system. The number of cold starts reduces with an increased
    replacement rate ( ) and travel demand ( ) in a shared mobility system, due to
    continuous repositioning, reducing engine shut-off frequency. The for non-electric
    shared mobility system can be estimated as follows (Singh et al., 2021): (24)
    ∊ The cold-start emission cost is defined as follows: (25) 4.5. Ownership and
    operation costs The normalized ownership cost ( ) over the study period ( is the
    function of the purchase price ( ), total lifetime mileage of the vehicle (total
    miles a vehicle can travel during its entire lifetime), and miles traveled per
    vehicle ( ). It is important to note that the additional cost of AV technology
    is considered in the purchase price of AVs ( The normalized ownership cost ( )
    is as follows: (26) The operating cost ( ) includes fuel and maintenance costs.
    It is a function of the fuel cost per mile ( ), the maintenance cost per mile
    ( ), the miles traveled per vehicle ( ), and the number of vehicles . For EVs,
    the battery might have to be replaced after its life is expired. Hence, the operating
    cost for EVs is also a function of the life of the battery ( ), the battery price
    ( ), and the total lifetime mileage of the vehicle ( ). It is important to note
    that the fuel cost per mile ( ) accounts for the reduction in fuel consumption
    due to the efficient driving behavior of the AVs. The operating cost is defined
    as follows: (27) ∊ ∊ 4.6. Driver cost The non-AV shared vehicles (SMV, SMEV) require
    human drivers. Thus, there would be a cost to support the salary of these drivers.
    The labor cost ( ) depends on the hourly salary of the driver ( ), and the total
    service hours ( ). (28) The total service hours can be divided into five components:
    interzonal time (travel and waiting time), intrazonal time (travel and waiting
    time), detour time to the refueling station, refueling time, and inconvenience
    time at the refueling station: (29) Where, and are the average refueling time
    and inconvenience time at the refueling station. The inconvenience time is the
    time to drive the vehicle in and out of the station, remove and put the nozzle
    back, and pay at the station. 4.7. Crash cost The adoption of AVs is known to
    significantly reduce crashes and associated costs. Hence, it is crucial to consider
    this cost to estimate the optimum vehicle fleet configuration. The cost estimated
    due to crashes for vehicle type is as follows: (30) where the term is the average
    monetary value per crash. The term is the crashes per VMT in a system of vehicle
    type . This factor accounts for the reduction in crashes with the adoption of
    AVs. 5. Solution method The proposed optimization model in the previous section
    is a computationally complex problem that includes a non-linear objective function
    and non-linear constraints consisting of various non-linear functions (i.e., ceiling,
    exponential, and polynomial functions). A small-scale hypothetical transportation
    problem is solved using the non-linear commercial solver “Knitro.” Knitro is one
    of the most powerful and commonly used solvers for complex non-linear optimization
    problems (Artelys, 2019, Byrd et al., 2006, Ghamami et al., 2016). Therefore,
    the proposed model is implemented in the AMPL and solved using the Knitro. However,
    the current commercial solvers are not able to solve large-scale problems (i.e.,
    a mid-size city in the US). Hence, two metaheuristic algorithms based on the genetic
    algorithms (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms are developed in this
    study to solve large-scale problems. The developed metaheuristic algorithms are
    calibrated and validated using the small-scale network, and their performances
    are compared using a large-scale network in terms of solution quality and efficiency.
    5.1. Genetic algorithm (GA) This study proposes a metaheuristic algorithm based
    on the real-coded GA. However, due to the complexity of the proposed model, the
    GA algorithm takes a considerable amount of time to solve the models. Thus, certain
    modifications are made to improve the performance of the metaheuristic algorithm.
    In this section, we propose the general framework for GA, and then present certain
    modifications to increase the algorithm''s efficiency. The initial input to the
    real-coded GA includes detailed network data, travel demand, vehicle types, user
    classes, cost types, and user-defined algorithm parameters (Fig. 4). The algorithm
    is initialized by generating a population of (population size) random solutions
    (labeled as parent population set (PPS)). The algorithm is then performed for
    the total number of generations (gen) or until the termination condition is met.
    In each iteration, the objective function value (OBJ), constraint violation (CV),
    and fitness value (FV) are estimated for the set of solutions in the population
    set. The CV, estimated after normalizing the constraint, is defined as follows:
    (31) Download : Download high-res image (491KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Flow chart diagram for Genetic Algorithm. In which, is the non-negative
    constraint violation of the normalized constraint. If the CV is zero, then the
    solution is feasible. The penalty-parameter-less approach is adopted to estimate
    FV, which is an efficient constraint handling method (Deb, 2012, Deb, 2000). The
    FV is defined as follows: (32) where, is the maximum OBJ among all the feasible
    solutions in a given population set. This method minimizes CV rather than if no
    feasible solution exists. Among two feasible solutions, the one with a smaller
    has a better FV. In the next step, the selection/reproduction of different solutions
    is performed based on binary tournament selection without replacement (Deb, 2012).
    The solution with a lower fitness value has a higher chance of getting selected.
    Further, this method selects exactly-two (binary) copies of the best solution
    (lowest fitness). The crossover operation is performed on the new population set
    (labeled as child population set (CPS)) generated after the selection procedure.
    This study performs a simulated binary crossover (SBX) operator using a distribution
    index and crossover probability . The SBX is an efficient crossover method for
    real-coded GA (Deb and Agrawal, 1995). The higher value of generates the child
    solutions closer to the parent solutions. The crossover operation helps in searching
    the space close to the existing solutions. Then the mutation operation is performed,
    which implements a parameter-based mutation operation with polynomial distribution
    (distribution index ) (Deb, 2012, Deb, 2001). The mutation operation ensures that
    the GA algorithm does not get trapped in locally optimal solutions. The mutation
    probability ( ) is limited to small values to not deviate from good solutions.
    Finally, the survivor selection is performed, which compares the new set of solutions
    (CPS) with the PPS and chooses the best set of solutions out of the two population
    sets. This new set of best solutions is fed into the next iteration as PPS for
    the selection, crossover, and mutation process. The algorithm stops if the total
    number of generations is reached or the termination condition is met. The flow
    chart diagram for the proposed GA is shown below: To improve the efficiency of
    GA, first, the set of solutions is generated in such a way that the equality constraint
    in Equation (2) is always satisfied. This is done by assuming a new integer variable
    as follows: (33) where, is the number of vehicle types considered in the study.
    The algorithm is fed with the input variable rather than to optimize the objective
    function. The variable is determined based on the estimated value of , as follows:
    (34) Equations (33), (34) ensure that the constraint in Equation (2) is always
    satisfied. Further, the constraint in Equation (4) is used to estimate from the
    variable and thereby making it always satisfied. These modifications make it easier
    for GA to find a feasible solution and significantly reduce the required searching
    time to find the feasible set. To further improve the efficiency of the modified
    GA, a parallelization approach is adopted, which involves multiple processor cores
    (using a cloud cluster of high-performance computers) to perform evaluation operations
    on the large population set. The algorithm is initialized by generating a population
    of (population size) random solutions. These solutions are equally divided into
    smaller subsets, which are fed into different computer cores (80–100 computer
    cores) in a cloud cluster to improve the algorithm speed. Each computer cluster
    performs the GA algorithm in parallel on the smaller subset of the populations
    of solutions till the total number of iterations or termination condition is met.
    The best solution from the final subsets of the population of all computer clusters
    solved in parallel is reported as the optimum solution. 5.2. Simulated annealing
    (SA) The SA solution method proposed in this study starts by generating the initial
    feasible solution and determines the objective function value for this solution
    (Fig. 5). The algorithm consists of two iterative procedures. In the first iteration,
    a control parameter is reduced (similar to reducing the temperature as annealing
    in metallurgy), which reduces the probability of accepting worse solutions. In
    the second iterative procedure, the algorithm perturbs the current solution by
    changing the value of decision variables to obtain a neighborhood solution. The
    objective function value of the neighborhood solution is compared with that of
    the current solution. If the objective function value of the neighborhood solution
    is better, then the current solution is replaced by the neighborhood solution
    deterministically. However, if the objective function value of the neighborhood
    solution is worse, then it might replace the current solution probabilistically
    depending upon the difference in the objective function values. This allows the
    algorithm to avoid getting trapped in local optima (Ghamami et al., 2020). The
    current solution is updated based on the objective function value of the neighboring
    solution and the existing current solution. Then, another neighboring solution
    is randomly generated based on the current solution in the next iteration. The
    control parameter is adjusted through the first iterative procedure to reduce
    the probability of acceptance of the worse solution and ensure convergence to
    the best solution. Download : Download high-res image (399KB) Download : Download

    Experiments The modeling framework is implemented for a hypothetical case study
    and the real-world transportation network of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The values of
    different parameters for the “Base Scenario” are presented in Table 1. The hypothetical
    case study includes a transportation network with four zones and three user classes
    in a mid-sized urban area. These zones are assumed to be equidistant from one
    another (5 miles). A total of 30,000 trips per day are assumed to be equally distributed
    among each user class for each pair. In addition, the city of Ann Arbor consists
    of 36 Traffic Analysis zones (TAZ) and about 192,169 trips/day (Fig. 6). The distance
    between the zones varies from<5 miles to up to 23 miles. Further, the study considers
    three user classes differentiated based on their VOTT, as shown in Table 1. The
    VOTT of the different user classes is assumed based on variation in the hourly
    wage rate of the users in Ann Arbor, Michigan (U.S.B. of L.S, 2021). The study
    considers daily trips on a typical weekday in Ann Arbor to be equally distributed
    among the three user classes. The hypothetical problem is solved using the commercial
    solver “Knitro.” However, the proposed problem for the Ann Arbor network cannot
    be solved using commercial solvers. Hence, the proposed metaheuristic algorithms
    are deployed. Note that these metaheuristic algorithms are validated using the
    small-scale hypothetical problem using the commercial solver “Knitro”. Download

    on GA and SA algorithms, and their performance is compared with a commercial solver
    (Knitro) in this section. While these algorithms are faster, they find the same
    solution as the commercial solver for the hypothetical network (Table 2). Further,
    as the size of the problem grows, the commercial solver is unable to solve the
    problem. Table 2. Result and the Solution Time for different Optimization Techniques.

    SA 294,544 0.11 2,059,681 76.51 For Ann Arbor, the GA algorithm is parallelized
    using high-performance computers with multiple cores running in parallel (i.e.,
    cloud computing). In contrast, the SA algorithm is implemented using high-tech
    computers with substantial available RAM. The SA algorithm converges faster (about
    55 %) than the parallel GA algorithm (Table 2 and Fig. 7). The objective function
    value for the two algorithms is almost similar, with the value in GA slightly
    smaller. Thus, the SA algorithm should be used for the optimization problem that
    requires real-time output. However, to get more accurate results, GA should be
    used. Note that the original GA, without high-performance capabilities, takes
    over 140 h to find the optimal solution for the Ann Arbor, Michigan network. Hence,
    we adopt the parallelization approach to improve the efficiency of GA for Ann
    Arbor, Michigan. The parallelization reduced the solution time to 140.75 min.
    Further, high-tech computers are used to find the optimal solution using SA algorithm
    to ensure that the results are comparable to that of the GA algorithm. However,
    SA performance does not change significantly with the high-tech computers in solving
    the Ann Arbor network. Download : Download high-res image (72KB) Download : Download

    Michigan. The following subsection presents the results for the base scenario
    of the Ann Arbor network, followed by the sensitivity analysis with respect to
    different parameters. 6.2. Base scenario for Ann Arbor network The optimum mode
    for different user classes may vary with respect to trip length and depends upon
    the trade-offs between various factors such as operating costs, traffic congestion,
    travel time savings, etc. This subsection studies the base scenario considering
    the specifications and parameters listed in Table 1. The optimum mode for each
    user class and different trip lengths in the base scenario is shown in Fig. 8.
    The solution indicates the adoption of EVs (i.e., PMEVs, SAEVs, PAEVs) results
    in minimum system costs due to low operating costs and zero tailpipe emissions.
    The non-electric modes (PMVs, PAVs, SAVs) are not the optimal solution, resulting
    in significant emissions. Further, non-autonomous shared modes (SMVs, SMEVs) are
    not favorable as these modes pose higher crash and driver costs as compared to
    autonomous shared modes (SAEVs). Note that the total number of trips are higher
    if the adopted modes are autonomous or shared mode, which is attributed to improved
    mobility of the users in these systems. Download : Download high-res image (245KB)

    different user classes for long and short-distance commute trips for the base
    scenario in the Ann Arbor network. The lowest VOTT ($20/hr) users should predominantly
    adopt SAEVs to minimize the system cost (Fig. 8a). These users can avail of the
    benefits of travel time savings in SAEVs, and prefer waiting for these vehicles
    rather than incurring the high ownership cost of private modes. Note that the
    VOWT is a function of the VOTT of the users. The optimal solution favors the adoption
    of PMEVs by the second user class (VOTT=$50/hr) over SAEVs, especially for short-distance
    trips (<10 miles), as the travel time savings are not significant to outweigh
    the waiting time experienced by users in SAEVs (Fig. 8b). However, these travel
    time savings increases with an increase in the distance (>10 miles), making users
    shift to SAEVs. Further, the PAVs and PAEVs are not favorable for the second user
    class (Fig. 8b) because the travel time savings are not significant enough to
    outweigh the high ownership cost of these vehicles. The optimal solution for the
    third user class (VOTT= $100/hr) is the adoption of private modes (PAEVs, PMEVs)
    to avoid the waiting time (Fig. 8c). Further, the third user class (VOTT=$100/hr)
    should predominantly adopt PAEVs over PMEVs to avail of the benefits of reduced
    crash cost and travel time savings in the short distance trips (<10 miles). The
    long-distance trips (>10 miles) of these users (VOTT=$100/hr) shift to PMEVs over
    PAEVs because the increased number of trips (due to improved mobility by AVs)
    increases the operating cost and congestion, which outweighs the travel times
    savings, and crash reduction benefits in PAEVs (Fig. 8c). 6.3. Sensitivity analysis
    for Ann Arbor network The different parameters of the model are expected to change
    as the AV and EV market evolves. These factors, such as travel time savings, the
    purchase price of the vehicle, and AV technology cost, would govern the fleet
    configuration in the system. Further, different stakeholders might be interested
    in the optimum fleet configuration under various scenarios. For example, system
    planners would be interested in overall system costs, TNC might be interested
    in fleet size in carpooling and non-carpooling scenarios, and users might be interested
    in the costs directly impacting them. The sensitivity analysis of the results
    with respect to the above-mentioned factors for the Ann Arbor, Michigan network
    is presented in this section. 6.3.1. Sensitivity to reduction factor for VOTT
    (RVOTT) The RVOTT represents the most critical factor that captures the ability
    of the autonomous or shared mobility system to allow users to efficiently use
    their travel time for other activities rather than driving. These travel time
    savings can offset the high ownership cost of AVs. The lower value of RVOTT implies
    more significant travel time savings. Thus, the sensitivity of the results to
    variations of RVOTT as the technology evolves is presented in Fig. 9 (the RVOTT
    for the base scenario is equal to 0.8 (Singh et al., 2021, van den Berg and Verhoef,
    2016)). The dominant optimum vehicles are EVs. It can be observed that the solution
    shifts to PAEVs as the RVOTT is reduced, which is intuitive due to substantial
    travel time savings that dominate over the high ownership cost and increased congestion
    (with increased VMT). Further, making these autonomous vehicles electric also
    reduces the operating costs and emissions in the system. Download : Download high-res

    trips from zone 5 (origin) to all the other zones for different user classes (i-iii)
    in the Ann Arbor network. The optimal solution recommends users with the lowest
    VOTT ($20/hr) to predominantly adopt SAEVs because these users would prefer waiting
    for SAEVs rather than owning these costly vehicles as private modes (Fig. 9a-d(i)).
    If there are no travel time savings (RVOTT = 1), the optimal solution indicates
    PMEVs as the optimal solution for users with high VOTT ( 50/hr) due to the high
    ownership cost of private autonomous vehicles (PAVs, PAEVs) and high waiting time
    cost of the shared mode (Fig. 9a (ii, iii)). The minimum system cost solution
    indicates users with VOTT of $50/hr adopt PAEVs over PMEVs, only if travel time
    savings are substantial (RVOTT 0.6) to outweigh the high ownership costs of these
    vehicles (Fig. 9c-d, (ii)). However, lesser travel time savings are required (RVOTT
    0.8) in the case of users with a VOTT of $100/hr for the optimal solution to be
    PAEVs (Fig. 9b-d, (iii)). Further, users with the highest VOTT ($100/hr) may adopt
    PAEVs for long-distance trips (>10 miles), only if the travel time savings are
    40 % (RVOTT ); otherwise, these vehicles increases congestion and operating cost
    due to improved mobility in the system. The SAEVs are not the optimal solution
    for users with high VOTT ( $50/hr) because they prefer private vehicles rather
    than waiting for the shared vehicle to pick them up. Investment in promoting SAEVs
    is recommended even if there are no travel time savings, provided that users have
    low VOTT. The PAEVs adoption will favor the system if there are at least 20 %
    savings in the travel time with amenities onboard. These amenities can be the
    availability of charging ports, tables, computers, etc., to conduct meetings inside
    the vehicle or some collection of books, games, and novels for recreational activities
    allowing users to make their travel time productive. The policies can be adopted
    to encourage TNCs to operate the fleet of SAEVs in the regions with denser populations
    of users with low VOTT or low income. Further, to promote the adoption of PAEVs,
    technology advancements are required to provide onboard amenities in the vehicle
    such that it provides ambiance to perform other activities, e.g., organizing meetings,
    reading books, or other recreational activities. 6.3.2. Sensitivity to the cost
    of AV technology The additional cost of AV technology is one of the significant
    factors governing the adoption of such vehicles. The study considers two scenarios:
    1) adding AV technology to mid-priced cars ($30,000) that are affordable to most
    users, and 2) adding AV technology to luxurious cars ($80,000), affordable for
    high-income users. The AV technology cost varies from zero to half of the vehicle
    price, depending on the amenities provided. In the scenario with mid-priced cars
    (Fig. 10a), users with the lowest VOTT ($20/hr) should predominantly adopt SAEVs,
    irrespective of the AV technology cost, due to travel time savings, smaller waiting
    cost, and reduced ownership cost in the shared mode. Users with VOTT of $50/hr
    should adopt a mix of SAEVs and PMEVs. The SAEVs would be optimal for long-distance
    trips when the travel time savings outweighs the waiting time cost. However, for
    short-distance trips, the waiting time is a significant portion of the total trip
    time, and travel time savings are not enough in SAEVs making users (VOTT=$50/hr)
    switch to PMEVs. Further, the optimal solution for these users is PAEVs only if
    there is no additional cost of AV technology. The optimal solution for the third
    user class (VOTT=$100/hr) would predominantly be PAEVs until the price of the
    AV technology cost is greater than one-third of the vehicle price. At a higher
    cost (half of the vehicle price), the travel time savings do not outweigh the
    high ownership cost of PAEVs, and these users (VOTT=$100/hr) switch to PMEVs.
    Note that the PAEVs are the optimal solution at low AV technology cost even though
    PAEVs are more expensive than PAVs due to low operating costs and zero tailpipe
    emissions. Download : Download high-res image (411KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 10. Sensitivity of optimum vehicle type for different user classes
    to (a) mid-priced and (b) luxurious cars equipped with AV technology in the Ann
    Arbor network. In the scenario with luxurious cars (Fig. 10b), the system cost
    would be minimum if the fleet composition has SAEVs and PMEVs for the AV technology
    cost greater than zero. Users with high VOTT ($100/hr) may adopt PMEVs to avoid
    waiting in the shared mode. Users with VOTT $50/hr should predominantly adopt
    SAEVs for the system cost to be minimum. SAEVs provide benefits such as travel
    time savings, reduced ownership costs, and reduced crash costs that dominate the
    waiting time costs. Further, PMEVs are expensive to afford due to high vehicle
    prices in addition to the added battery replacement cost, which is significant
    in the private mode. As the AV technology cost is reduced to zero, users with
    high VOTT ($100/hr) should shift to PAEVs due to substantial travel time savings.
    The adoption of AV technology is recommended in the shared electric mode for users
    with low VOTT ( $50/hr) even if the price of AV is substantial (30–50 % of the
    vehicle price). Users with the highest VOTT ($100/hr) should preferably adopt
    PAEVs unless the vehicle price and AV technology cost are substantial, making
    these users shift to PMEVs for minimum system cost. The policies should be adopted
    to promote autonomous and electric vehicles together to ameliorate and enhance
    each others'' effects. The low operating costs of EVs offset the high ownership
    cost of AVs. Further, the ownership cost can be further reduced if these vehicles
    are adopted as a shared mode, which can be utilized by low-income groups. The
    technology advancements are further needed to be improved to adopt AV as private
    modes so that the cost of AV technology should come down to at least one-third
    of the vehicle prices. In the case of luxurious cars, the cost of AV technology
    should be negligible relative to the price of the vehicle to be adopted as the
    private mode. 6.3.3. Sensitivity with respect to replacement rate and carpooling
    The replacement rate of the shared modes is an essential factor that governs the
    fleet size requirement relative to the total number of trips. It affects the empty
    miles, users'' waiting time, and cold-start emissions. In addition, carpooling
    reduces the fleet size requirement (increasing the replacement rate) and reduces
    the empty miles while increasing the waiting time of users sharing the same ride.
    Hence, the sensitivity analysis with respect to the replacement rate for carpooling
    and non-carpooling scenarios is presented in this subsection. In the carpooling
    scenario, 20 % of the users are assumed to share the ride (base scenario), and
    in the non-carpooling scenario, it is assumed that no two users share the same
    ride. The result shows that the SAEVs are less likely to be the optimal solution
    with an increase in replacement rate due to an exponential rise in empty miles
    and users'' waiting time (Fig. 11). Hence, the fleet size should be provided as
    large as the number of vehicle trips in the system, resulting in a replacement
    rate as low as possible. Further, if the replacement rate is lower ( 6), the trips
    served by SAEVs are lower in the carpooling scenario (Fig. 11a) as compared to
    the non-carpooling scenario (Fig. 11b). The user''s waiting time increases with
    the carpooling due to extra time to pick up users sharing the same ride. However,
    at a higher replacement rate ( 9), the carpooling substantially reduces the empty
    miles generated, which dominates the extra waiting time added for carpooling.
    Thus, the number of trips served by SAEVs increases in the carpooling scenario
    (Fig. 11a) relative to the non-carpooling scenario (Fig. 11b) due to a reduction
    in the empty miles generated. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Optimum vehicle type under different replacement
    rates (fleet size) for (a) carpooling and (b) non-carpooling scenario for the
    Ann Arbor network. The larger fleet size or lower replacement rate reduces the
    users'' waiting time and empty miles, reducing the normalized ownership and operating
    costs. Further, this larger fleet size is also favorable to TNCs because although
    the upfront cost would be higher, each of these vehicles would have lesser operating
    costs, which extends the effective life of these vehicles. A higher replacement
    rate or a reduced fleet size should preferably be adopted in the regions where
    users are more willing to share their rides. The TNC should deploy its fleet size
    considering the above factors. Note that the non-carpooling component of the replacement
    rate is the decision variable of the optimization problem. The optimal solution
    always sets this component to the lower bound value, which indicates that the
    cost associated with the exponential increase in the empty miles and user''s waiting
    time dominates the reduction in the cost associated with the decrease in the cold-start
    emissions (or zero tailpipe emissions in EVs). Hence, the sensitivity results
    presented here are obtained by setting the lower bound of the replacement rate
    (decision variable) to higher values. Further, the replacement rate in Fig. 11
    accounts for the reduction in the fleet size by both the non-carpooling and carpooling
    components. 6.3.4. Sensitivity to fuel and maintenance cost The fuel and maintenance
    cost of gasoline and electric vehicles fluctuate with time. Hence, it is important
    to do sensitivity analysis with respect to these parameters to understand the
    optimal solution under different fuel and maintenance cost (Aaa, 2022a, Aaa, 2022b,
    Fhwa, 2021, Kavianipour et al., 2021, Singh et al., 2021). Base fuel cost =  Increased
    fuel cost=. Base maint =  Increased maint=. Increased fuel cost per mile (Aaa,
    2022a, Fhwa, 2021, Kavianipour et al., 2021, Singh et al., 2021). Increased maintenance
    cost per mile (AAA, 2022b). The sensitivity results with respect to these costs
    are shown in (Fig. 12). It can be observed that the results are insensitive to
    the increase in fuel cost (Fig. 12b), as EVs were already the optimal solution
    for the base scenario. The rise in gasoline prices further increases the system
    cost associated with non-EVs. Note that the electric fuel price is observed to
    be similar to the base case as indicated above. The increase in the maintenance
    cost results in optimal solution switching from SAEVs to SAVs for the users with
    low VOTT (<$20/hr) (Fig. 12c). The maintenance cost of SAVs becomes comparable
    to that of SAEVs (because of a higher increase in EV maintenance cost from the
    base case). The lower ownership cost of SAVs outweighs the savings in emissions
    and maintenance costs due to SAEVs. A similar observation can be made for user
    class with VOTT $50/hr with SAEV trips switching to SAVs. However, the optimal
    solution is predominantly PMEVs for short distances (<10 miles) because travel
    time savings in SAVs do not significantly outweigh the waiting cost. For longer
    distances (>10 miles), the travel time savings in SAVs outweighs the waiting cost
    resulting in the optimal solution, predominantly SAVs for the second user class.
    The optimal solution for the user class with the highest VOTT ($100/hr) switches
    to PAVs over PAEVs because the low ownership cost of PAVs outweighs the lower
    maintenance cost (smaller difference in maintenance cost) and emissions savings
    of PAEVs (Fig. 12c). Further, the long-distance trips of these users (VOTT $100/hr)
    are still predominantly PMEV because the PAVs result in increased trips due to
    improved mobility, increasing the operating cost and congestion. The PMVs are
    not the optimal solution because these increase the emission cost as compared
    to PMEVs. It can be observed from Fig. 12d that the solution remains almost similar
    as we increase both the fuel and maintenance costs with respect to the base case
    (Fig. 12d). This is because the effect of increased fuel cost is dominant over
    the impact of increased maintenance cost. Download : Download high-res image (701KB)

    fuel and maintenance costs for different user classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
    6.3.5. Optimal solution without considering emissions Due to their zero tailpipe
    emissions, EVs are favored to be included in the optimal solution. In this subsection,
    we minimize the system cost without considering emissions to capture the shift
    in the optimal solution ignoring this societal cost. Fig. 13 indicates that the
    solution changes significantly if we do not consider emissions. Users with the
    lowest VOTT ($20/hr) should adopt SAVs to minimize the system cost as these users
    would not mind waiting for these vehicles and avail the benefits of travel time
    savings (Fig. 13a). Further, the private and electric modes are not preferable
    due to their high ownership cost. Users with VOTT $50/hr should adopt a mix of
    SAVs, PMEVs, and PMVs (Fig. 13b). The SAVs should be adopted for long-distance
    trips to avail benefits of substantial travel time savings and insignificant waiting
    time. However, the travel time savings are not significant to outweigh the waiting
    time cost for short-distance trips, and the users should switch to private modes.
    The PMEVs and PMVs should be adopted for short-distance trips by users with VOTT
    $50/hr, with most of the trips by PMEVs due to low operating costs compared to
    PMVs. The PAVs and PAEVs are not part of the optimal solution because of their
    high ownership cost. The users with high VOTT ($100/hr) predominantly adopt PAVs
    due to substantial travel time savings and reduced crash cost (as opposed to non-AVs),
    and no waiting time (as opposed to the shared mode) (Fig. 13c). Further, the PAEVs
    do not minimize the system cost as these contribute to additional battery costs,
    increasing ownership costs. In conclusion, proper policies should be implemented
    to make users adopt environmental-friendly vehicles (EVs) to favor the system.
    This can be done by imposing carbon taxes, providing rebates over EV purchases,
    developing adequate charging infrastructure, etc. Download : Download high-res

    6.3.6. Optimal solutions considering costs directly impacting users The users''
    main goal is to fulfill their trips with maximum benefits. Hence, it is crucial
    to estimate the optimal solution considering the costs directly impacting the
    users. These costs include travel time, waiting time, ownership, operating, and
    driver costs. The optimal solution is shown in Fig. 14. The users with the lowest
    VOTT ($20/hr) predominantly adopt SAVs due to low ownership cost, less waiting
    time, and travel time savings in SAVs (Fig. 14a). The users with high VOTT ( $50/hr)
    predominantly adopt PMEVs, which is attributed to low operating costs (as opposed
    to PMVs), low ownership cost (as opposed to PAVs, PAEVs), and no waiting time
    (as opposed to shared mode) (Fig. 14b,c). The PAVs are adopted by some users with
    a high VOTT of $100/hr due to substantial travel time savings (Fig. 14c). Further,
    some of the trips for the users with VOTT of $50/hr are fulfilled by SAVs due
    to travel time savings, low ownership cost, and smaller waiting time costs (Fig.
    14b). Download : Download high-res image (150KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 14. Optimal solution while minimizing the costs directly impacting
    users for different user classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Hence, the users with
    a low VOTT prefer to adopt SAVs availing the benefits of autonomy without owning
    these vehicles. Certain policies should be adopted to encourage TNCs to operate
    the fleet of SAVs in the regions with denser populations of users with low VOTTs
    or low incomes. Users with high VOTTs predominantly prefer PMEVs. Hence, the adoption
    of EVs should be promoted by providing adequate charging infrastructure and eliminating
    the human factors which are difficult to capture, such as range anxiety and concerns
    about being stranded for a long time at the charging stations. 7. Conclusions
    and future recommendations AV technology provides various potential benefits such
    as improved safety, roadway capacity, mobility, and driver productivity. One of
    the outcomes of these benefits is the increased VMT in the system, which will
    increase emissions and operating costs and affect the total system travel time.
    The cost of owning these vehicles is also high due to added cost of AV technology.
    The emissions and operating costs can be significantly reduced with the adoption
    of EVs. However, EVs have a limited range, higher battery price, and limited refueling
    infrastructure. In light of these, AV and EV technology adoption in the shared
    mobility systems would be a promising solution. However, the shared mobility systems
    generate additional empty miles in the system and waiting time for users. Furthermore,
    the impact of these technologies would vary for different user classes defined
    based on their VOTT attributed to their income levels. This study builds a modeling
    framework to capture the trade-offs associated with emerging technologies/systems
    and estimates the optimum fleet configuration of these technologies with the minimum
    total system cost, considering both private and shared mobility systems. A fleet
    optimization problem is developed in a multiclass user system to minimize the
    system cost, including emission, ownership, operating, travel time, waiting time,
    crash, and driver costs. The solution to the optimization problem provides fleet
    configuration of different vehicle types (PMV, PMEV, PAV, PAEV, SMV, SMEV, SAV,
    SAEV), which is also specific to various user classes having different VOTT or
    income levels. The developed metaheuristic algorithms based on GA and SA are validated
    using a hypothetical problem and then implemented to solve the computationally
    complex non-linear real-world optimization problem (Ann Arbor, Michigan). The
    main findings from the research are as follows: • The optimal solution is a combination
    of private and shared mobility and is sensitive to the VOTT of the users, trip
    lengths, RVOTT, AV technology cost, ownership cost, replacement rate, emissions,
    and user-specific costs. • The GA and SA algorithms converge to a similar solution
    for smaller case studies. SA algorithm is twice faster than the GA. However, the
    GA provides a smaller objective function for larger case studies. • The EVs are
    recommended as the optimal solution for the system due to their low operating
    costs and zero tailpipe emissions. Hence, policies should be adopted to promote
    EVs by providing adequate charging infrastructure, rebates over the purchase of
    EVs, and imposing carbon taxes. • Electrifying AVs would lower the operating cost,
    offsetting their high ownership cost. Hence, policies should be adopted to promote
    vehicle automation and electrification together. • SAEV adoption is recommended
    for users with low VOTT ($20/hr) even if there are no travel time savings or the
    price of AV technology is substantial. Hence, these should be deployed in regions
    with a denser population of low VOTT/low-income groups. • SAEVs are also recommended
    for users with a VOTT of $50/hr, only if the trip length is>10 miles. • PMEVs
    are recommended for the short-distance trips (<10 miles) of users with mid-VOTT
    ($50/hr) and long-distance trips (>10 miles) of users with high VOTT ($100/hr).
    • PAEVs are recommended for short-distance trips (<10 miles) of users with a VOTT
    of $100/hr. In long-distance trips (>10 miles) of these users (VOTT=$100/hr),
    the travel time savings of at least 40 % (RVOTT ) is required for these trips
    to be PAEVs. • Adoption of PAEVs may also be favorable for users with high VOTT
    ($100/hr) if the AV technology cost of a mid-priced car ($30,000) is reduced to
    at least one-third of the vehicle price. The AV technology deployment cost for
    luxurious cars ($80,000) should be relatively negligible compared to the vehicle
    price, resulting PAEVs being favorable to users with high VOTT ($100/hr). • Technology
    advancements are required for promoting AVs as private mode so that the AV technology
    cost is reduced or the amenities onboard are improved, allowing efficient use
    of travel time through meetings, reading, or recreational activities. • The fleet
    size should be provided as large as the number of vehicle trips in the system.
    Carpooling is favorable to the system if and only if the fleet size is such that
    the replacement rate is>9. • Considering the costs directly impacting the users,
    the users with low VOTT or low incomes prefer SAVs. Users with high VOTT predominantly
    prefer PMEVs due to the low operating costs of EVs and no waiting time. Hence,
    EV adoption should be promoted by eliminating uncaptured human factors, such as
    range anxiety and waiting at charging stations. The policymakers and system planners
    can utilize the above findings to reduce the total system cost by introducing
    proper policies. The policies can be subsidies, road improvements, infrastructure
    development, etc. For instance, based on the length of the trips, the policymakers
    can plan to deploy different types of vehicles in various regions to support heterogeneous
    user classes, as proposed in this study. In addition, the study also provides
    evidence that if uncaptured human factors, such as range anxiety and concerns
    for being stranded for long time at the charging stations, can be eliminated,
    users will adopt EVs. Also, the sensitivity to RVOTT assists car companies with
    policies in designing AVs (i.e., improving onboard amenities) based on the required
    reduction in VOTT to promote adoption. The current study provides a broader perspective
    for planning the adoption of emerging technologies under different scenarios.
    The current study estimates fleet configuration considering the daily trips of
    users as well as peak hour demand. Hence, the future scope would be to distinguish
    between peak and off-peak hour travel patterns. Another future scope would be
    to consider the time spent in the queue for charging at the EV charging stations.
    The study can be further extended to consider parking costs and the trade-off
    between empty miles and the parking costs for shared AVs. There can be multiple
    automated mobility-on-demand operators in the system (Wang, Correia, & Lin, 2022).
    Thus, future studies should consider different automated mobility-on-demand operators,
    simultaneously providing service to the users to get more insights on operational
    requirements of these technologies. Also, some studies showed that the roadway
    capacity might reduce at a low penetration rate of AVs (Zhang and Gao, 2020).
    Hence, the future scope would be to consider roadway capacity as the function
    of the penetration rate of AVs. Further, the reduction in VOTT can be modeled
    as a function of travel distance. In addition, the proposed metaheuristic algorithms
    can be further compared through sensitivity analyses with respect to various algorithm
    parameters, multiple case studies, and proposing the best solution method for
    the problem. Author contributions Harprinderjot Singh and Mohammadreza Kavianipour

  description: This study article investigates whether the Philippine supply chain
    sector is prepared for sector 4.0, highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of
    this revolutionary period. The study starts out by giving a thorough introduction
    to Industry 4.0, outlining its salient characteristics and possible advantages
    for the supply chain sector. Digitalization and connectivity within the supply
    chain are considered in connection to transformational technologies like the Internet
    of Things, automation, and big data analytics. The evaluation then looks at the
    available frameworks for assessing readiness and chooses the Supply Chain Industry
    4.0 Readiness Framework (SCI4RF) as the most appropriate framework to evaluate
    the preparedness of the Philippine supply chain industry. The study highlights
    the need for investments in technological infrastructure, worker upskilling, and
    supporting policies by flagging gaps and opportunities for development. The report
    also analyzes the effects of sector 4.0 on supply chain performance measures,
    gives case studies of successful implementations, and discusses prospects for
    the Philippines' supply chain sector under Industry 4.0. The report ends by offering
    suggestions for improving preparation, governmental actions, and future research
    trajectories.

  description: This paper seeks to advance understanding of the barriers that constrain
    and the drivers that promote the adoption of automation and robotics in agriculture.
    The paper focuses on Ontario, Canada, as the case study. The choice of the province
    is informed by the fact that it is generally considered one of Canada's leading
    agriculture powerhouses. The paper employed a mixed-methods approach consisting
    of survey questionnaires and in-depth focus group discussions. The article sheds
    light on the complex and context-specific factors determining farmers’ adoption
    of automation and robotics technology. Principally, adopters and non-adopters
    of automation robotics technology agree that government has a critical role in
    accelerating the adoption of automation and robotics technology. More importantly,

    Metrics and citations Figures and tables Abstract This paper seeks to advance
    understanding of the barriers that constrain and the drivers that promote the
    adoption of automation and robotics in agriculture. The paper focuses on Ontario,
    Canada, as the case study. The choice of the province is informed by the fact
    that it is generally considered one of Canada''s leading agriculture powerhouses.
    The paper employed a mixed-methods approach consisting of survey questionnaires
    and in-depth focus group discussions. The article sheds light on the complex and
    context-specific factors determining farmers’ adoption of automation and robotics
    technology. Principally, adopters and non-adopters of automation robotics technology
    agree that government has a critical role in accelerating the adoption of automation
    and robotics technology. More importantly, the paper spells out the various facets
    of that role and the contexts within which they can be most effective and impactful.
    The discussion explores the significance of the results in relation to the relevant
    extant literature and highlights the key implications of our findings for future
    policy and practice. It also offers some solutions in the form of policy recommendations
    and suggested action steps for removing barriers and exploiting opportunities
    associated with adopting technology. While empirically focusing on Ontario, the
    findings and analysis have implications for all of Canada and other industrialized
    countries. Introduction Over the past three decades, breakneck technological changes
    have led to seismic industrial restructuring in the agriculture and agri-food
    sector, with exponential advances in automation, robotics and mass digitization
    of cultivation, production and delivery processes that are fundamentally reshaping
    the sector (Niagara Community Observatory, 2019; OECD, 2019; Wolfert et al., 2021).
    These trends point to the imperatives of ‘smart’ precision agriculture techniques,
    processes embedded in cyber-physical systems, or platforms that are radically
    transforming the agri-food value chain from primary agriculture to processing,
    packaging, distribution and consumption (Archontakis and Anastasiadis, 2019; Cambouris
    et al., 2014; Campus, 2021; Capmourteres et al., 2018; Geldes et al., 2017). Against
    these trends, agriculture worldwide stands at a critical crossroads (Canadian
    Census of Agriculture, 2021; Mitchell et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2018). These
    global trends present opportunities, risks and challenges. They represent a fluid
    and dynamic global market context where first-movers in the technological race
    are poised to gain tremendous advantages. Technology development and adoption
    capacities fundamentally determine a region or country''s place on the global
    economic map (Breznitz, 2021; Niosi, 2005). In Canada, for instance, innovative
    technology has become an indispensable component of the agriculture sector''s
    capacity to increase its competitiveness and productivity, including addressing
    the growing challenges of critical labour shortages (Geldes et al., 2017). According
    to the Canadian Agri-food Economic Strategy Table (2018), technology adoption
    is one of the most pervasive challenges limiting the global competitiveness and
    productivity of Canada''s agri-food businesses. Canadian agri-food sector expenditures
    on research and development (R&D) as a percentage of sales have dropped by 24%
    since 2008 and lag other OECD competitors (de Avillez, 2011; Agriculture and Agri-Food
    Canada, 2011; Canada''s Agri-Food Economic Strategy Table, 2018). The Canadian
    Agri-food Economic Strategy Table (2018) further notes that while a number of
    Canada''s agri-food businesses are attempting to adopt new technologies, the sector''s
    investment in machinery and equipment has been on a steady long-term decline.
    This is due not to a lack of interest but several systemic challenges. The results
    are that despite increased public investments over the past two decades in technology
    R&D, along with a mushrooming of public, private and post-secondary agri-food
    laboratories, automation and robotics technology adoption in the Canadian agriculture
    sector has not kept pace with these developments (Agricultural Institute of Canada,
    2018; Canada''s Agri-Food Economic Strategy Table, 2018). This trend is particularly
    concerning given the breakneck pace of technological advances in robotics, automation
    and digitization in the agri-food sector and the attendant increase in global
    competition not only among industrialized countries but also from emerging economies
    (Borbasova et al., 2015; Cillo et al., 2019; Materia et al., 2017). In light of
    the above trends and issues, the objectives of this paper are two-fold: first,
    to advance understanding of the barriers that constrain and the drivers that promote
    the adoption of automation and robotics in pursuit of globally competitive production
    systems in agriculture. Second, the paper offers some solutions in the form of
    policy recommendations and suggested action steps for removing barriers and exploiting
    opportunities to accelerate automation and robotics technology transfer and adoption
    in the agriculture sector. However, term ‘adoption’ is a relevant but complex
    concept that needs to be considered in specific contexts (Allan et al., 2022).
    Therefore, to provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying factors shaping the
    adoption of automation and robotics technology in agriculture, the discussion
    focuses on the province of Ontario, Canada, as a case study. The reason for empirically
    focusing on Ontario is that it makes up the largest national share of farms and
    farm operators among Canada''s ten provinces.1 For instance, Ontario is the leader
    among all Canadian provinces in farming commodities such as soybeans, corn for
    grain and greenhouse products. Results from the 2021 Census of Agriculture show
    that Ontario accounted for over one-quarter – 25.5% – of total farms in Canada,
    while making up 7.7% of total farm area. Compared with other provinces, Ontario
    has the largest proportion of Canada''s farms in a range of areas, including greenhouse,
    nursery, and floriculture production, accounting for 31.8% of the country''s total.
    In light of these figures, Ontario is demonstrably one of Canada''s leading agriculture
    powerhouses, and therefore provides fitting case study. However, while the focus
    is on Ontario, the findings from the study have implications for all of Canada,
    and more importantly, other industrialized countries worldwide. The rest of the
    paper is structured as follows: The next section provides a literature review
    and analytical framework related to the role of automation and robotics in competitive
    production systems in agriculture. It also examines the extant literature on the
    barriers that constrain and the drivers that promote the adoption of such technologies.
    In doing so, the discussion examines core concepts such as agriculture innovation
    systems (AIS), the role of strategic leadership, and the function of intermediaries
    within such systems. The third section lays out the research methods employed
    in the 2-year study that resulted in this paper. This is followed by a fourth
    section concisely outlining the results. The fifth section then discusses the
    significance of the results in the context of the extant literature and highlights
    their practical implications. The final concluding section recaps the paper, linking
    the research objectives with key results and their significance. Analytical framework
    As noted in the introduction, innovative technology has become indispensable to
    the agriculture sector''s capacity to increase its competitiveness and productivity.
    However, there are systemic challenges and barriers associated with the adoption
    of new technologies in Canada and worldwide. These challenges take several form
    (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 2011; Garbade et al., 2012), which principally
    include the following: first, a general lack of information about available technologies;
    second, a lack of understanding among farmers about how to integrate technology
    with existing systems and operations; third, fragmented regional innovation systems
    in which research centres and technology providers within the same geographic
    space often work in isolation rather than in close partnership; and fourth (resulting
    from the third), weak support systems for integrating technology across a region''s
    agri-food supply chain. The prosperity of agriculture and agri-food industries
    in the knowledge economy often rests on the economic vitality of a mosaic of regional
    agglomerations of agriculture and agri-food clusters concentrated within geographic
    nodes. In Ontario and Canada, for example, such agglomerations are spread across
    the country. However, a regional agglomeration of activities among a cluster of
    farms based on available natural resources, labour pool or market size is not
    necessarily an innovation system (Niosi, 2005). For a regional innovation system
    to exist in agriculture, the geographic agglomeration of farms and other supporting
    institutions must demonstrate commitment to the creation and use of new and improved
    technology. This means that while farmers will leverage the natural endowments
    of favourable soil and climate conditions, they must manifest a sustained demand
    for new and improved technology and greater use of skilled labour in pursuit of
    global competitiveness and efficiencies to maintain or increase their international
    market share. This paper thus defines a competitive and dynamic agriculture innovation
    system as a geographically embedded cluster of interacting farms and other agri-food
    businesses along with post-secondary and private research centres and laboratories,
    aiming at the production and use of science and technology to accelerate the global
    competitiveness and productivity the sector (Bradford and Bramwell, 2018; Niosi
    et al., 2000; Niosi, 2005; Wolfe and Gertler, 2016;). An ‘innovation system’ in
    this regard, is an assemblage of heterogenous parts (researchers, technology developers,
    intermediaries, farmers and other end-users) within working towards a set of common
    goals (Bramwell et al., 2019; Conteh, 2020; Conteh and Harding, 2021; Kivimaa
    et al., 2018; Klerkx and Begemann, 2020; Wolfe and Gertler, 2016). Moreover, a
    functional and integrated AIS involves strategic leadership and close interconnections
    between the state, market and non-profit actors in the pursuit of greater technological
    development, adoption and economic competitiveness. This is because, contrary
    to the myth of liberal orthodoxy, innovation systems seldom create themselves
    organically (de Boon et al., 2021). Like all market entities, AIS are subject
    to perverse tendencies like rivalry, rent-seeking, intellectual property violations,
    abuse of personal data and information asymmetry, and other opportunistic behaviours
    (Conti et al., 2021; Turner et al., 2020). Innovation systems are so-called because
    they consist of tangled webs of actors in conflictual and cooperative joint action
    (Garbade et al., 2012). An effective and functional innovation system is thus
    about strategic and visionary leadership in creating the institutional support
    systems serving as a governance architecture. Innovation systems point to a set
    of policy, regulatory, financial and other institutions jointly set up by governments,
    industry and non-profit stakeholders. These institutions consist of an amalgam
    of laws (such as intellectual property rights and data management and privacy
    standards), resources (such as funding or research and development) and organizations
    (such as extension services, post-secondary institutions, research centres and
    industries) that support and sustain the pursuit of a shared set of innovation
    goals. Furthermore, the mere development of technology does not necessarily make
    an innovative region globally competitive. Developed technologies must be transferred
    into the hands of farmers and other agri-food businesses. Similarly, such businesses
    must manifest a high propensity for adopting new and improved technologies into
    their operations. The rate of robotics and automation technology adoption within
    an agri-food cluster is thus a function of push and pull factors. The push factors
    are those elements that determine the development and transfer of technology by
    a constellation of laboratories, post-secondary institutions and research centres
    within an agri-food innovation ecosystem. However, equally significant for an
    agri-food innovation system to manifest global competitiveness are the ‘pull’
    factors of automation and robotics technology adoption. These factors refer to
    the conditions that incentivize (or disincentivize) farmers to adopt new technologies
    to improve the efficiency and productivity of their operations. The ‘push’ and
    ‘pull’ factors of automation and robotics technology adoption in the agri-food
    sector points to the fact that a dynamic and globally competitive innovation system
    it is not merely a function of the amounts of money spent on R&D but also understanding
    the barriers/drivers to innovative automation and robotics technology adoption
    by businesses in the agri-food sector. In this regard, some scholars have pointed
    to the need to embrace an end-user development model of technology adoption –
    co-creation – in agriculture to strengthen connections between researchers, technology
    developers and farmers (Glover et al., 2021; Leeuwis and Aarts, 2021). Implicit
    in this model is the fact that the rate of automation and robotics technology
    adoption is often partly a function of upstream push factors related to the development
    and transfer of technology by a constellation of laboratories, post-secondary
    institutions and research centres within an AIS. There are several reasons for
    adopting an end-user development model (Knickel et al., 2021; Ronner et al., 2021;
    Toffolini et al., 2021). First, it would deepen the appreciation among technology
    developers for the risk calculus of farmers and why they may tend to be ‘risk-averse’,
    as some technology developers tend to complain. Underlying this model is the need
    to bridge the differences between technology developers and farmers. Second, adopting
    an end-user development model would mean including farmers at all stages. However,
    for agriculture and agri-food innovation systems to be fully functional, and the
    end-user model to be operational, there is a need for intermediaries – or organizational
    actors – at the centre of AIS. Intermediaries have been described by other names
    such as ‘middle actors’, ‘hybrid actors’, ‘boundary spanners’, ‘user assemblages’
    and ‘interaction arenas’ (Kivimaa et al., 2018). Regardless of the name, they
    are the organizational brokers shepherding the development, promotion and adoption
    of new and improved technologies in innovation systems (Bramwell et al., 2019;
    Fait et al., 2019; Klerkx et al., 2009). They are the bridge or lynchpins (such
    as advisory and extension services) that connect actors nested within an innovation
    system (Breznitz, 2021; Kivimaa et al., 2018; Ramirez et al., 2017). In short,
    they are intercessors or mediators bringing together the distinct worlds and cultures
    of government, the automation and robotics technology industry and the agriculture
    sector to collaborate under one canopy (Ramirez et al., 2017). At the heart of
    every functional and effective agri-food innovation system are purpose-driven
    intermediaries. In light of the above review of the extant literature, the rest
    of the paper explores through a set of survey and focus group questions (elaborated
    in the methods section below) how concepts like ‘push-pull’ factors of technology
    adoption, agriculture innovation systems, the end-user development model and the
    role of intermediaries might shed light on our understanding of the barriers that
    constrain and the drivers that promote the adoption of automation and robotics
    in Ontario. Similarly, we hope to generate some solutions for removing such barriers
    and exploiting opportunities to accelerate automation and robotics technology
    transfer and adoption in the province''s agriculture sector. Methods In pursuit
    of two objectives outlined in the introduction above, the authors of this paper
    employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze quantitative and qualitative
    data over a period of 26 months. The data consist of survey questionnaires and
    in-depth focus group discussions. These activities were organized into phases
    and sequenced to feed into each other, as outlined below. Survey In this phase
    of the project, the research team administered a province-wide survey of Ontario''s
    agriculture sector, canvassing farms across Ontario on their adoption of innovative
    automation and robotics technology. The survey was meant to identify several key
    issues, namely: (1) reasons for and for not adopting automation and robotics technology;
    (2) the main barriers/drivers to adoption; (3) how the barriers to adoption were
    overcome and (4) what steps could be taken to accelerate innovative automation
    and robotics technology transfer and adoption in the agriculture sector. All respondents
    were also asked a series of Likert-scale questions related to their perceptions
    of the agriculture innovation system in their region. The online survey was distributed
    in four ‘waves’ from November 2020 to February 2021. In the first wave, the researchers
    emailed a unique survey link to individuals or organizations in their proprietary
    databases considered to be active in the agri-food sector. For the second and
    third waves a unique link to the survey was sent to 2743 email addresses extracted
    from websites of farms and agribusinesses based in Ontario. For the fourth wave,
    a unique link to the survey, along with a short write-up of the project was included
    in two consecutive issues of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture weekly newsletter
    (5 and 12 February 2021). Several criteria were used to extract the final dataset
    from the total responses. The final, curated dataset included (1) respondents
    who identified as owning, operating or working for a farm and (2) respondents
    who identified as producing crops and/or raising livestock. These two criteria
    were used in combination to ensure that those who identified as being associated
    with a farm, provided confirming information about the type of farm. Of the total
    of 295 survey respondents, 174 met these criteria and have been included in the
    final data set. Focus group discussion The findings of the survey above served
    as the basis for generating a set of questions that guided a series of discussions
    with multi-stakeholder focus groups held in May and June 2022. The groups met
    either in person or online via Microsoft Teams. Overall, 42 individuals registered
    to participate and were spread across five focus groups. Each focus group had
    a combination of farmers, researchers, technology developers, manufacturers, intermediaries
    and government officials. The research team posed a number of questions but employed
    an open-ended conversational flow that enabled the focus groups to come up with
    solutions drawn from their expertise and experience as well as the evidence generated
    in our earlier findings. Some of the questions we addressed with the focus groups
    were: 1. How could government better help farmers adopt and implement automation
    and robotics technology in Ontario? 2. Since technology research, development
    and adoption processes are complex and often take time, if done correctly, how
    could government programmes be altered to factor in the element of time? 3. How
    could researchers and technology developers be better at encouraging farms to
    adopt automation and robotics technology? 4. In what ways could we improve farmers’
    awareness of the research and technology development resources and opportunities
    available? 5. How could intermediaries (such as advisory and extension services
    that act as a bridge between technology developers and adopters) be better mobilized
    and positioned to promote and support greater transfer and adoption of automation
    and robotics technology? All focus group discussions were recorded and transcribed.
    The research team also took observatory notes (memos) during the focus group discussions,
    and those memos were incorporated into the data. We employed a mix of deductive
    and inductive coding methods to analyze the data. For the recorded and transcribed
    data, we used the deductive method whereby the questions (noted above) we posed
    to focus group participants served as the coding frame that guided the analysis
    of the data. For this deductive coding process, the research team first read through
    the data to get a sense of what it looks like. We then assigned codes, going through
    the data line-by-line to code as much as possible, resulting in the identification
    of themes that came up the most. Because the deductive approach is vulnerable
    to overlooking themes outside the coding frame, we also employed an inductive
    coding method that enabled us to examine the memos (observatory notes) that the
    research team took during the focus group discussions. These memos provided materials
    for an open coding, whereby we identified themes that emerged during the discussions
    but were not anticipated by our research questions. The inductive coding of our
    memos thus enabled the team to have a more complete and unbiased coverage of the
    themes that emerged from the focus group discussions. For both the deductive and
    inductive coding processes, the data was analyzed through two stages of coding,
    deploying inter-rater reliability to ensure consistency among the research team''s
    identification and assignment of themes in the data. In the first round of data
    analysis, the principal investigator and their research assistants engaged in
    separate coding of the data. In the second round of data analysis, the research
    team came together to compare their coding results. Where there were disagreements,
    the team engaged in in-depth discussion to reach a common agreement, thereby ensuring
    inter-rater reliability in their observations and analyses of the focus group
    data. We then integrated and distilled the themes across all the focus groups
    into the final results. In the section below, following the discussion of the
    survey results, we present our analysis of the focus group data. Results In this
    section, we provide a concise synthesis of the results from the survey and focus
    group data phases of the research. In the discussion section below, we will explore
    the significance of the results in the context of relevant extant literature and
    highlight the key policy implications of our findings for the agriculture sector.
    Survey results For the survey phase of the study, based on 171 responses, the
    top three reasons farmers give for adopting automation and robotics were productivity,
    efficiency and costs. Two-thirds of adopters (67%) identified increasing productivity
    as one of their three top reasons for implementing automation and robotics technology.
    More than half (57%) of survey respondents cited increasing production efficiency,
    and 56% said automation and robotics technologies reduced costs. The top reasons
    given by non-adopters for not implementing technology over the past 10 years were
    high costs of acquisition (47%), lack of relevant technology (35%) and insufficient
    return on investment (34%). Those who did adopt technology were asked about the
    barriers they had experienced during the implementation process. The top three
    barriers cited were insufficient return on investment (45%), lack of government
    support and funding (36%) and a lack of in-house expertise (34%). When asked what
    the role of government should be in supporting the uptake of automation and robotics
    technology, adopters and non-adopters gave the same three responses: to provide
    financial assistance, provide research grants for in-house development, and promote
    established and proven technologies. While providing financial assistance was
    the most frequently identified role for government by both adopters and non-adopters,
    it was the clear choice of adopters (80%) compared to non-adopters (68%). The
    provision of research grants for developing in-house technology was a role cited
    by 54% of adopters and 60% of non-adopters, indicating that with the right incentives,
    current non-adopters might be more willing to develop technology in-house. Promoting
    established and proven technologies was cited by 33% of adopters and 35% of non-adopters
    as a key role of government while promoting new technologies was cited by 28%
    of adopters and 35% of non-adopters. When these numbers are combined, the promotion
    of technology is the second-most frequently cited role for government by adopters
    (61%) and non-adopters (70%). Additionally, the survey shed light on contextual
    factors shaping the adoption of new technologies, such as farmer interactions
    with agri-food laboratories and research centres, their perception of changing
    trends in automation and robotics, and how these might affect their businesses.
    The survey thus provided a quantitative portrait of the current barriers and opportunities
    of automation and robotics technology adoption in Ontario''s agriculture sector.
    Focus group data results Several themes emerged from the analysis of the focus
    group discussion data, but for this paper, we focus on findings related to the
    role of government. The aim is to shed light on policy initiatives and programme
    reforms that governments worldwide could undertake in concert with their industry
    and non-profit partners in the agriculture sector to address the issues and challenges
    of automation and robotics technology adoption that we uncovered in the study.
    In this vein, the findings are presented in this section in the form of policy
    recommendations. It is best to view the recommendations as inter-related within
    a holistic lens for envisaging measures that government, the agriculture industry,
    and non-profit stakeholders should consider in their efforts to accelerate the
    adoption of automation and robotics technology (Table 1). Table 1. Summary of
    focus group discussion findings. Public policy and programme reforms Embrace a
    broader conception of technological innovation Redesign cost-share and other incentive
    programmes to fully reflect a broader construct of innovation and a wider range
    of risk mitigation in agriculture Diversify the structure of cost-share programmes
    Design cost-share programmes to accommodate and acknowledge early adopters Factor
    in the element of time in cost-share programmes Embrace a greater risk orientation
    Diversify financial resources of cost-share funding Improve the dissemination
    of information about cost-share programmes Explore ways to reduce the administrative
    burden Support and facilitate the development of standards for data interoperability
    and address security and privacy issues Build the requisite digital and physical
    infrastructure in rural areas to support greater use of automation and robotics
    technology Expand the capacity of experimental research stations and demonstration
    farms Harness emergent labour trends to cultivate the requisite skill sets needed
    for developing and using more relevant automation and robotics technology Promote
    societal acceptance of agri-food innovations Coordinate policies and programmes
    across levels of government Embrace a broader conception of innovation One of
    the key findings from the focus group discussion is that government should seek
    to redefine common notions and usages of the term ‘innovation’ away from the tendency
    to narrowly focus on new or novel technology (Breznitz, 2021). In particular,
    such a broader and more nuanced understanding of innovation implies exploring
    myriad forms of innovation. It also makes room for a broader range of farm operations
    and business models as viable candidates for technology adoption. In fact, embracing
    a broader and nuanced conception of innovation is foundational to all the other
    findings that follow below. Redesign cost-share and other incentive programmes
    to fully reflect a broader construct of innovation and a wider range of risk mitigation
    in agriculture The need for financial incentives to de-risk development, commercialization
    and adoption was one of the recurring themes in the focus group data. For instance,
    cost-share programmes are seen by focus group participants a vital way to minimize
    the financial risk for technology developers and farmers alike. Such programmes
    would cover the costs and financial risks of testing or validating a new technology
    on the farm as a critical part of the commercialization process. The focus group
    data points to seven action steps on how government should fundamentally rethink
    its role in developing such programmes that mitigate risk, as well as make functional
    changes to how it runs the programmes. Diversify the structure of cost-share programmes
    First, in keeping with the two findings above to embrace a broader conception
    of innovation and redesign cost-share programmes, the focus group participants
    call for the diversification of the structure of cost-share programmes by articulating
    a clear set of criteria encouraging different types of innovations. For example,
    many interviewees and focus group participants pointed out that government programmes
    often do not reflect the realities and diversity of agriculture. For instance,
    in some cases, new automation and robotics technologies require new barn designs.
    As a further example, automated robotic milking systems cannot be installed in
    conventional tie-stall barns. However, new barns are not an eligible expense in
    cost-shared programmes that support the installation of robotic milking systems
    in Ontario. These issues point to the need for a broader construct of innovation
    targeting the concrete and specific needs of different commodities and production
    systems. Similarly, government incentive programmes could target various types
    of farms along a spectrum of capacity from small to large operations, from those
    with limited capacity (e.g. new farmers) to those that can absorb ambitious and
    high-capacity innovations. Current minimum levels of co-funding (government fund-matching
    programmes requiring a percentage of financial and/or in-kind contribution to
    be provided by the farmer) in Ontario are often too high for smaller farms to
    consider, and the competitive nature of the programmes means that only a few farms
    receive support. In a similar vein, cost-share programmes should accommodate different
    business models, such as purchasing, renting and servicing automation and robotics
    technologies. The main undercurrent in this finding to diversify the structure
    of cost-share and other incentive programmes is for government to have greater
    flexibility and explore a wider range of risk mitigation initiatives for different
    kinds of farming operations and technological needs. Design cost-share programmes
    to accommodate and acknowledge early adopters Second, the focus group participants
    suggest that government should design cost-share programmes to accommodate and
    acknowledge early adopters of new technologies. They consider funding or cost-share
    programmes that support the adoption of automation and robotics technology as
    a disincentive to early adopters. For instance, cost-share programmes in Ontario
    are generally reactive in nature, responding to a record of adoption by early
    adopters. However, funding or cost-share programmes in the province do not allow
    retroactive payments. This means that those early adopters who use technology
    before a cost-share programme is launched are not eligible for support. In a sense,
    funding and cost-share programmes essentially support so-called ‘laggards’ – those
    who are late adopters while ignoring farmers who took the risk of pioneering new
    or improved technology. While this policy incentivizes the wider adoption of successful
    technologies, focus group participants speculate it discourages overall levels
    of adoption. Cost-share programmes should thus be restructured to support the
    leaders, not laggards or followers. For example, this would also involve calibrating
    options for more government funding to be directed to pioneer projects which can
    be further incentivized with financial or other rewards for their owners’ willingness
    to share successes with a wider audience. This means mobilizing early adopters
    as champions of new and improved technologies. Farmers tend to trust each other''s
    experience considerably more than the promises of technology developers. Factor
    in the element of time in cost-share programmes Third, government should factor
    in the element of time in cost-share programmes. Focus group participants indicate
    that the timing of cost-share programmes in Ontario is often misaligned with production
    cycles, making it difficult for farmers to find the time to prepare applications.
    More generally, the element of time implies the need for realistic expectations
    about the processes of research, technology development and adoption in agriculture.
    This is particularly significant given the peculiarity of technology development
    and adoption in agriculture related to the several production seasons involved
    in the validation process. Some field-based research projects for new or improved
    technologies in agriculture often need several years of field data to know what
    works. If farmers are to willingly participate in these trials, then government
    has a critical role in mitigating the risk involved, especially if the technology
    does not perform as expected. The livelihoods of farmers are on the line if they
    lose some or all their crops or livestock. Paying closer attention to the element
    of time would thus involve factoring in a wider range of programmes accommodating
    single-year to multiyear projects. Similarly, it would exploit shorter-term opportunities
    in year-round operations like greenhouses, for instance, that are not particularly
    constrained by seasons. Cost-share programmes would also have built-in time horizons
    that allow business owners and farmers to adopt technology in a slow and incremental
    fashion because learning how to use technology takes time. The ultimate goal would
    be to incorporate flexible timelines for various kinds of farming operations,
    navigating the complex and often industry-specific and commodity-specific nuances
    of technology adoption. Embrace a greater risk orientation Fourth, the focus group
    data indicates that government should embrace a greater risk orientation in accelerating
    the adoption of automation and robotics technology by farmers. Notwithstanding
    the negative connotations of uncertainty as a barrier to adopting new technology,
    by embracing a greater risk orientation, government can, in fact, leverage uncertainty
    as a driver of adoption. For example, with the increasing complexity of farming
    linked to the challenges of climate change, unstable, fluctuating global markets,
    and shifting consumer expectations and demands, farmers see automation and robotics
    technology as a way to alleviate some of this instability. They see it as offering
    some level of control in a sector where much is out of their control. However,
    funding mechanisms should better reflect the realities of uncertainty and risk.
    In addition to all the forces of uncertainty outlined above, farmers operate in
    less controllable environments, subject to the vagaries of weather and seasons,
    and frequently at the mercy of climactic and biological forces. Furthermore, technologies
    such as harvesting robots must be designed and trained to identify a range of
    similar but not identical units in more dynamic and varied production environments.
    All this means incorporating appropriate incentive mechanisms and compensation
    packages for farmers in high-risk ventures that may fail to generate their anticipated
    outcomes. Diversify financial resources of cost-share funding Fifth, the focus
    group participants indicate that government could diversify the financial sources
    of cost-share funding by exploring more innovative financial instruments, such
    as partnerships with banks and other financial institutions to take on certain
    kinds of ventures – especially ambitious and high-risk technological development
    and adoption projects. Similarly, governments could deploy more innovative fiscal
    incentives to accelerate technology adoption. Examples of such innovative tax
    instruments include the accelerated investment incentive, full expensing for manufacturers
    and processors and full expensing for clean energy investments that were announced
    in the Government of Canada’s 2018 Fall Economic Statement.2 Improve the dissemination
    of information about cost-share programmes Sixth, focus group participants see
    room for government to improve the dissemination of information about cost-share
    programmes in the public domain. Principally, this involves employing innovative
    conduits of information flow to improve how farmers access that information. For
    instance, governments could harness with greater intentionality industry associations
    (like the Ontario Federation of Agriculture) which already serve as well-established
    information networks. The networks of these industry associations cultivated over
    many years can serve as effective channels for disseminating and promoting information
    about available cost-share programmes for automation and robotics technology adoption.
    Explore ways to reduce the administrative burden The seventh and final findings
    for improving cost-share programmes are to explore ways to reduce the administrative
    burden of accessing such programmes. A recurring theme in the focus group data
    is the highly administrative and bureaucratic nature of funding and cost-share
    programmes in Ontario. For instance, application and reporting requirements are
    often overly burdensome. One immediate remedy would be to make the application
    processes for cost-share programmes simpler and more straightforward. It would
    also mean more advance notice of new programmes to allow farmers more time to
    prepare their applications. A related suggestion for reducing the administrative
    burden is for governments to design and manage cost-share programmes with greater
    continuity, consistency and predictability. As one focus group participant puts
    it, ‘we should have intake times written more in stone like there''s going to
    be an intake 9/12/16 months from now for this particular thing. Programme predictability
    and more advance notice might influence greater uptake’. Growers need to have
    the confidence that cost-share programmes will be there over the long term as
    they invest their livelihoods into experimenting with new or improved technologies.
    Farmers sometimes avoid high-risk projects because of the limited and unpredictable
    lifespan of incentive programmes. Support and facilitate the development of standards
    for data interoperability and address security and privacy issues Another recurring
    theme of the focus group data focused on how government could address the challenges
    associated with managing, using, harmonizing, sharing, storing and protecting
    the massive volumes of data that are generated by automation and robotics technology.
    Principally, government should take a more active role in supporting and facilitating
    the development of standards for data interoperability to reduce fragmentation
    in data systems and enable data collected on one system to be easily combined
    with data collected on another. For example, such standards will address the challenges
    of farms often having multiple systems that are unable to communicate. It will
    also alleviate problems in the supply chain where data cannot be shared among
    supply chain partners. A more synchronized data collection and management system
    will immensely facilitate collective learning across the sector. Other critical
    issues related to data include privacy, security and ownership. Standards should
    thus address the risks associated with collecting, storing and sharing large volumes
    of data to mitigate the endemic legal and ethical incertitude pervading the security,
    privacy and ownership of the data. However, the lack of standards is not limited
    to the issues around data but other aspects of technology''s design, functionality
    and performance. There is also a national standards perspective to think about,
    such as standards related to providing technical support, service and guidelines
    for purchasing technology. A final point about the development of standards relates
    to assessing challenges that prevent broader uptake and scale-up, identifying
    what standards are needed to increase trust amongst user groups, and ensuring
    consistency, quality and performance of automation and robotics technology. In
    general, clearly established standards encourage close collaboration, engagement
    and consensus-building with all relevant stakeholder groups. Build the requisite
    digital and physical infrastructure in rural areas to support greater use of automation
    and robotics technology Addressing broadband connectivity issues in rural areas
    was deemed by the focus group participants as a pre-requisite for any meaningful
    policy and programme initiative to accelerate the adoption of automation and robotics
    technology by farmers. For example, all other incentive programmes will be pointless
    if poor broadband connectivity in rural communities renders the use of automation
    and robotics technology an ongoing challenge. Throughout our research, farmers
    repeatedly pointed out that adequate digital infrastructure to fully support digital
    devices are a critical part of their decision making when considering technology
    adoption. Although the predominant focus was on digital infrastructure, participants
    in our study also highlighted the need to update physical infrastructure with
    state-of-the-art utilities such as gas, electricity, renewable energy, water and
    wastewater. Expand the capacity of experimental research stations and demonstration
    farms While the adoption of new technology is no doubt a problem, evidence from
    the focus group data points to upstream issues and challenges related to developing
    and validating relevant new products and rendering them market ready. This means
    that governments rethink their engagement with upstream innovation activities
    by supporting more targeted applied/experimental research for validating automation
    and robotics technology. This would require expanding the mandates and capacity
    of research stations and demonstration farms to prioritize automation and robotics
    technology experimentation and validation. An expanded mandate for research stations
    and demonstration farms will task them with focusing more on leading-edge automation
    and robotics technology validation. They will also serve as platforms for adapting
    foreign technology to domestic needs. Experimental research stations could be
    a vital conduit for partnering with international technology producers in adapting
    foreign technology to domestic needs. Revamping the mandate of research stations
    and increasing investment in such facilities would enhance the ‘soft-landing’
    of newly developed foreign technologies entering domestic farms. Harness emergent
    labour trends to cultivate the requisite skill sets needed for developing and
    adopting more relevant automation and robotics technology The focus group participants
    highlighted labour shortage (exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic) as a prevalent
    challenge. However, they view it as also having triggered unprecedented opportunities
    for automation and robotics. Exploiting these opportunities requires that government
    focus on cultivating the requisite skill sets needed for developing and using
    the new technologies. First, it would require addressing the downstream issue
    of reskilling the labour force so that they possess not just technical skills
    in operating sophisticated equipment but also knowledge about agriculture and
    its peculiarities. Second, government could target upstream initiatives focused
    on providing training programmes that combine technology development with knowledge
    of agriculture. This will help close the current cultural gaps between technology
    developers and the agriculture community and the resulting tendency for newly
    developed technologies to be irrelevant to the pressing needs of farmers. Both
    the upstream and downstream skills training initiatives would entail government
    working with post-secondary and other training institutions which already possess
    the pedagogical logistics for generating these requisite skills. Promote societal
    acceptance of agri-food innovations Society''s acceptance of innovations is another
    factor that the focus group participants consider as a critical variable in a
    farmer''s decision making about incorporating new technologies into their food
    production systems. The agriculture sector must contend with changing consumer
    tastes, societal values and other expectations. Managing these societal pressures
    makes developing and adopting new or improved technologies unpredictable, messy,
    time-consuming and costly. Farmers are keenly aware that the public is concerned
    not only about how innovation affects the safety of foods consumed but also increasingly
    about the ecological footprint of food production. The focus group participants
    thus see government has having a vital role to play in developing new pathways
    to engage and educate the public and address society''s questions and misinformation
    about innovation in the agri-food sector. Coordinate policies and programmes across
    levels of government None of the findings and recommendations above from the focus
    group data would make a lasting impact without greater policy and programme coordination
    among levels of government, especially in multi-tiered federal jurisdictions like
    Canada. For instance, the focus group participants see the province of Ontario''s
    policy and programme efforts as only partial measures without adequate coordination
    with other levels of government. They see greater policy and programme coordination
    vertically among levels of government and horizontally across departments within
    the same level of government to ensure greater synchrony as a vital pre-requisite
    for governments’ role in accelerating the adoption of automation and robotics
    technology in agriculture. Discussion In this section we will explore the significance
    of the survey and focus group discussion results in the context of relevant extant
    literature and highlight the key policy implications of our findings for the agriculture
    sector. One of the main extrapolation from the survey data findings above is that
    the rate of robotics and automation technology adoption in agriculture is a function
    of push and pull factors. As we noted earlier in the analytical framework section
    of the paper, the push factors are those elements that determine the development
    and transfer of technology by a constellation of laboratories, post-secondary
    institutions and research centres. However, equally significant for the agri-food
    sector to manifest global competitiveness are the pull factors of automation and
    robotics technology adoption. These factors refer to the conditions that incentivize
    (or disincentivize) farms to adopt new technologies to improve the efficiency
    and productivity of their operations. The push and pull factors of automation
    and robotics technology adoption in the agriculture sector point to the fact that
    a dynamic and globally competitive innovation system is not merely a function
    of the amounts of money spent on R&D but also of understanding what best incentivizes
    as well as what holds back technology adoption by farmers. A second and equally
    important implication from the survey and focus group data is the vital significance
    functional AIS as the context within which policy interventions to accelerate
    technology adoption are most effective. Improving the performance of agriculture
    innovation system is, in fact, closely intertwined with the findings and recommendations
    from focus group discussions. For example, it is through a functional and effective
    innovation system that governments can deliver successful cost-share and other
    incentive programmes. Through the work of partners in such AIS, standards for
    data interoperability and security and privacy can be voluntarily incorporated
    into farming operations as industry best practices and norms of socialization.
    Similarly, experimental research stations are entities whose operations are usually
    embedded within AIS. And finally, promoting societal acceptance of agri-food innovations
    is not the exclusive business of government but one best undertaken in partnership
    with industry and non-profit actors. The key implication is that the role of government
    in policy development and programme reform aimed at accelerating automation and
    robotics technology adoption in agriculture is best seen within the context of
    wider functional AIS within which it works with industry and non-profit actors
    in the agriculture sector to accelerate the adoption of automation and robotics
    technology. A functional and integrated AIS, as we noted in the analytical framework
    section, involves strategic leadership and close interconnections between the
    state, market and non-profit actors in the pursuit of greater technological development,
    adoption and economic competitiveness. In addition to regulations and provision
    of resources, strategic leadership in building a functional AIS requires actively
    bringing together public and semi-public entities, post-secondary institutions,
    research and training centres, technology producers and farmers into sustained
    and iterative networks. Building such networks means, first and foremost, cultivating
    trust among AIS partners from diverse cultures – technology developers, researchers
    and farmers. The majority of interviewees and focus group participants made direct
    reference to ‘trust’ and its vital importance in building an AIS where technology
    developers and farmers can work together. For example, a key part of building
    such trust is for the AIS leadership to work on establishing ethical standards
    for communicating and promoting new technology to mitigate technology developers’
    tendency to overstate their digital technologies’ performance and benefits. Similarly,
    AIS leadership should create the requisite standards for validating new technologies
    to avoid situations where immature technologies that do not have enough successful
    case studies to demonstrate their merit are aggressively promoted and sold to
    farmers. A third theoretical and policy implication of the survey and focus group
    data is the need to embrace an end-user development model of technology adoption
    – co-creation – to strengthen connections between researchers, technology developers
    and farmers. As we noted in the analytical framework, the rate of automation and
    robotics technology adoption is often partly a function of upstream factors related
    to the development and transfer of technology by a constellation of laboratories,
    post-secondary institutions, and research centres within an AIS. The end-user
    model bridges the cultural and cognitive divides between technology developers
    and farmers by including farmers at all stages of a technology''s development,
    from conceptualizing to validating, prototyping and manufacturing. A final policy
    implication from the findings above that aligns with, and sheds further light
    on, the extant is the need to deploy purpose-driven intermediaries. As we noted
    earlier in reference to the extant literature, intermediaries are organizational
    actors at the centre of AIS consisting of iterative relations between groups bound
    together by their shared interests in a set of technologies. For example, intermediaries
    are the organizational conduits through which government and its agri-food innovation
    partners deliver and monitor cost-share and other incentive programmes. They are
    often the custodians of industry standards and norms of best practice. Intermediaries
    are also active agents in promoting societal acceptance of agri-food innovations.
    Moreover, the idea of strategic leadership in building a functional AIS would
    be meaningless if not for the efforts and activities of intermediaries who shepherd
    the cultivation of networks in such AIS. If AIS is the scaffolding in the acceleration
    of technology adoption, as we argued above, then intermediaries are the planks
    of that scaffolding. They are the translators and curators of knowledge and information
    not only in helping technology end-users manage the problem of information overload
    but also making such information less intimidating and more accessible and intelligible.
    Intermediaries are vital to encouraging growers’ interest in learning and deeper
    engagement with new technologies. Conclusion In this paper, we have employed a
    mixed-method approach in an attempt to shed light on the emergent and longstanding
    barriers and drivers to innovation, specifically automation and robotics technology
    adoption. In a similar vein, the paper extrapolated from the survey and focus
    group findings some policy recommendations and suggested action steps for removing
    barriers and exploiting opportunities to accelerate automation and robotics technology
    transfer and adoption in the agriculture sector. While the empirical focus was
    on Ontario, Canada, the findings, discussion and policy recommendations have worldwide
    implications for accelerating automation and robotics technology adoption by agriculture
    businesses in industrialized countries. As we noted in the discussion of the survey
    results, there is a well-demonstrated value in adopting automation and robotics
    technology with two-thirds of adopters (67%) noting increasing productivity, more
    than half (57%) citing increasing production efficiency, and 56% mentioning reduced
    costs as their reasons for implementing automation and robotics technology. Most
    significantly, adopters and non-adopters alike agree that government has a critical
    role to play in accelerating the adoption of automation and robotics technology
    in agriculture through initiatives like embracing a broader conception of technological
    innovation, restructuring cost-share incentive programmes, supporting and facilitating
    the development of standards for data interoperability, and ensuring greater security
    and privacy. Furthermore, they expected government to build the requisite digital
    and physical infrastructure in rural areas, expand the mandate and capacity of
    experimental research stations, harness emergent labour trends to cultivate the
    requisite skills, and promote societal acceptance of agri-food innovations. They
    also called for more strategic leadership by public, private and non-profit stakeholders
    in building functional and effective agriculture innovation systems. Finally,
    they expressed a strong desire for purpose-driven intermediaries with a clear
    mandate, adequate resources and the technical competence to shepherd farmers and
    technology developers into sustainable and iterative relationships of technology
    co-creation. In closing, it is our hope, as researchers that the recommendations
    generated from our study will serve as evidence-based action steps for accelerating
    the development and adoption of automation and robotics technology not only in
    Ontario and Canada''s agriculture sector, but countries worldwide pursuing a globally
    competitive production system. Acknowledgements I am also indebted to my colleagues,

    Robotic Process Automation Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction The application and importance
    of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is increasing in many types of organizations.
    It is triggered by such drivers as increased productivity, quality and job satisfaction
    as routine tasks are automated [1]. RPA may be applied to any field and tasks
    where repetitive processes exist in knowledge work. Intelligent automation through
    RPA is one factor that may contribute to the Society 5.0 as it drives productivity
    through digital technologies. At the same time, it may contribute to a more human-friendly
    working life as employees are freed from routine tasks and may concentrate on
    tasks requiring human competences. An RPA implementation typically begins by carefully
    modelling existing business processes [2]. Some parts of the modelling process
    or of the RPA process itself may employ artificial intelligence (AI). Examples
    of these are the automatic generation of rules based on business data and the
    task of automatic information extraction from invoices, respectively. As the previous
    research on RPA adoption in SMEs is scarce, more research is needed to determine
    the reasons behind this. Hsiung and Wang [3] who explored the adoption of RPA
    in Taiwan SMEs suggested to scale the research to other continents and countries.
    The study of RPA adoption in SMEs by Turcu and Turcu [4], suggested to further
    study other departments and processes than HR. Also, Brzeziński [5] recommended
    to address the aspect of process management and governance in RPA implementations
    for the SMEs sector. According to Matthews and Greenspan, the Future of Work (FoW)
    will be driven by automation and collaborative robotics that require further exploration
    [6]. Addressing these recommendations, our research describes both the implementation
    of RPA in financial processes in several small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs)
    in Finland and the construction of a collaborative network for building and sharing
    expertise on RPA. Hence, we formulated the following research questions: RQ1:
    What drives SMEs in the implementation of RPA? RQ2: What is the role of business
    process modelling in RPA implementations for SMEs? RQ3: What is the role of a
    collaborative network in the business process transformation with RPA in SMEs?
    The narrative of our paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 describes related
    work and Sect. 3 describes the empirical setting and the company cases. The results
    are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 analyses the significance of the results,
    both theoretically and in practical terms. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Related
    Work RPA technology can be used to perform repetitive tasks, such as invoice or
    transaction processing, reporting, updating databases, data validation and filling
    in documents [7]. As many accounting, financial, and payroll tasks are repetitive,
    rule based and already in digital format, RPA is often started by automating company’s
    accounting related tasks [8]. While it may trigger some doubts, or even fear among
    accountants’ or other office workers, it may on the other hand increase job satisfaction
    and work-life balance when automating the mundane and boring tasks [9]. RPA automations
    can be implemented at task level, where software robots perform only one routine
    task such as bank reconciliation, extracting information from invoices, updating
    of master data information or transfer of information from one system to another.
    In such an arrangement, humans are only responsible for handling the exceptions
    [7]. In other words, the manual work of “extracting data from one system, performing
    data processing and moving the adjusted data to another system” [10] is automated.
    However, RPA can also support companies with the automation of an entire process,
    sometimes with some help of AI solutions [10]. In such cases, no manual intervention
    is needed, e.g. in a purchase invoice process that includes receiving, validating
    and paying the invoice. However, many researchers note that it is typical for
    organizations to start with task automations, while entire processes are typically
    automated only in large companies [11]. The importance of business process governance
    is growing, also due to the increased automation of processes [12]. This also
    applies for accounting processes as the well-governed processes are easier to
    automate with RPA. Even though Business Process Management (BPM) is mostly used
    at large organizations, also SMEs can benefit from it [13]. BPM is a structured
    method of understanding, documenting, modelling, analysing, simulating, executing,
    and continuously changing end-to-end business processes and all relevant resources
    in relation to an organisation’s ability to add value to the business. Aguirre
    and Rodriguez [1] present a case study where business processes have been automated
    through RPA. Through careful BPM, also SMEs can take well-informed decisions on
    the prioritization of automation pipelines in an organization. BPM provides information
    on which task automation would provide most added value to the business. This
    is very relevant also for SMEs, as their resources tend to be scarcer than those
    of large enterprises. IT governance helps to align decisions on RPA with the strategic
    objectives of a company [14]. RPA drivers and benefits can be categorized into
    four main groups: 1) Cost reduction, 2) Productivity enhancement, 3) Customer
    service improvement, and 4) Impact on employees. Each of the categories contains
    several detailed benefits, such as time savings or removal of non-value processes
    that are benefits linked to cost reduction, flexibility with capacity and working
    hours, as well as more detailed data capture and management. These solutions can
    enhance productivity, bring faster processes and quality improvements, improve
    customer service, and in the same time help employees by removing repetitive mundane
    tasks, increasing their job satisfaction and morale [11]. Collaborative networks,
    such as the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) aim at enhancing and facilitating
    digital transformation in Europe. There are several AI and industrial automation
    related EDIHs, but no EDIH is specifically targeted at the automation of knowledge
    work. However, there are some networks that are developing standards relevant
    both for business process modelling and financial sector. An example of such is
    the Object Management Group Standards Development Organization, an international
    non-profit organization that gathers together organizations from the industry,
    government and academia. The way of working of individual experts is often very
    dependent of collaborative networks, by which we mean networks that consist of
    autonomous and heterogeneous entities that collaborate to achieve common or compatible
    goals through interaction that is made possible through computer networks [15]
    Financial experts may collaborate thorough various digital platforms and communication
    channels with other experts inside and outside of their organization and exchange
    ideas, knowledge and experiences. 3 Research Design The research was conducted
    under an EU funded project ‘Center of Intelligent Process Automation for SMEs
    (CIPAS)’, run at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences during 2021–2023.
    The project focused on providing training and consulting about digital accounting
    and automating accounting processes for SMEs in the capital region of Finland.
    As part of the project, the participants got an opportunity to implement their
    first RPA trials, and then decide whether they wish to implement it into their
    production environment. Project participants were invited with an open invitation
    to join the project by email or by participating at different events organized
    by Haaga-Helia. Altogether 99 companies and their 115 employees took part at the
    project. The first step was to participate in online webinars conducted by the
    project. The webinars consisted of one-hour sessions which contained information
    about what is RPA, how it can be implemented, how to improve processes and analyse
    business cases for RPA projects. Organizations could choose which seminars were
    the most interesting to them and participate in them freely. After the webinars,
    the participants were welcome to take part at RPA and Process Development Workshops,
    which were one-day contact sessions, where the participants learned how to use
    the no-code/low-code RPA tools, such as UiPath StudioX or MS Power Automate. Alternatively,
    they had a chance to learn how to model their processes and recognize the tasks
    which could be automated, or just learn advanced Excel usage. These workshops
    contained hands-on training, where the participants learned how to use the software
    and build their own automations, as citizen developers. Over 50 companies participated
    in these workshops. The workshops allowed participants to discuss and consider
    their own automation needs, and companies that had enough interest were selected
    to receive individual consulting. Additionally, the company’s technological maturity
    level had to be sufficiently high in order to proceed into the consulting phase.
    Altogether, 12 participants were selected to receive company level consulting,
    where the automation needs were analysed and a RPA Proof Of Concept (PoC) was
    offered. The findings collected from those 12 case companies are presented in
    this paper. Case companies are listed in Table 1. Table 1. The case companies,
    their sizes, industries and the automations done. Full size table The size of
    case companies varies both in number of employees and turnover. All companies
    are registered in southern Finland, in the Uusimaa area. Most of the companies
    were micro sized companies which employ 2–10 employees. Only one company employs
    50–100 persons. Three participants were single entrepreneurs but had a registered
    limited liability company. Turnovers are rounded to 50 kEUR and varied from 50
    kEUR to 7,6 million. What comes to the industry, 7 of the 12 companies provide
    accounting services, as our project was run in collaboration with the national
    accounting service providers union. The remaining 5 companies came from various
    businesses, 3 providing different kind of services either to private people or
    businesses, 2 being trade organizations and 1 of the participants had both own
    production and trade. When joining the automation consulting stage, a one-hour
    online meeting was arranged where the potential automation task was described,
    so that the development and consulting could begin. In these meetings, the following
    topics were discussed: 1) Which task/process the company wanted to develop, 2)
    Defining the current state of the task/process, recognizing the challenges and
    bottlenecks, 3) Reasons behind the wish to develop and automate the task or process,
    4) Possibilities for alternative automation solutions. It is good to notice that
    all cases were task automations instead of process automations. After the online
    meeting, the project consultant documented the process into a flowchart and the
    process was reviewed by the company representative in the next meeting. In this
    meeting the development and automation ideas were discussed, including analysing
    the possibility for an RPA PoC. Automations or other developments done for case
    companies are presented in Table 2. Nine of the case companies had an RPA PoC
    was done, whereas for three of the participants other development ways were decided
    instead of RPA. Companies which did not advance to automation PoC had some challenges
    related to technological maturity level. Company 1 was a small accounting service
    provider, and its processes were mainly paper based, while the entrepreneur didn’t
    have sufficient IT skills and awareness. For this company, we were able to digitalize
    part of the paper process, but it was suggested that further automation could
    be done after the entrepreneur got used to the new cloud-based tools. Company
    2 had all digital accounting solutions in use, but the challenge was with process
    harmonization. Many employees were doing the same task in the company in different
    ways. In this case, task standardization was suggested and thus the company did
    not wish to proceed to RPA PoC yet. Company 5 had a very manual purchase process,
    which was not that suitable for business purposes and rather hindered company’s
    growth. Suggestion was to first improve the process, and only after that consider
    any automation trials. Additionally, the IT-skills in the company were not on
    such a level that the company employees could maintain an RPA automated task.
    For the companies that were chosen for a RPA PoC, the process was documented in
    detail, and an external service consultant prepared the POC either with Microsoft
    Power Automate, or UiPath StudioX. These two software platforms were seen as the
    most suitable for SMEs. Once the POC was ready, one final session was organized
    to present the results and give feedback. It was then up to the company to decide
    if they want to buy a production version of the solution from the service provider.
    Table 2. The RPA automation POCs or other development done to case companies.
    Full size table 4 Results 4.1 Regarding RPA Implementation Drivers for SMEs The
    automation drivers for case companies are presented in Table 3. For most of them,
    the key reason was to get rid of repetitive tedious tasks and thus either improve
    employee satisfaction, or in the case of self-employed people, improve their own
    work. When discussing the objectives of automation, it was found to be the main
    driver for all companies, excluding 2, 3, and 6. Automating routine work and getting
    more satisfied employees can easily be understood when reviewing the automated
    tasks: company 1 had a manual, paper-based process to be developed, companies
    4, 7, 8, 9 and 11 all used time in modifying MS Excel templates regularly, company
    5 processed large number of pdf-based purchase documents manually. Company 10
    wanted to automate the creation of hundreds of data folders for its customers,
    and company 12 automated its invoicing based on calendar notes. All these tasks
    might be time-consuming, but the processing is routine and does not need any human
    decision making, they were part of some other processes and were seen tasks which
    could easily be given to a ‘digital helper’. Table 3. Classifying the drivers
    for automation and tasks which were automated. Full size table What comes to other
    companies’ automation drivers, company 2 was a bigger accounting service provider
    and they had recognized a need for RPA as part of the competitive environment.
    However, they had not used RPA yet. For them, cost reduction, increasing productivity,
    but also removing non-value tasks was brought up as the motivator. They had recognized
    tasks which were done by several accountants to several customers and saw the
    potential for automation on those. Also, company 5 mentioned cost savings as one
    of the motivations, they had negotiated with their accounting service provider
    that they would do more accounting work themselves and this way would pay less
    for the services. Nonetheless, eventually when the process got analysed deeper,
    the employee did spend quite much time on processing the invoices manually, and
    as did the accountant in the external service provider and the accounting fees
    were quite high. The manager of the company commented that they would not mind
    paying so much for accounting services, as long as they did not need to spend
    so much time processing the documents themselves. Company 3 provided auditing
    and quality assurance services, and their driver for automation was to increase
    quality for the audit work they performed to minimize auditing risks. With an
    RPA PoC, the auditors could have a more systematic approach for auditing accounting
    documents. Obviously, larger auditing firms already have such automations, but
    for a smaller auditing company it might be too costly, and this had to be done
    manually. It is noticeable that audit services are such that are performed for
    a customer, but a quality improvement in audit does not affect the customer as
    much as it minimizes the auditor’s risk of giving the wrong statement of the company.
    Thus, the quality improvement is internal. Similar internal quality improvement
    was sought by company 6, where the automation collected information on the company’s
    customers’ tax filing status. The company was responsible for over 100 customers’
    tax filing and in case being late, the tax authorities would impose sanctions
    which would fall for company 6 to be paid if it had been their mistake. To avoid
    this, the management of the company wanted a checklist of the tax filing status
    for each of the customers. So, for these two companies the main driver was internal
    quality assurance. 4.2 Regarding the Role of Process Modelling at SME RPA Development
    For each of the consulted companies at least two meetings were held to define
    the process or task companies wanted to automate. Before documenting the process,
    the regularity and time-consumption of the process was assessed. Only simple,
    regular and time-consuming processes or tasks were accepted for further development.
    Companies typically had a longer process in mind, but as it was their first RPA
    trial, the project budget was limited, and only one task or a small process was
    accepted for the PoC. None of the companies had process documentation in place
    and processes were documented by the project consultants with MS Visio or PowerPoint.
    This documentation or process modelling was essential for an external person to
    understand the process in question and often in the second meeting some corrections
    were made to the process documentation. Once the process documentation was in
    place, the process was analysed to recognize bottlenecks or other challenges in
    the process. Solutions for the bottlenecks were searched from such perspectives
    as: 1) was the process part needed at all, 2) could existing software provide
    the solution. For example, for Company 1 where a grant application process was
    under analysis, some data collection phases were moved into latter phase of the
    process, as it was not necessary to collect such information from everyone who
    had send the application. This way the process was simplified. For company 1 several
    development points were recognized – also ones which could have been automated
    with RPA, but as the company was not technologically mature, it was decided to
    digitalize the most time-consuming and paper-based task. The maintenance of the
    possible software robots would have been challenging for the company. Company
    5 also had several automation options, but their purchase process was not optimal
    for business purposes and thus the project team did not recommend automating such
    a process, but rather gave suggestions on how to digitalize their accounting and
    use their existing sales and purchase system more efficiently. In all cases, the
    new process was documented as well and given to the case company. Some of the
    companies’ employees were not the ones who made the final decision on the process
    development and RPA. They asked for the project documentation so they could communicate
    about the coming development and get approval for it. Thus, the project documentation
    was used in several manners in the project and had important role. 4.3 Regarding
    the Role of Collaborative Network at SME Digital Transformation with RPA In the
    beginning of the project, a service design method was applied to find out the
    RPA needs of the companies. Three points were diagnosed: first, respondents were
    interested of the benefits of RPA, secondly, they wanted to know what peer companies
    had done with RPA, and thirdly the participants preferred RPA trainings and services
    which would be provided independently of time or place. Also, many participants
    did not know what RPA was, so raising awareness was needed. Benefits and experiences
    of RPA were shared during various events. In the beginning, it was difficult to
    find participants in the project, but eventually the project started to attract
    more participants. However, it was learnt that SMEs are extremely busy and were
    not keen on participating in RPA events arranged by the project. Most probably
    the companies didn’t even know what RPA was and thus such events were easily ignored.
    Consequently, the project team realized that information should be shared in networks
    where the entrepreneurs already are. For this reason, the project team started
    to participate at other industry events: run by organizations such as Finnish
    Association of Accounting service providers, Real Estate Management Federation
    and The Federation of Finnish Entrepreneurs. In addition, originally the project
    team was planning to create a platform where SMEs could discuss their RPA needs
    and challenges as the RPA POCs are universal, while the companies would prefer
    to learn about RPA examples of their own industry. Again, these associations and
    federations would maybe be the correct place for this kind of discussion, whereas
    different projects could just bring in new knowledge. The training courses and
    services were provided both remotely, but also in contact sessions. Even though
    the original wish was to have time and place independent training courses, the
    project specialists felt it was easier to give software training in a contact
    session, rather than remotely. However, lots of webinar recordings were offered.
    In the future, also the software training should be provided virtually and maybe
    short video recordings to be done on how to build small automations. What was
    learnt during the project but not recognized in the service design analysis was
    the usefulness of test-before-invest concept. Testing before investing is a service
    concept provided e.g. by European Innovation Digital Hubs which allows SMEs experimenting
    new technologies before actually investing in them [16, 17]. Project was EU-funded
    and provided the services free of charge, for a small company this is certainly
    a needed approach. In our project the POCs or POCs were provided for the companies
    but if the company wanted to implement them in real-life, they needed to get a
    production version from the consulting company who had created the POC. Without
    this possibility most of the case companies might not have tested RPA automations
    or started to develop their work with automation. Project shared information about
    RPA possibilities success, only Company 2 had previous experience with office
    work automation and RPA. This company was bigger than the others and had done
    some automation trials before, however they had not implemented any solution yet.
    All the other companies either had participated in some of the Center of Intelligent
    Automation for SMEs project’s training courses, just an Excel training or watched
    some webinars on what RPA is. In these training courses the project specialists
    discussed with companies, and the participants understood the possibilities of
    automation. Additionally, the training and workshops served as an experience sharing
    event. Some of the project participants did not proceed to the PoC-phase, but
    participated in a citizen development workshop with UiPath StudioX or MS Power
    Automate. Usually, these participants had already made their first trials with
    automation and shared their experience openly with others. Sharing information
    on what other similar companies had done either by the project team or by the
    participants was essential in raising the interest of starting the automation
    also in the case companies. Knowing the benefits and experiences of automation
    achieved by others was important when deciding to apply RPA in companies’ own
    processes. 5 Discussion When analysing the drivers of RPA implementation in the
    Nordic companies, we can use the four category classification: 1) Cost reduction,
    2) Productivity enhancement, 3) Customer service enhancement and 4) Impact on
    employees [11] In our study, focusing on the RPA adoption in SMEs, category 4)
    Impact on employees was the most important driver. We also found out that the
    improvement of internal processes quality was an important driver for RPA implementation
    for some SMEs, which is a novel contribution to the available literature. We agree
    with Chong [13] and Jurczuk [12] that business process governance: especially
    process understanding, documentation and analysis is essential for its successful
    automation, also when SMEs and micro-sized companies want to automate their processes
    no matter how small the automated task would be. Proper BPM enables smooth RPA
    implementation, and in our study the companies were able to use proof-of-concepts
    that were the result of proper process analysis. In addition to the findings concerning
    the added value that the SMEs saw in implementing RPA, we observed that the tasks
    that were chosen by the SME for the RPA proof-of-concept were the simplest ones
    with the smallest number of exceptions. Also, repetitive tasks were chosen, but
    it was the second most important criteria. This is in line with the findings from
    Sharma et al. [18]. Our study encompassed the very first stage of RPA implementation,
    i.e. the “test before invest” stage. Additionally, our study does not discuss
    the actual decisions on taking RPA into use in the SME, as the 12 cases were dealing
    with companies that implemented the PoC. An RPA implementation would be the next
    step in the process. A future study could address SMEs that have actually implemented
    RPA. The second part of the study contained the establishment of a collaborative
    network for RPA knowledge creation and sharing among SMEs. The network consisted
    of over 100 SMEs interested in RPA, companies offering RPA services and non-profit
    organizations, such as a university and associations for financial experts, entrepreneurs
    and other professionals. Large organizations typically create organization-wide
    Centers of Excellence (CoEs), focused on aligning organizational resources, establishing
    standards and tools, providing training and education to establish RPA readiness.
    Sharma et al. [18] found that CoEs are positively related to the intention to
    adopt RPA. Our study focused on micro-enterprises of less than 10 people. These
    firms cannot have organization specific CoEs because of the small organization
    size. Thus, the Center for Intelligent Automation was created to take over at
    least some of the tasks that large organizations typically handle through CoEs.
    Collaborative networks, of which the Center for Intelligent Automation is an example,
    play an important role in digitalization [19]. 6 Conclusions RPA is often implemented
    in larger companies, but smaller organizations such as SMEs or even micro-sized
    companies may equally benefit from it. Once learned about the automation possibilities,
    even small companies are willing to get rid of the repetitive routine tasks and
    thus improve their employee satisfaction. SMEs may also see in RPA a possibility
    to improve their internal quality or to enable substantial cost savings. However,
    currently many SMEs and micro-sized companies are still implementing their first
    RPA trials and automation is not yet in the companies’ strategy. Additionally,
    efficiency related benefits of RPA are not yet widely seen by SMEs. Well planned
    RPA in a small company can benefit the organization in many ways. Consequently,
    SMEs should learn how to use these tools. Surprisingly, our case companies did
    not see RPA as a competitive factor yet. Even there were companies from same industries,
    they were willing to share their RPA ideas with others. However, the project did
    only one RPA PoC for each company, and it was required them to be as multipliable
    and scalable RPA PoCs as possible. Probably a larger set of RPA automations would
    not be shared with competitors. To avoid faulty investments and automations of
    wrong tasks, even smaller organizations should find the time to go through their
    processes and thus identify the ones which should be developed. SMEs’ resources
    are scarce, and thus should be used wisely, however too much time spent on planning
    might make them lose the competitive advantage of RPA. Nevertheless, before a
    SME automatizes its accounting processes, the process should be as digital as
    possible as this might already bring the benefits looked for. Small organizations
    with limited number of employees, R&D funds and knowledge are not usually the
    front-runners in new technologies and innovations. They tend to wait until evidence
    of the benefits of the new technologies is demonstrated and preferably by their
    peers. Co-operation with national federations, universities and non-profit organizations
    provides good opportunities for learning and implementing new technologies, such
    as RPA and AI. Fortunately, at least in Europe, projects supporting SMEs have
    been funded quite well and with help of collaborative networks SMEs will remain
    competitive. It is crucial, that the SMEs understand the importance of improving
    and questioning the current ways of working. Considering our limitations, our
    case explored organizations from only one country, so it would be interesting
    to extend this research beyond Finland and study also other locations. Moreover,
    it is recommended to study more examples and cases of RPA technology implementations
    from the perspective of its synergy with process management and process improvement.
    In the upcoming months, due to the rapid growth in the popularity and importance
    of AI solutions (such as ChatPGT), it is also recommended to explore how RPA products
    could be transformed to provide better and more approachable offerings of automation
    services not only to large organizations, but also to medium and small enterprises
    (SMEs) that would like to deploy this technology and collaborate with software
    robots and assistance, as part of hybrid workforce. References Aguirre, S., Rodriguez,

  description: This paper presents a novel approach to identifying reskilling requirements,
    job merging pathways, and a tentative timeline for transforming offshore oil and
    gas drilling occupations amid the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0).
    The proposed algorithm focuses on potential job merging due to technological adoption.
    It introduces a scaling factor named digital readiness level to incorporate modulation
    factors (e.g., cost of development and deployment of new technologies, labour
    market dynamics, economic benefits, regulatory readiness, and social acceptance)
    that act as catalysts or hindrances for technology adoption. A feature-based approach
    is developed to assess the similarities between occupations, while a mathematical
    model is developed to project automation trajectories for each job under investigation.
    These facilitate the consideration of potential job merging scenarios and the
    associated timeline. Since technology adoption depends on the industry, region,
    occupation, and stakeholder&#x2019;s ability to manage the transformation, the
    proposed algorithm is presented as a case study on Canadian offshore oil and gas
    drilling occupations. However, this algorithm and approach can be applied to other
    industries or occupation structures. The proposed algorithm projects that the
    total number of personnel on board (POB) in a typical offshore drilling platform
    will be reduced to six by 2058. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess
    the robustness of the proposed algorithm against variations in the feature values
    and weighting factors. It was found that when changing feature values and weighting
    factors up to <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\pm 20\%$</tex-math>
    </inline-formula> of their original values, only one job that remains after 2058
    follows three different job merging pathways, while others remain unchanged. Even
    the job that followed three different pathways was composed of the same source
    jobs compared to the corresponding job in the baseline results. <italic>Note to
    Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This research is inspired by the ongoing digital
    transformation initiatives and their socioeconomic impact. The adoption of digital
    technologies, such as automation, robotization, digital twins, data-driven decision-making
    systems, smart devices, and cloud computing technologies, gradually transform
    existing workplaces into digitally-enabled smart workplaces. Therefore, stakeholders
    must invest in training programs to reskill existing workforces and to orient
    prospective employees to work at these smart workplaces. If technology adoption
    occurs at a rapid or slower pace than workforce reformation, industries cannot
    gain the optimum benefit from their digital transformation initiatives. Also,
    human capital investments may not generate much benefit if technology adoption
    and workforce reformation occur at different rates. Therefore, this work presents
    a novel framework to predict future employment scenarios, particularly for the
    workers in offshore oil and gas drilling activities, along with a tentative timeline.
    Stakeholders can utilize the proposed framework to effectively plan the pace of
    technological adoption, future workforce transformation and human capital investments.

    automationTechnology adoptionSMESoftware-as-a-service 1. Introduction Software-as-a-Service
    (SaaS) is a cloud-based digital technology that offers ubiquitous access to an
    online service over the Internet (Cho & Chan, 2015). The rise of SaaS in today’s
    technology landscape is evidenced by the growing volume and variety of available
    SaaS solutions (Brinker, 2020), the fast-growing user base of popular SaaS technologies
    (e.g., Zoom, Slack, Dropbox, Salesforce, and HubSpot), and shifts toward SaaS
    business models by many long-established software companies (e.g., Microsoft,
    Oracle, and SAP). Gartner (2020) forecasted that the global sales revenue of SaaS
    providers would exceed $140 billion (USD) in 2022 (up from $105 billion in 2020).
    More than 70% of North American companies have now implemented SaaS technologies,
    and most of the remaining companies are considering doing so (Computer Economics,
    2019). The growing popularity of SaaS technologies has been reinforced by characteristics
    that help organizations make quick adoption decisions. For example, the upfront
    cost of acquiring SaaS is often negligible because most providers operate on a
    subscription revenue model in which the provider charges a monthly fee, including
    a free trial period, for new customers (Venkatachalam et al., 2014). Furthermore,
    the installation and set-up of SaaS are technically fast and easy (Siu, 2020).
    These characteristics distinguish the adoption of SaaS technologies from more
    traditional technologies because the perceived risk converts from the potential
    loss of invested capital to the potential loss of SaaS-related opportunities and
    delays in materializing the potential benefits they offer. For these reasons,
    organizations are encouraged to skip cautious evaluations and make swift adoption
    decisions to realize the underlying potential of SaaS technologies (Andriole,
    2018, Brinker, 2019, Lee et al., 2013). The swift adoption of SaaS changes the
    nature of the subsequent implementation process. The conventional perspective
    is that the implementation process is controlled by extensive pre-understanding
    regarding the technology-organization-environment (TOE) fit (Tornatzky & Fleischer,
    1990). Given that cautious pre-evaluation is absent in the adoption of SaaS, understanding
    of the technology’s fit to the organizational context arises from learning by
    doing as the implementation unfolds. Such agile software implementation processes
    are widely recognized in the managerial literature (e.g., Andriole, 2018, Brinker,
    2019), but the theoretical conceptualizations are implicit and scattered among
    different perspectives, such as effectual reasoning (Mero et al., 2020), the behavioral
    approach (Makkonen et al., 2016), and organizational learning (Hart et al., 2004).
    All these studies demonstrate how the implementations are highly iterative adaptation
    processes that rely on learning by doing rather than linear blueprints; thus,
    they provide conceptual ways to describe agile logic as an alternative to the
    predesigned implementation approach. However, research that theorizes how organizations
    select the adaptations that are needed to facilitate implementation and how these
    adaptations are operationalized via the learning-by-doing approach is scant. Against
    this backdrop, this study proposes the following: (a) the selection of adaptations
    in the agile implementation of SaaS is informed by organizational goals as well
    as the perceived affordances and constraints of the technological and organizational
    context, and (b) the adaptations are operationalized via iterative matching of
    SaaS features with organizational routines, which follow a cyclical pattern of
    designing, testing, and configuring. Thus, the goal of the focal study is to conceptualize
    and illustrate such agile SaaS implementation processes. To meet the stated goal,
    this study draws from the literature on SaaS implementation, agile methodologies,
    and the theory of affordances (Gibson, 1979) to conceptualize the agile implementation
    of SaaS. To illustrate this conceptualization, the study adopts a case research
    strategy with a focus on the longitudinal case of a start-up company that implemented
    HubSpot’s marketing automation (MA) software. MA represents a typical SaaS solution
    that can be acquired without significant upfront investment; thus, it enables
    firms to make swift adoption decisions without excessive planning (Järvinen and
    Taiminen, 2016, Mero et al., 2020). The start-up context was selected because
    start-up firms are generally considered agile implementers of technology in their
    pursuit of fast business growth and scalability (Blank and Dorf, 2012, Ries, 2011).
    Therefore, the case research strategy and the chosen case context seemed appropriate
    for manifesting the agile logic of SaaS implementation. This study contributes
    to SaaS implementation literature (e.g., Kim et al., 2017, Oliveira et al., 2019,
    Seethamraju, 2015) by conceptualizing agile logic for SaaS implementation and
    offering a framework for investigating agile implementation processes that are
    characterized by continuous adaptations to technological features and organizational
    routines. Such adaptations are recognized as a core part of the agile implementation
    approach (Makkonen et al., 2016; Mero et al., 2020; Paluch et al., 2020), but
    the basis on which the adaptations are selected remains unclear. We add to this
    knowledge by theorizing how organizations select which adaptations to technological
    features and organizational routines are needed to facilitate SaaS implementation.
    Furthermore, this study contributes to MA as a particular stream of SaaS literature
    (Järvinen and Taiminen, 2016, Mero et al., 2020) by identifying the key processes
    that a start-up organization needs to capitalize on MA affordances. The study’s
    structure is as follows: literature on the implementation of SaaS is first reviewed,
    followed by a description of the agile implementation of SaaS, presentation of
    the study’s framework, justification for the data collection, and analysis of
    the study methods. Finally, we present the findings, explain the theoretical contributions
    and managerial implications, and conclude with a discussion on the study’s limitations
    and avenues for future research. 2. Agile implementation of SaaS 2.1. SaaS as
    an object of implementation in start-ups SaaS refers to a type of cloud computing
    service in which a service provider hosts, develops, manages, and delivers software
    via the Internet (Cho & Chan, 2015). By purchasing a license or subscribing to
    an SaaS application, a client receives on-demand access to the software in a self-service
    fashion that is independent of either a device or a location (Marston et al.,
    2011). The client organization does not need to use its own server space or install
    and maintain the software; upgrades and new features are available on an on-going
    basis (van de Weerd et al., 2016). Compared to on-premise software, using SaaS
    is “like getting power from the grid rather than one’s own generator” (Yang et
    al., 2015, p. 254). The SaaS literature has extensively investigated the reasons
    behind SaaS adoption decisions and contributed to our knowledge of factors that
    affect them (e.g., Oliveira et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2017, Wu et al., 2011).
    These contributions imply that the reasons for SaaS adoption largely fall into
    the categories of cost and convenience and the magnitude of potential gains. Karunagaran
    et al. (2019) found that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) perceive greater
    cost and convenience benefits from the adoption of cloud services than large companies.
    Similarly, SaaS applications seem to be particularly attractive to start-up firms
    and SMEs because they require no upfront capital costs and provide ease of access,
    free trials, direct subscriptions, and automated upgrade cycles (Venkatachalam
    et al., 2014). Lee et al. (2013) reported that SMEs consider SaaS a rapid solution
    for filling gaps in information technology (IT) resources and capabilities. Furthermore,
    by having less of a legacy IT infrastructure and fewer ingrained attitudinal issues,
    SMEs are likely to be less burdened and more agile in adopting new types of cloud
    services (Marston et al., 2011). While SaaS may not always be the most cost-efficient
    approach for larger enterprises, the benefits that relate to the many SaaS alternatives
    available for prompt trials and rapid implementation offer a wider array of potential
    gains than traditional software packages (Tan et al., 2020). The research on the
    implementation of SaaS applications is largely posited in the software implementation
    literature (e.g., Alsharari et al., 2020, Seethamraju, 2015) and focused on the
    implementation of extensive software, such as enterprise resource planning systems
    (i.e., software packages “that integrate information and information-based processes
    within and across functional areas in an organization” [Kumar & Van Hillegersberg,
    2000, p. 23]). This research stream emphasizes the role of careful preplanning
    before making an adoption decision, which opens up an implementation process that
    executes the predesigned actions for attaining the TOE fit (Sia & Soh, 2007).
    Thus, a large share of software implementation research focuses on keeping the
    implementation process on the right track and proceeding as planned (Tan et al.,
    2020) by identifying critical success factors of the implementation (Finney and
    Corbett, 2007, Karim et al., 2007) and coordinating them via effective process
    execution (Al-Mudimigh et al., 2001). This branch of research lies largely in
    attempts to foresee the needed modifications for the organizational structure
    to fit a rigid off-the-shelf software package (Morton & Hu, 2008). Therefore,
    these studies articulate linear implementation process descriptions as tools to
    achieve the TOE fit (Orenga-Roglá and Chalmeta, 2019, Ke and Wei, 2008). Despite
    contributions to managing SaaS implementation processes, the focus on preplanning
    in this literature stream undermines its applicability to SaaS implementation
    processes, in which adoption decisions are driven by speed rather than precision,
    leading to a focus on capitalizing on software benefits by making fast and flexible
    adaptations on the basis of testing and continuous learning (Andriole, 2018).
    To develop alternative perspectives for mainstream software implementation research,
    studies like those of Fichman and Moses, 1999, Tan et al., 2020 explicitly challenge
    the linear preplanning process to underline the need to hasten the implementation
    for faster release of the software’s benefits. Similarly, Desouza et al., 2006,
    Pozzebon and Pinsonneault, 2005, and Morton and Hu (2008) agreed that software
    should be implemented as a modifiable and configurable entity that expands the
    implementation process from a pure organizational adaptation to a parallel technology
    adaptation. Similar types of non-linear implementation processes are also recognized
    in the other branches of the technology implementation literature. For example,
    Makkonen et al. (2012) applied a disjointed incrementalism perspective (Lindblom,
    1979) to their study to conceptualize the sequence of interlinked technology adoptions
    and the interrelated chain of problems and solutions that the adopter organization
    faced until it reached a balance through the learning-by-doing approach. Mero
    et al. (2020) applied the effectuation perspective of technology adoption to demonstrate
    how even large business-to-business (B2B) companies move back and forth between
    effectual and causal reasoning to challenge the idea of a rational and planned
    process by the probe-and-learn approach. Andriole (2018) discussed a mindset change,
    wherein a primary feature of technology implementation is not mastering its complexity
    but rather finding ways to attain a balanced outcome via continuous exploration,
    testing, and learning activities. Altogether, the studies introduced above articulate
    ideas and conceptualizations for considering the TOE fit as an actionable entity
    that can be reached by adaptations for both the technology and the organization.
    To synthesize the characteristics of the alternative perspectives described above,
    the following section draws from the research on agile methodologies. These methodologies
    are used to articulate a research framework for the agile implementation of SaaS
    that is a complementary theoretical perspective to the traditional software implementation
    research, which builds on the cautious preplanning perspective. 2.2. An analytical
    framework for the agile implementation of SaaS Over the last two decades, the
    concept of agility has expanded from the field of IT and software development
    (Bianchi et al., 2020, Dybå and Dingsøyr, 2008; see also Manifesto for Agile Software
    Development1) into various areas of business. The concept has an established position
    in guiding organizational processes, such as innovation development (Paluch et
    al., 2020), business analytics (Collier, 2011), risk management (Moran, 2014),
    organizational learning (Annosi et al., 2020), and service development (Sjödin
    et al., 2020), to be capable of reacting to unforeseen, rapid changes in the business
    environment. Agile process management builds upon how the desired performance
    is enacted through initial ideation and testing of the respective application
    that informs continuous development and modifications (Mills et al., 2020). For
    this purpose, agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, deviate from linear
    process models and use circular and flexible processes of designing, testing,
    and developing (Bianchi et al., 2020, Larman, 2004, Mills et al., 2020). According
    to Paluch et al. (2020), conventional processes are deterministic because they
    aim to reduce the uncertainty of technology initiatives upfront by careful planning,
    systematic execution, and control. On the contrary, agile processes are stochastic;
    they discover and address uncertainties continuously by adapting to new insights
    and unexpected events (Paluch et al., 2020). The focus on particular agile methodologies
    has turned toward the broader issue of the agile logic of an organization (Tronvoll
    et al., 2020). Thus, in its broadest sense, agility refers to an organization’s
    operational logic (or strategic agility) that manifests in a set of organizational
    elements that nurture a change-embracing and growth-oriented culture to support
    iterative processes for fast reactions and reconfigurations of the organization
    (Braunscheidel and Suresh, 2009, Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2020, Swafford et al., 2006,
    Conforto et al., 2016). Agile organizations are associated with increased variety
    and speed in their organizational actions, which allow them to gain a competitive
    advantage (Razmdoost et al., 2020). Building on this broad conceptualization of
    agility as operational logic, the focal study builds a framework that conceptualizes
    the ever-increasing pattern of SaaS implementation in which the implementation
    process is not guided by the explicit ex ante idea of the TOE fit (Tornatzky &
    Fleischer, 1990); rather, the fit arises during the implementation process via
    iterative testing. To conceptualize the micro-foundations of agile implementation
    logic, we draw from the concept of imbrication (Leonardi, 2011). The central idea
    of imbrication is that contemporary organizations work with flexible routines
    and flexible technologies. Routines here refer to repeated practices through which
    an organization exploits its resources (Feldman and Pentland, 2003, Teece, 2012).
    When flexible routines meet flexible technologies, the organization may either
    change its routines or customize a technology to fit its existing routines. When
    changes to technology and routines are sequential and interdependent, they become
    imbricated as the implementation process evolves. Leonardi’s (2011) conceptualization
    supports our view of an agile implementation process in which an organization
    does not have a fixed plan for how a technology or organizational routines are
    adapted. Instead, imbricated adaptations result from interactions during the implementation
    process as the organization learns which technology features and which organizational
    routines will help them realize their goals. According to Leonardi (2011), imbricated
    adaptations are fundamentally driven by the perception of the affordances and
    constraints of the technological and organizational context in which the implementation
    process occurs. Thus, the theory of affordances provides a meaningful lens through
    which to understand how organizations select the adaptations that are needed to
    facilitate the agile implementation of SaaS. Originally, the theory of affordances
    was created to explain how animals perceive their environments (Gibson, 1979).
    The principal claim was that physical objects in the environment offer certain
    affordances for action, but those affordances depend on the specific ways in which
    an animal perceives the object and its material properties (i.e., physical objects
    have specific features, but their affordances are unique to the goals of the actor
    in a given context). This theory has been principally applied to the technology
    literature by Norman, 1990, Norman, 1999, who suggested that affordances derive
    from specific technological features. Hutchby (2001) offered a relational view
    by arguing that affordances are created in the interaction between users and technological
    features: users view technological features with different goals in mind, making
    the affordances change across different contexts. Notably, depending on the context,
    technological features are not always perceived as affordances; they may also
    be perceived as constraints if they inhibit the realization of one’s goals (Hutchby,
    2001). Leonardi’s (2011) conceptualization of imbrication and Hutchby’s (2001)
    relational view on the theory of affordances (and constraints) offer meaningful
    ways to approach and conceptualize the agile implementation of SaaS software,
    as depicted in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (526KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Agile logic for SaaS implementation. The framework depicted
    in Fig. 1, which forms an analytical framework of the research to guide the empirical
    study, defines agile implementation as a process by which an organization matches
    its routines with the features of the technology to be implemented. Matching involves
    making decisions on how to adapt organizational routines to fit SaaS features
    as well as how to adapt SaaS features to fit existing routines. These decisions
    are based on the perception of what affordances and constraints the technological
    and organizational contexts offer per the organizational goals. Each new adaptation
    to a routine and/or a feature builds on the previous adaptations (Makkonen et
    al., 2012, Makkonen et al., 2016), leading to a chain of imbricated adaptations
    that form the core of the implementation process. Consequently, we propose that
    agile implementation of SaaS is a process by which an organization matches an
    SaaS’s features with its organizational routines by making a series of imbricated
    adaptations to both the technological features and the organizational routines
    based on perceived affordances and constraints and its organizational goals. 3.
    Methodology and research design 3.1. Longitudinal case study research This study
    adopted the longitudinal case research strategy and focused on a single case during
    the period May 2016–April 2020. The exploratory case study method is particularly
    suitable for investigating complex phenomena in a real-life setting (Eisenhardt,
    1989) and attaining an in-depth understanding of an emerging phenomenon through
    fortifying a theory by answering “why” and “how” questions (Yin, 2014). The longitudinal
    single-case study method was considered the most suitable approach for this research
    because it offers a viable means to investigate the phenomenon as it unfolds,
    producing longitudinal insights into both the technological and the organizational
    contexts in which the implementation process occurs. The case company was selected
    based on generous access to data collection and the suitability of the case to
    the study context. The case firm, which represents a start-up company operating
    in B2B markets, originated in Finland but was global at inception, and its key
    product is recruitment software that can be delivered digitally to international
    markets. Notably, research access was granted at a fertile time (May 2016) because
    the case company had recently acquired HubSpot MA software (March 2016) and was
    beginning to initiate its implementation. 3.2. Data collection This study harnessed
    three data collection methods: participatory observations, interviews, and behavioral
    (digital) analytics data. Each selected data source had a unique role in the study
    design (Table 1); thus, they corroborated and complemented one another. Table
    1. Data sources and their roles in the study design. Data source Role in the study
    design Participatory observations (from a four-year period) Real-time documentation
    of the key events, activities, and adaptations in the implementation process Semi-structured
    interviews conducted with six key informants at three timepoints (N = 18) Collection
    of explicit perceptions of the affordances and constraints of the technological
    and organizational contexts and reflections on topical adaptations in the implementation
    Validation interviews conducted with six key informants at two timepoints (N =
    12) Verification of the accuracy of our findings and assessment of data saturation
    Behavioral analytics data (from a four-year period) Tracking progress toward the
    organizational goal along the implementation process The participatory observations
    were collected throughout the implementation process over four years (May 2016–April
    2020), allowing real-time documentation of how the implementation process unfolded
    and how agility manifested in the adaptations of technological features and organizational
    routines. In practice, one of the authors was involved with the implementation
    process by taking notes on the observations in real time and storing them in a
    diary. The objects of observation were limited to six key informants that were
    purposefully selected (Patton, 2002) to represent all organization members who
    participated in the implementation process (Table 2). The involved author was
    unaware of the theoretical framing of this study to avoid biases in the data collection.
    Table 2. Key informants of the study. Key informant Role and main responsibilities
    1. Chief Executive Officer Operates as the company director; focuses primarily
    on sales and growth but supports all other key activities 2. Chief Technology
    Officer Key role in product development; contributes primarily to sales 3. Marketing
    Director Responsible for marketing; key role in brand management and marketing
    analytics 4. Sales Manager Responsible for sales; key role in customer relationship
    management 5. Customer Success Manager Responsible for customer service and sales;
    assists in marketing; key role in customer relationship management 6. Solution
    Designer Responsible for product development; key role in building the information
    system infrastructure Next, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the
    case firm’s key informants (i.e., the same informants who were observed) in three
    phases: August 2016, December 2016, and February 2017. The rationale for selecting
    these timeframes was that the observational data revealed major adaptations in
    the implementation process, providing fertile timing for the interviews. For the
    same reason, each interview round was slightly unique because we weighted the
    topical adaptations that were revealed by the observational data. Overall, the
    semi-structured interviews followed our conceptual framework. Accordingly, the
    main role of the interviews in the study design was to identify the perceived
    affordances and constraints of the organizational and technological contexts because
    such perceptions were difficult to collect explicitly via observations. Therefore,
    we focused on questions like the following: What do you perceive as the use cases/benefits/limitations/challenges
    of the MA system? What are the organizational elements that facilitate/inhibit
    the implementation? What has been learned? What has been achieved? What should
    be done next? Probing questions were also used to reveal further insights into
    the interviewees’ responses (Creswell, 2009). In addition, two validation interview
    rounds in June 2018 and April 2020 were organized to verify the study findings.
    These interviews were open discussions that focused on discussing the study findings
    with the key informants and obtaining feedback and corrections to our interpretations.
    Furthermore, the interviews’ role was to ensure that our data collection was saturated.
    Given that major new developments were not found during the validation interviews,
    we concluded that the data collection could be terminated. In total, the interview
    data comprised 18 semi-structured interviews and 12 validation interviews (i.e.,
    six interviews per interview round), which were conducted face to face and took
    an average of 32 min each. Finally, the interview and observational data were
    complemented with behavioral analytics data, which were collected from the case
    firm’s web analytics and social media analytics tools (e.g., website visits, social
    media following, campaign statistics, collection of marketing and sales leads).
    The analytics data helped monitor the progress of the MA system’s implementation.
    Importantly, the aim was not to make any causal claims that improvement in marketing
    metrics would be solely due to the implementation of MA. Using multiple data sources
    enabled us to triangulate the data, which increases the trustworthiness of the
    findings and mitigates biases that are typical of qualitative inquiries with single-source
    data (Farquhar et al., 2020). Data triangulation was performed at the data source
    level, where we compared the data collected via different methods over time to
    ensure that our observational, interview, and analytics data were aligned, and
    at the key informant level, where we ensured that the data collected from different
    key informants formed a convergent picture of the implementation process. Fig.

    the implementation process, as recommended by Street and Ward (2012). Download

    3.3. Data analysis Our analysis logic was guided by iterative orientation that
    balanced inductive theory generation and deductive theory verification and aimed
    to produce knowledge by integrating theoretical claims with empirical insights
    (see Orton, 1997, Srivastava and Hopwood, 2009). Specifically, we followed Dubois
    and Gadde (2002), who recommended the use of an analysis framework that is “tight”
    and “evolving” (p. 558), which implies that a study follows a pre-designed analytical
    framework that is allowed to evolve as a result of matching the case to the framework.
    Accordingly, our analytical framework (Fig. 1) formed the basis of our analysis,
    while the case-specific data determined the final specifications of the empirical
    framework (Fig. 4). Thus, our aim was to develop a theoretically grounded but
    empirically enriched framework that is more nuanced, given the particular research
    context (in this case, the implementation of MA software in a start-up). In the
    following, we explain how the data analysis proceeded in practice. All study data,
    including the transcribed interviews, observation diaries, and analytics data,
    were integrated into a unified study database. The data were carefully reviewed
    several times by the researchers. Thereafter, the analysis was conducted via a
    three-step thematization procedure that involved data condensation, data display,
    and conclusion drawing/verification (Miles et al., 2014). Data condensation involved
    elimination of data that were deemed irrelevant to the case and the analytical
    framework of this study. During the data display phase, the remaining data were
    classified based on the analytical framework, resulting in the data structure
    described in Fig. 3. After several iterations, the data were classified into (a)
    the domains of adaptations that occurred in the implementation and (b) the perceived
    affordances and constraints of the MA context (i.e., technological context) and
    the start-up context (i.e., organizational context). In total, we identified 3
    major domains of adaptations and 12 perceived affordances/constraints that were
    connected to those adaptations. Appendix A presents the affordances and constraints
    along with associated key informants and examples of interview quotes. When drawing
    conclusions, we interpreted the stages (i.e., design, test, and configure) through
    which the agile logic was manifested in the adaptations over time. As a result,
    we developed our conceptual framework into a context-specific and empirically
    enriched framework that accommodated the insights analyzed from the data. The
    findings were further reviewed and verified in the validation interviews. The
    results section details the connections between the affordances and constraints
    and the domains of the adaptations as well as the operationalization of those
    adaptations. Download : Download high-res image (751KB) Download : Download full-size

    the study case. 4. Findings 4.1. An overview of the case study The case firm acquired
    HubSpot MA software in March 2016. The acquisition decision was made quickly after
    the CEO heard about HubSpot via recommendations. The acquisition cost was low,
    and HubSpot even offered a significant introductory discount for start-up companies.
    Therefore, management did little in terms of either comparing HubSpot to other
    MA systems or pre-planning the implementation process. They reasoned that there
    were few risks to exploring the potential affordances of the system. Furthermore,
    the management team regarded HubSpot as a state-of-the-art platform that would
    allow the firm to align marketing operations with the firm’s desire for a scalable
    business model. Thus, from the inception of the implementation process, the organizational
    goal was to increase the scalability of marketing operations, although they were
    uncertain how this goal would be practically realized. Overall, the implementation
    of MA culminated in the development of three intertwined processes: (a) a sales
    lead management process, (b) a content marketing process, and (c) a customer intelligence
    process (see Fig. 4). These three processes formed the domains in which the adaptations
    to both technological features and organizational routines occurred. In turn,
    the adaptations were operationalized via alternating phases of designing, testing,
    and configuring. The case firm first designed an ideal process that was informed
    by its organizational goal and the perceived affordances and constraints that
    MA features and start-up characteristics evoke. During the testing phase, the
    firm experimented with MA features and organizational routines that might be useful
    for realizing the process. The testing produced insights regarding how to match
    MA features and organizational routines to find an optimal configuration for the
    process design. The phases of designing, testing, and configuring occurred in
    turns until the case firm found a satisfying configuration. Configuring the process
    also made the firm realize the need for other processes, which resulted in an
    imbricated chain of adaptations that ultimately led to a complete transformation
    of the firm’s marketing operations. The following sections discuss the development
    of the processes in more detail. 4.2. The sales lead management process (May 2016–December
    2017) After setting up and exploring the HubSpot features, the case firm concluded
    that the most actionable MA affordance concerned automated sales lead management.
    The key MA-related constraint was that setting up the MA system and rules for
    managing sales leads required a significant amount of manual work. The organizational
    constraints magnified this problem because the firm lacked the necessary expertise
    and human resources to dedicate to setting up the lead management rules in the
    automation system. Conversely, there were several organizational affordances that
    facilitated the process; their simple information systems infrastructure meant
    that there were no complex integrations to be made, and the flexibility of the
    organizational design meant that it was relatively easy to adapt the sales lead
    management routines. More importantly, the willingness to change drove the organization
    to design a sales lead management process in which high-quality online sales leads
    would be automatically transferred to the sales team. This automated process resonated
    with the firm’s goal of increasing the scalability of marketing operations because
    it would allow efficient processing of incoming online sales leads. In the testing
    phase, the case firm experimented with different MA rules by which incoming leads
    were classified, scored, and transferred between the marketing and sales systems.
    This was a highly iterative task because the initial rules were driven by intuition,
    but they were continuously optimized in a data-driven manner. To elaborate, data
    were used to learn which behavioral patterns and actions (e.g., demo requests
    and white paper downloads) were associated with high-quality leads that the sales
    team should approach. In addition to customizing and optimizing the MA rules,
    it was equally important to adapt organizational routines to match the sales lead
    management process. In particular, the case firm found the alignment of marketing
    and sales operations to be a crucial factor in effective lead management. Thus,
    the case firm tested different cooperation routines to improve alignment between
    marketing and sales and clarify the responsibilities of each group. After several
    configurations of MA rules and organizational routines, the case firm had built
    a strong foundation for its sales lead management process by December 2017. Nevertheless,
    the analytics data revealed that the number of sales leads remained low, which
    turned their attention to the need for creating and delivering marketing content
    that would attract more sales leads. 4.3. The content marketing process (October
    2016–March 2018) While configuring the sales lead management process, it became
    obvious that the existing approach of generating leads via cold calling was ill-suited
    to the scalable business model that the case firm was building. In response, the
    case firm envisioned a content marketing process that involved the systematic
    creation and delivery of valuable and engaging content, which was presumed to
    feed the sales lead management process with new incoming leads. This vision was
    based on the automated delivery of marketing communications, which was perceived
    as one of the key MA affordances, enabling the firm to send relevant content to
    customers at the optimal time of their purchasing journey. The constraints of
    creating the content marketing process were that the case firm had a limited amount
    of existing marketing content, and the MA did not create content or any other
    automation objects on behalf of the organization. Furthermore, the case firm had
    to manually determine the automation rules of what content was delivered to whom
    and when. Similar to the sales lead management process, the lack of MA expertise
    and human resources was considered a significant constraint in the content marketing
    process. However, management responded quickly by hiring a new marketer to support
    the firm’s content creation efforts. Overall, the envisioned process was considered
    to take MA usage to a more advanced level; thus, the entire organization was willing
    to help realize its goals by making changes to organizational routines. Initially,
    the testing focused primarily on organizational routines rather than technological
    features. The marketers innovated new ways to create content but were dissatisfied
    with the resulting content. Ultimately, the creation of high-quality content was
    a resource-intensive task that required versatile expertise and collaboration
    between marketers and product specialists. After testing different procedures
    to create content, the firm developed a routine in which the content creation
    expertise of marketers was matched with the expertise of product specialists and
    key managers. This type of co-creation empowered nearly the entire organization
    to participate in content creation. As the volume of content increased, the focus
    shifted to customizing the targeting and personalization criteria of the MA system.
    Matching content pieces with distinct customers was a highly experimental task
    that relied on data-driven optimization as the firm learned what types of content
    resonated with distinct types of behavioral patterns. Once their knowledge accumulated,
    the focus shifted to matching personalization criteria with content creation efforts,
    which led to several configurations until the case firm found harmony between
    them by March 2018. Despite the progress seen, the analytics data demonstrated
    strong deviations in how customers responded to personalized content delivery,
    which implied an urgent need to learn more about the preferences of the firm’s
    target customers. 4.4. The customer intelligence process (May 2017–December 2018)
    While the case firm was fine-tuning the content marketing process, its marketers
    realized that they had underutilized the automated collection of customer data,
    although they had perceived it as a key affordance during the early phase of the
    implementation process. This untapped potential hindered the relevance of their
    content marketing delivery. In response, the firm’s marketers began designing
    a customer intelligence process that would foster the systematic creation and
    sharing of customer insights. Their simple information systems infrastructure
    was considered a major affordance in the process because the existing customer
    data were already in one system, which eliminated the need to integrate data from
    different systems. The key constraint of MA in generating customer intelligence
    was that data collection was limited to behavioral data, while qualitative insights
    on, for example, implicit customer needs were largely missing. In other words,
    they were able to track what customers did and how they responded to different
    content marketing activities, but they lacked data on why customers behaved in
    specific ways. Due to the lack of human and monetary resources, the firm also
    had a limited ability to conduct extensive market research to complement the analytics-based
    data on customer behavior. The limitations of the customer data stressed the need
    for experiments to identify the types of content that would meet their customers’
    needs. The testing phase focused on exploring different organizational routines
    to design experiments that could feed customers with alternative content and analyze
    their responses with different metrics to generate new insights on preferences.
    The firm also tested different MA features to find actionable ways to automatically
    execute experiments and disseminate insights within the organization to support
    learning. As knowledge of its customers accumulated, the case firm improved its
    understanding of different customer personas and points of interest. In turn,
    the case firm was able to create and deliver more personalized and targeted content
    to meet the informational needs of its target customers and consequently facilitate
    the generation and nurturing of incoming leads. Positive progress was evidenced
    by analytics data that demonstrated significant improvements in the response rates
    of content marketing activities and the volume of incoming sales leads. 4.5. Evaluation
    of implementation benefits (2019–2020) After the case firm configured the three
    core processes for MA by late-2018, the pace of adaptations decreased, but continuous
    testing and optimization remained an integral part of its MA usage. Certain strategic
    decisions (e.g., changes to the target market and customer relationship management)
    led to more active development of marketing processes. However, even notable developments
    were relatively frictionless in their execution because the firm was already accustomed
    to making agile changes to its processes. By April 2020 (four years after the
    implementation), the firm had gained significant benefits from the implementation
    of MA as follows: (a) efficiency gains, including that a significant part of marketing
    communication was automated, while the numbers of sales leads, website visitors,
    and social media followers were rapidly growing; (b) a better understanding of
    its customers, which allowed the further strengthening of its business model;
    and (c) increased transparency in linking marketing activities with sales revenue,
    which led to favorable attitudes toward marketing operations. Besides the direct
    benefits, the case company recognized that the most substantial benefits of MA
    had been indirect because its implementation had transformed ad hoc marketing
    and sales activities into highly systematic operations that enabled continuous
    learning and performance improvements. During the implementation of MA, the sales
    lead management process progressed from a random cold-calling approach to a systematic
    lead-generation funnel, including metrics and marketing activities at each stage
    of the funnel. The content marketing process had transformed the philosophy of
    marketing communications from outbound to inbound. The customer intelligence process
    had transformed from using ad hoc customer feedback data to systematic monitoring
    of customer preferences and responses to marketing activities, leading to new
    insights regarding customers’ needs and preferences that now guide the firm’s
    marketing and business strategy at large. 5. Discussion 5.1. Theoretical contributions
    and propositions This study conceptualized agile logic for SaaS implementation
    as a process in which an organization matches SaaS features with organizational
    routines to reach its goals by making a series of imbricated adaptations to both
    the technological features and the organizational routines based on their perceived
    affordances and constraints. The conceptualization built on Leonardi’s (2011)
    theory of imbrication and Hutchby’s (2001) relational view of the theory of affordances
    and constraints to offer a theoretical explanation for agile implementation processes
    that have become increasingly common in business practice (Andriole, 2018, Brinker,
    2019). Our empirical setting explicated the operationalization of the conceptualization
    via a longitudinal case study of an MA SaaS implementation by a start-up company,
    leading to three theoretical contributions (C) and seven propositions (P) to guide
    future research on SaaS implementation. C1: This study developed a framework for
    investigating SaaS implementation processes that do not follow a linear planning
    logic. Thus, our framework complements the existing SaaS research (e.g., Kim et
    al., 2017, Oliveira et al., 2019, Seethamraju, 2015) that is largely built on
    preplanning the implementation process to ensure the TOE fit (Tornatzky & Fleischer,
    1990). In doing so, the study responds to business practice calls for novel approaches
    that are capable of accommodating implementation processes that are characterized
    by fast adoption decisions and explorative learning by doing (Andriole, 2018,
    Brinker, 2019). Although our intention is not to claim that the planning phase
    should be ignored, our findings suggest that the low upfront acquisition cost
    of SaaS mitigates the risk of adoption decision failure; therefore, time-consuming
    planning and evaluation may be considered bigger risks because they delay the
    potential benefits that can be gained with SaaS. This is particularly evident
    in implementations that require adaptations to both technological features and
    organizational routines because it is difficult to foresee their ideal configuration
    and resulting outcomes. The findings imply that a more agile approach to SaaS
    implementation provides an effective route for reaching organizational goals because
    it allows more flexibility and may lead to unforeseen and positive developments
    via the trial-and-error approach (Larman, 2004). In this regard, the proposed
    framework builds toward systemizing the agile implementation process into cyclical
    steps of designing, testing, and configuration that provide a structure for agile
    implementation processes, enabling the organization to avoid a tendency toward
    ad hoc behaviors (Heimeriks et al., 2012, Maitland and Sammartino, 2015). These
    contributions led us to formulate P1–P3 to guide further research. P1: The low
    upfront cost of SaaS acquisition transfers the risk perception from the risk of
    adoption failure to the risk of delaying the potential benefits of SaaS, leading
    to fast adoption decisions. P2: Fast adoption of SaaS allows for an implementation
    process that is guided by agile learning by doing rather than pre-evaluation and
    planning. P3: The management of SaaS implementation can be operationalized as
    recurring events of designing, testing, and configuring to adapt and match SaaS
    features and organizational routines. C2: The study theorizes how organizations
    select which adaptations to technological features and organizational routines
    are needed to facilitate SaaS implementation. Although the literature has recognized
    adaptations as a core part of the agile implementation approach (Makkonen et al.,
    2016, Mero et al., 2020, Paluch et al., 2020), it has focused on the logic of
    continuous adaptations rather than the elements that guide those adaptations.
    We contribute to this gap by demonstrating that the selection of adaptations is
    informed by organizational goals as well as perceived affordances and constraints
    of the technological and organizational context. Notably, the findings implied
    that the resulting adaptations to organizational routines were more radical than
    the SaaS features because the implementation process completely transformed the
    case company’s marketing strategy and operations. Although this finding may be
    influenced by the start-up context, it raises an important question regarding
    the influence of major SaaS providers in driving business strategies at large;
    the increasing implementation of dominant SaaS solutions might lead to institutional
    pressures to make mimetic movements and conform mainstream business practices
    to suit the software’s features, which are likely to hinder differentiation of
    marketing practices and decrease their benefits (Hillebrand et al., 2011). These
    contributions led us to formulate P4 and P5 to guide further research. P4. Agile
    SaaS implementation culminates in adaptations to organizational routines and software
    features that are informed by organizational goals and the perceived affordances
    and constraints of the technological and organizational contexts. P5. Adaptations
    of organizational routines to fit mainstream software features may lead to the
    institutionalization of business practices and subsequently decrease the firm’s
    ability to differentiate itself from competitors. C3: Our study contributes to
    MA as a particular stream of SaaS literature (Järvinen and Taiminen, 2016, Mero
    et al., 2020) by demonstrating the key processes that a start-up organization
    needs to capture the affordances of MA. Specifically, the findings related to
    the key MA processes are strongly aligned with the work of Järvinen and Taiminen
    (2016), who emphasized the vital role of building suitable sales lead management
    and content marketing processes as part of an MA initiative. We have added to
    this knowledge by demonstrating the relevance of the customer intelligence process
    in supporting content marketing and sales lead management. The study findings
    also imply that the effective management of these key processes requires versatile
    marketing capabilities (e.g., Day, 2011, Kachouie et al., 2018), ranging from
    the creativity to design MA use cases to the analytical competence to evaluate
    MA usage performance. Our findings are also highly related to the findings of
    Mero et al. (2020) regarding their use of effectuation theory to challenge the
    conventional wisdom of technology implementation as a strategic initiative with
    a predetermined implementation plan. Mero et al. (2020) show that even large-sized
    B2B companies make ad hoc decisions on adopting MA. Additionally, the subsequent
    implementation process balances the effectual experimentation of MA features and
    the causal creation of organizational processes and routines that support the
    efficient use of MA. Thus, the findings of Mero et al. (2020) that characterize
    the implementation of MA as a dynamic and flexible process align with our conceptualization
    of agile implementation, suggesting that our model may be highly relevant beyond
    the start-up context of our study. These contributions led us to formulate P6
    and P7 to guide further research. P6. In the context of MA SaaS implementation,
    sales lead management, content marketing, and customer intelligence processes
    form the core domains in which adaptations to SaaS features and organizational
    routines occur. P7. Managing the key processes of utilizing MA requires marketing
    capabilities that combine creativity with analytics competence. 5.2. Managerial
    implications From a managerial perspective, in-depth case studies often provide
    highly useful information (Johnston et al., 1999). This study provides important
    implications for managers who are either considering the acquisition of SaaS or
    are in the early phases of its implementation. Our findings suggest that managers
    should be open to new SaaS technologies and have a low threshold for acquiring
    them for trial periods, as long as the given technology fits the existing or desired
    business model. Before wasting resources on implementing software, the firm should
    focus on exploring the features of the given SaaS technology and assess their
    relevance to the business model and alignment with existing organizational routines.
    If the software is not aligned, managers should evaluate the need for additional
    resources that the adaptations would require and whether the adaptations would
    add value to the business or divert attention from more critical business processes.
    If the adaptations are likely to add value and help the organization reach its
    goals, we recommend proceeding with implementation without detailed planning procedures.
    During the implementation phase, it is critical to identify the key value-adding
    features of the software and the processes that are needed to benefit from those
    features. This approach requires adaptations to both software features and organizational
    routines. We suggest that managers adopt an agile process that follows alternating
    phases of designing, testing, and configuring. The key to success is learning
    via trial and error because it is difficult to foresee how different variations
    of features and routines might bring the optimal result. For example, because
    our case organization had difficulties envisioning a sales lead management process
    that would bring in high-quality leads, they had to try different adaptations
    of the MA rules and sales approaches toward engaging leads at different phases
    of the funnel. Consequently, the firm managed to build a process that suited their
    specific business context. As implementation proceeds, managers must continuously
    monitor internal and external environments. They should search for bottlenecks
    in software usage, design processes to further strengthen the benefits of the
    SaaS solution, and test and develop processes that are beneficial to the firm.
    Alongside internal development, it is vital that managers remain agile and react
    quickly to changes in the business landscape so that the use of SaaS can be dynamically
    adjusted to reflect changes in both customer and market behaviors. 5.3. Limitations
    and future research An important part of any study is critically evaluating its
    quality. This study was limited in terms of its statistical generalizability,
    which is typical of qualitative inquiries (Dubois and Gibbert, 2010, Yin, 2014).
    Instead, the study aimed to achieve analytical generalizability (i.e., the empirical
    observations are generalizable to a theory instead of a population) (Yin, 2014).
    The analytical generalizability was improved by building an analytical framework
    that guided our inquiry. Although the details of the framework may vary from study
    to study, its core idea is presumed to be transferable to other settings because
    of its broad contextualization; we presume that, regardless of the firm type,
    the agile implementation of most technologies will require adaptations to features
    and organizational routines, and these adaptations will be informed by perceived
    affordances and constraints. Thus, future research could adapt our study framework
    to other technologies, types of organizations, and cultures to test its applicability
    across contexts. Furthermore, it remains unclear which specific circumstances
    favor agile versus preplanning logic in technology implementation. Therefore,
    future research should study the roles of planning and learning by doing in the
    technology implementation processes, explore what types of technologies require
    more careful planning, and determine which technologies can be managed largely
    via learning by doing. Achieving a high level of reliability and validity is challenging
    for a longitudinal research study that is influenced by countless factors and
    events. However, the authors aimed to improve the study’s reliability through
    transparent data collection and analysis processes that would allow the study
    to be replicated (Batt, 2012, Dubois and Gibbert, 2010). Validity was improved
    by using several informants and multiple sources of data (observations, interviews,
    and analytics data) to examine the research phenomenon from various angles and
    achieve data triangulation (e.g., Beverland and Lindgreen, 2010, Piekkari et al.,
    2010). Furthermore, the results were verified by validation interviews. However,
    an analysis of qualitative data requires interpretation, which may lead to subjective
    biases and the omission of important evidence. Therefore, more research is needed
    to test the validity of our propositions (P1–P7) and the conceptualization of
    agile implementation processes at large. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    associated key informants, and example quotes. Marketing automation affordances
    Key informants Example quotes 1. Automated sales lead management • Chief Executive
    Officer (CEO) Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Marketing Director “We noticed that
    marketing automation allows us to treat sales leads automatically, which suits
    our scalable business model” (Marketing Director). “HubSpot makes marketing and
    sales automated … Marketing automation can act as a sales person or a sales team
    and get just as many leads” (CTO). 2. Automated delivery of marketing communications
    • CEO Marketing Director Sales Manager Solution Designer “I think the key benefit
    is the automation of customer communication, like automatic emails, for example”
    (Solution Designer).“HubSpot automates digital marketing and helps us to communicate
    with prospects and customers” (Sales Manager). . 3. Automated collection of customer
    data • CEO Customer Success Manager Marketing Director Sales Manager “First of
    all, it provides insights about people who are interested in our solution” (Sales
    Manager).“HubSpot will bring knowledge and data about new kinds of buyer profiles
    (data we would not know ourselves). I also hope that HubSpot will help us to find
    out what our target group is interested in so we can make our solution more fascinating
    for them. Additionally, we can maybe also find more information about our key
    segments or even find new segments, and then we would be able to generate more
    content for them” (Marketing Director). Marketing automation constraints Key informants
    Example quotes 1. Manual set-up of automation rules • CEO CTO Marketing Director
    Sales Manager Solution Designer “It is hard to know how much work it requires,
    and I expected the process to be faster … It [the set-up of marketing automation]
    has been a slower and more laborious process than I had anticipated … Difficulties
    we may face are that we have set up something wrong” (CEO). “There is much more
    manual work than I had anticipated. There is still a long way to get to the point
    where marketing automation works almost independently and the user only needs
    to do small modifications” (Marketing Director). 2. Manual creation of automation
    objects • CEO Marketing Director Sales Manager Solution Designer “Unless our content
    is interesting, people do not register, and we do not get leads [to the system]”
    (CEO). “The biggest problem so far has been the manual work that needs to be done,
    such as updating contact details and offers … If we contact the wrong people or
    send them the wrong messages, the conversions get worse, and it will also be harmful
    to our brand” (Sales Manager). 3. Limitations of automated data collection • CEO
    CTO Customer Success Manager Marketing Director Solution Designer “[Besides data
    produced by marketing automation], we still need more knowledge of who the people
    are who visit our website and whether they are relevant for us” (CTO). “We can
    track thousands of website visitors, but we should get more conversions and business
    results out of them. The trouble is, we do not know how many of the visitors are
    potential customers for us” (Marketing Director). Start-up affordances Key informants
    Example quotes 1. Simple information systems infrastructure • CTO Customer Success
    Manager Marketing Director Sales Manager Solution Designer “We do not have multiple
    systems nor the need for complex integrations” (Sales Manager).“All [customer]
    data and conversations are in one place” (Customer Success Manager) . 2. Flexibility
    of organizational design • CEO CTO Sales Manager “We are a start-up, and we do
    not have the same problems as corporations have. We can make changes in our organization
    quickly and alter our activities when the understanding of the market and customers
    grows” (Sales Manager).“It has been maybe good that we do not have a huge team.
    It has probably sped up the implementation process to be more streamlined” (CTO)
    . 3. Willingness to change • Customer Success Manager Marketing Director Solution
    Designer “All employees have had a positive attitude towards the new system, so
    there has not been change resistance. Everyone wants to learn how to use the system
    and make it part of everyday work” (Customer Success Manager).“People are motivated
    to use the system. It is always about the people, not about the tools. All employees
    are willing to contribute to the implementation.” (Solution Designer) . Start-up
    constraints Key informants Example quotes 1. Limited expertise of marketing automation
    usage • CEO CTO Customer Success Manager Marketing Director Sales Manager “We
    had employees working with a system like that pretty much for the first time in
    their life, so it has taken time from them to learn to use it. If we would have
    had someone on board who has more experience with the system, it might have sped
    up the process” (CEO).“This is always an issue when people are working. I see
    that the development areas concern the organization, not the system. We have to
    find the right methods for how to work more efficiently and accurately, not to
    get new tools” (Sales Manager). 2. Lack of human and monetary resources • CEO
    CTO Customer Success Manager Marketing Director Sales Manager Solution Designer
    “We are a start-up, and we have too many things going on at the same time. We
    have difficulties in estimating how much time different activities take” (Sales
    Manager). “The most difficult part is the lack of resources because adequate resources
    allocated to HubSpot take a lot from us … We do not have enough resources for
    this project, and external service providers are too expensive” (Marketing Director).
    3. Lack of existing marketing content • CEO CTO Marketing Director Sales Manager
    Solution Designer “One difficulty is the lack of content, and good marketing cannot
    be done without it. It takes effort from all of us” (CTO).“We do not have enough
    content to use the system properly” (Marketing Director) . References Al-Mudimigh

    2022 1 Introduction Robotic process automation (RPA) has emerged as an important
    technology for reducing repetitive and manual labor in administrative and standardized
    tasks [1, 2]. In recent years, the public sector has increased its use of robotic
    process automation (RPA) in administration, decision making and citizen services
    [3]. Available studies mostly focused on the specific cases of using RPA in public
    organizations [4]. Although the findings from these studies provide deep understanding
    of the RPA adoption by the case organizations in the public sector, we still lack
    a general helicopter view of how RPA is adopted in the public sector, its perceived
    benefits, and an understanding of RPA governance in public sector organizations.
    To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the benefits and implications of RPA
    use in the Swedish public sector, with particular attention on RPA penetration,
    impact on routine capabilities, RPA governance, and distribution of responsibilities
    between administrators and IT personnel. A survey was e-mailed to 525 Swedish
    public sector organizations, and we received 217 usable responses. The results
    show that Swedish public sector organizations are aware that RPA can improve routine
    administrative tasks and capabilities, although the level of adoption is moderate.
    This paper contributes to the knowledge regarding RPA use in public organizations
    in Sweden. The paper demonstrates the RPA general penetration in public sector,
    as well the insights of RPA benefits and impacts on improving routine capabilities
    in pubic organizations. The paper also depicts the governance structure of RPA.
    The knowledge and insights can serve as a reference for other countries and public
    administrative models. The remainder of this paper is structured accordingly.
    Section 2 presents a theoretical background to RPA, including governance, organizational
    benefits and routine capability. Section 3 describes the research method and the
    context. The results are presented in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the findings,
    limitations and future research. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 Theoretical
    Background Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is becoming established and “…can
    now be considered a mature technology which seems to have passed a hype without
    enduring a large dip in expectations.” [2, p. 130]. Willcocks et al. define RPA
    as the automation of service tasks by configuring software that controls robots
    to perform the work previously done by humans [1]. Similarly, Penttinen et al.
    [5] and Dias et al. [6] describe RPA as a process automation technology configured
    to perform work by interacting with information systems through existing user
    interfaces [5,6,7]. Also, RPA can be combined with artificial intelligence to
    increase its ability to capture and process information, so called cognitive RPA
    [8, 9]. RPA is considered as lightweight IT since it is non-invasive [10] and
    easy to configure such that less programming skills are needed for its implementation
    [1, 11]. 2.1 Level of Adoption Public organizations have started to adopt RPA
    technology. By adoption we mean that an organization accepts and starts to use
    a technology [12]. Several cases of RPA implementation in public organizations
    have been reported in literature. Dias et al. [6] examined how organizations transform
    knowledge work when adopting artificial intelligence. The result is based on a
    case study of a Finnish government shared services center that implemented AI-centric
    robotic process automation. Houy et al. [8] report on a cognitive automation application
    of RPA for determining issue date of trade tax notices provided by municipalities
    using different notice layouts. The application was developed and tested as a
    prototype. Ranerup and Henriksen [13], reporting on a case from municipal social
    services, found that the adoption of RPA contributed to several public sector
    value positions: professionalism, efficiency, and service. On the other hand,
    Gustafsson [14] calls attention to conflicts and tensions in relation with the
    introduction of RPA in public organizations. Having results from three case studies
    conducted in Swedish municipalities, Gustafsson [14] shows how RPA integration
    in public services can potentially create tensions in the areas of governance
    (i.e., policies and legislations), public administration (i.e., organization and
    management), technical infrastructure and data (issues of privacy and security).
    Güner et al. [4] survey eight cases of RPA in public sector organizations. These
    cases include examples of RPA adoption for automating a variety of work practices
    and processes. For instance, at higher education institutions, RPA is adopted
    to automate payroll processes in HR practices [15] and to automate examination
    result manual data entries [16]. In both cases, automated processes involve high
    volumes of manual data entries. Local governments adopt RPA to automate administrative
    processes, case handling practices [17] and decision-making processes in social
    assistance practices [18, 19]. Although these cases show that public organizations
    have begun to adopt RPA technology, they do not provide a comprehensive picture
    of the level of adoption, which makes it difficult to understand how widespread
    the use of RPA technology is in a wider public context. 2.2 Benefits of RPA Adoption
    Previous literature shows that there are several benefits associated with implementing
    RPA, including time savings, error reduction and cost savings [20,21,22,23,24].
    For example, the cost of RPA software licenses range between 1/3 and 1/5 of Full
    Time Equivalent (FTE) costs [24,25,26]. Although the degree of FTE savings varies
    depending on the business context and the process type, a study by Wewerka and
    Reichert [27] shows that FTE savings can be calculated using simple variables
    (i.e., number of cases, processing time, and daily working time of the employee)
    with concrete measures. Wewerka and Reichert [27] found that successful RPA projects
    decrease FTE costs independent of the context. Kedziora and Kiviranta [23] show
    the impact of RPA on FTE savings in different industries. In some cases, Return
    on Investment (ROI) from RPA projects can be up to 200% within one year [28].
    Time savings or reduced time is another benefit of RPA [20,21,22, 29]. Although
    some studies report that a human employee can complete tasks faster than the bots
    [30], RPA implementation usually increases the process speed [16, 20, 24, 27,
    28, 31, 32]. As a result of increasing the process speed and reducing the task
    completion time, RPA implementation frees employees from repetitive and tedious
    work, giving them more time to perform value added critical tasks [33,34,35].
    Another benefit of RPA is error reduction. Many data intensive processes (i.e.,
    finance, accounting, insurance, healthcare, and telecommunication applications)
    are prone to human errors. RPA eliminates human errors and improves the accuracy
    and quality of the processes [6, 21, 22, 24, 36]. For example, a case study [16]
    showed that a task performed by an RPA bot was free of errors. The literature
    also shows that the increased accuracy leads to accountability, which is important
    for decision-making [5, 13, 36, 37]. In addition, some of the benefits of RPA
    such as accessibility, scalability, and improved compliance can be attributed
    directly to its technological features. According to Lacity and Willcocks [7],
    RPA is designed to meet security, scalability, auditability, compliance requirements,
    and aspects of work that support continuity of service [38]. RPA software saves
    the logs of each activity, which are performed based on pre-defined rules. The
    configuration of the bots to follow regulations allows processes to be audited
    easily [7, 39, 40]. A case study [32] showed that RPA provides transparency in
    actions and decisions and supports the compliance with regulations. Table 1. Summary
    of benefits found in literature. Full size table A recent study of RPA professionals
    found that the main expected benefits of RPA adoption were consistent improvements
    in speed, availability, compliance, and quality [27]. Additionally, benefits for
    public organizations are usually aligned with the pre-defined benefits for RPA
    use and adoption. For example, Ranerup and Henriksen [13] found that automated
    decision-making was part of digitalization initiatives when the main benefits
    for adoption were clear before RPA implementation. Accordingly, automated decision-making
    with RPA significantly reduced the response time for social assistance applications
    and improved the efficiency of the social services. As a result, time savings
    were achieved processing applications, costs were reduced, and accountability
    was increased [13]. Also, RPA adoption reduced response times and the administrative
    workload of employees in the short term and increased the quality of social work
    in the long term [41]. In addition, RPA provides a cost-effective automation solution
    with a short implementation time [5, 42]. The benefits identified in the literature
    were placed into five benefit categories adapted to the perspective of public
    administration: free up time for employees, reduce cost for administration, improve
    working environment, increase customer service, and increase legal certainty,
    see Table 1. 2.3 Technology as Routine Capability Swanson [43] proposes an overarching
    perspective – “technology as routine capability” – for the study of the interplay
    between technology, routines, capabilities, and practices. This perspective theorizes
    that routine is integral to technology itself and that capabilities are associated
    with device-enabled (or technology-enabled) routines by which human practices
    are advanced. Technology as routine capability makes routine the linchpin in the
    analysis. Routines are patterns of action of people as well as machines. Swanson
    [43] argues that devices (technologies) are employed only through routines (device
    as routine component). The affordance offered by devices is largely received through
    routines (affordance built-in routine performance). Practice entails a family
    of routines executed in coordination and in a certain social order (routine as
    practice component). Since routine is integral to technology itself, the capability
    generated by the new routines will advance human practice (technology as routine
    capability built in practice). Therefore, practice is theorized as constituted
    from routines and capabilities. Practices can be advanced at three levels: individual,
    organizational, and social [43]. The individual level is concerned with the human
    practice, which is improved by the new routine capabilities provided by technology.
    The organizational level is about gaining new or improved existing routine capabilities
    of the organization through technology. The social level is about the whole society,
    including industries, professional services, professions, and other units of the
    society that are advanced by the new routine capabilities. Swanson [43] links
    capabilities with practices and argues that “technology as routine capability
    serves to advance human practice”. Advancing human practice occurs in a variety
    of contexts with regards to improvement such as “its economics, social acceptance,
    or politics” [43, p. 1011]. Improvement covers, e.g., “simplifying it or otherwise
    reducing its costs, for instance, or finding new outlets for it, expanding its
    presence, or increasing its appeal, making it more enjoyable, or obtaining favored
    social treatment for it, or improving its reputation” [43, p. 1011]. Considering
    that people and organizations constantly seek to improve their practices and therefore
    their routines, it can be concluded that advancing human practice drives change
    in technology [43]. The new technology, in turn, promotes human practice and unites
    new routines and devices to provide new capabilities. In addition, Swanson claims
    that this perspective of technology as routine capability serves as “a new theoretical
    and meta-analytic framework that allows insights from multiple studies to accumulate
    in a way that both illuminates and motivates further research on technological
    change” [43, p. 1008]. 2.4 RPA Governance IT has come to play a more strategic
    role in digitalizing public services. The governance of IT is becoming an integral
    part of public governance that define and implement processes, structures, and
    relational mechanisms that enable both business- and IT people to execute their
    responsibilities in support of effective and qualitative public services and the
    creation of more public value from IT enabled investments [c.f. 44]. Research
    on RPA governance is limited, but RPA is considered a lightweight IT with a higher
    level of end-user involvement in configuration and implementation [1]. This perspective
    implies a hybrid governance model [45] that involves both business and IT functions.
    Forrester [46] suggests that organizations establish centers of excellence for
    RPA governance, with business roles, such as process owners and subject matter
    experts, and IT roles, such as developers. Hence, it is expected that business
    personnel, such as administrators, are actively involved in RPA governance in
    the public sector. 3 Method The survey reported here was mailed to 525 public
    sector organizations in Sweden – 235 selected government agencies and all 290
    municipalities. 31 government agencies were not included because they were either
    currently inactive (e.g., Oljekrisnämnden) or too small to have their own e-mail
    address (e.g., Riksvärderingsnämnden). Also, the Swedish Courts, were treated
    as one authority. The questionnaire,, see Appendix, included 20 questions related
    to the following areas: level of adoption, routine capability, benefits, and RPA
    governance (distribution of responsibilities between administrators and IT personnel).
    Between December 2019 and May 2020, invitations to participate were e-mailed to
    the selected organizations and the e-mail included a link to the online survey.
    The survey used three question formats: Likert scales, multiple responses, and
    open responses. The online survey format was chosen to simplify survey distribution,
    enable different answering patterns and simplify data analysis [47]. After the
    survey data were collected, we performed a thematic analysis of the data. The
    analysis included six steps: familiarization with data, generating initial codes,
    searching for themes among codes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and producing the final report [48]. To ensure reliability and validity of the
    results, the team performed the analysis jointly. The consensus and agreements
    in interpretations were achieved through team discussions and meetings. 3.1 Research
    Context This research is situated in the context of Swedish public administration
    rooted in the Nordic social model of European countries [49, 50]. The Nordic model
    is unique as it combines high levels of social protection expenditures and universal
    welfare provisions with high levels of employment and low levels of poverty by
    emphasizing equity and efficiency [51]. Also, Sweden is ambitious in implementing
    automated decision making. The Swedish National Audit Office [52] has recently
    evaluated the use of automated decision-making in 13 of the largest Swedish government
    agencies. These 13 agencies make 148 million decisions annually (e.g., parental
    benefit, income taxation, and driving licenses). 138 million of these decisions
    are included in automated decision processes and 121 million are fully automated.
    Automation has shortened lead-times for decision-making without increasing costs
    for processing. In addition, automated decision-making has improved some aspects
    of legal certainty leading to cases are treated more equally. 4 Results Of the
    525 public organizations (290 municipalities and 235 government agencies) that
    were sent an invitation to participate, 217 responded (response rate of 41%):
    90 from government agencies and 127 from municipalities. The respondents had different
    roles in their organizations: 53% were involved in IT; 21% were administrators
    such as case handling officers and accountants; 21% worked with digitalization
    and other strategic staff functions such as organizational development and legal
    issues; and 4% did not specify their roles. 4.1 Level of Adoption The level of
    adoption of robotic process automation is illustrated in Fig. 1. Nine government
    agencies and 40 municipalities (23% of the total number of respondents) had already
    implemented and used robotic process automation, 22 government agencies and 63
    municipalities planned to implement RPA (39% of the total number of respondents),
    and 59 government agencies and 24 municipalities (38% of the total number of respondents)
    had no plans to implement RPA. Fig. 1. Adoption status. Full size image Over a
    third (38%) of the respondents – 24 municipalities and 59 government agencies
    – did not have plans to implement robotic process automation (Fig. 1). The motives
    for not implementing RPA can be roughly divided into two categories: business
    and technical. Business motives are related to organizational benefits and business
    process characteristics, whereas technical motives are related to IT policies
    and legacy systems. The business motives for not implementing RPA differ somewhat.
    Some respondents showed an interest in RPA but had not developed any plans for
    adopting RPA. Some respondents did not find that RPA provides sufficient value
    in relation to other digitization initiatives or that their business processes
    or decision-making are suitable for automation using RPA. The main technical motive
    for not implementing RPA is that organizations preferred to integrate systems
    at the Application Program Interface (API) level rather than using RPA. In addition,
    some organizations require software suppliers to provide open APIs when sourcing
    new systems and that they focus on transforming processes to become fully digitally
    integrated. In addition, organizations believe that RPA integration threatens
    to cement outdated information systems by automating simple and short-lived processes
    and that RPA will increase IT maintenance costs. 4.2 Routine Capability New Routines
    Respondents who had implemented RPA in their organizations acknowledged that new
    routines have been built: (1) automated processes, e.g., administration processes
    and financial processes (reporting support for social assistance services and
    payroll management); (2) PRA speeds up the processing of routine tasks and minimizes
    the risk of errors which give more time to humans to make quality decisions; (3)
    RPA replacing manual routines as new routines in public services; and (4) management
    of RPA and the bots create new routines that will require new job descriptions
    and positions. Respondents who plan to implement RPA indicated that the organizations
    have positive expectations of implementing RPA such as automating different processes
    that consist of manual repetitive tasks. However, to implement RPA in the organizations,
    they need to develop new management and RPA implementation methods, they need
    to prioritize processes that can be automated by RPA, and they need to train and
    educate employees in the use of the RPA solutions. New Capabilities (RPA as New
    Capabilities Advancing Practice) We identified ten routine capabilities related
    to RPA implementation: (1) reduce costs in administration and provide public services;
    (2) provide quality analysis and add value to their services to better meet the
    citizens’ individual needs; (3) free up time for the employees; (4) reduce human
    errors and avoid human emotions in the employees’ work; (5) provide more time
    for employees to develop new skills; (6) produce more confident decisions after
    RPA through an analysis of a case; (7) make work more process oriented; (8) develop
    new e-services that complement RPA; (9) improve digital capabilities of the employees
    and increase organizational digital maturity; and (10) use RPA to simplify and
    integrate different systems. From the perspective of routine capabilities, such
    applications change the routines in an improvisational way and advance the practices.
    In addition, the organizations point out that new management practices and change
    management programs are necessary for the implementation of RPA. Handling of Complaints
    Caused by RPA Since the use and implementation of RPA is in the early stage, very
    few complaints are related to RPA implementation. The survey indicates that most
    of the organizations handle the complaints the same way as other complaints received
    in the public services. For example, the complaints are received through a customer
    center and then forwarded to the digitization councils. Some respondents noted
    that the use of RPA is only changing the internal work processes and citizens
    may not notice the changes. Thus, the complaints related to the use of RPA in
    public services are not an issue at the moment. 4.3 Benefits Fulfilment of RPA
    Adoption The result shows that organizations that have already implemented RPA
    and organizations that plan to implement RPA want to free up time for administrators
    (Table 2). Other benefits are considered less important. The means for benefits
    for the organizations that implemented RPA are significantly lower than the means
    for importance (P < 0.01; paired t-test assuming two-tailed distribution) for
    the benefits free up time for administrators and reduce cost of case management.
    For the remaining three benefits, it was not possible to determine whether the
    benefits’ importance and fulfilment were significantly different. Table 2. Importance
    of benefits for RPA for public organizations that have implemented and plan to
    implement RPA. Benefits fulfilment for public organizations that have implemented
    RPA: 1 – lowest and 5 – highest. Full size table In addition, the respondents
    had the possibility to provide free-text descriptions of the benefits. Most free-text
    responses were variations of the benefits in Table 3. However, we identified a
    handful of new benefits: build knowledge, support digitalization in general, increase
    quality of information, and perform technical integration. Building knowledge
    relates to organizations learning to effectively use RPA. RPA is becoming an integral
    part of technologies for digitalization of public organizations in general. Increasing
    quality of information is related to the benefit increase legal certainty in case
    handling but applies to administration in general. Also, RPA is a tool for technical
    integration of government information systems. 4.4 RPA Governance The majority
    of agencies used or planned to use standard software (e.g., Ui-Path, Blue Prism,
    and Automation Anywhere) when adopting RPA (Table 3). Also, almost half of the
    agencies use or plan to use consultants to configure the software (45% for implemented
    and 54% for planned), while 16% of implemented and 31% of plan to configure the
    software internally. In addition, only a few agencies have developed (8%) or plan
    to develop (13%) their own software for RPA. Table 3. Overview of how the agencies
    govern or plan to govern RPA software. Full size table Administrators were involved,
    to various degree, in IT-related tasks when public organizations adopt RPA (Table
    4). A five-step scale was used to measure involvement: 1 (not involved) and 5
    (involved to a high degree). Administrative staff were highly involved in managing
    requirements and setting up robots, but they were rarely involved in the actual
    purchasing of the RPA software. Table 4. IT-related tasks performed or planned
    to be performed by administrators in conjunction with the adoption of RPA: 1 –
    not involved and 5 – involved to a high degree. Full size table There is a statistically
    significant difference (P < 0.05) in the expectations of administrators to participate
    in the management of requirements, set-up, and implementation of robots of the
    public organizations that plan to implement RPA and the experience of the public
    organizations that have implemented RPA. Public organizations that had implemented
    RPA responded that administrators were more involved in these three tasks than
    expected. 5 Discussion This paper studies the current adoption and implementation
    of RPA in Swedish public organizations. The results show that the awareness of
    RPA is high in the Swedish public sector though the level of adoption is still
    modest. Also, there are notable differences in the level of adoption between central
    and local government. The reasons for this discrepancy seem to be that many government
    agencies do not find RPA to be suitable for automating their processes or decision-making
    and that RPA threatens to increase dependency on outdated information systems.
    The results indicate that Swedish public organizations use standard software for
    RPA, have positive experiences and expectations of using RPA, and are aware of
    the advantages and benefits of implementing RPA. RPA improves the current routines
    (e.g., administrative, and decision-making processes), which results in better
    performance of civil servants because RPA frees them from repetitive work, which
    gives them more time to do valuable work, including personalizing services for
    citizens. The organizations that do not plan to adopt RPA are mainly hindered
    by economic and technical reasons. The study also finds that RPA generates routine
    capability for public organizations which produce benefit, such as free up work
    time for valuable tasks, improving working environments, reducing errors in handling
    cases, and increase personalized citizen service. However, the results show that
    the benefits of freeing up time for administrators and reducing costs of case
    management are lower than expected. The reasons for these results are unclear
    but could be related to the fact that public organizations need to also build
    knowledge for how to appropriately use RPA assets and how to manage their impact
    on organizational performance [53]. Clearly, the administrative personnel are
    heavily involved in the set-up and implementation of the software robots which
    demonstrate the common governance structure of RPA. Which indicates that organizations
    that plan to implement RPA underestimate the involvement of administrative staff
    in managing requirements, set-up, and implementation of the robots as compared
    to the experience from organizations that have implemented RPA. That is, public
    organizations planning to implement RPA need to better prepare administrative
    staff to use lightweight IT, such as RPA, and increase the requirements on administrative
    staff to be actively involved in IT-related work. The study provides a first overview
    of RPA adoption in the public sector on the country level. Moreover, it provides
    a case of RPA in the context of the Nordic administrative model with a strong
    emphasis on equity and efficiency [49, 51]. In this context, the use of RPA could
    potentially help to improve efficiency and legal certainty in case handling and
    support digitalization by providing means of lightweight IT [11]. The knowledge
    and insights can serve as a reference for other countries and public administrative
    models. We present five guidelines that would help towards a broader adoption
    of RPA in Sweden and in general. First, the adoption of RPA in public sector is
    necessary to improve the quality of public administration and service quality
    to citizens. Standard RPA solutions can be easily adopted and added to organizational
    IT infrastructure since RPA is a lightweight IT. Second, there are challenges
    to identify which process to be automated. In Sweden, public organizations automate
    various processes, for example, internal administration process, decisions of
    social assistance, school students’ healthcare management, and income support
    process. Public organizations need to analyze their routines and organizational
    needs before they select which process to automate. Third, the identified benefits
    serve as a framework for public organizations to formulate goals for RPA and for
    evaluating its usefulness, however, the benefits may not occur equally in all
    cases of RPA adoption. Fourth, public organizations must prepare public administrators
    for participating in the management, set-up, and implementation of software robots.
    Therefore, public organizations need to build knowledge about the appropriate
    use of RPA assets and how to manage the RPA assets, so they improve their performance.
    Fifth, public organizations need to build a new RPA governance structure to manage
    RPA operations and to facilitate the collaboration between the IT organization
    and the administrative staff. 6 Conclusion and Future Work We conclude that the
    awareness of RPA is high in the Swedish public sector but that the level of adoption
    is still modest. One possible limitation is that data collection was primarily
    carried out before the COVID-19 pandemic fully hit Sweden. There might be a quick
    shift towards automating routines in public administration because of the pandemic,
    which is not shown in our data [54]. We anticipate that the number of organizations
    without plans should decrease significantly. Another limitation of the study is
    that the data do not completely capture the Swedish public sector, but it is expected
    that most Swedish government agencies and municipalities will be invited to participate
    as data collection continues. Hence, we expect to establish a more complete understanding
    of the status of RPA adoption in the Swedish public sector. It would also be interesting
    to extend the survey to include other sectors and compare the results with other
    countries. Also, the use of RPA in the public sector could provide an interesting
    case of lightweight IT to overcome the challenges of outdated systems that hinder
    digitalization. References Willcocks, L.P., Lacity, M., Craig, A.: The IT function

    Swedish Public Administration (The survey was translated to English from Swedish.
    The survey was conducted in Swedish.) RPA was described accordingly in the survey:
    By RPA is meant that work processes are automated using software robots. Repetitive
    tasks are automated by the software robots mimicking how people perform the tasks.
    Normally this is done by the robot communicating with different computer systems
    via the user interfaces. 1. Which statement is true for your organization? a)
    We are a municipality b) We are a government agency. 2. Which statement is true
    for your organization? a) We have implemented and use RPA in our business. b)
    We plan to implement RPA in our business. c) We do not plan to implement RPA in
    our business. (a - Respondents directed to answer questions 3 – 13, b - Respondents
    directed to answer questions 3 – 6 and 15 – 20; c - Respondent directed to answer
    questions 3 – 6 and 14) 3–6. Background information about demographics and respondent’s
    role. 7. Were new work routines created during or after the implementation of
    RPA? a) Yes, examples: ________________ b) No 8. Do these new work routines mean
    that your organization also gains new capabilities, for example, in the form of
    more time for critical decisions, increased flexibility, or more support in decision-making?
    a) Yes, examples: _________________ b) No 9. Has the implementation of RPA led
    to complaints from residents/citizens? a) Yes, examples: __________________ b)

  description: 'In early 2020, IAAO President Amy Rasmussen created the Artificial
    Intelligence Task Force with the goal of developing a white paper describing the
    impact and uses of artificial intelligence (AI) in government valuation offices.
    The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 forced government valuation offices to adapt
    overnight. Many jurisdictions rapidly virtualized tasks and duties, which accelerated
    ongoing efforts to utilize office automation and implement intelligent software
    solutions. More and more, workflows incorporating digital information and multiple
    sources of data are processed and analyzed using software and integrated applications.
    The fully integrated workflows facilitate the increased usage of AI in operations,
    assessment, and valuation. This white paper delivers an introduction and overview
    of AI through case and pilot studies and review of relevant analytic methods while
    touching on possible organizational impacts. The paper looks at the changing role
    of valuers and assessment administrators and the evolution of valuation offices
    where AI will be used to improve operations, value estimates, and administration.
    It provides illustrative examples of AI use in the conduct of tax assessment,
    including the administrative aspects not directly involved in valuation. While
    there is substantial fanfare around valuation with AI, many of the benefits to
    be realized from the technology are in areas of administration, validation, and
    oversight. This is reflected in the case studies included, with more than half
    involving AI applications outside of the explicit valuation function. The introduction
    provides a definition and brief history of AI. It also helps disentangle the raft
    of AI methods with how they are used and provides a concrete list of which assessment
    activities may benefit from those general classes of algorithms. More importantly,
    the first section helps put into context why AI is becoming more widespread and
    what that means for organizations from both staffing and administration standpoints.
    After the introduction’s overview of what AI is, why it has captured professional
    imagination, and the organizational changes it portends, we provide examples of
    current uses by assessing organizations and their partners. The first case study
    is about the Property Valuation Services Corporation’s (PVSC) foray as the first
    organization in Canada to publish a tax assessment roll using AI-based valuations.
    This case study highlights the multiyear process leading the organization to that
    accomplishment and the lessons it learned along the way. The second use case is
    a pilot study by PVSC. The section discusses the success of AI, particularly machine-learning
    methods, for the valuation of residential properties in the Netherlands. The third
    use case is from BC Assessment (BCA) and describes how valuations of manufactured
    homes were conducted using AI methods. For successful adoption of AI in an assessment
    office, this case study highlights the importance of communication and feedback
    from appraisers and integration of AI-modeled values with the computer-assisted
    mass appraisal (CAMA) system. The fourth case study comes from the City of New
    York and showcases applications using AI to better manage form intake and processing.
    Using optical character recognition (OCR), it is possible to process the volumes
    of senior exemption applications and condominium declaration forms received in
    paper and PDF formats. As with the other case examples, the results still require
    human oversight but provide a significant improvement over the existing process.
    The fifth use case also comes from the City of New York. This section discusses
    how geospatial data and AI methods are being integrated and leveraged to determine
    land use, detect building changes, and extract parcel data from images and may
    be used to automate data collection. This section also gives background on the
    geospatial data required to leverage land use and building change detection applications,
    which are growing increasingly familiar and important to tax assessment organizations.
    The sixth application involves integrating AI-powered valuation as a feature within
    CAMA. To illustrate the potential of AI to automate sales-based valuation models,
    this study examines Tyler Technologies’ experience trying to provide an AI-powered
    valuation option for its users. It also clarifies the technology’s perceived limitations,
    which create headwinds for widespread adoption. This section ends with a discussion
    of international adoption of AI in property assessment offices in four African
    nations: Rwanda, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. The full digitalization of their
    records and workflows using imagery and modern technology allows them to modernize
    their systems without going through and updating legacy records and operational
    processes found in more established assessment jurisdictions. Following the case
    studies, the reader will find a section delving deeper into the core machine learning
    (ML) and AI methods underpinning these applications. ML is covered in the first
    part of this section. Other methods discussed cover key concepts in artificial
    neural networks and search and optimization, which underpin virtually every AI
    application. Finally, the paper closes with recommendations. Key takeaways are
    that some tax assessment organizations and their partners are already cautiously
    adopting AI. The technology’s adoption will grow more widespread and touch every
    tax assessment organization. As such, familiarity with how it is being used, a
    basic understanding of what is driving these changes, and what they mean for your
    organization are important.'

  description: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) originally entered the field of information
    systems as one of those disruptive innovations that will, among other automation
    solutions, have a profound effect on job descriptions and work itself in near
    future. One of the sectors that will be revolutionized – and are in fact already
    changing – are financial and human resource (HR) services, such as accounting,
    billing, and payroll services. According to statistics, Finnish companies operating
    on the administrative and support services sector make little use of service robots.
    Companies that have initially adopted the technology do not necessary reach its
    full potential. We explore what factors create challenges for the continued adoption
    of robotic process automation by investigating two companies and using interpretive
    case study as our research method. The two companies are service centers. They
    operate on the public sector in Finland and provide financial and HR services
    for their owner-clients. The findings of this study include insights into the
    key factors that affect continued adoption of RPA, and these point towards an
    expanded model of Innovation-Decision Process where iterations of a new decision
    are triggered by new ideas on how to use the innovation.

    entered the field of information systems as one of those disruptive innovations
    that will, among other automation solutions, have a profound effect on job descriptions
    and work itself in near future. One of the sectors that will be revolutionized
    – and are in fact already changing – are financial and human resource (HR) services,
    such as accounting, billing, and payroll services. According to statistics, Finnish
    companies operating on the administrative and support services sector make little
    use of service robots. Companies that have initially adopted the technology do
    not necessary reach its full potential. We explore what factors create challenges
    for the continued adoption of robotic process automation by investigating two
    companies and using interpretive case study as our research method. The two companies
    are service centers. They operate on the public sector in Finland and provide
    financial and HR services for their owner-clients. The findings of this study
    include insights into the key factors that affect continued adoption of RPA, and
    these point towards an expanded model of Innovation-Decision Process where iterations
    of a new decision are triggered by new ideas on how to use the innovation. Keywords

    Workplace forecasts have for years now stressed that automation will in the very
    near future have a substantial effect on jobs in several industries. Accountants
    and auditors have been viewed as one of the professions in the non-manufacturing
    sector which will decline considerably due to the adoption of automation technologies,
    such as robotic process automation (RPA). When RPA was introduced into financial
    and payroll services in Finland, a common theme in the news, professional journals
    and seminars was that accountants and other similar professions would be replaced
    by robots in the near future. However, certain public sector organizations which
    already adopted RPA some years ago during its first hype are still actively recruiting
    accountants, payroll specialists etc. According to statistics, Finnish companies
    in the administrative and support services sector utilize service robots to a
    low degree [1]. Out of these observations rose the question: How has the adoption
    process been continuing after the initial decision to adopt a technological innovation?
    And secondly, if change has been slower than originally anticipated or the adoption
    rate is slower in terms of the number of the robots in production, what factors
    are influencing the continued adoption of RPA? In this paper we try to find answers
    to these questions and explore the main challenges the companies have been facing.
    In order to find out how the adoption of RPA has been continuing after its initial
    adoption within accounting and HR services we visited two publicly controlled
    Finnish companies (service centers). While the underlying goal was to explore
    and understand the phenomenon, we also hoped to gather new knowledge which could
    deepen the theory of innovation adoption process, particularly information on
    the different stages of continued or discontinued adoption. This paper contains
    a brief discussion of earlier literature followed by an introduction to the case
    study and a description of the methodology used in gathering and analyzing data.
    The main body of the paper discusses the key findings of the thematic analysis
    of the interviews. Finally, we summarize the conclusions of this research and
    its limitations and put forward recommendations for further study. 2 Adoption
    of Technology and Robotic Process Automation In this section we aim to summarize
    and illustrate the existing theory of the adoption of technology in a few words
    and discuss some recent RPA studies related to the phenomenon. Different theories
    on the adoption of technology and its acceptance, such as Technology Acceptance
    Model (TAM) [2], Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) [3], Theory of Planned Behavior
    (TPB) [4], Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) [5] and its modifications [6] and Unified
    theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) [7] are widely used in the
    IS research field to explain how organizations or individuals adopt and accept
    technological innovations. Conceptualized factors behind the adoption can, according
    to these theories, be generalized as being related to a) the technology itself
    and its characteristics; b) the characteristics of the individual (as an adoption
    unit), such as demographics, norms, and innovativeness; and c) the characteristics
    of the organization as an adoption unit and its prior conditions. When revisited
    and re-evaluated, these popular theories and a priori study would appear to provide
    a good starting point for research, this one included, but nevertheless they seldom
    cover the continuance or discontinuance stages of the adoption of technology.
    Existing literature is even more limited in terms of organizational studies; hence
    we have explored the theoretical framework from the perspective of both individuals
    and organizations. 2.1 Different Elements of Adoption and Acceptance Decisions
    In this study, the adoption process base framework is founded on the Innovation-Decision
    process of the Diffusion of Innovation. The Innovation-Decision consists of five
    main stages: 1. Knowledge, 2. Persuasion, 3. Decision, 4. Implementation and 5.
    Confirmation [5]. This process is impacted by the characteristics of an innovation.
    The DOI itself recognizes five key attributes for the innovation, which are relative
    advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability. Other studies
    have identified several other key elements, such as attitudes, norms, and perceived
    behavioral control, to explain the intention to accept the technology [4], or
    attributes such as image, voluntariness, ease of use, visibility, trialability
    and result demonstrability among other characteristics to be considered [6]. While
    trust and its narrower subcategories, such as security and privacy have been seen
    as influencing key factors in adopting such technologies as web-based shopping
    and internet banking [8, 9] on the consumer level, trust or reliability does not
    always affect an organization’s intentions to adopt a technology [10]. The different
    elements mentioned earlier are related to the initial adoption of a given technology.
    In this case they might be relevant when our case organizations took the first
    decision to invest in RPA technology and put the first robot into service. Recent
    organizational studies emphasize somewhat different elements. One of them to be
    considered is economic efficiency [11]. In organizational motivation, legitimacy-oriented
    motives predict initial adoption and efficiency motives predict continued adoption
    [11], meaning that organizations with efficiency motives tend to adopt technologies
    in line with their objectives of economic efficiency. There was also a relation
    to be found with high searching efforts influencing positively on satisfaction,
    and satisfaction in turn influencing positively on continued adoption. However,
    the influence of satisfaction and perceived usefulness on continued adoption has
    also been argued to be less significant today and organizational context factors,
    such as subjective norms, and environmental context factors, such as competitive
    pressure, more significant [12]. The findings of some recent studies support the
    view that change within organizations needs to be managed as a continuous process
    instead of concentrating exclusively on the initial stage of adoption [12,13,14].
    A behavioral approach to organizational adoption of innovations suggests that
    in companies involved in the development of their own technology and environment
    these factors (innovation characteristics in DOI) “are not a given but emerge
    as a result of the company’s own action” [14]. In that case 1) goals and technical
    infrastructure, 2) business relationships, and 3) key individuals influence the
    continuous adoption activities and how these activities interplay and “comprise
    micro-foundations of organizational innovation adoption behaviour” [14]. When
    we reviewed the literature, we did not find that such factors as trust or image
    play a role when continued adoption progresses at a slow rate, but when it comes
    to the initial decision to adopt, especially when it is a question of late adoption,
    there is some evidence (e.g. in consumer studies) that late adoption may be related
    to a negative word of mouth [15]. If we remain on the level of individuals, social
    influence (of a more positive character) has been seen as a potential influencing
    factor on intentions to adopt, albeit a more potential factor with earlier than
    later adopters [16]. Theories which focus on organizations instead of individuals
    include such concepts as mimetic behavior/isomorphism or institutional pressure
    in the list of factors that influence the intention and the final decision to
    adopt an innovation. However, there was no evidence that they would have any significant
    influence on decisions to discontinue [18]. A survey on continued adoption conducted
    among purchasing managers suggests that mimetic competitor pressures have a negative
    effect on the continued adoption of a technological innovation within an organization
    (the firms) [11]. Among social factors, there is evidence of technical and economic
    influences in continuation inertia like system investment (earlier investments
    to other technologies) and technical integration, and finally research has found
    among forces of change such factors as shortcomings in system performance or environmental
    changes, which include increasing costs of system support and support being no
    longer available [18]. Finally, when considering whether the size of the adoption
    unit (organization) is related to the adoption, the literature suggested that
    the decision to adopt or the factors influencing the adoption are not necessarily
    dependent on the organization’s size. This was seen in the phenomenon of adopting
    open-source office applications and factors influencing the adoption decision
    [10] as well as in the adoption rate of web services in municipalities [19]. These
    studies suggest that smaller organizations may be more agile, and innovativeness
    of individuals has a greater impact on the adoption rate in small organizations,
    but they often lack the necessary funds to adopt the technology. 2.2 The Adoption
    of RPA There are several, if not exactly plenty of, recent articles covering general
    themes related to software robotics, the RPA implementation process and why RPA
    is initially adopted. However, the actual level of RPA usage or the stages of
    the process after the initial adoption do not appear to have been studied systematically.
    From earlier studies we can for instance find suggestions what may be success
    factors and risks in automation projects, including RPA [20], whereas there were
    very few indications on how organizations have continued adopting RPA in the years
    following the initial decision to adopt RPA or its implementation. Organizations
    often adopt RPA with the aim to gain such benefits as operational efficiency (in
    terms of time, money, human resources) and to increase the quality of their services
    (fewer mistakes, more rule-based error checking). The Big Four accounting firms
    estimated in 2017–18 that between 10 to 30% of accounting processes can potentially
    be automated [21]. They concluded that a business process is suitable for RPA
    if two conditions are met: 1) it involves only structured, digital inputs, and
    2) it is entirely rules-based. Studies show that reducing manual tasks and workloads
    can lead to significant time-saving in processes [22]. RPA is often used as an
    automation tool due to inadequacies in information systems and their capabilities.
    In accounting, RPA may be used in a wide range of tasks, from completing complex
    parts of processes to carrying out small automation tasks, such as running a report
    from an operative system. The purpose is to shift manual and standardized high
    volume routine tasks from humans to robots hoping to improve their accuracy and
    allowing experts to focus on tasks that involve interaction and problem solving
    [21]. The literature provides general and reasonably up-to-date information on
    the use of robotics in accounting and HR services [23,24,25], whereas scientific
    research articles on the topic are more scarce, but to be found such as Lacurezeanu
    et al. 2020 [26]. Syed et al. [22] presents a very comprehensive review of what
    has been written on the characteristics of tasks deemed suitable for RPA, and
    the paper also includes the results of different types of RPA research and identifies
    possible gaps in current literature on RPA. Adopting RPA in an organization does
    not necessarily mean that it will meet the goals commonly associated with RPA,
    such as operational efficiency. Systematically composed guidelines for the benefits
    realization of RPA deployment are currently scarce [22]. However, an early involvement
    of both IT and business division in adopting technology has been found to be critical
    in the long-term success of RPA, as [22] posited on the basis of the literature
    reviewed. RPA adoption has been studied earlier in the context of service centers
    in Portugal [Error! Reference source not found.]. The study of six Portuguese
    shared service centers (SSC) found that important factors leading to the initial
    adoption of RPA included the influence of external forces (through a process of
    “normative isomorphism”) and that mimetic (“everybody does”) isomorphism was also
    a key factor. In the case referred, all the SSC’s used the same consulting firms
    in the implementation and the same RPA technology [Error! Reference source not
    found.]. This led to the outcome that the decision to“introduce robotization was
    not backed up by ‘a number’, such as the number of hours of human labour that
    could be saved, but by a normative rationality”. The main challenges facing the
    implementation of robotics included a lack of resources to carry out robotization
    tasks and insufficient training to develop RPA solutions internally. Due to these
    challenges the SSC’s had established RPA core teams that required both the necessary
    technological skills and a full knowledge of the processes. We mentioned in our
    introduction the theme of “robots taking the jobs of accountants”. This theme
    appears to come up often when searching for news articles and other online material.
    Often the theme seems to origin from a study by Oxford Martin School, which was
    published already in 2013 [29]. Yet accountants and HR personnel (or developers)
    have not been seen as a source of possible resistance towards change in the reviewed
    literature on RPA research. When New Zealand researchers studied the future of
    work and employees’ views in the service sector [31], they found that automation
    was not seen only as a threat. Respondents of this study saw “automation as providing
    new opportunities, perhaps even enhancing their current jobs”, which may be considered
    a key finding. It was quite clear that younger respondents saw automation as something
    that would affect their careers significantly, whereas older employees did not
    necessarily believe it would affect their career prospects anymore as they were
    able to retire soon. The study however suggested, that for older participants
    it would be difficult to remain competitive in work as they presumed that the
    adoption of new technology would not be easy, thus much work would be needed in
    training systems. As will be seen later in this study, RPA is not the only automation
    solution for accounting and HR services. As mentioned earlier, RPA-based robots
    are often used to fill out the insufficient capacities of an enterprise’s IT.
    Firms may consider other technologies as solutions and adopt several practices
    to digitalize and automate their processes. In general, it is not uncommon to
    aim to maximize the value of the current IT and to discover new technologies at
    the same time. Similar hybrid models have been found in other technologies, e.g.
    cloud computing strategies [17]. The next step after adopting RPA on a basic level
    is sometimes considered to be integrating AI with robotics, and, although there
    have been recent studies on the critical success factors and challenges related
    to it, e.g. [30], the focus of research is mostly placed on robots other than
    software-based (such as physical service robots) and on intelligent artificial
    systems. Searches from research databases suggest that AI is not yet an active
    topic in accountancy. A recent case study [27] has examined successful implementation
    of RPA and AI systems in accounting and auditing, including both existing RPA
    systems and the implementation of new ideas. However, its findings were mainly
    based on business and technical approaches, excluding the social factors. The
    study also concluded that “the amount of identifiable challenges and risk factors
    are many and of various consequence” as they also identified this domain to be
    relatively new [27]. Because of this, we have chosen to refrain from further examining
    RPA and AI adoption studies, and while the topic came up later in some of the
    interviews, we do not include this theme either in our theory or in our findings,
    since AI was not yet adopted in the case organizations. 3 Case Introduction The
    case study was conducted in two publicly-controlled service centers. These were
    in-house companies which provide financial and HR services, such as accounting
    and payroll services to their customer-owners: municipalities, social and health
    care districts and other public utilities. While the two organizations which participated
    in this case study had similarities in terms of their business model, clientele,
    financial and payroll services and operative systems, they also had significant
    differences related to their other service offerings and how they had arranged
    their internal IT-services. One of the events that triggered the initial decision
    to adopt RPA was a “Robots for Service Center” project run in 2017 and 2018 [see
    32]. This was a co-operative project between seven publicly-controlled service
    centers, its goal to ensure their personnel’s wellbeing at work in the near future
    when digitalization and robotics would change the nature of their work. Both companies
    had acquired their first robots approximately 4 years earlier, but their rates
    of continued adoption differed considerably. Their production models were also
    different: whereas in Company 1 its internal teams took care of the RPA infrastructure
    and the evaluation and coordination of the project, the actual design and implementation
    of it were outsourced. They also serviced their robots in-house, and their infrastructure
    and projects services included robotic projects for their owner-clients as well.
    Company 2 had outsourced the infrastructure but had made the decision to form
    an RPA team and hire both internally and externally the team members who would
    take care of the actual design, implementation and maintenance of the robots.
    Company 2 did not provide RPA as a service for their owner-clients. Both companies
    had also experienced a merger some two years earlier, and this had changed their
    organizational structures and caused a considerable need for harmonized processes.
    However, neither the service processes nor the information systems of the financial
    and HR services were harmonized as yet. 4 Methodology Case study was chosen as
    the research method with the purpose of exploring the contemporary phenomenon
    of inertia affecting continued RPA in accounting and HR services and to understand
    it in its context [33]. The data was gathered through individual interviews of
    21 key members of the case organizations (see Table 1). Each interview lasted
    between 40 and 90 min – longer interviews encompassed more detailed discussions
    of the actual robots and technology. Interviews were preceded by informal discussions
    with contact persons from each company. We explored during these preliminary,
    informal and unstructured conversations the utilization rate and targets of robotization
    and sought to identify the key persons to interview. These conversations were
    noted down in brief memos, but they are not used as a base for analysis but rather
    as an additional reminder of the RPA targets. Other data included process documentation
    from one of the companies and public news pages and press releases. The interviews
    were held online due to the concurrent COVID-19 situation. Semi-structured questions
    were used as a starting point, although the interviews were meant to follow a
    free course according to the interviewees’ own initiative. The interviews took
    place between February and May 2021, one organization at a time. They were recorded
    and immediately written down as memos. Transcription and deeper analysis were
    to follow afterwards. Before each series of interviews were conducted, informal
    online meetings were held between the researcher and contact persons, who were
    later interviewed in more depth. A one-month break followed after the interviews
    held at Company 1. This time was used to analyze the framework of the research
    – namely the structure of the interviews. Results from the first data set were
    also analyzed during this stage. Table 1. List of interviewees at Companies 1
    and 2 of the case study Full size table The data was analyzed using thematic analysis,
    i.e. themes were coded from the interview memos and transcripts [34]. The process
    was iterative: discoveries and conclusions were organized into preliminary findings,
    these were then compared again with the data, and the findings were then updated.
    The themes that were gleaned from the interviews were also compared with the existing
    theory to understand what new knowledge – if any – might be drawn from these findings.
    In the following chapter we present our focal observations from the analysis of
    the data and return to the Diffusion of Innovation theory and Innovation-Decision
    Process. 5 Findings The six factors that follow below emerged from the interviews.
    While they may also play an important part when initial decisions are being made,
    they mainly manifest themselves at every new cycle of the decision-making process,
    and in the end they lead either to the continuation or discontinuation of the
    adoption. They are: 1. the role of competing technologies and compliance with
    Enterprise Architecture (EA) 2. the resourcing model of development 3. the incompleteness
    of the processes 4. interaction between IT and other teams 5. the amount of knowledge
    and ideas 6. resistance to change and trust Fig. 1. Factors affecting the continued
    adoption of RPA Full size image The factors affecting RPA continuation are explained
    in the following chapters and summarized in Appendix 1. It also explains briefly
    which factors have the greatest effect at each stage of the Innovation-Decision
    Process as well as their relations. 5.1 Competing Technologies and Compliance
    with EA RPA competes with other automation solutions. It needs to be compatible
    with the existing information systems and match the overall enterprise architecture.
    At Company 1, the specialists told that as part of the evaluation they first examine
    the underlying need for automation or the problem to be solved and then evaluate
    the possible technical solutions. The technical solutions which are considered
    among RPA include business intelligence solutions and integration solutions. Often
    the specialists may even hold up the automation and request their information
    system supplier to develop the system itself, even if a new release takes time.
    The IT specialists also seem to be more familiar to the competing technologies
    as they use them constantly. Company 2 had invested in an internal RPA development
    team, and while they considered that other automation solutions would probably
    play a bigger part in the future, for the time being they focused on putting new
    robots into service. Company 2 also hoped that their information system suppliers
    would develop their systems in such fashion that robots would not be needed, but
    they were more willing than Company 1 to develop temporary robots as a short-term
    solution. The key differences between the two companies is lead to assume that
    this was because Company 2 had its own developers with time allocated on RPA,
    whereas Company 1 needed to outsource all the development. “Even though robotics
    is a good tool for reducing manual work and in a sense, it automates processes,
    it is not the only instrument for digitalization and automation.” – One of the
    directors “I don’t know whether one of the contributing factors is that the instruments
    in production [for financial services] have evolved so that they have started
    to meet the demand. And on the other hand, how much have we been able to provide
    solutions with integration tools in such cases which otherwise would have been
    implemented with robotics. The spectrum of reasons is wide. To be honest, what
    is the cause and what the effect has not been investigated particularly explicitly.”
    – One of the managers. “As soon as we can have our software vendor implement certain
    things in the financial information systems, we can eliminate robots as superfluous.”
    – One of the developers Both companies reported problems in implementing RPA.
    These were caused by defects in the user interfaces of the information systems
    (compliance issues between RPA and the IS), and updates to these systems often
    made the robots malfunction. The maintenance and servicing of robots were consuming
    ever more hours – work hours which otherwise could have been used developing new
    robots. As mentioned earlier, the IS was not harmonized in the case companies
    and they both had more than one IS for same purpose (e.g. two systems for payroll
    service). Hence, they often needed more than one robot implementation to automate
    one task in the service process. 5.2 The Resourcing Model of the Development Interviewees
    commonly spoke of change being poorly managed or about the lack of shared coordination.
    Company 1 had historically faced challenges trying to find the right people who
    would commit to managing the change and be able to find the time to do it. Establishing
    a cross-organizational virtual team had also taken time, and only after that progress
    had been made. The committed individual managers or directors did not enough time
    to manage the change, and their responsibilities needed to be delegated. At Company
    1 the challenge was an intra-corporate one, and at Company 2 the challenge was
    being faced at the corporate group level, as both the senior management and the
    developers indicated that the development of automation needed to be managed collectively
    for the entire group. “It’s just that this process, well, it does not work properly
    and has not worked even once. What you can say about it is that when you wait
    for ideas to emerge from the process, then it is very sluggish. They constantly
    invoke the urgency of the process as an excuse, that there is not enough time
    for the actual doing part of it. I don’t know what the real reason is.” – One
    of the developers [The interviewee uses term “process” both in context of a certain
    HR or financial service and sometimes also when referring to the actual development
    process from idea to implementation] As mentioned in Sect. 5.2, Company 1 had
    decided to outsource its development of RPA. It seemed to be very careful with
    cost-benefit calculations of ideas surrounding the use of robots, although it
    had already invested in sufficient infrastructure and licenses. Some of the interviewees
    also reported issues with the outsourcing model and contracts – at least in the
    past. While Company 1 did not possess strong RPA competence either in the number
    of specialists or hours allocated for it, it had firmer knowledge of other IT
    services and technologies, since they were part of its core services to its clients.
    The management at Company 2 had also introduced a cost-evaluation model to be
    employed whenever new ideas for implementation were being evaluated, but the developers
    did not use it. The developers tended to implement any viable idea to a robot
    task, because they felt they did not receive enough ideas in the first place (this
    will be discussed later in Sect. 5.5). As again mentioned earlier, Company 1 seemed
    to be willing to wait for the new features of the operative information system
    to resolve automation issues, but Company 2 had chosen to build a robot while
    waiting for the updates, because developers had said that any change usually took
    longer than promised. Thus the company which relied on outsourcing did not prefer
    short-term, temporary robots. We assume as a conclusion that the barriers against
    continuing with a technology are lower when resourcing is not outsourced and that
    cost-benefit calculations play a relatively smaller role when the direct external
    costs of the technology are lower. 5.3 Incomplete Processes The theme of incomplete
    processes comes up in our case organizations in two different ways: 1) robots
    are given only small segments of processes or single tasks in a process and 2)
    service processes are not mature enough and the documentation of the processes
    are not sufficient. In first case, automation does not cover complete service
    processes nor considerably large sub-processes, but tasks from here and there.
    The developers saw it only as a partial solution to fill the need of process automation,
    and they explicitly wished to have more complete processes automated. The underlying
    reason, they suggested, had to do with the primary business processes that were
    to be automated and their maturity – see number 2 above. Business/service processes
    were incomplete in both companies. They needed companywide harmonizing and thorough
    documentation. Interviewees indicated that automation would have been executed
    differently, had the processes been better documented, the automation implementation
    would have been different and the level of automation altogether higher – regardless
    of the automation technology used. In particular, the CIO of Company 2 brought
    up the need for lean thinking in process development. “We may robotize a section
    which could be completely unnecessary in the first place if we had invested in
    automation [elsewhere].” – CIO While the number of robots was substantially smaller
    at Company 1, they had chosen to use robots to cover large or complex tasks. This,
    however, seemed to prolong the timescale of the project – in other words, it took
    several months to get a robot from design table to production. This led to other
    challenges, which are described in Sect. 5.5. It appears to be highly probable
    that the delays in projects were also due to difficulties in resourcing, as explained
    in Sect. 5.2. 5.4 Interaction Between Developers and Other Teams The lack of a
    common language shared by the IT department or developers and the accounting and
    payment services and their personnel came up in the interviews conducted at both
    companies. This had a slowing effect on the definition and implementation stages
    of the development. Learning to understand each other and the jargon used by each
    team took time, and the learning curve may flatline if a mediator is not involved
    in the process. This was seen as a problem, especially when an outsourced contractor
    was used in an implementation project. People within the same organization found
    it easier and more flexible to interact and share knowledge when they could, for
    example, sit by the side of a substance specialist (e.g. an accountant) in an
    ad hoc situation and observe what they were doing. Changes within the development
    team slowed interaction repeatedly. “Often there are too many changes in personnel
    here, one moves out, another comes in. Work cannot go uninterrupted with the same
    person and in the same team. Then the procedure may change every time as well
    and the ideas change, and you need to start all over again. Communication might
    be another issue.” -One of the developers However, one developer at Company 2
    realized that when they had introduced in the team new developers who had earlier
    experience in automation of accounting or other services, the design phase became
    gradually easier. We suggest as a conclusion that when the resourcing of technological
    implementation is assigned to on an organization’s internal teams, it may prudent
    to investigate whether any personnel outside the IT department have the necessary
    skills and willingness to have a career change and learn the technology which
    is being adopted. “The more one knows about the software, the easier it is to
    make [robots]. When you are an outsider, [In matters of financial services] a
    complete clot, it means that someone needs to give you hands-on guidance on how
    the finance side of things work.” – One of the developers 5.5 The Amount of Knowledge
    and Ideas A common theme raised during the interviews held at both companies was
    the lack of good ideas (or any ideas whatsoever) about the use of robots. Ideas
    were gathered from the service teams. The interviewees thought that only those
    who are experts in the service process that was to be automated were expected
    to be able to suggest workable ideas. They also highlighted that all ideas were
    welcomed. This was also stressed in internal communications when ideas were being
    solicited. The two companies and interviewees at all levels of hierarchy told
    that they did not secure as many ideas as they had hoped. At Company 2 this led
    to a situation where almost any technically feasible idea was developed into a
    robot, regardless of whether it really reduced weekly work hours or not. In contrast,
    IT specialists at Company 1 reported that they often had to turn down ideas because
    these were not feasible. “I feel like our users have a somewhat incorrect notion
    of this thing [RPA]. And then they [the ideas] are given to the RPA team, even
    though they clearly should be addressed to reporting team.” – One of the ICT specialists
    Lack of knowledge can also be viewed in this context as a lack of general knowledge
    about and knowhow of the capabilities of RPA and business processes. One key group
    had the necessary technical knowledge and the other key group knew the processes
    that could be automated, but combining this knowledge turned out to be problematic.
    Both those who were expected to come up with the ideas as well as those who were
    to evaluate and implement these ideas mentioned challenges in the past. “The greatest
    challenge for me was to understand. I’m the kind of person who needs to know the
    process in depth and understand it. I still don’t understand it comprehensively,
    so I can’t utilize all my knowhow.” – One of the HR specialists “If everyone could
    find the information easily, and if it were easier for the RPA team to gather
    the information, it would be easier to automate more and better robots. We in
    the RPA team know what a robot can do but we don’t know the accounting process.
    An accountant knows their own processes but does not know what a robot can do.”
    – One of the developers Knowledge is the initial state in the Innovation-Decision
    Process. However, interviewees from both companies, especially specialists, told
    that knowledge and knowhow – particularly when they are lacking – constantly influence
    the continuation of the adoption process. In Fig. 1, we have substituted the term
    ‘knowledge’ as the first stage of the adoption-continuation iterations with the
    term ‘trigger’. The idea of a new implementation is seen as the trigger which
    starts a new iteration of the Innovation-Decision process. When an organization
    runs out of viable new ideas in such technologies as RPA, continuation of the
    technology is endangered. 5.6 Resistance to Change and Trust Resistance to change
    came up in most of the interviews within both companies. Views varied depending
    on how long an interviewee had worked for the company. For example, a director
    at Company 2, who had been worked there for a relatively short time, was astonished
    by how well the personnel welcomed robotics. However, other key persons (at all
    levels) had seen resistance, albeit more towards the beginning. At Company 1 almost
    everyone mentioned it, and a few stated that this may have been the reason for
    the lack of ideas (an opinion shared by the ICT specialists at Company 2). “Directors,
    managers, they understood the ideology of what we were doing. But let’s say on
    staff level it is understandable that if you come and say, could you teach a robot
    to take your place, it may have a negative effect on motivation. And I don’t know
    how much of an actual effect it has had on implementing automation, but I would
    argue that if not explicitly, at least indirectly. The level of commitment may
    be lower. In my opinion management in many organizations has not realized well
    enough this point of view, namely that people are actually afraid of losing their
    jobs.” – One of the managers When interviewees were asked what kind of negative
    memories they had or what challenges they remembered from their journey to RPA,
    the most common themes were constant technological challenges and resistance from
    the personnel. They found the resistance milder now than before, but sometimes
    it still raised its head within some teams or sub-teams. When resistance was more
    evident, it seemed generally to be mostly passive and to be expressed as dithering,
    for instance through delaying decision-making at all stages of the innovation-decision
    process. Lack of trust (or doubt) also came up when interviewees shared their
    observations on the robots’ capabilities. Lack of trust cam in two types: 1) a
    general lack of trust in the robots’ capability to handle their tasks without
    crashing, and 2) a lack of trust in the robots’ capability of handling complete
    and complex processes. This is merely a suggestion that requires further study,
    but nevertheless lack of trust in new technology may increase the tendency to
    favor competing technologies. These thoughts are a conclusion drawn from the two
    themes that came up repeatedly in conversation with those interviewees who had
    a background in other automation or IT solutions: 1) the suitability of RPA over
    other solutions for automation and 2) the perceived number of technical issues
    related to RPA. The tendency to favor solutions other than RPA may also be related
    to the ease and comfort of continuing with old customs and habits. However, this
    notion needs more in-depth examination before it can be confirmed. 6 Conclusion
    We explored the continued adoption of RPA in two publicly-controlled in-house
    service centers in Finland, and our ambition was to understand how the innovation-adoption
    process had continued with RPA, whether there were challenges and why. As the
    available literature on continued and discontinued adoption of technology is very
    limited, the contribution of this research is not only to add knowledge of RPA
    adoption but also to provide insights on how the existing theory should be expanded
    to explain better the stages after the initial decision to adopt a technology
    innovation. We expanded the Innovation-Decision Process with iterations of the
    decision during the continuation phase of the adoption of technology and suggested
    factors which may affect the rate of continued adoption of an innovation on organizational
    level. The expanded model is limited by the fact that these factors are based
    on researching only one technology, albeit in two organizations. In terms of continued
    RPA adoption, six key factors were discovered to influence the decision to continue.
    These factors and their effect on one another can be summarized in general terms
    as follows: 1. The technology under examination may be in constant competition
    with other technologies that the organization has adopted. These other technologies
    may be preferred over the examined technology, especially when: a. Specialists
    involved in decision-making and development have more knowhow on other technologies.
    b. Compatibility issues with other technologies are more easily solved by the
    key personnel. c. Instead of allocating the development to an internal core team
    the organization outsources it, even more so if it faces challenges with the subcontractor’s
    delivery models. 2. Even when the desire to accelerate the change exists, the
    rate of adoption slows down when: a. The technology cannot be utilized on the
    desired level due to incomplete business processes and lack of knowledge. b. Key
    personnel do not share a common language and knowledge about the change process.
    3. When the continued adoption of a technology depends on a constant flow of new
    triggers for implementation, the decision to discontinue is predicts by a depletion
    of ideas. Ideas run out when: a. There is resistance to the technology. b. There
    is a lack of trust, or the reliability of the technology is in doubt. c. There
    is not enough knowledge on how the technology could be utilized. The first conclusion
    in this summary is related to ‘compliance’, an element of innovation in the DOI
    theory. It also comes close to the element of ‘relative advantage’ as well as
    ‘ease of use’ in TAM. The second conclusion is related to the environmental factors
    of the adoption unit, and the results might be different if these factors were
    removed. The third conclusion resonates with the element of ‘attitudes’ in acceptance
    models such as TPB and studies which highlight the need to incorporate factors
    arising from organizational context. Thus it seems that a single adoption or acceptance
    theory alone does not explain whether the use of a technology is continued or
    discontinued, and DOI theory alone does not provide ready-made solutions for modeling
    the continuation and discontinuation stages. Also the characteristics of an innovation
    and adoption unit are key factors not only in the initial innovation-decision
    process but keep impacting the decisions to continue as well (see Fig. 1). For
    the information systems managers this study highlights the importance of understanding
    1) the full context and complexity of the IT environment and the underlying enterprise
    architecture, 2) the maturity or the organizational situation of the underlying
    processes and customs related to technology they are adopting, 3) the importance
    of solving resourcing issues at an early stage and finally 4) the importance of
    a shared language and early involvement of people from across the organization.
    We have examined only one technology, and this has its limitations for theory
    building. We did not study whether these same adoption units would have similar
    results with other technologies. In terms of Diffusion of Innovation, this study
    does not take into consideration the innovativeness of an organization in general
    – the study did not explore the phenomenon from that point of view, and no national
    (or EU/ETA) statistics exist for determining the organization’s position in view
    of the general situation of its peers. What we can depend on is how the organizations
    and individuals saw their current situation was related to their hopes and goals.
    Neither have we in this study delved deeper into the initial adoption decision
    made years earlier and whether for instance normative or mimetic isomorphism have
    played the most significant role in the initial decision and could have later
    influenced the decisions to continue. However, they faced external pressure from
    their owner-clients to search constantly for solutions bringing greater efficiency
    and lower costs. Suggestions for further research include returning to a more
    in-depth case study or possible action research exploring business models and
    organizational decisions in these companies. We also suggest taking a deeper dive
    into the culture of an organization with the aim of understanding different rates
    of adoption more thoroughly through key differences in management decisions and
    interaction. In addition to interaction a more in-depth examination of EA is encouraged
    in further studies. The theory should be tested e.g. by collecting more data from
    other organizations, either concentrating on automation technologies or by exploring
    several technologies and keeping to a more general level of continuation inertia
    affecting the adoption of technologies. References Official Statistics of Finland

    of privately-owned, petroleum-powered vehicles used primarily by single occupants,
    is a major contributor to climate change, air pollution, excessive congestion,
    and land-use impacts (Urry, 2004). Many policymakers and other stakeholders have
    explored and supported efforts to transition towards more sustainable forms of
    mobility, with recent efforts intently focused on three particular categories
    of innovation: electric mobility, autonomous vehicles and shared mobility. These
    have been referred to as the “three revolutions” (Sperling, 2018) as well as “new
    mobilities” for transport (Sheller and Urry, 2016). These innovations, individually
    or in some combination, could play important roles in future transformations of
    transportation sectors—substantially impacting the environment, energy use, and
    social well-being. Yet there is a dearth of literature that explores what role,
    if any, these innovations may play in the Global South—lower income countries
    often situated below the Earth''s equator. In this paper, we focus on a subset
    of the Global South — Africa, concentrating our research on major urban areas
    in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) such as Johannesburg (South Africa), Kigali (Rwanda),
    Lagos (Nigeria) and Nairobi (Kenya). As just one example, global EV datasets (e.g.
    the Electric Vehicle World Sales Database, 2021, see https://www.ev-volumes.com/)
    do not adequately track sales in Africa. The EV dataset includes only one market
    for the entirety of “Africa and Mid-East,” which was the United Arab Emirates.
    Such gaps in data point to the inherent challenge in studying transport pathways
    or decarbonization of the transport sector in the Global South. Another reason
    for this challenge is because doing such study requires large interdisciplinary
    teams with expertise spanning History, Human, Psychology, Geography, Economics,
    Sociology, and Urban Planning alongside topics such as Tourism or Gender (Ingeborgrud
    et al., 2020). Impactful, reflective interdisciplinary research in social science
    and the humanities on transport sector decarbonisation encompasses studies of
    different modes of transport and corresponding shifts in sociotechnical systems
    for mobility (Wood, 2015). As (Mareï and Savy, 2021) caution, notwithstanding
    an increased focus in city logistics and transport planning within the research
    community, the particular issues facing cities in the Global South, where modern
    and traditional modes of transport often coexist, remain “seldom addressed” (Njoya
    and Knowles, 2020). concur when they note that research on the development and
    impacts of air transport has hitherto focused mainly on developed countries in
    the Global North, and relatively little on less developed countries in the Global
    South. (Sovacool et al., 2018)’s review of electric mobility and vehicle to grid
    transitions depicts a literature dominated by institutions in the Global North.
    In his broader critique of the literature on transport and geography, (Schwanen,
    2018) affirmed that predominantly Western worldviews, theories, concepts, methods
    and research practices continue to prevail in geographical scholarship on transport
    in the Global South. These biases are unfortunate, given the pressing needs of
    communities and cities in the Global South. (Schwanen, 2018) notes that these
    needs are interstitial and severe, and pressing challenges include substantial
    increases in emissions, noise, traffic injuries and casualties, and road congestion.
    (Benevenuto and Caulfield, 2019) add that countries (and cities) in the Global
    South must often confront transport systems dealing with high levels of corruption,
    poor performance and levels of access, limited access to data, high rates of poverty,
    investments focused on appeasing political constituents rather than emphasizing
    what is needed and a prioritization for flagship construction projects (media-attractors),
    rather than maintenance or upkeep. Most countries especially in the Global South
    remain locked-in to petroleum-powered automobility, despite decades of progress
    in alternative and low-carbon fuels and technologies, and some incremental improvements
    taken up in the mass market (Axsen and Sovacool, 2019). A study on mobility in
    SSA cities by Tembe et al. (2020) revealed a relatively small public transport
    sector concentrated on major radial roads, and an increasing informal sector of
    paratransit. Household ownership of motorized two-wheelers and the private car
    is reported to be very low. A comparison of urban transport systems across the
    two cites of Nairobi, Kenya and Maputo, Mozambique identified affordability as
    the main concern for the use of buses and paratransit. For example, a substantial
    share of urban dwellers was found to have no daily access to public transport
    services because these are expensive and not easily accessible (Tembe et al. (2020)).
    In this article, we focus intently on the drivers and barriers resulting from
    three innovations in the four African urban areas of Johannesburg, Kigali, Lagos,
    and Nairobi. We ask: What are the drivers behind automated vehicles, electric
    mobility, and ridesharing/bike-sharing in these regions? What are the potential
    barriers? And what implications for policy or sustainability transitions emerge?
    We argue that these innovations are particularly important at providing low-carbon
    transition for the transport sector. Although emissions of greenhouse gases have
    been historically low, they are expected to see extremely rapid growth in the
    coming decades; thus, locking-in low-carbon forms of mobility now has a chance
    to protect public health, improve efficiency, lower carbon dioxide emissions,
    and generate innovation simultaneously for decades to come (Noel et al., 2019;
    Lah, 2018; Fisch-Romito and Guivarch, 2019; Waisman et al., 2013). We begin by
    introducing these three innovations, justifying our four case studies, and explicating
    our research design, which is based on an interdisciplinary review of the academic
    literature. We then present the results of our review before discussing how to
    better harness innovation for low-carbon mobility in an African context. Although
    largely empirical in nature, we also intend our contribution to inform ongoing
    debates over transport policy and planning, as well as sustainability transitions,
    which we explore in Section 4. We conclude with implications for research and
    policy. 2. Research methods: selecting three innovations and four case studies
    This section of the paper briefly introduces the three innovations selected for
    analysis, the four urban areas we explore their use in, and how we collected our
    data and evidence for the review. 2.1. Choosing three mobility innovations Our
    focus in this paper is on three innovations for urban transport (Vu and Preston,
    2020): automated mobility, electrification and electric mobility, and ridesharing
    and bike-sharing (see Table 1). These three innovations are largely heralded as
    ushering in the next wave or transformation in mobility services (Axsen and Sovacool,
    2019); (Sperling, 2018) even calls these three innovations “the three revolutions”
    for future transport, although he focuses mostly on their use in the Global North.
    Table 1. Conceptualizing “the three revolutions” in innovative future mobility
    and transport. Innovation Description Examples Electric vehicles (EVs) Automobiles,
    buses, trucks, or other forms of mobility (scooters, micro-mobility) that use
    electricity as their primary source of fuel Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles,
    battery electric vehicles, e-bikes and scooters Ridesharing & carpooling The on-demand
    shared use of a vehicle or transport technology (bicycle) where the passenger
    pays for the service rather than owns the vehicle Uber and Lyft, bike-share, peer-to-peer
    carshare Automated vehicles (AVs) Forms of mobility that use partial or full automation
    to assist or replace a human driver in operation and use Self-Driving Mini-Trucks,
    Autonomous Electric Cars, Satellite-Controlled Vehicles, Drones, automated light
    rail or rapid transit Source: Authors. One closely related aspect of these innovations
    are the business models that can support them. The particular emergence of digital
    platforms are beginning to allow online information and ticketing and innovations
    in Mobility as a Service (MaaS) systems. MaaS systems are applicable in some cities
    like Lagos and Johannesburg (Magnusson et al., 2020). Even in situations that
    often equate urban transport with rail and bus services, various modes of transport
    can be differentiated in terms of capacity and costs. The low-cost public transport
    and low-capacity systems such as mini−/microbuses, paratransit, and taxis can
    be an alttractive niche for many people (Preston and Bickel, 2020). There are
    various debates around hype-disappointment cycles on these three innovations,
    and in this sense, they do not focus on (or many do not prioritize) environmental
    sustainability (clean energy, climate change, transport and industrial decarbonization).
    And that Africa is still lagging in the adoption of these options (Jacob and Lefgren,
    2011). Interestingly, such innovations intersect with existing patterns of infrastructure
    as well as emerging new business models for mobility, including MaaS. These services
    are also often based on the technology that has facilitated the advent of Transportation
    Network Companies (TNCs) like taxifier, Uber, and Lyft. TNCs —app-based, and on-demand
    transportation services that connect the driver and user – were designed to serve
    public transit riders through more predictable pricing, and be less dependent
    on government subsidies, while services often designed to fill gaps in the fixed
    route by public bus and mass transit system (Weinreich et al., 2020). Several
    app-based pilots, and on-demand programs have emerged in most countries across
    Africa, spurred on, in part by the mass transit administration (MTA) and its introduction
    of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) programs in cities such as Lagos. Meanwhile, the emergence
    of deep learning techniques and their applicability in transportation systems
    recently has equally contributed to heightened interest in TNCs (Davis et al.,
    2020). Jennings reveals that such sustainable mobility systems could contribute
    to changing the virtualization of life and work, the increasing contribution of
    electronic communication and important role that social media are playing in national
    discourse. These trends such as teleworking and e-shopping are helping to establish
    new lifestyles and habits (Jennings, 2020). Teoh et al. (2020) also suggests such
    innovations would be useful at helping urban transport regions become more sustainable
    only insofar as they support a leveling off and eventual decline in car use. 2.2.
    Selecting four African case studies While mass transit is enabling mega infrastructure
    change in many of the world''s cities and providing large volumes of people with
    options for traveling on trains and buses, in the Global South these modes of
    transport are often face challenges over concerns that include reliability, efficiency,
    effectiveness and speed (Costa et al., 2017). Urban transport planning for many
    Global South regions in the 1950s and 1960s emerged almost entirely by “top-down”
    approaches to research and development. But “bottom-up” options including climate-compatible
    development pathways and natural climate solutions hold great promise in making
    African cities more resilient and sustainable (Fankhauser et al., 2019; Page and
    Fuller, 2021). To examine the role of some potential bottom-up or leapfrogging
    transport innovations in Sub-Saharan Africa, we selected the four populous, carbon
    intensive, major metropolitan areas that also serve as capital cities shown in
    Table 2. As that Table indicates, each of the cities has more than one million
    inhabitants and some (Lagos) has more than 20 million. The four cities are fairly
    large, occupying at least 600 km2 or more. Johannesburg and Lagos are particularly
    carbon intensive. Household electricity access also vary from 70% to 87.7%. In
    this section, we summarize some key information and data about trends in each
    of the four cities to give readers more context for the sections to come. Table

    met our criterion for a populous and carbon intensive city given that road-based
    transportation is widely depended on. One contribution of the South Africa''s
    apartheid structures remain a subtle and insistent feature of capitalist domination,
    in which racial and other divisions among labor, and the separation between working
    and living are rife (McCarthy and Swilling, 2001). Putting aside its infamous
    label for being a “post-apartheid” city, Johannesburg has been termed variously
    “a city of extremes,” a “neoapartheid city,” “Fortress Johannesburg” and even
    a “neoliberal dystopia,” terms that all highlight how patterns of division and
    inequality are built into the socio-spatial dynamics of the city (Robinson et
    al. 2020). The city itself is governed by a single-tier metropolitan authority
    that must fulfil its developmental mandate, secure its electoral base, provide
    for the black urban working-class and urban poor but also maintain alliances with
    white ethnic communities, making the city one of contrasts. Urban transport planning
    centers on the flagship initiative known as the “Corridors of Freedom” plan intended
    to take “transit orientated development” further by stimulating public transport,
    especially intensifying development along new BRT networks shown in Fig. 1. While
    on paper The Plan involves “stitching together” a fragmented city into something
    far more integrated and inclusive through linking centrally located affordable
    accommodation to public transportation, employment opportunities and a range of
    accessible services, in practice it has a high number of private cars, traffic
    congestion, and high resulting transport carbon emissions. Bus and taxi services
    are relatively more accessible than rail services, and the percentage of households
    that have access to a car is 26.1% with an average of 0.40 cars per household
    (Walters, 2013). This results in substantial carbon footprint for transport: nationally,
    5% of petroleum liquid is consumed by industry, while 78% is consumed by the transport
    sector in South Africa (Vanderschuren et al., 2010). Carbon emissions from the
    transport sector are of a similar scale to industrial emissions in South Africa=

    is projected to have one of the fastest growing rates for a city in the world.
    Between 2000 and 2015, Kigali grew at an annual rate of 5.3%, from a city of 580,000
    to a city of 1.3 million, and over the coming 15 years the city is projected to
    grow 4.0% annually to a population of 2.4 m in 2030 (Sudmant et al., 2017). If
    these estimations are accurate, the city will quadruple in size by 2030. Despite
    this population, (Niyonsenga, 2018) write that the nature and extent of public
    transport services remain inadequate in terms of both condition and capacity,
    with poor quality roads and a very limited road network shown in Fig. 2. However,
    between 2005 and 2011 the stock of private cars more than doubled, leading to
    rising congestion and contributing to high levels of particulate air pollution
    in the city, also ensuring high carbon emissions “for decades to come” (Sudmant
    et al., 2017). Unlike many other African cities, Kigali has been more active in
    attempting to better manage urban growth, fight poverty, and improve liability.
    This includes commitment to the environment in the form of a ban on plastic bags,
    investments in public waste, and corridors for safer walking and the use of electric
    buses for public transportation. Download : Download high-res image (352KB) Download

    Source: (Niyonsenga, 2018). Lagos was selected because it represents not only
    a large, populous city (reputed to be the sixth fasting growing city in the world)
    but one where transport service demands centre more on two end-use services, passenger
    and freight transport. This however remains primarily fossil-fuelled, with the
    two main conventional sources of transport fuel in Nigeria, gasoline and diesel,
    accounting for around 99% of the vehicles operating across the country (Dioha
    and Kumar, 2020). Passenger transport remains dominated by bus (44.8%) and car
    (42.5%); motorcycle travel contributes 12.6% and rail only 0.24%. Collectively,
    more than 61% of travel is by petrol vehicles and the rest by diesel (Gujba et
    al., 2013). This is very carbon intensive, with greenhouse gas emissions expected
    to reach a staggering 39 MtCO2eq in 2040 (Dioha and Kumar, 2020). Seeking to better
    manage congestion and traffic, planners in Lagos have adopted extreme measures
    such as banning motorcycles (okada) as a means of commercial and private transportation
    on some roads (Olajide et al., 2018). The traffic planners have also sought to
    expand bus links and corridors shown in Fig. 3, although these are still prone
    to frequent breakdowns and traffic congestions. It has been projected that out
    of the 7 million or so passengers that use the Lagos transport system, only around
    8000 passengers a day use the rail network for transport, with water and rail
    transport accounting for about 1% of all travel in Lagos (Ikioda, 2016). Download

    Authority) Nairobi, similar to our other cities, is populous and features a mixture
    of different transport modes, notably walking but also a well-established paratransit
    network shown in Fig. 4. According to Tembe et al. (2019), Nairobi is a critical
    economic center for all of East and Central Africa, accounting for half of all
    formal employment for Kenya as well as half of gross domestic product. The city
    is also reported to have one of the longest average journey-to-work times in Africa
    due to: “Heavy congestion, high rates of walking, informal collective transportation,
    and the spatial distribution of jobs and residents” (Nakamura and Avner, 2021).
    Nairobi''s traffic congestion, caused by deficient transportation infrastructure,
    is argued to be crippling the economy (Rajé et al., 2018). Another unique aspect
    of Nairobi''s transport sector is high levels of tourism related to transport,
    given that the city sits alongside a national park that is home to endangered
    wildlife including black rhinos. This makes Nairobi a “major tourist gateway”
    for safaris and holidays (Rajé et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image

    Source: (Campbell et al., 2019). 2.3. Research design: A critical and umbrella
    literature review With our four urban case studies established, we then proceeded
    to execute an interdisciplinary literature review of peer-reviewed publications
    to collect evidence on their overall mobility trends as well as specific studies
    examining the role of automation, electrification, and shared mobility in their
    transport mixes. We focused on the academic literature, rather than the grey literature,
    for three reasons. First, we maintain that the peer-review process of academic
    journals produces generally higher quality research (compared to say advocacy)
    and minimizes bias. Second, it is often a requirement for project funding, especially
    from academic research councils, that researchers publish their results only in
    accredited, indexed peer-reviewed journals (this helps avoid predatory journals
    and outputs that have no quality control). Third, academic databases such as Scopus
    are often where most professional researchers go (and may even be trained to go)
    when they examine a topic. We executed specific search strings covering the past
    15 years of peer-reviewed research available on Scopus, searching for: • Automation:
    the terms “automated mobility,” “autonomous mobility”, and “self-driving cars”;
    • Electrification: the terms “electric vehicle,” “electric mobility,” and “electrification
    of transport”; • Shared mobility: the terms “ride hailing,” “shared mobility,”
    and “carpooling “ Along with: • “Johannesburg” and/or “South Africa” • “Kigali”
    and/or “Rwanda” • “Lagos” and/or “Nigeria” • “Nairobi” and/or “Kenya” • “Africa”
    and/or “Sub-Saharan Africa” We searched these terms in English on the Scopus database
    and collected approximately 90 studies published in the past fifteen years, most
    of which we cite in the rest of the review. Admittedly, although we are able to
    capture some perspectives from the Global South (especially Sub-Saharan Africa,
    a key region within the Global South) written by author teams in the Global South,
    much of our evidence still arises from research looking at Global North contexts
    or looking at Global South contexts via Global North projects and authors. Although
    there are elements of our search criteria that are systematic, we do not classify
    our approach as a systematic review. Instead, we classify our study as a mix of
    a “critical review” and an “umbrella review” (Grant and Booth, 2009). A critical
    review seeks to demonstrate not only that a research team has sufficiently scoured
    existing literature on a topic but to go beyond description to include a degree
    of analysis, interpretation, and conceptual synthesis. An umbrella review refers
    to the compiling of evidence from multiple disciplines or literature searches
    into one accessible and usable document, highlighting (at times) competing interpretations
    and uncertainties in the literature. The critical aspect of our review enables
    us to describe and interpret what is known, whereas the umbrella aspect of our
    review enables us to capture diverse interdisciplinary perspectives and also identify
    recommendations for research. 3. Results: electrified, automated and shared mobility
    in an African context Interestingly, our review of the literature suggests that
    the three innovations will have neither solely positive, nor negative, impacts
    within each of the four urban areas. Table 3 offers a high-level summary based
    on some established metrics from the literature, focusing on key indicators that
    correspond go the three innovations we examined: • Indicators for electrification
    and power outages relate directly to our examination of electric mobility as well
    as automated mobility depending on wireless internet or GPS data networks (which
    require reliable electricity); • Indicators for poverty relate to all three innovations
    as they reflect the purchasing power of respective communities and households;
    • Indicators for car ownership, road length, and passenger car sales also affect
    all three innovations as they relate to preferences for private vs. public mobility
    and also the general quality of mobility infrastructure; • Indicators for registered
    electric vehicles relate directly to our electric mobility innovation. Table 3.
    Key energy and transport indicators for our four selected urban areas (using most
    recently available data) and their implications for three mobility innovations
    (using a red, yellow, green “traffic light” system). Note: Issues in red signify
    strong barriers to the three mobility innovations, yellow moderate barriers, green
    weak barriers. Categorization was undertaken based on the expert opinion of the
    authors. a(Access to electricity (% of population) | Data April 2021). b(Meijer
    et al., 2018). c(Statistics in Category: Energy Nation Master 2014). d (Electric
    Vehicles Initiative – Programmes - IEA Global EV Outlook, 2016.) e (World atlas:
    Car sales by country, 2021). These indicators were also chosen because we were
    able to actually find reliable data on them. With these metrics selected, Table
    3 visualizes red/orange showing strong barriers to the innovations, yellow moderate
    barriers, and green weak barriers (i.e., more positive markets). It is telling
    that all urban areas have at least some red/orange, indicative of multiple red
    barriers. For example, electrification would be a strong barrier to Kigali and
    Lagos in particular, given poor coverage of electricity networks and issues of
    reliability in Nigeria, where a typical firm suffers about one power outage a
    day. All countries had few electric vehicles (EVs), three with no data at all
    or “0”. South Africa had 1119 EVs in 2019 (cleantechnica, 2020). Lack of roads
    creates a very strong barrier for automated vehicles in all of the urban areas
    with the exception of Johannesburg. High rates of poverty suggest low patterns
    of disposable income available to purchase the innovations. In the remainder of
    this section of the review, we elaborate more on the specific drivers and barriers
    to the three innovations organized by each option. 3.1. Automated mobility and
    self-driving cars Among our three innovations, automated mobility was by far the
    least published topic in the context of our urban areas. Nevertheless, we identified
    both positive drivers and negative barriers from the available literature. Firstly,
    there is some potential for automated mobility to improve the efficiency of delivery
    for particular items especially drones (aerial automated vehicles) that can avoid
    the congested streets of urban areas in Africa. A study by McCall (2019) on the
    use of drones in commercial medical service delivery in Rwanda, reveals that Zipline''s
    drones currently serve 19 hospitals across the country. And this service is set
    to expand to cover 500 hospitals and health facilities (McCall, 2019). Secondly,
    emerging social science work on possible adopters and consumers for automated
    vehicles (AVs) notes that many African stakeholders have positive perceptions
    of automated mobility. Moody et al. (2020) examined perceptions of AV safety across
    a diverse sample of individuals from a wide variety of countries. The study found
    that a significant country-to-country variance in perceptions of AV safety exist,
    even after controlling for the characteristics of the individuals in those countries
    (Moody et al., 2020). The authors examined perceptions of AV safety across 41,932
    individuals in 51 countries, noting that young, high-income, employed, and highly
    educated males are the most optimistic about AV safety especially in Africa. Out
    of these 51 countries, Kenya ranked 15th in awareness, 20th in positive perceptions
    of safety, and 9th in terms of rapid employment. South Africa was not far behind,
    ranking 25th, 26th, and 16th (respectively) in the same categories, putting both
    in the top half of countries. Moreover, there are literatures that suggests that
    enhanced efficiency or delivery of freight, an important sector of non-commuting
    journeys, often ignored in the literature (Thomopoulos et al., 2020), could also
    be enabled by automated mobility. One study noted that eco-innovation initiatives
    in the Nigerian logistics sector (such as automation and efficiency) can aid in
    enhancing sustainable performance and increasing competitive advantage of freight
    logistics firms (Orji et al., 2019). Other evidence suggests that connected, automated
    cars could enhance urban tourism, enabling more economic activity by running 24
    h a day, seven days a week. Cohen and Hopkins noted that the impacts of automated
    mobility on urban tourism could be “far-reaching” given that automation could,
    under particular contexts, positively influence transport mode use, spatial changes,
    tourism employment and the night-time visitor economy, leading to new socio-economic
    opportunities (Cohen and Hopkins, 2019). They emphasize that the connected, automated
    vehicles behind these tourism applications could indeed leapfrog to urban areas
    in the Global South. These positive aspects of automated mobility sit in contrast
    to some barriers and risks arising from the literature. Firstly, automated mobility
    faces infrastructural barriers that are both digital (lack of internet connectivity)
    and material (lack of roads). There is a legitimate concern that most urban areas
    in Africa do not have the requisite ICT systems to facilitate automated mobility.
    Statistics on global internet access for 2019 noted that Africa as a whole had
    a penetration rate of only 39.3%, the lowest among all geographic continents (Yarik,
    2020). And when the internet or digital apps are accessible in Africa, they are
    often expensive and unaffordable; digital markets sit within monopolies with few
    (often unfair) providers; or they lack adequate bandwidth or maintenance (Ocorian,
    2019) also see (A4AI 2020). Lack of infrastructure such as roads, highways, and
    bridges is another impediment, with all four case cities known for having poor
    quality of roads and underfinanced road networks. (Sudmant et al., 2017) note
    that only 12% of roads in Kigali were paved even though the urban stock of private
    cars more than doubled. In Kigali less than 1% of the roads are constructed with
    granite-pavers, and the rest is rough dirt (Niyonsenga, 2018, (Ikioda, 2016) notes
    that Lagos has only about 5500 km of tarred roads for a city of more than 20 million
    people. And that due to widespread migration and settlements expanding outside
    of the metropolitan borders of the city, road developments have been slow to catch
    up with the city''s population needs. These infrastructural challenges contribute
    to constrain the feasibility of automated mobility in the near-term. 3.2. Electrification
    and electric mobility The literature on electrification of mobility in our four
    urban areas was more extensive than automated mobility, although it also identifies
    a mix of positive drivers and negative barriers. Firstly, because our four urban
    areas are still investing in infrastructure, they could have fewer path dependencies
    and sunk costs related to electrification. With a majority of roads or urban infrastructure
    still yet to be built, the thinking is that if governments decided to, they could
    invest now (and leapfrog) into a future where EV is the dominant mode of transport.
    For example, Alsalman et al. (2021) revealed that refuelling/charging stations
    would be a critical investment that urban planners could make now (Alsalman et
    al., 2021). And that doing so would lock in lower carbon forms of mobility for
    generations to come. There would also be the ability to incorporate African led
    design into newer vehicles, making them more suited and adaptable to African urban
    contexts, including vehicle specifications, payload capacities, and aesthetics
    (Nur, 2020). Secondly, for better or worse, private automobiles are becoming embedded
    into the norms and lifestyles of many African urban communities. Battery electric
    vehicles can thus help “normalize” low-carbon mobility by delivering automobility
    similar to the conventional cars they are replacing (Kester et al., 2020) and
    (Campbell et al. (2019) affirms this particularly for Nairobi, noting that it
    is becoming a car dependent society and thus place-based accessibility via cars
    is strongly preferred (amid autocentric lifestyles and norms). This preference
    for cars also explains, in part, the non-adoption of bus rapid transit across
    Nigeria and South Africa. (Rajé et al., 2018) supports this benefit of EVs conforming
    to conventional notions of automobility by noting very high adoption rates in
    automobiles for Nairobi, with growth rates almost doubling for some years. Scorcia
    and Munoz-Raskin (2019) note similar trends for Johannesburg, which due in part
    to apartheid is a city of low density and spatial patterns where the poor reside
    very far from work or school, leading to travel demands with long, unidirectional
    trips well suited to private cars. A similar trend is observed in Lagos, where
    people drive frequently and also commute longer distances (making it difficult
    or impossible to walk or cycle) (Maduekwe et al., 2020). The authors note, for
    instance, that 60% of residents travel 15.1 to 30 km daily for work. Cultural
    associations, preferences and behaviours of car drivers are some of the critical
    issues around car-based mobility. Others include freedom, individual identity
    and modernity, coupled with skills requirements and assumptions of transport planners,
    as well as the technical capabilities of car manufacturers, suppliers, and repair
    shops in these countries (Magnusson et al., 2020; Geels and Schot, 2007). EVs
    can also capture, nurture, support and affirm these aspects of autocentric transport.
    Thirdly, and somewhat counterintuitively to the point about EVs embedding automobility,
    is that there are niche markets for other forms of e-mobility. For example, e-bikes
    and e-scooters could possibly thrive. (Temble et al. ., 2020) emphasizes that
    the urban poor in Nairobi simply walk—they do not use cars or even mass transit.
    This could offer an appealing niche market in the form of low-cost e-bikes, a
    more affordable and available technology that has taken off among the urban poor
    in China (Lin et al., 2017; also see Lin et al., 2018). A study on Nairobi found
    a strong preference for ownership of motorcycles rather than private cars or the
    use of buses (Olajide et al. 2018) (see Fig. 5). Such motorcycles (and e-bikes,
    if they replace them) have the added benefit of being able to move more quickly
    through congested areas of cars (as they can maneuver in smaller spaces), and
    for having generally lower fuel and operating costs than private cars. Download

    Prolific use and adoption of motorcycle in Nairobi, Kenya. (Source: (Olajide et
    al. 2018)) Another niche market could be the electrification of buses. Although
    existing bus networks are insufficient to meet the mobility needs of all urban
    areas and residents, those that do exist are heavily utilized. (Temble et al.
    2019) documents how Nairobi''s Kenyan Bus Service, despite being underfunded and
    privatized, still offers millions of daily commuting trips per day. Mogaji (2020)
    notes that because religion is such an important part of life in Lagos, Nigeria,
    with a large Christian and Muslim population, thousands of worshippers travel
    to worship centres every day (Mogaji, 2020). This presents an opportunity for
    a niche market for fleets of church vehicles or for church parking lots to aggregate
    EVs in the form of community-scale vehicle-to-grid projects (Sovacool et al.,
    2020). These probable positive aspects of electrification sit alongside equally
    salient negative barriers. The first is perhaps the most obvious barrier of electricity
    supply itself. The electrification rate in SSA is far from universal, even in
    urban areas. And when there is electricity, access is not always guaranteed; neither
    is the electricity reliable or affordable. This barrier emphasizes that the availability,
    accessibility, reliability, and transmission losses of electricity that have plagued
    the continent''s energy supply need to be assessed before EVs can be adopted (Ayetor
    et al., 2021). Not only does 47% of Rwanda''s population lack electricity access,
    there are persistent power failures and the grid is also unstable (Brönner et
    al., 2020). Sovacool et al. (2019) reveals that only about 6% of electricity generation
    is used by households in Kenya (Sovacool et al., 2019). The high costs of electricity
    were also identified as barrier to electric vehicle diffusion in Johannesburg
    (and Cape Town) (Becker et al., 2020). A second barrier relates to affordability
    concerns, not over fuel or electricity, but the capital cost of an EV itself,
    which remains more expensive than most fossil-fuelled private cars. This makes
    a private purchase of an EV extremely costly, especially in situations where,
    for example, about 40.1% of Nigerians still live below the poverty line (Dioha
    et al., 2019). Nairobi is similarly struggling with very high rates of urban poverty,
    with Fig. 6 showing very low housing quality (slums, incomes of less than 1300
    KES, or US$12/month) to low housing quality (social housing, planned estates,
    incomes of less than 2165 KES, US$20/month) throughout the city (Campbell et al.,
    2019). It would be impossible for any such homes to afford their own EV. The trends
    in Kigali are similar, with 80% of the population residing in informal neighborhoods
    and 60% of the population employed in the informal sector; per capita income for
    the entire year is still only about US$650 (Sudmant et al., 2017). In Rwanda,
    poverty is such a stark barrier that many urban poor and especially recent immigrants
    cannot afford bus fares in other cities, such as Kampala (Vermeiren et al., 2015).
    This also implies that EV markets are well beyond their reach. This could be why
    when Onokala and Olajide (2020) discussed the use of electric vehicles for reducing
    air pollution from vehicles in developing countries such as Nigeria, they noted
    that only a few electric vehicles are used in Lagos roads (Onokala and Olajide,
    2020). Download : Download high-res image (462KB) Download : Download full-size

    Source: (Campbell et al., 2019). Thirdly, for those who can afford a private personal
    EV in our case cities, it would do little to ameliorate traffic congestion. In
    large volumes such EVs would substantially contribute to traffic congestion. (Ibitayo,
    2012) writes how in Lagos high numbers of vehicle breakdowns create a cause-and-effect
    feedback loop for traffic jams: the breakdowns create delays that then cause other
    vehicles to overheat and breakdown, leading to further delays. In Nairobi, congestion
    is just as severe, with 98% of the present mini-bus and bus routes (including
    intercity and intracity bus routes) starting from and terminating at the very
    congested Central Business District (CBD) and downtown areas, adding to the congestion
    challenge (Nakagawa et al., 2018). A recent study by Fraser et al. estimated transport
    time from road traffic collisions sites to level 4 (and above) medical facilities
    . The study found that even ambulances experience difficulties in clearing congestion
    to get to hospitals and health clinics (Fraser et al., 2020). 3.3. Ridesharing
    and bike-sharing The literature was slightly more extensive on ridesharing and
    bike-sharing than automated mobility, but slightly less extensive than electric
    vehicles. We again see positive and negative aspects identified. First, the literature
    suggests that many communities in each of our four urban areas are familiar (and
    therefore comfortable) with ridesharing in the form of mass transit. In addition,
    many African major cities are accustomed to group rapid transit (GRT), personal
    rapid transit (PRT), and demand responsive transport (DRT) systems. Furthermore,
    there are various types of tram and bus technologies, such as single-deck, double-deck,
    and articulated buses/coaches, and trolley buses. Public transportation systems
    in many fast-growing cities of Africa are dominated by informal paratransit services,
    a form of ridesharing. On the African continent, they are called by several local
    names, including Matatus (Kenya), Combis (South Africa), Cars Rapides and Ndiaga
    Ndiaye (Senegal), troto (Ghana), and Molues and Danfo (Nigeria), to name a few
    (Agyemang, 2020). For example, paratransit modes such as minibuses play a valuable
    role in South African transport (Woolf and Joubert, 2013). Ridesharing norms are
    already entrenched in Johannesburg via minibus taxis, Metrobuses, Metrorail and
    Rea Vaya BRT journeys (Lionjanga and Venter, 2018). Taxi transport remains popular
    throughout South Africa, accounting for about 60% of the market, with an estimated
    130,000 of these vehicles in operation countrywide (Groenewald, 2003). Vanderschuren
    noted how in South Africa over 65% of people can reach minibus taxi services within
    5 min which is, essentially, what traditional taxi services provide. However,
    minibus taxi services serve various users at the same time. More recent options,
    such as UberPool and other more sustainable ride-sharing options that encourage
    increased car occupancy through the combination of ride request along the same
    corridor, include this feature (Vanderschuren and Baufeldt, 2018). Nairobi commuters
    have also been exposed to many forms of ridesharing especially via paratransit
    options and minibuses, often 14 seaters, called matatus, which are privately owned
    and operated by individuals or cooperatives. In the city, the majority of people
    rely on the paratransit system, which accounts for 40.7% of all trips (Campbell
    et al., 2019). Relatedly, ridesharing and bike sharing can help supplement walking,
    another dominant mode of transport within the urban areas. (Rajé et al., 2018)
    note that because walking avoids the expense of owning a car and is suitable for
    short distance trips, up to half the population of Nairobi tends to walk for their
    mobility needs at least some of the time (e.g., weather permitting). Motorization
    rates in Kigali are also low, with almost half (45%) of trips made by walking
    or cycling (Sudmant et al., 2017). These options have the added benefit of not
    contributing significantly to traffic congestion, air pollution, or expenditures
    on imported fuel. Municipal and national governments in Rwanda have demonstrated
    their capacities for innovation and implementation in this sector by sponsoring
    wide pedestrian walkways and promoting car-free zones in the city centre—options
    that could also be tweaked to incentivize ridesharing. Audikana suggests in particular
    that bike-sharing technology is critical in determining the economic sustainability
    of urban mobility patterns (Audikana et al., 2017). Bikesharing business is a
    typical scenario of technological innovation and competitiveness (Radzimski and
    Dzięcielski, 2021). In South Africa, at least, parallel development of cycling
    facilities is a pleasing concession to slower, healthier and less carbon-intensive
    transport (Pirie, 2013). Doherty (2020) revealed the potential of boda boda motorcycle
    taxis with both ride-hailing apps and with municipal reforms in Uganda. Boda bodas
    are motorcycle taxis driven primarily by young men. Nationally, 1.7 million people,
    or 7% of the Ugandan population, received part, or all, of their livelihood from
    this industry (Doherty, 2020). Shibayama and Emberger (2020) study the operation
    of matatus in Kenya, in that traditional taxis run on predetermined routes with
    a possible limited deviations of routes on demand of passengers, while the routes
    of shared taxi rides fully depend on passengers (Shibayama and Emberger, 2020).
    These positive drivers of ridesharing reside alongside some negative obstacles.
    Firstly, the sustainability benefits of ridesharing are not guaranteed, they depend
    on how schemes are implemented, and in some contexts could lead to more traffic
    and emissions through “rebounds” (Axsen and Sovacool, 2019), especially if ridesharing
    displaces more active walking or cycling. Shams et al. (2020) suggest the contributions
    of carsharing as a new mode of transportation only add (rather than remove) complexity
    to the socio-economic system (Shams Esfandabadi et al., 2020). This is troubling
    given that most forms of mobility are carbon intensive, implying that an increase
    in ridesharing would merely increase the amount of time petrol and fossil fuelled
    vehicles remain in use. Saidi and Hammami (2017) calculated greenhouse gas emissions
    from road transport in South Africa and Lesotho between 2000 and 2009. The authors
    found that road transport carbon dioxide emissions, estimated at 43.5 million
    tons in South Africa, increased by approximately 2.6% yearly between 2000 and
    2009. And that in South Africa, the motorcars and trucks produced 70.6% of the
    total road transport emissions (Saidi and Hammami, 2017). Second, although some
    norms are emerging in favor of ridesharing, other norms exist against it, and
    bike-sharing. (Morgan, 2020) notes that in Johannesburg, bike-sharing options
    have so far only been able to capture about 0.5% of mobility needs (reflected
    in the latest household travel survey). Then, of those who cycle, it tends to
    be working class, fairly wealthy men—not exactly a representative sample. (Wood,
    2020) argue that bike-sharing in Johannesburg is a failed innovation that has
    been “non-adopted” especially given that 90% of those cycling are classified as
    leisure cyclists, and only 10% cycle for commuting to work or taking non-leisure
    trips. Thirdly, and in tandem with affordability concerns for automated vehicles
    and electric mobility, poverty is a barrier to ridesharing and bike-sharing. Even
    though such options are generally more affordable than cars, the four urban areas
    still have low affordability levels, especially those households in chronic poverty.
    Even less capital-intensive bike-sharing schemes would still “require substantial
    subsidies to work” including adequate remuneration for things like bike storage,
    staffing, lighting and security (Wood 2020). Consumer behaviours are changing
    towards adoption of car-sharing, and ride-hailing, cycling and scooters are much
    more unique and commonly used in Rwanda and South Africa, while light-duty vehicles
    are used in Kenya. However, in Lagos, Nigeria, the use of petrol fuel transit
    vehicles, tricycles, and bike-share is widely adopted. 4. Discussion: implications
    for sustainability transitions research and policy Even though this study was
    intended to offer an empirical contribution more than one connecting with theories
    of mobility and transport or conceptual debates, it still enhances our view of
    transport planning and policy (making a policy contribution) and connects with
    emerging thinking about prominent theories. 4.1. Spatial, cultural and historical
    specificity First, our review offers insight into the specific regional context
    of African energy and mobility transitions (or more relevantly its ongoing transition,
    or lack of it, to electric mobility and low-carbon transport). This is a welcome
    contribution because it enables other researchers to better connect place-specific
    notions of geography and space to sustainability transitions, to better comprehend
    the spatial differentiation of transitions and the power relations they entail
    (Lawhon and Murphy, 2012); Köhler et al., 2019; Sovacool et al., 2020). Our study
    facilitates those hoping to analyze the relationships between the “locations,
    landscapes and territorializations associated with a low-carbon energy transition”
    (Bridge et al., 2013: 337). It also builds the evidence base for those researchers
    seeking to grapple with the socio-political regimes present within developing
    countries that can shape and intertwine with the development or deployment of
    specific technologies (Swilling et al., 2016). Our results therefore have topical
    or geographic relevance for indicating how African transitions to mobility are
    being perceived by different groups of actors. Put another way, there is no uniform
    set of preferences—we see considerable variation cross demographic, spatial, and
    political attributes of our selected cities. This enables one to better ground
    ongoing transport and mobility transitions in Sub-Saharan Africa more properly
    within its historical and spatial dimensions (Baptista, 2018). 4.2. Understanding
    African adoption and diffusion patterns Second, our results can inform approaches
    attempting to model or predict transport and energy consumption profiles, diffusion
    patterns, or psychological processes. In developing their own model of sustainability
    orientated values, Axsen and Kurani (2013) did not look at demographic conceptualizations
    of identity (such as gender, nationality, or cultural norms), but acknowledge
    their potential importance in influencing preferences. Our results show how grander,
    broader technology curves can break into more discrete, heterogeneous classes
    of users and adopters that cut across spatial scales (neighborhoods, blocks of
    flats, slums, informal settlements) and household types (large vs. small families,
    employment patterns that depend on commuting, etc.). Our findings suggest that
    we must unpack the “individual” or the “adopter” or the “African household” to
    be more than just an automaton who rationally calculates cost or efficacy in these
    (and other) models. We open up the complexity of users and the ability for emerging
    innovations to impact them in complex ways—across space (urban and rural dimensions),
    time (immediate to distant benefits), and risk (the coupling of drivers and barriers,
    benefits and costs). 4.3. Deepening sustainability transitions theories and frameworks
    Third, and finally, our results deepen ongoing discussions and conceptual debates
    within sustainability transitions (Loorbach et al., 2017). Within that literature,
    values and culture are seen as operating across multiple scales (such as niches
    and regimes) (Schot and Geels, 2008). Social norms, values, and culture are even
    seen at times to be direct barriers that hinder innovation or create institutional
    failures (Matthias and Rohracher, 2012; Turnheim and Sovacool, 2020). Instead,
    our study shows how demographic attributes, culture, and patterns of injustice
    and inequity can be factors that influence behavioral antecedents or preferences
    for sustainable forms of mobility. For instance, African transport systems may
    have greater degrees of hybridization that blend together forms of mobility or
    different technologies. As one example, the aboboyaa, a three-wheeled vehicle
    is locally perceived in Ghana as a hybrid identity, occupying the border of two
    technological artifacts, the motorbike and the truck (Nur, 2020). Paratransit
    schemes are also seen by many throughout Sub-Saharan Africa as hybrid infrastructures
    blending together private and public forms of mobility (Joubert and Venter, 2020).
    African transport systems also open up debates about transformation vs. incrementalism.
    On the one hand, there is a case that the dynamics of innovation and policy design
    themselves may need harnessed differently, with much more focus on transformation.
    According to Table 4, one dominant frame promotes innovation for growth. This
    framing makes an important submission about the consensus which suggests that
    the state should play an active role in financing scientific research on the premise
    that new scientific discoveries on urban mobility, in this case in Sub-Saharan
    Africa that would ripple into practice through applied research and development
    by the private sector on design and innovation mobility that would be centered
    on peculiarity of African cities (Pisoni et al., 2019) also see (Dahle, 2007).
    Table 4. Three frames, features and rationales for innovation policy. Framing
    Key features Policy rationale Innovation for growth Science and technology for
    growth, promoting production and consumption. Responding to market failure: public
    good character of innovation necessitates state action. National systems of innovation
    Importance of knowledge systems in development and uptake of innovations. Responding
    to system failure: maintaining competitiveness, coordinating system actors. Transformative
    change Alignment of social and environmental challenges with innovation objectives.
    Responding to transformation failure: pathways, coordination domains, experimentation
    and learning. Sources: Schot and Steinmueller, 2018. But growth alone would not
    be enough. An argument can be made that transformative innovation policy (TIP)
    is needed. A TIP would focus on a broad acceptance that public policy should play
    a more active role in new innovation systems in mobility, and it would also suggest
    research that is more responsive to social and environmental challenges, alongside
    economic growth objectives (Schot and Steinmueller, 2018; Daniels et al., 2020).
    Our analysis therefore offers insight on the need to strengthen the research and
    development complex within Sub-Saharan African countries, since the present methods
    for delivering its science, technology and innovation policy cannot offer the
    required drivers for addressing its environmental and social challenges, this
    includes green mobility. On the other hand, transport systems in the Global South,
    especially within informal settlements, may have greater degrees of oscillation
    between disruption and incrementalism, a focus on smaller, cumulative minor modifications
    resulting from the continuous input of commuters or travellers. In many Sub-Saharan
    African planning contexts including South Africa, incrementalism and minimalism
    are pivotal principles, not transformation (Geyer et al., 2011). Indeed, Loor
    and Evans (2021: 5) even write that “incrementalism epitomises the capacity of
    informal settlements dwellers to make use of their abilities and resources to
    maintain their space functional” via creative forms of mobility. A third and final
    example relates to leapfrogging, skipping over a stage of technical development
    or a particular problem to pursue instead a more advanced option. The classic
    example relevant in an African context is their ability to leapfrog landline telephone
    systems by investing in mobile phone and wireless systems instead; an energy relevant
    example is leapfrogging past fossil fuels or centralized diesel power plants to
    solar panels or wind farms (Szabó et al., 2013). Such leapfrogging, at least in
    the domain of energy systems, has already been shown to significantly reduce the
    energy intensity of economies, lower pollution, and even create greater economic
    opportunity (Liddle and Huntington, 2021). Cavoli (2021) suggests that in rapidly
    growing cities, especially those in the Global South, leapfrogging can involve
    not only the substitution of technologies (better performing ones to inferior
    ones) but also cross-sectoral collaboration and system thinking, where communities
    leapfrog in their planning or their approaches to urban governance. Leapfrogging
    strategies relevant for transport in such cities can also focus on prioritizing
    active travel or collective transport modes, rather than merely cars or roads.
    Leapfrogging can relate to integration at the level of ministries or government
    action on mobility, and it can also focus on visions and vision-led planning rather
    than reacting to shorter term political cycles. Broader social changes and contexts—the
    prevalence of hybridization, a proclivity for incrementalism, leapfrogging, the
    ability to afford a car, transient unemployment, living in an area with traffic
    congestion, having access to an electricity network or the internet—may hold just
    as much salience as innovation patterns or infrastructure in explaining transition
    patterns. An implication here is that processes affecting sociotechnical change
    manifest themselves not only on national and global scales, but at more micro
    individual, interpersonal, household, and intra-city levels. 5. Conclusion: harnessing
    innovation for low-carbon mobility What are we to make of these conflicting drivers,
    barriers, and overall trends and dynamics? This final section of the paper draws
    inductively and qualitatively from our results to focus on three insights: one
    about tradeoffs, one about coupling, and one about innovation. First, as Table
    5 summarizes, the possible benefits of our three innovations exist only juxtaposed
    next to negative barriers; no innovation is purely positive or negative and all
    of them have multiple dimensions of positivity and negativity. There are thus
    (tragically) tensions within each of the innovation options that could see improvements
    in sustainability or affordability but also the exacerbation of dilemmas and problems.
    For instance, high car ownership in South Africa could be a precursor for EVs,
    but also mitigates the potential of ridesharing or AVs because they lead to increased
    congestion and traffic jams. Two-wheelers could be electrified and thus better
    for the climate and environment than fossil-fueled ones,but would also contribute
    to motorized transport (rather than walking or cycling) and the risk of accidents.
    Walking and cycling may be the most affordable options for low-income households
    and residents but would preclude those households from accessing many of the benefits
    to motorized transport or the ability to commute for longer distances (Campbell
    et al., 2019). If access to transport modes is limited by income, then a first
    order condition might be for more equitable access to all three of our innovations.
    Table 5. The positive drivers and negative barriers facing automated mobility,
    electrification, and ridesharing in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Innovation Positive drivers
    Negative barriers Automated mobility and self-driving cars • Perceptions of improved
    safety • Ability for aerial drones to bypass congestion (esp. for medical drones)
    • New forms of economic activity (e.g., enhanced efficiency of freight delivery,
    expanded tourism) • Nonexistent or expensive digital infrastructure • Lack of
    paved roads and poor maintenance of existing road networks Electrification and
    electric mobility • Ability to leapfrog into EV infrastructure or incorporate
    African design principles • Compatibility with autocentric lifestyles • Attractive
    niche markets for e-bikes and two-wheelers (for walkers or cyclists), e-buses
    (for mass transit) or fleets (for churches) • Contribution of EVs to traffic congestion
    • Lack of reliable electricity supply or distribution • Higher capital costs of
    vehicles and affordability concerns • Increased accident risks for two-wheelers
    and scooters Ridesharing and bike-sharing • Familiarity with ridesharing via existing
    mass or public transit schemes and taxis • Can supplement walking • Far more affordable
    than owning a private vehicle • Possible rebounds and increases in travel use
    and associated impacts • Strong norms in some areas against cycling or bike-sharing
    • Affordability concerns for those in chronic poverty • Lack of safety for cyclists
    (and two-wheelers when shared) Source: Authors. Second, although we have treated
    each of the three innovations as fairly isolated from one another, there are emergent
    (and potentially strong) couplings or entanglements between them, such as the
    energy system (for EVs) and the mass transit system (for ridesharing), or digital
    networks (for automated mobility or some of the apps needed for ridesharing) or
    the housing system (which determines where people reside and thus their travel
    and commuting needs). As Fig. 7 also depicts, each of the three innovations can
    catalyze or enhance the adoption of the other two innovations, e.g. automated
    vehicles can also be electrified; ridesharing can rely on electrified vehicles
    and both can in turn influence automation (Sovacool et al., 2020). There is even
    a term used in some of the literature to describe coupling all three innovations
    together: Autonomous, connected, electric shared vehicles (ACES) (Adler et al.,
    2019). Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Positive interconnections and couplings between electrification,
    automation, and ridesharing. Source: Authors. AV = automated vehicle. However,
    if such coupling and future innovation is to reshape the transition into low-emission
    technology in an African context, despite decades of bearing the brunt of costly
    policy failure, then the three particular innovations of automation, electrification,
    and ridesharing need to be steered towards growth and transformation. Overall,
    the literature offers a sober critique of failed policy transfer and of policy
    transfer agents who are at times seen as cynical sellers of transport solutions
    without enough understanding of context and appropriateness. International best
    practice will not work if local context and culture are not respected and incorporated,
    if bicycle lanes are to avoid being “empty” (Gota et al., 2019), if electric vehicle
    charging stations are to avoid sitting derelict and abandoned. More insight will
    be needed to evaluate how technology transfer happens, in what context, under
    what conditions, and to what degree of success, especially in conditions of poverty
    and limited resources such as those facing our four urban areas. Such an evidence
    base could link policy outcomes with learning, paying greater attention to collaborative
    research efforts, joint learning, and community acceptance (Dlugosch et al., 2020).
    There also remains a need for evidence-based programs to make the case for high-volume,
    low-carbon transport in Sub-Saharan African countries to show that a context-appropriate
    shift can reduce emissions as well as meet development and mobility needs. Perhaps
    researchers and planners must begin to reject the tacit assumption that innovations
    and socio-technical transitions will necessarily come from the Global North (Alessandrini
    et al., 2015). In some contexts, hybridization, transformation, incrementalism
    and leapfrogging are seen as positive attributes and desirable characteristics
    of planning and technology adoption, but in others they may not be. African transport
    planners and researchers need not always look to the Global North for innovations,
    as evident by the uneven adoption and scope for automated mobility, electric mobility,
    and ridesharing across our four case studies. Perhaps regions and cities in Africa
    and the wider Global South are in a position to experiment with and contribute
    to patterns of sociotechnical change that will even bring salient lessons to the
    Global North—enhancing a potential for deep mutual learning where the benefits
    of low-carbon mobility more inclusively and accountably shared among all of us.

  description: Manufacturing organisations are adopting Industry 4.0 (I40) technologies
    to automate decision making and operational tasks down the assembly line. Manufacturing
    organisations can achieve benefits at the level of capital and labour welfare
    through a more optimised production process, stable employment and enriched duties
    for workers. Nevertheless, the benefits of I40 adoption produce on the capital
    could be detrimental for the labour welfare. I40 automation can lead to job disruption,
    impoverishment of workforce roles and expertise along the production process.
    There is a lack of studies that explores how organisations adopt I40 technologies
    to reach a fair balance between capital and labour welfare benefits because management
    privileges the I40 automation potential over the workforce role in I40 adoption.
    We address this gap by conducting a single case study of the Italian production
    branch of an international manufacturing organisation adopting I40 technologies.
    The results show that organisations achieve a fair balance between capital and
    labour welfare benefits by deploying I40 technologies with a worker-centric approach.
    I40 assembly line operates with a sociotechnical interplay between technologies
    and workers. I40 technologies automate repetitive and dangerous activities, and
    workers reduce routine work and enrich their duties taking on supervision activities
    on the assembly line. To this end, workers are trained to acquire digital competencies
    and maintain a higher level of knowledge of the production activities.

    Nevertheless, the benefits of I40 adoption produce on the capital could be detrimental
    for the labour welfare. I40 automation can lead to job disruption, impoverishment
    of workforce roles and expertise along the production process. There is a lack
    of studies that explores how organisations adopt I40 technologies to reach a fair
    balance between capital and labour welfare benefits because management privileges
    the I40 automation potential over the workforce role in I40 adoption. We address
    this gap by conducting a single case study of the Italian production branch of
    an international manufacturing organisation adopting I40 technologies. The results
    show that organisations achieve a fair balance between capital and labour welfare
    benefits by deploying I40 technologies with a worker-centric approach. I40 assembly
    line operates with a sociotechnical interplay between technologies and workers.
    I40 technologies automate repetitive and dangerous activities, and workers reduce
    routine work and enrich their duties taking on supervision activities on the assembly
    line. To this end, workers are trained to acquire digital competencies and maintain
    a higher level of knowledge of the production activities. Previous article in

    organisations are automating assembly lines adopting advanced digital technologies
    – Internet of Things, robotics, big data analytics, 3D printing – under the push
    of innovation programmes named Industry 4.0 (I40) (Kagermann, Wolfgang, & Helbig,
    2013; Kang et al., 2016). Manufacturing organisations use I40 technologies to
    innovate, exploit new market opportunities, or defend their competitive position
    against low-cost producers (L. Li, 2018; Porter & Heppelmann, 2014). In such automation,
    decision making and operational tasks pass from workers to machines (Kim, 2017;
    J. Lee, Bagheri, & Kao, 2015). Hence I40 changes the way human labour contributes
    to value generation on the assembly line (Bonekamp & Sure, 2015; Margherita &
    Braccini, 2020). The literature highlights several benefits of I40 that manufacturing
    organisations can achieve, both at the level of capital and labour welfare (Gupta,
    Kumar, & Wasan, 2021; Kumar, Singh, & Dwivedi, 2020; Shayganmehr, Kumar, Garza-Reyes,
    & Moktadir, 2021). I40 adoption supports the business capital development with
    higher productivity and higher quality products (Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2018; Kang
    et al., 2016). I40 technologies also afford reductions for energy savings, better
    resources usage, reduced downtimes and shorter lead time (Braccini & Margherita,
    2019; Ghobakhloo, Fathi, Iranmanesh, Maroufkhani, & Morales, 2021; Tortorella
    & Fettermann, 2018). I40 supports labour welfare by promoting new managing roles
    along the assembly line (Romero, Stahre, & Taisch, 2020; Romero et al., 2016).
    I40 adoption also supports labour welfare by moving workers far from hard-muscular
    tasks (Erol, Jäger, Hold, Ott, & Sihn, 2016; Shamim, Cang, Yu, & Li, 2016). Finally,
    I40 technologies may help in reducing performance conflicts between workers and
    supervisors due to the availability of fine-grained data on operations (Kiel,
    Muller, Arnold, & Voigt, 2017; D. Li, Fast-Berglund, & Paulin, 2019). However,
    the benefits I40 technologies produce on the capital side could be detrimental
    for the labour welfare (Wang & Siau, 2019). I40 automation may lead to the reduction
    of job positions as a consequence of the extensive replacement of human labour
    with machines (Chin, Jiao, & Jawahar, 2019; Frey & Osborne, 2017; Haleem & Javaid,
    2019) also for decision-making activities (Bonekamp & Sure, 2015; Nurazwa, Seman,
    & Shamsuddin, 2019). Even when I40 technologies do not fully replace the workforce,
    the management can reduce the role of the workforce in assembly lines due to the
    lack of digital competencies to manage these technologies (Bonekamp & Sure, 2015).
    Finally I40 adoption may keep workers far from operations reducing their accumulation
    of knowledge on the transformation process and reducing in turn their performance
    (Bednar & Welch, 2020; Burton-Jones, 2014). The rationale of the benefits produced
    by I40 is the pivotal role that I40 technologies have on the automation of the
    assembly line. Thus organisations may have an incentive to push automation to
    seek capital benefits (Wang & Siau, 2019) and face the ethical dilemma of pushing
    too much towards capital investments damaging labour welfare. To develop their
    business ethically manufacturing organisations should deploy I40 technologies
    fairly towards capital and labour (Trentesaux & Caillaud, 2020; Trentesaux & Karnouskos,
    2021), seeking a fair balance between extensive automation and labour (Gabriel
    & Pessel, 2016; Stock & Seliger, 2016). However, current literature exploring
    I40 technologies adopts a technocentric perspective focusing on performance benefits
    achievable by the optimized deployment of I40 technologies (Hooker & Kim, 2019;
    Kang et al., 2016; Wright & Schultz, 2018). In this paper, we address this gap
    by conducting an exploratory single case study of the Italian production branch
    of an international manufacturing organisation that undertook I40 adoption, reaching
    a fair balance between the benefits of capital and labour welfare. We address
    the following research question: \"How does a manufacturing organisation adopting
    Industry 4.0 support a fair capital-labour welfare balance in a fair ethical business
    development?\" We contribute to the literature by showing that a fair balance
    between benefits on capital and labour welfare in I40 adoption is possible. We
    then illustrate how I40 technologies are deployed for a fair ethical business
    development, pinpointing the automated activities and the enriched duties of the
    workforce that compensate for the reduction of their activities. Finally, we show
    managerial solutions to prepare workers for their novel role. We structured the
    paper as follows. First, we describe in the theoretical background the I40 initiative,
    the concept of fairness in ethical business development, the fair capital-labour
    welfare development in I40 adoption and its challenges in section 2. Section 3
    is devoted to the research design. We describe the case study in section 4, and
    we portray the fair balance between benefits on capital and labour welfare. In
    section 5, we discuss our findings against the literature proposing four theoretical
    propositions and reflecting on implications for research and practice. Finally,
    we conclude the study in section 6. 2. Theoretical background In this paper, we
    explore how organisations can adopt I40 with for a fair balance between capital
    and labour welfare benefits. In this regard, our paper refers to I40 technologies
    and their innovation potential for fair business development in manufacturing
    organisations. Thus, the current section is divided into three subsections in
    which we respectively (i) conceptualise the role of I40 technologies for manufacturing
    organisations, (ii) outline the concept of fair ethical business development,
    and (iii) elaborate on the role of I40 technologies for a fair capital-labour
    welfare development. 2.1. Innovating manufacturing with industry 4.0 The term
    I40 derives from the German term \"Industrie 4.0\" and was mentioned in public
    for the first time at the \"Hannover trade fair\" in 2011 in Germany (Kagermann
    et al., 2013). I40 is an industrial plan, developed consequently by all modern
    manufacturing economies, that promotes the adoption of enabling digital technologies
    along the assembly line of manufacturing organisation to optimize the production
    process (Aceto, Persico, & Pescapé, 2020; Dalenogare, Benitez, Yala, & Frank,
    2018; L. Li, 2018). I40 programs concern the deployment of advanced enabling digital
    technologies in assembly lines: • Internet of Things: it is used to integrate
    physical objects – such as pieces of machinery or materials – into computer-based
    systems to collect and communicate data in real-time among systems and humans
    (de Sousa Jabbour, Jabbour, Foropon, & Filho, 2018; Kang et al., 2016). Internet
    of Things technologies make use of tags (such as barcodes, QR codes or RFIDs),
    sensors and controllers to collect data from machinery. • Robotics: a heterogeneous
    set of automatic or semi-automatic machinery that can perform tasks without human
    supervision or collaborate with human tasks (Haleem & Javaid, 2019). • Cloud manufacturing:
    a virtual network that connects different supply chain actors affording for the
    storage and exchange of large volumes of data and on resources sharing on-demand
    through an internet-connected digital platform (Xu, Xu, & Li, 2018). Cloud manufacturing
    offers the assembly line actors low-cost high scalable, and high-performing solutions
    (Aceto et al., 2020). • Additive manufacturing: a set of technologies that use
    3D computer systems to design and print objects, adding layers of materials rather
    than removing materials from a solid block (Braccini & Margherita, 2019; Haleem
    & Javaid, 2019). Additive manufacturing affords fast prototyping, production,
    and customisation of products. The integration of these technologies on assembly
    lines forms cyber-physical systems, i.e. fully automated pieces of machinery that
    can be programmed with software to transform raw materials into finished products,
    and that produce a digital trace of all their operations (Kagermann et al., 2013;
    Kim, 2017). Such cyber-physical systems afford manufacturing organisations to
    automate operational and decision-making tasks – such as stopping the production
    for preventing errors or for performing maintenance tasks – on assembly lines
    that can be fully autonomous (Kim, 2017; J. Lee et al., 2015). The data produced
    by such cyber-physical systems can facilitate integration among assembly line
    actors (Kagermann et al., 2013; Müller, Buliga, & Voigt, 2018) and can be used
    to continuously improve the assembly lines. Thus, I40 assembly lines are horizontally
    and vertically integrated, allowing for virtual production and mass customization
    (Haleem & Javaid, 2019), and easy collaboration among partners within a supply
    chain (Kagermann et al., 2013; Müller, Buliga, & Voigt, 2018). 2.2. Fairness in
    ethical business development Ethical business development combines the concept
    of \"business development\" and \"business ethics\". Business development refers
    to the organisational practices on the economic system, and it represents the
    organizational attitude to create value in the production and distribution of
    goods and services (Kiel et al., 2017). In profit-oriented manufacturing organisations,
    such practices aim to economic growth and increase the organisation''s profits
    to support the business capital (Wang & Siau, 2019). Business ethics combines
    the concept of ethics, i.e. \"the strive for the good life, with oneself and others,
    in fair institutions\" (Ricoeur, 1990), with that of business development. For
    our paper, we consider ethical business development that encompasses the needs
    of the different actors involved in business organisations (Donaldson & Dunfee,
    1994). Given that the ethical approach towards capital and labour welfare depend
    on the socio-economic context in which the decision is taken (Morahan, 2015),
    in this paper we address the perspective of a fair ethical business development,
    i.e. investment decisions that seek a fair balance between capital development
    and labour welfare (Morahan, 2015; Trentesaux & Karnouskos, 2021). An organisation
    acts fairly towards labour welfare by promoting stable employment, job enrichment,
    workers satisfaction, career development, and well-being (Bowie, 1998; Michaelson,
    Pratt, Grant, & Dunn, 2014). Therefore, we consider fair the ethical business
    development that aims at balancing the benefits of capital and labour welfare
    without detriment to none of them, promoting capital benefits and maintaining
    stable and satisficing work conditions (Michaelson et al., 2014; Morahan, 2015).

    image Fig. 1. Fair Ethical Business Development of Industry 4.0 adoption I40 adoption
    supports the business capital increasing efficacy and effectiveness of processes
    through automation (Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2018; Haleem & Javaid, 2019). I40 technologies
    can be implemented down a lean production in order to reduce the lead time of
    operations and maintain constant workflow (Tortorella & Fettermann, 2018). I40
    adoption increases output quantity, product quality and reduces natural resources
    because the production experiences less downtime and more precise operations (Braccini
    & Margherita, 2019; Ghobakhloo et al., 2021). Also, the integration of data improves
    the effectiveness of managers and control activities, leading to resource savings
    (Margherita & Braccini, 2020). I40 adoption supports labour welfare by creating
    new job roles. Novel activities are required to manage I40 technologies along
    the assembly line that can be addressed by the requalification of the workforce
    and hiring new ones (Romero et al., 2020, 2016). There is also a need for project
    managers who can deal with I40 projects and work in unit related to these technologies
    and a more complex IT unit to develop and handle I40 technologies (Margherita
    & Braccini, 2020; Sony & Naik, 2019). Moreover, I40 adoption improves work conditions
    by automating hard-muscular and dangerous activities (Gabriel & Pessel, 2016;
    Sony & Naik, 2019; Xu, Xu, & Li, 2018). Still, the way of producing in an I40
    assembly line may stimulate the workforce creativity as workers can contribute
    to the continuous optimisation of the production process and development of new
    ideas for improved products, process, and services (Erol et al., 2016; Shamim
    et al., 2016). The management and decisions related to job performance are transparent
    because they are based on fine-grained operations data (Kiel et al., 2017). Workers
    can use the human-computer interface of I40 technologies to communicate with their
    colleagues, enabling knowledge sharing that sustain knowledge operations within
    the organisation (D. Li et al., 2019). 2.2.2. Challenges in achieving a fair labour-capital
    development in industry 4.0 To date, the extant literature devoted to exploring
    I40 adoption follows a technocentric perspective (Kang et al., 2016). This perspective
    privileges the role of I40 technologies over the workforce in the assembly line
    and emphasizes only the benefits on the capital side. We summarize the challenges
    that organisations encounter in a fair ethical business development through I40
    adoption to reach a fair balance between capital-labour welfare benefits in Table
    1. Table 1. Challenges to achieving fair capital-labour welfare benefits in Industry
    4.0 Challenge Reference Description Reduction of human activities in the production
    systems (Chin et al., 2019; Frey & Osborne, 2017; Haleem & Javaid, 2019; Kang
    et al., 2016) The automation produced by I40 technologies improves the production
    process and disrupts labour, replacing workers with machines, both for operational
    and decision-making activities. Workers no longer play a crucial role in the production
    system, and their lay-off allows the organisations to reduce staff cost. Marginal
    role of workers due to lack of competencies for the maintenance of I40 technologies
    (Bonekamp & Sure, 2015; Margherita & Bua, 2021; Nurazwa et al., 2019; Prause et
    al., 2017) Traditional manufacturing workers do not possess the competencies to
    deal with I40 systems. Requalify workers or hiring new ones is a challenging and
    costly strategy. Thus, organisations opt to adopt a more automated I40 application
    and reduce workforce role to support capital by improving production and reducing
    workforce development costs. Reduction of knowledge of production operations (Bednar
    & Welch, 2020; Burton-Jones, 2014; Mehri, 2006; Zuboff, 1992) I40 adoption improves
    the production process and leads to the workforce''s low performance. The automation
    of production core activities impedes workers from acquiring the proper knowledge
    to conduct effective operations and reduces the potential for creativity and innovation.
    By extending the automation to decision-making activities, I40 potentially leads
    to job disruption, especially for low-skilled workers (Kang et al., 2016; Wright
    & Schultz, 2018). The manufacturing industry has already experienced the disappearance
    of routinary jobs due to technology (Frey & Osborne, 2017). I40 continues this
    erosion, potentially automating the entire production process (Kang et al., 2016;
    Wright & Schultz, 2018). Furthermore, I40 challenges both blue and white-collar
    jobs since I40 automates both operational and decision-making activities (Bonekamp
    & Sure, 2015; Nurazwa et al., 2019). The workforce may have fewer opportunities
    to undertake a career and remain stably employed in a manufacturing organisation
    (Chin et al., 2019; Sony, 2020). The reduction of the staff cost – one of the
    higher organisational expense in manufacturing – corresponds to capital benefits
    (Sony, 2020; Wang & Siau, 2019). Traditional manufacturing workers only possess
    operational competencies to assemble products (Margherita & Bua, 2021) not adequate
    for working with I40 technologies (Bonekamp & Sure, 2015; Nurazwa et al., 2019).
    The reskilling of these workers have a huge cost, and it is risky since there
    is a significant distance between traditional and I40 digital competencies (Sony,
    2020). Even after training, workers can cause recurring maintenance issues in
    the I40 assembly line, leading to higher costs (Prause, Atari, Prause, & Atari,
    2017). Replacing these workers is challenging as well since I40 skilled workers
    are scarce and expensive on the job market. The workforce replacement also leads
    to a loss of know-how and expertise in manufacturing organisations (Margherita
    & Braccini, 2020; Sony, 2020). Therefore, the organisation can opt to impoverish
    the workforce role and leverage on extensive I40 automation to sustain productivity
    and save costs for mismanagement and workforce development (Bonekamp & Sure, 2015;
    Nurazwa et al., 2019). I40 adoption can also lead to low performance of workers
    along the assembly line because it impedes workers'' knowledge accumulation (Burton-Jones,
    2014; Malone, Laubacher, & Johns, 2011; Zuboff, 1992). Thus, workers no longer
    have proper knowledge of operations to work efficiently (Bednar & Welch, 2020).
    They are involved only in a small segment of the production process and lack visibility
    of the whole system (Mehri, 2006). These challenges open the issue of fairness
    in ethical business development as the capital benefits can be realised with worse
    workforce conditions (Wang & Siau, 2019). Acting fairly towards workers is not
    an obligation for an organisation, neither reaching a fair balance between capital
    and labour benefit. These unfair practices presented in the ethical dilemma are
    not sufficiently prevented by the law (Morahan, 2015) and I40 industrial plans.
    These plans provide funds to purchase I40 technologies without considering any
    kind of social protection for workers (Sony, 2020). Therefore, profit organisations
    are not incentivised to act fairly towards workers. Instead, they are incentivised
    to deviate and support capital at the expense of labour (Wang & Siau, 2019). Thus,
    organisations wanting to achieve a fair balance between capital-labour welfare
    benefits through I40 adoption should overpass such challenges and find a fair
    division between activities to automate and leave to the workers. 3. Research
    design We conducted a single case study analysis of the production unit of the
    Italian branch of an International electrotechnical organisation that produces
    electrical switches (ELECTRIC a fantasy name). Given the nature of the research
    and limited body of knowledge of how I40 adoption supports the organisation to
    a fair ethical business development that reaches a fair balance between capital
    and labour welfare benefits. The case study approach is the most suitable methodology
    for the empirical investigation. The case study is appropriate when investigating
    a poorly researched phenomenon and where data required for formulating hypotheses
    have not yet been obtained (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2018). Exploratory case studies
    typically address how and why questions (Yin, 2018) concerning the dynamics present
    within a particularly contextual setting to develop initial understandings (Eisenhardt,
    1989; Yin, 2018). The case study is well-accepted in the IS literature when the
    studies discuss the societal transformation enabled by technologies (Benbasat,
    Goldstein, & Mead, 1987; Braccini & Margherita, 2019; Seidel, Recker, & vom Brock,
    2013). Specifically, the single case study is appropriate if the case under scrutiny
    is critical, extreme, unique and revelatory (Dube & Pare, 2003). The single case
    study claims for analytic generalization of the phenomenon that allows for the
    development of theoretical propositions that can be statistically tested in future
    studies (Yin, 2018). 3.1. Case selection We consider the case of ELECTRIC as a
    revelatory case study (Dubé & Paré, 2003; Yin, 2018) for four reasons: 1 ELECTRIC
    is the first mover in its competitive domain to undertake a fair ethical business
    development of I40 technologies in 2017. In addition, the organisation was ranked
    among the best employers in Italy by a distinguished national newspaper and received
    a prize for corporate social responsibility. 2 In 2019, ELECTRIC supported capital
    by doubling production. At the same time, it supports labour welfare by defending
    employment levels and foster enriched work and better work conditions. This evidence
    confirmed that the organisation reached a fair balance between the benefits of
    capital and labour welfare. Thus, it provided a suitable context for the study.
    3 The production process of ELECTRIC is labour-intensive, and the organisation''s
    management is very attentive to sustain labour welfare. The organisation has implemented
    ISO 9001, ISO 45001, and the certifications OHSAS 18001 and ISO 45001 to manage
    safety within the plant. It has a long-standing commitment to community engagement
    by providing impactful support for community-building initiatives across three
    pillars: education, diversity and inclusion, and care in the community. Also,
    the organisation adopted many pieces of I40 technologies in a fair manner in various
    units. Therefore, this context is prominent to explore how the management addresses
    the challenges to reach a fair balance between the benefits of capital and labour
    welfare. 4 ELECTRIC is the leader of a manufacturing cluster for the deployment
    of I40 plants in Italy. ELECTRIC serves as a model for studying pilot projects
    that other organisations eventually adopt in the cluster in a fair manner. 3.2.
    Data collection We followed Yin''s principles (2018) concerning data collection.
    One of the researchers spent two full days in November 2019 visiting the organisation
    invited by the public relation officer. He collected 17 semi-structured interviews
    of key informants of the fair ethical business development of I40 adoption. Such
    key informants include both the management and the workers (4 women and 13 men).
    He first approached the public relation officer of the company to introduce the
    research objective and to receive a first overview of the I40 adoption in the
    organization. The public relation officer introduced him to the management who
    participated in the fair ethical business development of I40 adoption as members
    of the steering committee. Also, the management put the researcher in contact
    with a worker supervisor from the assembly line involved in the I40 adoption.
    Separately he also reached out and interviewed three more workers - one worker
    supervisor and two workers - involved in the I40 adoption and operating in the
    assembly line before and after the I40 adoption. We decided to interview the management
    and the workers to have a more transparent representation of I40 adoption and
    its fair ethical business development. It is also a valid strategy because the
    voices of the two groups often diverged on themes related to how work conditions
    changed after the technology adoption and the consequences of technology automation
    on the assembly line workforce (Sawyer & Jarrahi, 2014). In Table 2, we illustrate
    the details of the interviewees and their role during the I40 adoption. The interviews
    were conducted face-to-face, recorded, and transcribed. The interviews in total
    lasted for about eight hours, with varying lengths (from 15 to 60 minutes each).
    The researcher also conducted observations and took field notes on the traditional
    assembly line, the I40 assembly line, the operation of smart machines and control
    systems and the activities performed by workers. Table 2. List of interviewees

    on the assembly line before and after the I40 adoption. Products engineer 1 He
    managed the industrialisations on the I40 assembly line of new products. For conducting
    the interviews, we used a track covering the different areas mentioned by the
    I40 literature. During the interviews, we slightly adjusted the track to encompass
    the different points of view of each role related to the fair ethical business
    development of I40 adoption (Yin, 2018). The interview track is showed in Table
    3. Table 3. Interview Track Interviewees Questions Management Organizational dimensions:

    Benefits of I40 automation and technologies The management of knowledge of operations
    of workers in the I40 assembly line We triangulated secondary data sources to
    increase the reliability and validity of data (Denzin, 2006). As secondary data
    sources, we used the official balance sustainability statements of ELECTRIC, the
    official balance statement of 2018, and distinguished national newspapers articles
    reporting the outcome of the ethical business development of ELECTRIC. We include
    the official balance sustainability statement since we found a section dedicated
    to the organisation''s sustainability, which embraces social themes, including
    safety and social indicators, as the number of employees and turnover is strictly
    related to our study. We use the chamber of commerce company registration of ELECTRIC
    to acquire official data on the employment level of the production unit. 3.3.
    Data analysis For the data analysis, we combined all the interview transcriptions
    and the secondary data sources in a single research database. In total, we coded
    about 19,000 words from interviews transcriptions and field notes, and 180.620
    words from secondary data, 5.420 words from web articles and 175.200 words from
    official balance statements. We conducted data analysis using CAQDAS as a supporting
    tool. We made use of first, and second-level codes. The first coding represents
    first-level concepts that adhere faithfully to informant terms. With second-level
    coding, we aggregate these first-level concepts in categories by distinguishing
    similarities and differences among them (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). We analysed
    the data to identify how the management reaches a fair balance between capital
    and labour welfare benefits. The research follows an inductive approach following
    qualitative inquiry principles to maintain methodological rigour (Corbin & Strauss,
    2015). Only one of the two authors coded the materials in the CAQDAS using codes
    emerging from the words of interviewees, adding codes and categories during the
    analysis. Both authors regularly discussed the results of the coding together.
    The single coder iteratively coded the materials in several iterations, followed
    by discussion sessions. The coding stopped when both authors agreed on the results
    of the coding. Researchers accomplished the findings after three iteration rounds
    adopting a two-fold saturation criterion: (i) all the data sources could be coded
    with the set coding structure, and (ii) the research team agreed on the result
    of the coding. When there were conflicts in the accounts of the participant, we
    organised follow up phone calls for clarifications. We also increase the reliability
    of our analysis by presenting our findings to one key informant – one worker –
    that confirmed our results (Yin, 2018). Appendix 1 shows the coding data structure
    used in our analysis and the exemplary statements. 4. The case of ELECTRIC ELECTRIC
    is one production unit located in Italy of an International electrotechnical organisation
    producing electrical switches through both automated and manual assembly lines.
    ELECTRIC, founded in 1979, currently employs about 850 employees, of which 80%
    are blue-collar and 20% white collar. ELECTRIC is one of the organisation leaders
    of the market. This market has a total value of US$ 7.6 Billion in 20191. ELECTRIC
    is also a leader of an Italian manufacturing cluster for the development of I40
    applications. Before the I40 adoption, ELECTRIC uses a traditional manual assembly
    line structured in islands and is composed of 16 workstations. The process consists
    of the pre-assembly phase and assembly phase. Each worker conducts all the operations
    of pre-assembly or assembly phases on a workstation manually with the help of
    traditional technologies. Workers conduct the pre-assembly phase on five workstations.
    One worker is in charge of unloading components from boxes. Four workers conduct
    all the operations to build components for the assembly phase. The assembly phase
    is performed on 11 workstations. Each of the eleven workers conducts all the operations
    to conclude the switch assembly and customisation by employing different utensils,
    such as soldering machines and performing electricity and temperature quality
    tests on products. All the workers can conduct all the operations of the two phases
    and follow preparation lists created according to customers'' orders. The logistic
    is also manual. Workers place the finished products in packages marking the production
    line batch, and then a logistics worker moves the products to the warehouse by
    forklifts. When workers find problems with machines, they call the maintenance.
    When the customer claims a faulty product, the organisation provides after-sales
    assistance, and workers detect the production issues and fix them. The traditional
    assembly line lacks accurate information on output and time. These pieces of data
    are self-reported by workers that fill in excel files at the end of their shifts.
    The same self-reporting mechanism is in use also for maintenance reports. The
    data are eventually used for compiling production statistics. The lack of precision
    in information reporting creates frequent and recurring coordinating issues between
    production, logistics, and maintenance. The maintenance unit is not punctual to
    fix the mechanical issues requesting interruptions of the production flow. Packages
    are lost during the handling between the production unit and the logistics unit.
    Moreover, in the pre-assembly phase, several production issues occur due to the
    repetitiveness of operations. These issues force workers to de-assembly the parts
    and assembly them again. The operations during the pre-assembly phase generate
    microplastics that can be inhaled by workers and can be dangerous for their health.
    4.1. Innovating the assembly line In 2017, the management decides to innovate
    the traditional assembly line by creating a new line with I40 technologies to
    improve production efficiency, maintain stable employment and improve the workforce
    conditions. The new line sides the old one that remains in business. Due to the
    early stage of I40 applications, the management adopts a participatory approach
    that involves the workforce identifying proper technologies to improve the production
    and address workforce issues along the assembly line. To this end, they launch
    a survey for workers seeking to receive their advice. The management eventually
    decides to adopt a set of I40 technologies (see Table 4), following the survey
    results. Table 4. Industry 4.0 technologies Description Industry 4.0 Technology
    Description Semi-automatic conveyor belt with smart sensors The semi-automatic
    conveyor belt employs shelves to move semi-finished products along the assembly
    line which are equipped with proximity sensors to avoid hits. The semi-automatic
    conveyor belt employs accelerometer sensors to detect mechanical issues of the
    assembly line. The traceability system collects the data they produce Robotics
    Autonomous or collaborative devices capable of performing specific tasks. Robots
    can be fully automated and self-moving machines that can manage material picking
    and handle inside a warehouse, or programmable collaborative robots (cobots) which
    can perform desired manipulation tasks Augmented Reality Application A tablet-based
    application that exploits augmented reality to guide workers for machine maintenance
    operations. The worker can point the tablet at part of the machine with a problem.
    The application will provide visual instructions (pictures, arrows, texts) to
    guide workers by fixing the mechanical issue. The application also contains a
    digital copy of all the maintenance procedures of all machines. Traceability system
    Set of integrated systems that use mobile devices, barcode scanners, QR-code scanners,
    and image recognition to trace work and materials flow on the assembly line. The
    system can be both automatic or manually operated by workers using manual barcode
    scanners. The system allows workers to point out human errors that contribute
    to a work incident. Data analytics Set of integrated systems that provide visual
    and real-time feedback information on workers on the assembly line. The feedback
    can be referred to costs or time benchmarks or operational instructions on the
    assembly tasks to perform on the component, product, or by-product. Manufacturing
    Enterprise Systems (MES) This system integrates inbound, production and logistic
    units. It is integrated with the corporate ERP for collecting customer orders
    and with the traceability system and augmented reality application to provide
    statistics Based on the survey result, more competent workers in I40 technologies
    continue to be involved during the adoption process. They are involved in focus
    groups for the deployment of these technologies as representative of workers''
    voice. Each piece of technology is developed and adopted by different projects.
    The management purchases both cobots, smart sensors and automated forklifts. The
    maintenance unit develops smart sensor systems for semi-automatic conveyor belts
    and programs the movements of cobots that are peculiar for assembly line operations.
    The unit programmes the cobot to automate the most repetitive and dangerous pre-assembly
    activities. The logistics unit, supported by engineers of the operation unit,
    programmes the automated forklifts to conduct the repetitive trip from the warehouse
    and the assembly line. The industrial engineering unit cooperates with a technology
    developer for the AR application. The IT department develops the advanced MES,
    data analytics and the tracking system, integrating the data of the different
    technologies with granularity at the level of production steps. The technology
    adoption is incremental. The management discusses the innovation plan with all
    the workers declaring to maintain a stable employment level and explain the production
    line redesign. Thus, they comprehend how their way of working changes. The workforce
    reaction is initially adverse as cobots, and automated forklifts completely disrupt
    some roles. The feedback turns positive when they experience simpler, less repetitive
    and safer tasks thanks to the I40 technologies. The management provides vocational
    courses for the workforce to acquire proper competence to operate I40 technologies
    and autonomously fix potential assembly line errors. During the adoption process,
    training per year of the workforce passes from 12 hours to 16 hours on average
    and includes both trainings on the job and mentorship. 4.2. The industry 4.0 assembly
    line The innovative assembly line is semi-automatic and works with a strong interplay
    between I40 technologies and workers. The I40 assembly line follows lean principles
    that allow workers to organise the production in a team and help each other reach
    daily production and reduce workload. The production process starts with MES retrieving
    orders from the corporate ERP. TV screens along with the assembly line display
    orders with real-time performance statistics visible to all workers. Each worker
    conducts only a small part of the pre-assembly phase or assembly phase activities
    in the entire working turn. Product components are placed on semi-automatic conveyor
    belts that connect each workstation. In the pre-assembly phase, workers unload
    components and conduct part of the pre-assembly phase. Thanks to the I40 technologies,
    one human workstation of the pre-assembly phase disappears with the previous tasks
    replaced by a cobot workstation. The cobot is in charge of conducting the repetitive
    activities of the pre-assembly steps of the switches. Moreover, the worker that
    no longer has the workstation supervises the cobot and help colleagues to maintain
    constant workflow. Cobot needs to be started and stopped and needs manual intervention
    in case of failure. The assembly phase remains manual. Workers finalise the product
    assemble and conduct the remaining customisation steps. Moreover, each worker
    performs quality control of the assembly of the previous worker before starting
    her assembly activities. The components on the assembly line are tagged with barcodes
    tracked by the traceability system that automatically measures the time spent
    for each phase. In case of defects, one worker manually reworks the product on
    a separate island. Workers are also in charge of using the traceability system
    to provide feedback to management to improve their safety along the line pointing
    out human errors and how to address them. The workers on the I40 assembly line
    address simple mechanical issues of the machinery. They fix these issues in autonomy
    with AR application assistance, which provides them visual step-by-step instructions.
    For more complicated issues, the workers call the maintenance unit. At the end
    of each maintenance, the AR application automatically sends a report where workers
    can add further comments. This data is acquired by the MES and used for statistics
    on maintenance. The finished products are moved to the logistic unit through an
    automated forklift controlled by the logistic worker who previously drove the
    forklift. The traditional assembly line remains in business, structured in islands,
    to support the I40 assembly line for customer assistance activities where workers
    repair defective products, and produce some batches of electrical switches that
    help the I40 assembly line reach the daily production goal. The workers are rotated
    along the I40 assembly line and interchanged daily the I40 and the traditional
    assembly line to mitigate the negative effect of repetitions and maintain a high
    level of knowledge operations. Moreover, how the MES schedule the sequence of
    products minimises the repetitiveness. Periodically all workers receive training
    on the latest updates of the I40 technologies. 4.3. Outcomes of industry 4.0 adoption
    I40 innovation produces several outcomes for the business capital. After the I40
    adoption, the plant of ELECTRIC reaches a turnover of 550€ million. The lead time
    of each operation is shorter than before, passing from 40 to 20 seconds on average.
    Consequently, the production doubles, passing from an average of 400 to 800 switches
    produced daily. Thus, I40 adoption contributes to increasing the output quantity
    by 20%, shifting the production from 2,5 million to 3 million electrical switches.
    The automation of the pre-assembly phase prevents all the common assembly mistakes
    of the workers. Thus, the defect rate is also reduced to the point that management
    sets a quality goal of 250 defect pieces per million of produced switches. As
    a result of the data collected on the performance of the assembly line, ELECTRIC
    reduces the cost for energy and prevent common mechanical issues on cylinders
    of the conveyor belt that may cost 1500€ each in electricity per year. Similarly,
    the smart sensors allow verifying whether a maintenance intervention on the conveyor
    belt was successful by comparing performance data before and after the interventions.
    Thus, I40 adoption, in conjunction with an electrical distribution control system,
    contributes to reducing the plant''s energy consumption by 30%. The combined use
    of the MES and the AR applications sharply reduces paper consumption because they
    digitalise machine instruction and the paper-based system to manage the line.
    The coordination among the units is also improved. The maintenance workers reduce
    intervention time from 20 minutes to 9 minutes on average. Through the reports
    produced by the data analytics system, the management can set challenging quality
    goals – the threshold of faulty products, daily production quantity – to improve
    the production and monitor the progress to reach them. 4.4. Achieving a fair balance
    between capital and labour welfare benefits Fig. 2 summarises the actions that
    the management employs to address the challenges to reach a fair balance of capital-labour
    welfare benefits. The I40 adoption transforms the traditional assembly line and
    adds a semi-automatic assembly line where a cobot workstation replaces one human
    workstation. Automated forklifts no longer require drivers. Analogously, the maintenance
    workforce experiences a reduction of routine maintenance activities due to the
    synergy between workforce and AR application. The management addresses the potential
    conflict between automation and labour welfare involving the workforce since the
    beginning of the I40 innovation and increasing their duties. They involve workers
    in the selection of I40 technologies in order to spot those technologies that
    can automate the most repetitive and unsafe activities of workers. Also, several
    workers see their tasks enriched. The maintenance workers are in charge of scouting
    new I40 technologies and supporting the development of the ones in use. Download

    Managerial actions to address challenges to achieving fair capital-labour welfare
    in Industry 4.0 The logistic workers programme and manage the automated forklifts
    rather than driving them. The assembly line workers supervise cobots, block and
    restart them, maintaining constant the production process. Their tasks are enriched
    with simple maintenance, quality control and assurance activities on the work
    of their colleagues. In addition, workers can increase their safety by providing
    feedback to the management to improve their operations. Workers increase autonomy
    in operations. They can manage the activities they perform helping each other''s
    – particularly to speed up underperforming lines – and to take these decisions,
    they are supported by screens showing the daily production trend in comparison
    with the target set for the day. Management also fosters a safer workplace giving
    extra compensation and recognition to workers of assembly line who maintain a
    more organised workplace. The redesign of the I40 assembly line increases the
    safety and health of the workplace with a resulting reduction of job accidents.
    After I40 adoption, there are no employee work-related fatalities. Furthermore,
    workstations are more spacious and ergonomic. Workers sit distant from the cobots
    that, by assembling the products, produce microplastics that are no longer inhaled
    by the workforce. During the adoption, the workforce expresses concern regarding
    knowledge reduction on how to assemble the products. Also, how ELECTRIC trains
    workers to perform the assembly activities privileges the human production steps
    neglecting the assembly phase performed by cobot. Workers also have difficulties
    in addressing assembly issues of finished products or when faulty product come
    back to the firm. The management addresses the concern with a frequent rotation
    of jobs along the I40 assembly line. Thus, workers perform various assembly activities,
    increasing the level of knowledge of the production phases and reducing the repetitiveness
    of assembly activities. Moreover, cobots need human support for loading and unloading
    operations, and the workers themselves manage the cobots. Finally, when cobots
    have difficulties in assembling components (due to different shapes or weight
    of switch components), the workers perform the task in the place of the cobot.
    Furthermore, since the traditional assembly line is still in place, the workers
    are interchanged between the two lines. The work on the manual line helps workers
    increase their knowledge on the assembly of the entire switch and fix faulty products.
    The I40 assembly line strengthens the teamwork among workers: they now assist
    each other to improve their knowledge of the production process. Since each worker
    acts as a quality controller against the work of her colleague, the workforce
    develops analytical skills to potentially fix faulty assembly activities and helping
    colleagues to perform the activities better. The work on the I40 assembly line
    is more straightforward than before, and this allows fast integration of apprentice
    workers who experienced fewer challenges to acquire the proper knowledge to work
    along the line. Through the reports produced by the traceability system, managers
    identify workers regularly performing below standards and discuss with them countermeasures
    to improve the performance, including the possibility of attending tailor-made
    vocational courses, training, or discussing the pace of the work on the process.
    Workers can also use the technology to point out improvement of operations to
    prevent potentially work incidents. Still, a maintenance worker can verify whether
    upkeep along the assembly line is successful through the data analysis of smart
    sensors. Finally, the workforce expresses concern about the lack of digital competencies
    for working with I40 technologies. The management addresses this problem, developing
    a lifelong learning path for the assembly line workforce. During the I40 adoption,
    workers attend vocational courses to learn how to use each I40 technology. For
    robotics, smart sensors, vocational training involves working with these technologies,
    managing their operations, and addressing potentially mechanical issues, particularly
    for the cobots. For I40 technologies with a human-computer interface, the courses
    involve using the embedded systems and their functionalities and addressing potential
    issues. In addition, the vocational course for the use of AR application also
    helps workers acquire maintenance competencies with the I40 technologies because
    they try the application to address mechanical issues of machinery. Then during
    operations, each worker goes through a period of training on the job and can count
    on mentorship from skilled workers if the former feels she remain unfamiliar with
    I40 technologies. Periodically all workers receive training on the new updates
    of the I40 technologies. Finally, the number of employees of ELECTRIC grows after
    the I40 adoption. The last balance sheet of 2018 of ELECTRIC states that the organisation
    has 858 employees. According to the CPO of the organisation, the workforce number
    grows about 100 units compared to the employment level of seven years ago. Adding
    to this, in the following three years (2020-2022), they recruit 122 apprentices,
    90 of whom are already recruited in 2020. 5. Discussion The extant literature
    reveals a lack of studies exploring how I40 adoption helps an organisation undertake
    a fair ethical business development between capital and labour welfare benefits
    (Sony, 2020; Trentesaux & Caillaud, 2020). Because I40 adoption follows a technocentric
    approach that privileges the automation of I40 technologies over the workers that
    can be replaced (Kang et al., 2016). We argue that a worker-centric approach of
    I40 adoption unveils a more complex picture with a different balance between automation
    and human labour. Table 5 illustrates the outcome on capital and labour welfare
    of a fair ethical business development through I40 adoption. Table 5. Outcome
    of a fair ethical business development in Industry 4.0 adoption Capital Labour
    Welfare Reduced lead time Increased number of workers Increased output quantity
    Better work conditions for labour Reduction of defect rates Workers act as supervisor
    of I40 technologies Reduction of energy usage Workers with improved digital competencies
    Better coordination of units Reduction of routine activities Reduction of the
    maintenance time on the line Continuous improvement of worker competencies through
    tailor-made vocational training Reduction of paper usage Increased task autonomy
    for workers Proficient knowledge of production activities of workers Task enriched
    for workers Reduction of work incident More responsibility for workers Extra compensation
    for workers To reach a fair balance between capital and labour welfare benefits,
    the organisation exploits I40 technologies to automate repetitive and dangerous
    activities, where human errors are common and work accidents can happen. The resulting
    I40 assembly line is semi-automatic and disrupts one job position along the line
    and one job position of the logistics unit, where two workers conduct the pre-assembly
    operation and drive forklift, respectively. Nevertheless, the organisation avoids
    such workforce reduction along the line, increasing workforce duties. In our case,
    assembly line workers operate both as machine supervisors and quality controller
    of colleagues'' operations. With a profound knowledge of the production process
    machinery, maintenance workers take on the role of technology developers to reduce
    simple maintenance activities, and logistics workers act as automated forklift
    supervisors. This workforce empowerment leverages job rotation, job enrichment,
    and vocational training that allows addressing operational knowledge reduction
    and developing a poly-specialistic worker. Thus, the novel assembly line generates
    value through a strong interplay between technologies and workers. I40 technologies
    are deployed to conduct faster operations, and poly-specialistic workers are developed
    to conclude the assembly, supervise I40 technologies and continuously optimise
    the assembly line. Moreover, I40 technologies embedded some feature for the competence
    growth of the workforce and performance at the same time. The measurement of time
    for each production phase and the mentoring and the training-on-the job ensure
    both managerial visibility on individual and overall performance and the continuous
    improvement of workers performance. The development of teams behaviour allows
    workers to help each other and learn from each other''s experience. Applied in
    this way, I40 technologies support labour welfare. The organisation maintains
    stable employment, and workers experience better work conditions and enriched
    duties. At the same time, the I40 adoption support business capital by improving
    production efficiency through a shorter lead-time, reduced costs for resources
    use and maintenance, higher quality product, and more fine-grained control over
    the assembly line. Such added value reflects a stronger market position of the
    organisation that can also continue to defend job positions and integrate new
    workers as soon as the increase in production requires new human resources. The
    organisation also shares their increasing profit with workers with extra compensation.
    Therefore, answering our research question, the principal proposition resulting
    from our investigation reads as follows. Principal Proposition. I40 technologies
    deployed with a worker-centric approach help organisation undertake a fair ethical
    business development and support a fair balance between capital and labour welfare
    benefits. I40 technologies automate repetitive and dangerous activities, and workers
    reduce routine work and enrich their duties taking on supervision activities on
    the assembly line. The production is more efficient, and workers acquire competencies
    to work with I40 technologies and a higher level of knowledge of the production
    activities. To deeper understand how an organisation employs I40 adoption to a
    fair ethical business development, we further analyse the main proposition. The
    extant literature reports that I40 technologies automate production activities
    according to their functionalities, neglecting the workforce''s role along the
    line with a resulting job disruption, particularly for low skilled workers (Frey
    & Osborne, 2017; Haleem & Javaid, 2019; Kang et al., 2016). In our case, the organisation
    addresses such consequence by following a participative approach. Workers are
    involved during the I40 development. They provide advice on the I40 technologies
    to purchase and activities to automate according to their working needs. The organisation
    is receptive to such advice and tends to follow this recommendation by including
    different units, particularly the maintenance unit, that knows how the production
    line operates and can help implement and program these technologies. As a result,
    I40 adoption is used to automate only unhealthy and repetitive activities for
    workers, where mishaps are common. Moreover, the management maintains stable employment
    by counterbalancing the loss of the workforce activities with novel duties that
    are more abundant in creativity and autonomy. The I40 workforce is enriched with
    supervision, maintenance, configuring, monitoring, and continuously improving
    the pieces of technology. Thus, the novel assembly line is semi-automatic and
    deliver value with a strong sociotechnical interplay between technologies and
    workers. The production is more efficient with less down-time, and the workforce
    experiences better workforce conditions and ergonomics and enriched tasks (Braccini
    & Margherita, 2019; Erol et al., 2016; C. K. M. Lee, Lv, Ng, Ho, & Choy, 2017;
    Shamim et al., 2016). Therefore, we propose the following sub-proposition: Sub-Proposition
    1. The management follows a participative approach to select the I40 technologies
    to adopt and the activities to automate. I40 technologies automate only repetitive
    and unhealthy operational activities leaving room for enriched tasks for the workforce,
    which are the supervision and continuous improvement of I40 technologies. The
    resulting I40 assembly line is semi-automatic and operates with a strong sociotechnical
    interplay between workers and technologies. The development of an I40 assembly
    line leveraging on this sociotechnical interplay is challenging for the management.
    Although the required I40 technologies can be purchased and programmed, these
    poly-specialist workers need to be developed and require a proper education according
    to the tailor-made activities they perform along the I40 assembly line. In our
    case, such poly-specialist workers supervise and address potential mechanical
    issues of I40 technologies and keep conducting most of the assembly activities.
    Such human activity configuration does the practice of replacing the traditional
    workforce with more IT-skilled workers detrimental for the organisation because
    it leads to a loss of know-how and expertise related that hampers all the peculiar
    manual activities for the completion and customisation of the production (Margherita
    & Braccini, 2020; Sony, 2020). Au contraire, the management develops life-long
    training paths – vocational training, mentorship, and training on the job – to
    reskill traditional workers. Thus, workers can understand how the I40 technologies
    operate along the line and how they can manage it. Such courses do not prepare
    workers to merely start and stop the technologies in case of mechanical issues
    but to develop digital competencies that allow poly-specialist workers to use
    complex human-computer interface systems of I40 technologies and deal with mechanical
    issues. This is the case of AR application that supports step-by-step workers
    on maintenance activities on cobots and different machinery or tracking systems
    that allow workers to send I40 to send feedback to increase their safety and communicate
    with other workers. Such training courses are not held only during the adoption
    process, but they are periodically given to workers to present the latest updates
    of the I40 technologies and their use. Therefore, we propose the following sub-proposition:
    Sub-Proposition 2. The management develops life-long training paths to build poly-specialistic
    workers with overlapping competencies related to advanced management of the I40
    technologies and related to the assembly of products. Thus, I40 technologies promote
    a more efficient and automated production process to support the capital and growth
    of workforce digital competencies and enriched duties for labour welfare. Finally,
    the interplay between I40 technologies and workers leverages poly-specialistic
    workers possessing a proficient knowledge of the entire production activities
    to operate in the I40 assembly line. They are in charge of conducting complex
    assembly activities and cobot''s activities when it is offline. Although the management
    supports knowledge accumulation by reshaping the production process into several
    easy steps, including straightforward activities and automating repetitive activities.
    Workers experience a lack of knowledge to assemble the entire product, fix finished
    products and the phases performed by robots, and a hyper-specialisation for the
    activities in charge (Bednar & Welch, 2020; Mehri, 2006). In our case, the management
    addressed these issues adopting I40 technologies for knowledge sharing: AR application
    provides visual instructions to assemble the component and traceability system
    allows workers to communicate with colleagues. Then, the management assigns the
    workforce the task of managing cobots, taking their tasks when they are offline,
    and interchanging the workforce between the traditional and I40 assembly lines.
    Furthermore, the task easiness, peer supervision, and the rotation of workers
    across phases and lines stimulated the growth of group dynamics that support performance
    and knowledge sharing. Therefore, we propose the following sub-proposition: Sub-Proposition
    3. I40 assembly line requires poly-specialist workers with a high level of knowledge
    of production activities to operate with I40 technologies. To this end, the workforce
    needs rotation, teamwork attitude, task easiness, peer supervision. I40 technologies
    accommodate knowledge sharing with a specific feature. Thus, I40 technologies
    increase organisational performance to support the capital and support knowledge
    development and better workforce conditions for labour welfare. 5.1. Implication
    for researchers Our study proposes four theoretical propositions to explore how
    organisations undertake a fair ethical business development through I40 adoption
    to support a fair balance between capital and labour welfare benefits. We believe
    that these propositions can contribute to the genesis of a research agenda for
    future studies in the field. Therefore, we encouraged researchers to develop these
    propositions further by adopting a number of methodological angles, such as qualitative
    – especially action research and Fs/CQA analysis – and quantitative approaches.
    We based the study on an Italian production branch of a large organisation producing
    electrical switches. Thus, we encourage researchers to replicate this study by
    selecting small-medium enterprises operating in different sectors and based in
    different countries from Italy because we expect that fair ethical business development
    of I40 adoption may vary in these cases (L. Li, 2018). Since the I40 adoption
    high cost (Sony & Naik, 2019), small-medium enterprises have less capital to invest
    in such a transition than a large organisation. A different production process
    may vary the I40 technologies to adopt and the tasks to automate with a result
    different balance between extensive automation and labour. Similarly, countries
    different from Italy can have different types of national funds (or any) to help
    the organisation adopt I40 technologies (Kang et al., 2016). Our results show
    how the management enriches the duties of assembly line, maintenance and logistics
    workers to compensate for the reduction of routine activities due to I40 automation.
    Owing to the limited body of knowledge regarding fair ethical business development
    of I40 adoption, we focused on operational workers because the current I40 technologies
    mainly impact their units. However, we noted that the tracking system and data
    analytics automatically produce reports and analysis previously compiled by middle
    managers. These technologies, combined with the advent of artificial intelligence,
    increase the automation of these activities and open a potential job disruption
    for middle management. Therefore, further studies should investigate a fair ethical
    business development of I40 adoption embracing the entire organisation and the
    middle management, developing a research proposal to advance the knowledge accumulation
    faster. The results of our case analysis show the importance of competencies for
    the I40 workforce and how competencies are built up. Indeed, the study portrays
    that workforce needs distinctive digital competencies for the management of technologies
    to remain in the organisation that is built by a lifelong learning path. Further
    studies should investigate whether management develops a lifelong learning path
    and how management can measure competence growth. We also encourage researchers
    to explore a competence catalogue that can serve as a reference for practitioners
    to develop tailor-made courses for I40 competencies. Finally, our work confirms
    that automation of production activities impedes workers from acquiring the proper
    knowledge to conduct effective operations along the line (Bednar & Welch, 2020;
    Burton-Jones, 2014). Although I40 adoption promotes knowledge sharing by the features
    of AR application and the traceability systems (D. Li et al., 2019)., these features
    are not sufficient to stem the decreasing expertise and know-how of the organisation.
    In our study, the management couples this I40 feature with teamwork and job rotation
    to address this issue. Further study should focus on the development of tailor-made
    knowledge management for I40 capable of knowledge acquisition, documentation,
    transfer, creation, and application. On which the organisation can base its competitive
    advantage. 5.2. Implication for practitioners Practitioners can use the study
    as guidelines to achieve a fair balance between capital and labour welfare benefits
    through I40 adoption. The transition to the I40 production process does not automatically
    imply the reduction of employment level. Practitioners should employ I40 technologies
    to automate repetitive tasks and prepare the workforce to conduct novel knowledge-intensive
    activities, including technology supervision with a higher degree of autonomy.
    In this period of recession due to the COVID-19, the deployment of I40 technologies
    with a worker-centric approach is a valid strategy for fighting the economic crisis
    allowing to increase production output and defending job positions for the community.
    To exploit the full potential of I40 adoption, the pieces of evidence of our case
    mandate organisations to develop a lifelong learning path to enrich workforce
    competencies on I40 technologies. Vocational training plays a crucial role in
    I40 adoption and shall be tailor-made to each worker employed in the assembly
    line. Training-on-the-job and mentorship conclude the workforce training straightening
    knowledge of production activities. Still, the study illustrates the importance
    of teamwork attitude, job rotations to maintain a high level of knowledge of the
    production process for the workforce. Moreover, our study shows that including
    the workforce during the I40 innovation project reduces the resistance to changes.
    We also show that maintenance workers can help the cobot adoption and programme
    customised cobot movements according to the assembly thanks to their knowledge
    of the production process. 6. Conclusion Our study is motivated by the lack of
    studies that explores how I40 adoption help manufacturing organisations undertake
    a fair ethical business development in order to support a fair balance between
    the benefits of capital and labour welfare. We addressed this gap by conducting
    a single case study analysis of the production unit of the Italian branch of an
    International electrotechnical organisation. The results show that I40 technologies
    deployed with a worker-centric approach help organisations find a fair balance
    between capital and labour welfare benefits. I40 technologies improve the production
    process by automating repetitive and dangerous activities to support the capital.
    At the same time, I40 technologies support labour welfare because they are deployed
    to improve workforce conditions and support workforce empowerment through reduced
    routine work and enriched duties. The resulted production line is semi-automatic,
    and the level of employment remains stable along the line. Workers need lifelong
    paths to acquire proper competencies to deal with I40 technologies. The automation
    simplifies the tasks assigned to workers with a potential downside in terms of
    knowledge fragmentation. The workforce is frequently rotated and assigned to interchangeable
    tasks having poly-functional and overlapping expertise to address this downside.
    Working in this way, the workforce developed a teamwork attitude and can see their
    roles enriched by taking on technology managerial tasks. We further propose four
    theoretical propositions to advance our study. We acknowledged that our study
    has limitations. The generalizability of the findings may be limited due to the
    selection of a single case organisation. Although we acknowledge this methodology
    accounts only for inductive generalisability, we believe our results to be significant
    in terms of external validity for two reasons. Firstly, we chose an organisation
    leader of the sector operating in the Italian context that is the second-largest
    manufacturer in Europe (Margherita & Braccini, 2020). Such context is similar
    to other European, American and Asian counties, where the government provides
    national funds to purchase I40 technologies without considering the societal effects
    of these technologies (Kang et al., 2016; L. Li, 2018). Secondly, the organisation
    is a leader of a large cluster of large and small-medium organisations, for which
    it will guide the I40 transition in an ethical manner. Therefore, the solutions
    deployed by ELECTRIC will be reproduced in the other companies of the cluster.
    Therefore, we retain the study generalisation is reinforced because our findings
    are not just idiosyncratic to a single case but will be replicated in several
    organisations of this I40 cluster. Author contributions The authors have contributed

    of the manuscript. Appendix In this section, we present the data structure and
    the interview excerpts of our studies. Appendix 1 Data structure and empirical
    findings 2nd level Coding 1st Level Coding Interview Excerpts A More Efficient
    production process Increased output quantity “The gain of I40 line was a constant
    production, and we reach 800 pieces per day while before we only produced 400
    pieces” (CPO). “We increased the productivity of the line with the cobots which
    assemble a part of the switch components faster than workers” (COO). “Thanks to
    I40 adoption, the organisation increased output quantity by 20%, shifting the
    production from 2,5 million to 3 million electrical switches and reaching a turnover
    of 550€ million” (distinguished national newspapers article). Reduction of defect
    rate “We set challenging quality goals related to faulty products since the production
    drastically reduced defects rate” (Quality Manager). Reduced energy cost “With
    the smart sensors, we can prevent the break of cylinders. We esteem that a damaged
    cylinder cost us 1500€ in electricity” (Mechanical Maintenance B). “With smart
    sensors, we can check if the maintenance of cylinders was good comparing the data
    before and after, thus we reduced energy waste” (Mechanical Maintenance B). “The
    organisation reduced the energy consumption by 30% thanks to I40 technologies
    and an electrical distribution control system” (Official balance sustainability
    statement). Reduced usage of paper “With the AR application, workers do not bring
    all the manuals of the machinery to do maintenance, and they have a digital copy
    in the application” (Industrial Engineer 2). “We digitalized all the documents,
    the schedule of the orders by the MES thus we have reduced the papers” (Informatics
    Engineers A). Better coordination among units “All the units are integrated with
    the MES and the management has current data of the production” (Informatics Engineers
    C).” “We reduce the intervention time from 9 to 20 minutes thanks to the systems
    (Informatics Engineer B)”. “When we use the paper-based system, we have coordination
    issue while with the MES we integrate all the units. Now we work to integrate
    our partner of the supply chain” (COO). Simpler activities for workers AR facilitates
    maintenances activities Simpler assembly activities “The AR application guides
    workers during the maintenance activities providing visual aid and digital instructions”
    (Industrial Engineer B). Simpler assembly activities “Now workers only perform
    a phase of very easy assembly activities, before the production was more difficult
    because they assembled the entire product” (CPO). “The MES automatically download
    the orders from the corporate SAP and manage orders to reduce the repetition of
    activities for the charging of components” (Informatics Engineer A). Sustaining
    Knowledge of production process Quick Job Rotation “We have a very quick job rotation.
    workers change the activities every day since they change the workstation of the
    line” (CPO). “To make the work less repetitive, we have a very large job rotation”
    (Industrial Engineer A). Employing workers for cobots activities “Now a worker
    is helping us to maintain the line constantly and does the same assembly of the
    cobots” (Supervisor Worker A). “When the components change in weight and shape,
    cobots often have problems assembling them. So, we help the line using a worker
    for cobots activities” (CPO). Altering workers between I40 and manual assembly
    line “I work in both line the I40 line and the manual altering with the other
    workers thus I can assemble the entire products” (Worker A). Tailor-made course
    for workers thanks to technologies “The tracking system allows finding in which
    assembly phase workers perform below standard thus we propose courses to increase
    skill and knowledge for those phases” (Quality manager). Knowledge of the process
    increased by teamwork “We create quality gate along the line, and the worker checks
    the assembly of the previous worker addressing potentially assembly problems.
    Thus, workers can help the team to improve their production skill” (Quality Manager).
    Workforce with more competences Competences increased by vocational courses “The
    organisation provides several vocational courses both for using cobots but also
    to work in the new assembly line. We provide them to apprentices and for experience
    workers periodically” (Public Relation Officer). “We received courses to manage
    the cobots. We learnt how to block the robots and how to restart it” (Supervisor
    Worker B). “For maintenance unit was a challenge to program the cobots, we followed
    a course for coding. This coding skills and our knowledge of machine anomalies
    really helps us to set up the cobots” (Mechanical Maintenance 1). “During the
    I40 adoption, training per years of the workforce passed from 12 hours to 16 hours
    on average” (Official balance sustainability statement). Knowledge of technologies
    increased by training-on-the-job “We received training on the job to use the cobots
    and address their issues” (Worker 1). “Now workers of the assembly line know better
    all the activity phases and how to manage cobots thanks to training on the job”
    (CPO). Knowledge of technologies increased by mentorship Three supervisor workers
    provided mentorship to us to improve our competencies in the use of the cobots.”
    (Worker A). More duties for workers Increased Task Autonomy “Now worker can directly
    order the broken piece through the AR app to conclude the maintenance. Before,
    workers had to call the maintenance unit” (Informatics Engineer B). “In the new
    assembly line, we workers download the order from the MES, we change components
    on the line, we help each other to maintain constant the production.” (Supervisor
    Worker B) Assembly line workers as a technology supervisor Logistic workers manage
    automated forklift trips “Now the workers that operate with cobots, supervises
    these robots using a computer. They can block them or restart them. While logistics
    workers now manage the forklifts” (COO). Assembly line workers as a technology
    supervisor “Now workers supervise the cobot. Before they only perform manual operations
    and now, they are a sort of technician. It is a great improvement for them” (CPO).
    “Now workers have to supervise the cobot which has micro collisions, and their
    work is very important. Sometimes cobots break the piece of the vision system
    has problems, and they afford to restart or block the system. They help each other
    and charge components on the line” (Mechanical Maintenance A). “Now workers have
    to supervise the cobot which has micro collisions and their work is very important.
    Sometimes cobots break the piece of the vision system has problems, they afford
    to restart or block the system. They help each other and charge components on
    the line” (Mechanical Maintenance A). Assembly line workers with maintenance duties
    “With AR application, workers do simple maintenance activities because the AR
    application does visual instructions” (Industrial Engineer B). Assembly line Workers
    as quality assurance “Along the line, the worker performs quality control of the
    assembly of the previous worker” (CPO). Maintenance workers as a technology developer
    “My unit, the maintenance, did scouting of these technologies and then we programmed
    the cobots and vision system. Before we only fix machines” (Mechanical Maintenance
    A). “We used workers with knowledge on I40 technologies to study and develop the
    application of these technologies, and they also did a sort of scouting. They
    also do focus groups with universities and start-up” (COO). Reduction of repetitive
    activities Reduction of repetitive activities for assembly line workers “I40 for
    us is a way to improve efficiency and to stimulate workers. We automated repetitive
    assembly activities with cobots. They assemble three small parts. Workers can
    do more complex activities” (COO). “We automated with cobots only activities with
    low value-added where errors often occurred. Workers were excited about this”
    (CPO). “We automated repetitive activities through cobots where mistakes often
    occurred” (Products engineer). “Along the line, we automated by cobots assembly
    phases repetitive and unhealthy for workers” (Mechanical Maintenance A). “Workers
    now see automated repetitive activities along the line, and at the same time,
    the organisations will increase employee number by 122 units” (Distinguished national
    newspapers article). Reduction of repetitive activities for maintenance workers
    “Maintenance unit reduced their routine activities, assembly line workers with
    AR do these simple activities” (Mechanical Maintenance A). Reduction of repetitive
    activities for logistics workers “Now the logistics reduce the time spent for
    the trips in the plant since the forklift is programmed to do so” (Supply Chain/
    Operation Engineer). Safer Workplace More ergonomics workstation “The redesign
    of the line thanks to I40 makes the workstation more organised and ergonomics”
    (Supply Chain/Operation Engineer). “We reach the golden zone for the picking.
    We adopted shelving units along with the I40 assembly which assures safe handling
    between 50-120 cm” (Supply Chain/Operation Engineer). Fewer microplastics in the
    production process “Along the line, we automated by cobots a pre-assembly phase
    which released microplastic. Now the line is safer because these microplastics
    remain in the cobots area, and worker do not inhale them. We pointed out this
    problem during the adoption process in focus group.” (Mechanical Maintenance A).
    More organised workplace “The workplace is more organised than before thanks to
    the lean, but also thanks to workers that are encouraged to take care the workplace
    organised because we give extra money. We experienced less injuries.” (Products
    engineer) Zero work-related fatalities “There are no employee work-related fatalities
    in the organisation” (official balance sustainability statement). Knowledge reduction
    of the production process Difficulties for workers to repair finished products
    “Workers do not know well the production process especially activities to repair
    the products.” (CPO). Limited knowledge for assembling an entire product “The
    traditional production process pushes workers to know all the activities of the
    entire production process while with this new line workers know only a small part
    of the production process” (CPO). “In the traditional line, we knew which product
    we assembled, I made it and I know how I assembled it. If there are some problems
    and the customer sends it back, I can understand my errors and improve my way
    of assembling. Now, it is possible because I only put some parts of the switch
    and in case of errors, we don''t know who made the errors. We only do movements
    not assembling” (Workers Supervisor A). “At the end this way of producing consists
    of only repetitive activities and not a production like in the traditional method”
    (Worker B). Lack of knowledge of cobots assembly activities “Since cobots assemble
    product constantly, we firstly teach how to assemble manual phases, after we teach
    the cobot phases in case of cobots problem. (CPO)” Reduction of human activities
    Reduction of production activities for workers “Now our line has cobots. Cobot
    does the work of one or two people” (Worker Supervisor B). Cobots substitute one
    human workstation Reduction of production activities for workers “We changed a
    manual workstation with a cobot that performs repetitive tasks” (CPO). “We design
    the new assembly line without a human workstation which we substituted with a
    cobot that performs faster” (Mechanical Maintenance A). Logistic workers no longer
    drive forklifts “Now logistics don''t drive the forklifts which are moving in
    autonomy” (Products Engineer). Reduction of routine maintenance activities for
    the maintenance unit “Now we are focused on programming cobots rather than does
    routine maintenance on the line” (Mechanical Maintenance A). “Workers of the assembly
    line performs simple maintenance activities on the line which were previously
    performed by the maintenance unit” (Informatics Engineer C). Lack of digital competencies
    to handle I40 technologies Low knowledge of technology feature “We teach workers
    since they are not familiar with the feature of these technologies” (Mechanical
    maintenance A). Lack of informatics competencies for the workforce “Workers need
    to have competencies for working with these technologies beyond the operative
    skills. But it is difficult to acquire them” (Worker B). “We need workers also
    for the assembly line with informatics competencies. Now it is a prerogative to
    be hired” (COO). References Bednar and Welch, 2020 P.M. Bednar, C. Welch Socio-Technical

  description: Digital fabrication (DFAB) for construction automation is emerging
    in the industry. However, DFAB requires better integration of fabrication-related
    information and organisation into the design process. Discrete processes in traditional
    delivery models such as Design-Bid-Build can hinder DFAB implementation when stakeholders
    find it hard to manage project costs. Target Value Design (TVD) has been proposed
    as possible approach to manage the DFAB design process, but management of DFAB
    using TVD is still new in the industry. Meanwhile, existing educational games
    have been successful at teaching players the basic principles of TVD principles.
    However, these games do not explicitly consider how players should select from
    advanced fabrication processes. They also have not yet been adopted for online
    play. This work presents an overview of an online TVD for DFAB game that can 1)
    help players understand basic TVD principles and 2) explicitly considers fabrication
    processes and resulting production times as an additional project value. The paper
    presents the results of a validation case played by 36 construction professionals,
    researchers and students in December 2020. Overall, this work contributes to the
    body of knowledge in learning and teaching TVD, online lean games, and technology
    adoption.

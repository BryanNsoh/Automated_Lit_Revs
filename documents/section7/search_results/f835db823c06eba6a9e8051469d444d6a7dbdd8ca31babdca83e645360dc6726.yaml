    Abstract In recent years many applications have been proposed for Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSN). One of these is precision agriculture, where WSN can play an important
    part in the handling and management of water resources for irrigation, in understanding
    the changes in the crops to assess the optimum point for harvesting, in estimating
    fertilizer requirements and to predict crop performance more accurately. This
    paper describes our experience during the introduction and deployment of an experimental
    sensor network at an ecological horticultural enterprise in the semiarid region
    of Murcia. It presents the topology of the deployed network using four types of
    nodes (Soil Mote, Environmental Mote, Water Mote and Gateway Mote), some of them
    connected to different sensors distributed in the field. These sensors can measure
    various soil characteristics such us temperature, volumetric moisture content
    and salinity. For each node, the overall architecture, hardware and software components
    are described. The system also includes a real-time monitoring application operating
    from a computer placed in the central offices of the farm. The testing of the
    system was done in two phases: the first in the laboratory, to validate the functional
    requirements of the developed devices, the networking solution and the mote''s
    power management; the second on the farm, to asses the functional performance
    of the devices, such as range, robustness and flexibility. The system was successfully

    1. Introduction The concept of precision agriculture has been around for some
    time now. Blackmore (1994) defined it as a “comprehensive system designed to optimize
    agricultural production by carefully tailoring soil and crop management to correspond
    to the unique condition found in each field while maintaining environmental quality”.
    Nowadays, it is possible to say that precision agriculture (Zhang et al., 2002)
    is a method for estimating, assessing and understanding the changes that take
    place in crops in order to be able to determine irrigation and fertilizer requirements,
    product growth and ripening phases, optimum points of sowing and harvesting, etc.
    as exactly as possible—in other words, adequately predict the various stages in
    crop production. To that end it is important to gather as much information as
    possible on the water, soil, plants and environment. Precision agriculture, then,
    utilizes numerous technologies and infrastructures: data instrumentation and gathering
    systems, geographic information systems (GIS), global positioning systems (GPS),
    microelectronics, wireless technologies and so forth (Chiti et al., 2005, Tang
    et al., 2002). Many wireless technologies have been put to different uses to implement
    wireless sensors in precision agriculture (Wang et al., 2006, Camilli et al.,
    2007, Vellidis et al., 2008, Siuli Roy and Bandyopadhyays, 2008, Pierce and Elliot,
    2008)—from simple infra-red-based devices (IrDAs) for very short distances to
    long-range systems based on mobile telephony, such as GSM/GPRS. In between there
    are WPANs (Wireless Personal Area Networks) for short distances, such as Bluetooth
    (10 m) and ZigBee (70 m), and WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks) for intermediate
    distances (100 m). Camilli et al. (2007) describe a simulated application for
    precision agriculture using a network of wireless sensors capable of providing
    field parameters to end users. Pierce and Elliot (2008) describe the hardware
    and software components developed for regional and on-farm sensor networks and
    their implementation in two agricultural applications in Washington State (USA).
    Within the category of WPANs are included the WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks)
    (Akyildiz et al., 2002), a type of autonomous, self-organized ad hoc network composed
    of tens, hundreds or thousands of smart low-rate devices or motes, which are generally
    battery-powered. These networks present a number of features that are particularly
    useful for precision agriculture: • The topology of the network need not be fixed;
    the nodes can be deployed arbitrarily and adapted to changing needs. For instance,
    sensor nodes can be placed anywhere in a crop field, in whatever arrangement is
    desired. A sensor node can be removed or added directly without having to reconfigure
    all the other nodes. • They are more error-tolerant than other types of networks,
    since a failure in one node is automatically compensated by rerouting through
    the other nodes thanks to the intrinsic possibilities of dynamic network reconfiguration.
    For example, if a crop is at a growth stage in which physical access to the mote
    is complicated, it is not absolutely essential to replace it. • Energy consumption
    by nodes is optimized in such a way that they can be powered solely by batteries
    or renewable energy-based systems (solar, wind or hydraulic) (Morais et al., 2008).
    In this way, energy supply is assured throughout the lifetime of the node—at least
    one agricultural cycle. • The sensors used in precision agriculture usually have
    to be robust, accurate and with high resolution and hence are relatively costly
    (over $300/sensor), but the current tendency is to embed sensors in the motes,
    which drastically reduces their cost. Motes normally consist of a processor, a
    radio module, a power supply and one or more sensors mounted on the mote itself
    or connected to it. The processor controls all the node''s functions (access to
    sensors, control of communications, execution of the state engine, etc.). The
    radio module transmits and receives through a communication standard. The standards
    that best adapt to the requirements imposed by the development of sensor networks
    and that incorporate most of the radio modules used in motes are IEEE 802.15.4
    (IEEE, 2006) and ZigBee (Baronti et al., 2007). These standards are designed for
    applications where the transfer speed is not very great, but they make it possible
    for network nodes to be powered by battery and to function for weeks or even months
    without recharging. The function of the power supply is to supply energy to the
    mote from batteries using high-performance power converters. Finally, some of
    the nodes in a sensor network may communicate with a computer or other networks
    through a gateway. This article describes experiments conducted for the introduction
    of a WSN in a horticultural holding. Other works have recently demonstrated the
    success of applying WSN in precision agriculture (Burrell et al., 2004, Pierce
    and Elliot, 2008). The farm is located in the Campo de Cartagena in the Region
    of Murcia, South-East Spain, in one of Europe''s most important horticultural
    areas. In climatic terms, this is a semiarid zone with annual rainfall of approximately
    400 mm. Despite this, 190,000 ha, 31% of the total crop area, is under irrigation;
    of this area, 51,000 ha are devoted to herbaceous crops and 91,000 to woody crops.
    The farm on which the experiment was conducted practises ecological agriculture,
    also known as biological or organic farming. This is a way of growing crops and
    caring for the land that is respectful of nature and normally excludes the use
    of chemicals (pesticides, herbicides, etc.) and genetically modified seeds (known
    as GMOs). The principal aim of this kind of farming is to preserve the environment,
    maintain or enhance the fertility of the soil and produce foods with their own
    natural properties. This company has a long tradition of organic farming and has
    been a pioneer in the growing of various types of horticultural produce (Rocket,
    Iceberg, Romaine, Mixed Salads, etc.). Its biggest market is in the United Kingdom.
    The farm is of medium size (1000 ha) with 250 crop fields spread over the Campo
    de Cartagena several kilometres apart from one another. As a specification of
    the research project 10 motes for monitoring the crop were considered, connected
    in star topology, with a Gateway Mote. Moreover, as the Gateway Mote has a stack
    where the received messages are stored and later processed using a task, more
    than 10 motes connected in star topology can be supported. Then, the ultimate
    aim of this work is to provide the farm with the infrastructure necessary, by
    crop, to ascertain crop water conditions in real time and make the appropriate
    decisions. A case study was defined with two sensor networks, each monitoring
    different parameters. The first network gathers temperature, moisture and salinity
    readings from the soil, while the second records the ambient temperature and humidity.
    In addition, an isolated wireless sensor was placed in a pond to measure the salinity
    of the water fed to the crops. These subnetworks and the isolated wireless sensor
    all send data via the appropriate gateway motes to a base station node located
    at the central farm offices, where the strategic decisions about crops are taken.
    To implement the different networks, specific, low-cost motes (about 150$ without
    sensors) were designed and developed, along with gateways linking the networks
    and the central offices. A monitoring application was also developed to control
    all the devices and keep a record of the information received in a relational
    database, which is used to make decisions about irrigation. Following this introduction,
    Section 2 describes the experimental scenario in which the sensor networks were
    deployed. Section 3 gives a detailed description, in terms of hardware and software,
    of the devices developed for implementation of the system. Section 4 outlines
    the possibilities offered by the monitoring software that was developed. Section
    5 details the technological and agronomic results. And finally, Section 6 presents
    a summary and future plans for continuation of this work. 2. Experimental scenario
    The agronomic problem as posed was addressed with the arrangement shown in Fig.
    1. This consists of two sensor networks and one isolated wireless sensor. The
    first sensor network consists of ten nodes called Soil Motes, each of which is
    connected to two Stevens Hydra Probe II sensors buried at depths of twenty or
    forty centimetres. These sensors can measure various soil characteristics such
    as temperature, volumetric moisture content, salinity and so on. The second network
    consists of ten nodes, called Environmental Motes, which measure the ambient temperature
    and humidity using Sensirion SHT71 sensors. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Illustration of field implementation of a horticultural crop monitoring
    network based on sensor networks. In addition to these sensor networks, a wireless
    sensor, called the Water Mote, was placed in one of the ponds used to water the
    farm. The purpose of this wireless sensor is to measure salinity on the basis
    of the electrical conductivity of the water and the temperature in order to determine
    the quality of the water used to irrigate the crops. The sensor used in this case
    is a Stevens EC 250. A long-range radio module is fitted to this sensor to allow
    direct communication with the base station 5.5 km away. The hardware and software
    implementation of these nodes is described in detail further below. Table 1 summarizes
    the principal features of the sensors. Table 1. Summary of principal features

    http://www.stevenswater.com/ The two sensor networks are respectively 5.2 and
    8.7 km away from the central computer. To assure wireless coverage of the system,
    Gateway Motes were developed incorporating long-range radio modules with the same
    technology as in the Water Mote. The nodes in each of these sensor networks are
    interconnected via IEEE 802.15.4. The reasons for the decision to use this standard
    are explained in the part of the following section specifying the software architecture.  When
    a message reaches the central computer through the Gateway, it is processed and
    its source and the information it contains are checked. On the basis of this information
    the message is stored in a relational database, where a historical record is kept
    of the data gathered by the sensors and the times of the readings. Table 2 summarizes
    the characteristics of the various different devices that have been developed
    and deployed on the farm. The following sections provide detailed descriptions
    of each of the motes that have been developed and the requirements and architecture
    of the monitoring application that was implemented. Table 2. Summary of devices

    chosen to deal with the problem as posed was to lay out two sensor networks with
    motes (Soil Mote, Environmental Mote, Gateway Mote), one wireless sensor to measure
    water quality and two motes in the central offices (a Repeater Mote on the roof
    and a Base Station Mote connected to the monitoring computer). The devices described
    in this paper were developed in the context of the ESNA (European Sensor Network
    Architecture) and RIMSI projects to satisfy the range requirements for network
    coverage (up to 10 km) and because there was no mote adapted to standard SDI-12
    (SDI, 2005) available on the agricultural instrument market. The chief requirements
    that were considered when designing these devices were: (1) a robust radio technology;
    (2) low-cost, low-consumption electronic devices; (3) use of long-lasting energy
    sources and reduced size (about 2700 mAh); and (4) use of input/output interfaces
    (SDI-12, I2C, 4–20 mA) to connect different types of external sensors. The hardware
    architecture, the sensors used, the functionality of the mote and the software
    components developed are detailed below for each of the motes. As result of the
    ESNA and RIMSI projects, there is a video online of the devices developed at http://www.dsie.upct.es/proyectos/projects.html.
    3.1. Soil Mote Fig. 2 shows details of the hardware and software implementation
    of the Soil Mote and its placement in the field. This mote consists of a microcontroller,
    a short-range radio transceiver, a SDI-12 interface, two DC/DC converters and
    a set of batteries (see Fig. 2a and b). All elements are contained in a watertight
    box with an IP67 protection rating. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.
    Various perspectives of the Soil Mote and Hydra Probe II sensor. The microcontroller
    chosen was the Texas Instruments Msp430F1611, which was programmed with TinyOS
    version 2 (Tiny, 2008) (Hill et al., 2000). The same microcontroller is used in
    all the other motes. The short-range radio module is a CC2420 (Chipcon), also
    from Texas Instruments. This module exchanges data with the Gateway Mote via wireless
    at 2.4 GHz with a bandwidth of 250 Kbps, following standard IEEE 802.15.4. The
    Gateway Mote acts as a gateway between the sensor network and the offices. The
    power supply consists of three AA NiMH 2700 mAh rechargeable batteries connected
    to a second DC/DC converter. This converter supplies 2.5 VDC for all the mote
    components. As we shall see in Section 5, these batteries last around 7 months,
    which is more than enough time for a normal farming season. Each mote is connected
    to two Stevens Hydra Probe II (HP2) sensors (see Fig. 2c) by way of the SDI-12
    interface. SDI-12 stands for Serial Data Interface at 1200 baud. This is a standard
    for interfacing battery-powered data recorders with microprocessor-based sensors
    designed for environmental data acquisition. The HP2 is an in situ soil sensing
    system that measures 22 different soil parameters simultaneously with digital
    output. It instantly calculates soil moisture, electrical conductivity/salinity
    and temperature. The Soil Mote monitors four parameters (soil temperature in °C,
    soil salinity in g/l of ClNa, volumetric percentage of moisture in the soil and
    soil conductivity with temperature correction in S/m) from the HP2 sensors; the
    sampling period can be configured by the user from the receiver PC, within a range
    of 30 min to about 48 h. Because sampling is normally hourly, it was decided to
    send the data read in each reading cycle, thus combining real-time data availability
    with reasonable power consumption. The device also monitors the battery levels
    and sends a signal when these reach critical level. This mote was programmed using
    the TinyOS 2.0 operating system and the associated nesC programming language (Gay
    et al., 2003), which are specific to the WSN domain. TinyOS is an operating environment
    designed to run on distributed embedded Wireless Sensor Networks. nesC is built
    as an extension to the C programming language with components “wired” together
    to run applications on TinyOS. Components are connected to each other using interfaces.
    TinyOS provides interfaces and components for common abstractions such as packet
    communication, routing, sensing, actuation and storage. TinyOS is a well-known
    alternative for the development of new WSN applications and also provides reusable
    components to assure reliable communications following standard IEEE 802.15.4
    and supports a lot of hardware (microcontrollers, transceivers, sensors). Moreover,
    there is an implementation of ZigBee (Open-ZB) written in nesC. In the beginning
    the authors do not know whether or not a Multi-Hop protocol will could be needed.
    For this, and other reasons, such as: (1) TinyOS is an open source code, (2) allows
    application software to access hardware directly when required, (3) the support
    for many hardware platforms, TinyOS was chosen to develop the software of motes
    applications. If an application strictly needs to communicate in a point-to-point
    or a point-to-multipoint fashion, 802.15.4 will be able to handle all the communications
    between the devices and it will be simpler to implement than trying to use a module
    with ZigBee to accomplish the same goal. ZigBee is necessary if the system needs
    to have repeating or mesh networking functionalities. In our case, IEEE 802.15.4
    was chosen for communication between the Soil Motes and the Gateway Mote because
    Multi-Hop communication was unnecessary thanks to the arrangement on the farm
    and the coverage provided by the radio modules. Fig. 2e shows a diagram of the
    components used to implement the mote using nesC. Note the different instances
    of the components and the different interfaces to the principal HP2C component.
    The HP2C component was developed to meet the functionality described above. All
    the other components are reused from the infrastructure supplied by TinyOS for
    access to timers, access to input/output ports, radio module, etc. Every time
    a component is reused, one or more instances of it are created and distinguished
    from one another by aliases. The entry-point to the programme is provided by the
    MainC component through the predefined Boot interface. Various different nesC
    components need to be instantiated for the programme to function: • TimerMilliC.
    To read the HP2 sensors, the operator must send a first start-reading command
    (timing set by Timer2) then wait for the response from the sensor, which will
    indicate when the data will be available. Once that time passes (Timer1), the
    data can be measured by sending a new read command (timing set by Timer3). In
    response to that command, the sensor sends the data that have been configured
    for reading and waits for a time (Timer0) before repeating the cycle. • AMSenderC.
    This component supplies the interfaces necessary to send radio messages to the
    Gateway Mote. The instances of this component, called SendData and SendAlarm,
    are used respectively to send the data readings and warn of a critical battery
    level. • CC2420ActiveMessageC. The sole instance of this component is used to
    enable/disable the radio module. It also provides the functionality necessary
    to work in low-consumption mode. • AMReceiver. This instance is used to receive
    messages from the Gateway Mote and modify the mote sampling period. • HplMsp430GeneralIOC.
    This instance provides access to the microcontroller ports in order to control
    the sensors and the DC/DC converter. • HplMsp430InterruptC. This instance facilitates
    handling of interruptions from the DC/DC converter in order to know when the battery
    level falls below the established threshold. • Msp430Uart1C. This is used to manage
    communications with the HP2 sensor by means of the SDI-12 protocol. • LedsC. The
    instance of this component encapsulates the hardware for the Mote''s LEDs; it
    is used to debug the application and ascertain its running status. Fig. 2d shows
    the mote in place on the farm with the characteristics mentioned. 3.2. Environmental
    Mote For ease of reading, hereafter we have left out those aspects that the other
    motes have in common with the Soil Mote and have only included details of new
    components and functionalities. The Environmental Motes (see Fig. 3) record the
    ambient temperature and humidity parameters for a crop. As we can see in Fig.
    3a and b, the mote''s architecture is similar to that of the Soil Mote, except
    for the interface with the external sensors. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. Various perspectives of the Environmental Mote. Each mote is connected
    via the I2C interface to a Sensirion SHT71 sensor (see Fig. 3c), which is placed
    inside a solar protection shield a metre and a half off the ground. These kinds
    of motes take readings of the cited parameters with a maximum parameterizable
    frequency of 2 readings/hour. The Environmental Motes are located within a radius
    of roughly one hundred metres around the Gateway Mote. The initial arrangement
    for this network consists of ten motes. Again, this mote was programmed using
    TinyOS. The SensirionSht11C component was used to meet the functionality described
    above. Besides, the Msp430ADC0C was used to sample the microcontroler''s ADC0
    analogical/digital converter in order to determine when the battery levels falls
    below a given threshold and send a low-batery alert. 3.3. Water Mote The Water
    Mote (see Fig. 4) measures the temperature and salinity of the water supplied
    to the crop from an irrigation pond. In this case the mote is connected directly
    with the offices by way of a long-range radio module (XStream X24-019PKI-RA radio
    modem) with an 8dBi omni-directional antenna for outdoor use. The rest of the
    architecture is very similar to that of the previous motes (see Fig. 4a and b).
    A Stevens EC 250 sensor is submerged in the pond. The two sensor outputs (temperature
    and salinity) are supplied in the form of a 4–20 mA signal; they are read by the
    microcontroller''s ADC0 and ADC1 converters after the current loop is passed through
    a resistor. These parameters are read with a maximum parameterizable frequency
    of 2 readings/hour. The mote is powered by a solar panel and is enclosed in a
    watertight box placed on the edge of the pond. Its antenna is located on a mast
    at a height of approximately four metres. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. Various perspectives of the Water Mote. The EC250C component was again
    developed with TinyOS to meet the functionality described above. In this implementation
    the components are as follows: • TimerMilliC. Every time the EC 250 sensor has
    to be read, a new reading cycle has to be performed (timer instance) by activating
    the DC/DC converter that powers the sensor for ten seconds. At the end of this
    time (Timer1) the measurement is transmitted from the two ADCs to which the sensor
    outputs are connected. Once there is a reading from the two ADCs the radio module
    is activated and there is a pause (Timer3) before the data are sent. In each reading
    cycle, once all the data have been sent (data plus battery alert if any), the
    long-range radio module remains activated for five seconds (Timer2) to listen
    for any sample period change message. At the end of this time the mote reverts
    to standby status pending a new reading cycle. • Msp430ADC0C and Msp430ADC1C.
    These afford access to the analogical/digital converters to which the sensor outputs
    are connected. • Msp430ADC2C. This instance is connected to the battery voltage
    via a resistive divider. • HplMsp430GeneralIOC. This affords access to the microcontroller
    ports necessary to control the DC/DC converter and the long-range radio module.
    • HplMsp430InterruptC. This generates a low-level pulse to signal that a radio
    message has been sent. • PlatformSerialC. Used to manage the input/output with
    the microcontroller UART to which the long-range radio module is connected. 3.4.
    Gateway, Base Station and Repeater Motes As we can see in Fig. 1, the device infrastructure
    required to interconnect the two sensor networks and the wireless sensor with
    the offices is as follows: (1) One Gateway Mote for each of the sensor networks,
    one of them based on Environmental Motes and the other on Soil Motes; (2) a Repeater
    Mote located on the office building roof; and (3) a Base Station Mote inside the
    offices, physically connected to the monitoring computer. Fig. 5a and b shows
    a detailed image of the Gateway Mote with a block diagram of the hardware architecture.
    The microcontroller communicates with the crop motes via a short-range radio module
    and with the Repeater Mote in the offices via a long-range radio module. The lifetime
    of the power supply is enough thanks to the use of rechargeable solar batteries.
    The solar panel is the model TPS 102/5 (12 V, 5 W) from Zodiac Solar, which is
    installed at an angle of 30°. In the worst case, the average solar irradiance
    in Cartagena during the test for that angle was 4600 Wh/m2. The consumption of
    the gateway is 7.8 Wh. Therefore, the panel provided more energy than the mote
    consumed. Fig. 5c shows the mote attached to the mast on the farm. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 5. Various perspectives of the Gateway Mote. To
    ensure that the Base Station Mote has adequate coverage, the main antenna is located
    on the office roof at a height of roughly nine metres. Wireless connection between
    the main antenna and the base station mote is also achieved via the Repeater Mote.
    The Base Station Mote gathers all the information generated by the sensor network
    (with the help of the repeater mote) and transmits it to the monitoring application
    which was developed to handle that network. Similarly, it broadcasts any order
    from the software application over the sensor network. This mote is composed of
    a long-range radio module (2.4 GHz) connected to a 3dBi omni-directional antenna,
    and a RS-232 interface for connection to the central computer. The Repeater Mote
    is a commercial radio modem configured in repeater mode, which is connected to
    an 8dBi omni-directional antenna. This provides up to 16 km line-of-sight coverage
    in the open. 4. Monitoring application The monitoring application is integrated
    by: (1) a graphical user interface (GUI) where the data read by the sensors is
    shown, and (2) a program that receives and stores data from the nodes. Both programs
    were developed using the Java programming language, with the Eclipse environment
    and the MySQL relational database management system. The essential features of
    these applications as developed may be summarized as follows: 1. The GUI includes
    the placement of devices using the utility supplied by Google Maps. In this way
    we can identify the exact geographic position of each node and the crop in which
    it is located (see Fig. 6). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Main view
    of monitoring application. 2. The data read by the sensors are sent periodically
    to the base station and stored within the database (the program waits for an event
    indicating data available at the serial port). The GUI will read these data and
    visualize them graphically in real time. In addition, the sampling period can
    be modified from the user application. 3. The database includes details about
    the deployed nodes, their aggregations into regions, the sensors integrated in
    every node, the historic record of the readings, the types of sensors, and the
    history of alarms received from the sensors and regions (for example battery failure,
    values lower than a threshold, etc.). A menu bar at the top provides the options
    noted above (see Fig. 6). On the right of the screen a Google Map has been used
    to depict the geographic position of the deployed nodes. On the left there are
    three tables displaying the latest data readings from the sensors for the three
    networks shown on the right. Below the tables a graphic display of the data for
    a user-selected time interval, or the latest data gathered is provided. Both the
    soil and the environmental motes provide the following services: changing the
    sampling period of the sensors and configuring the device to send data from the
    battery every hour. They also trigger an alert signal if the battery charge is
    critically low. Moreover, the soil mote also provides other services, such as:
    setting the soil type, configuring the measure data set, setting the water constant
    and establishing the warm-up time. Note that all the services are provided by
    using a special combination of the data sent to set the sampling period. 5. Results
    The methodological approach that has been followed to achieve the objectives proposed
    consists of two phases, the first in the laboratory and the second in the field.
    In the first phase all the subnetworks were deployed (with only four nodes in
    the case of the Soil Mote and Environmental Mote subnetworks) along with the two
    Gateway Motes and the Base Station and Repeater Motes. The main function of this
    phase was to validate the proposed hardware and software solutions. The hardware
    was validated with software versions that did not use low-consumption techniques.
    Once proper functioning was assured, the next step was to review the software
    in order to incorporate low-consumption modes in all the motes except those powered
    from the mains (Base Station and Repeater Motes). In this way we achieved sufficient
    autonomy to ensure that the motes would function throughout a horticultural cycle
    (10 weeks). The object of the second phase, which was conducted in real conditions
    on the farm, was to assess the functional performance of the devices that had
    been developed, such as range, robustness and flexibility. To achieve an adequate
    assessment of the results of implementation of the system as developed, these
    were analysed from the following standpoints: (1) from the standpoint of the devices
    developed and the technology used; and (2) from an agricultural standpoint. Each
    of these aspects is discussed below, with special emphasis on the most important
    points. 5.1. Results as regards devices After functional validation in the laboratory,
    the devices that had been developed were reprogrammed in low-consumption mode
    as the mode best suited for operation in the field. A detailed study of this mode
    of operation was therefore necessary to assure autonomy throughout an agricultural
    cycle. Presented below is the study that was carried out for the Soil Mote: The
    study was the same for all the other motes. The Soil Mote has four functional
    states: rest, radio on standby for messages, sensor data recording and data transmission.
    Fig. 7 shows the mote''s power consumption in each of these states. For its part
    Table 3 lists the times and the power consumption of the mote in each of these
    states. The worst-case scenario was taken for average consumption, that is acquisition
    and transmission of data from the two sensors every thirty minutes. The ultimate
    aim of this study was to determine how much power the mote consumed on average,
    so as to relate the resulting figure directly to the capacity of the batteries
    and hence determine the device''s autonomy. The mote''s average power consumption
    may be determined thus: (1) where (2) (3) (4) (5) Expression (2) indicates the
    standby consumption. Eq. (3) expresses the mote''s average consumption in receiving
    mode for a 15 ms pulse every 10 s. Eqs. (4), (5) reflect a similar calculation,
    only multiplied by two, which is the number of sensors connected to each mote.
    Expression (1) gives the average current consumption of the Soil Mote, which is
    approximately 0.5035 mA. Since the soil mote batteries are 2700 mA/H, their estimated
    autonomy is 223 days, enough to assure proper functioning throughout an agricultural
    or horticultural season. The consumption studies for the other devices followed
    the same process as in the case of the Soil Mote. For a summary of the results,
    see Table 3. As for consumption by the nodes after placement in the field, over
    the nine weeks that the validation tests lasted, no low-battery alert was received
    from any of the devices, indicating that the solar panels worked properly and
    validating the consumption estimates. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    Mote (Environmental Motes) 20 80 5000 NA NA 150 1200 23.2222 6500 11 To provide
    coverage for the devices, the base station mote was placed inside the office with
    a 3dBi omni-directional antenna. Because of coverage conditions in the building,
    a repeater mote had to be placed on the roof from the outset. This provided coverage
    of up to 10 km between the repeater mote and the motes equipped with XStream (Gateway
    and Water Motes). All were fitted with outdoor 8dBi omni-directional antennas,
    mounted on four-metre-tall masts to avoid any obstacles. Once the Gateway Motes
    for the sensor networks were positioned, the maximum coverage was 50 m between
    the Soil Motes and the Gateway Mote and 100 m for the Environmental Motes. The
    Soil Motes were placed within a horticultural crop, and so the sensors had to
    be buried 20 or 40 cm deep because of the profusion of roots. Unlike the Environmental
    Motes, the Soil Motes are placed at ground level and hence give poorer coverage.
    When the Soil Motes were first installed, the tops of the crop were barely above
    the ground, and so the Motes worked perfectly. However, they stopped working some
    months later when the crop started to grow upwards. This problem was solved by
    replacing the original antennas with 3dBi omni-directional versions. 5.2. Agricultural
    results The validation tests were conducted on a crop of ecological pointed cabbage
    (Brassica oleracea L. var. Capitata) covering an area of 4 ha, located in the
    Campo de Cartagena (37°44′26″N, 1°13′38″W) in the south–east of Spain. The seedlings
    were transplanted (with a population density of 7 plants/m2) in the last week
    of February 2008 and the crop was harvested 10 weeks later, in the second week
    of May 2008. The soil characteristics of the crop at 40 cm depth were: clay loam
    texture, total carbonates 35.4 p.100, P(Olsen) 78.6 ppm, K(Ac-NH4) 487.0 ppm.
    The drip irrigation system was laid in between the two rows of crop and 1 l/h
    emitters were installed each 0.20 m. Fertilizer was applied to the crop using
    fertirrigation. The nodes were deployed in the first week of March, at which time
    the owners of the farm began to gather data from the WSNs. The soil mote sensors
    were placed at 20 cm and 40 cm depth. During this time there was 80 mm cumulative
    rainfall, moderately strong winds of up to 65 km/h and mild temperatures (average
    15.2 °C). Fig. 8 shows the data (soil moisture and air temperature) collected
    throughout a 10-week period. The Hydra Probe sensors provide accurate soil moisture
    measurements in units of water fraction by volume (wfv or m3 m−3). That is, a
    percentage of water in the soil displayed in decimal form. For example, a water
    content of 0.20 wfv means that a one litre soil sample contains 200 ml of water.
    Full saturation (all the soil pore spaces filled with water) occurs typically
    between 0.5 and 0.6 wfv and is quite soil dependent. The nodes were found to function
    properly. This provides some assurance of the robustness of the arrangement for
    similar weather conditions. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Registered
    data from a 10-week monitoring process. Before this technology was introduced,
    the company monitored its crops in the traditional way, that is a person visited
    the crop and the pond to measure the relevant agronomic parameters with appropriate
    portable equipment. Now, with the technology that has been developed, crop variables
    can be ascertained in real time, and as a result the water requirements of the
    crops can be estimated without anyone having to visit them. The farm team could
    monitor in real time that the optimum conditions for the cabbage growing were
    preserved (salinity in the range 2–4 mmhos/cm, temperature between 10 °C and 24
    °C, and relative humidity in the range 60–90%). 6. Summary The wireless sensor
    network described here offers a real opportunity for monitoring soil and environment
    status in a crop. The system permitted to successfully monitor a crop of ecological
    cabbage for the entire growing season with the required precision. The farm team
    is now capable of gathering more comprehensive and accurate data in both space
    and time. Thus, the agriculture production system have benefited from incorporation
    of technological advances in the field of communications and information technologies.
    The capacity of WSN devices to collect measured values in broad ranges of soil
    and environmental conditions has been a fundamental requirement to the design
    of the system. An obvious advantage of WSN technology is a significant reduction
    and simplification in wiring and faster deployment, unlimited installation flexibility
    for sensors, and a better mobility. Despite the great potentials of this technology
    some obstacles have been detected (lack of experienced staff for troubleshooting,
    high cost for the sensors, power supply as a great concern, etc.). The good results
    obtained serve as stimuli to adapt the deployed infrastructure to other contexts,
    incorporating new soil and environment parameters, and to different sort of horticultural
    crops. The main effort needed to reuse the infrastructure in different contexts
    has to do with the maximum distance allowed between the farm offices and gateways
    (up to 10 km). For the medium term it is intended to develop an expert system
    to assist irrigation management incorporating the climate (ET) and soil water
    balance models necessary to estimate crop water requirements, optimized irrigation
    programming and capacity to manipulate the irrigation devices remotely. Acknowledgements

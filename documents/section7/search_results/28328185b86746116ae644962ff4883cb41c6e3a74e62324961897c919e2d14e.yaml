    rights and content Highlights • Evaluated groundwater potentiality of a water
    scarce semi-arid region of east India. • Adopted AHP method to delineate the groundwater
    potential map of the study area. • Cross-validated the predicted result using
    Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. • Analyzed multicollinearity and sensitivity
    of the input thematic layers. • ~35.38% of the study area is vulnerable to semi-critical/critical
    water scarcity. Abstract Over-extraction of groundwater has compromised its climatic
    resilience properties and the arid/semi-arid rural tracts are becoming increasingly
    vulnerable to the risks of groundwater scarcity. This study has employed a combination
    of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP)
    techniques to delineate the Groundwater Potential Zones (GPZs) of the semi-arid
    Birbhum district in eastern India which suffers from seasonal drought during lean
    periods. For a reliable evaluation, a large number of thematic layers (N = 12)
    including geology, geomorphology, Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), fault and lineament
    density, drainage density, rainfall, soil type, slope, roughness, topographic
    wetness index, topographic position index and curvature were considered for this
    assessment. Multicollinearity and consistency checks were performed prior integrating
    the layers to avoid a non-trivial degree of accuracy in prediction output. The
    GPZ map was obtained with an accuracy of 80.49% with respect to the observation
    tube well data. Based on the obtained output, 38.24%, 24.24% and 11.14% of areas
    of the district classified as moderate, poor, and very poor GPZs, respectively,
    whereas only 26.38% of the district classified as high to very high GPZs. Cross-validation
    using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve revealed a good prediction accuracy
    of 71.50%. Furthermore, map removal and single parameter sensitivity analysis
    was also performed which revealed geology, geomorphology, soil types, rainfall,
    LULC and lineament density as the most influential parameters for the prediction
    model where exclusion of any thematic layer significantly changes the prediction
    accuracy and area of each GPZ class. The most convincing GPZs are recorded in
    some parts of the Mayurakshi and Ajay river basins and certain alluvial aquifer
    regions. Nonetheless, the study recommends the adaptation of Managed Aquifer Recharge
    techniques including rainwater harvesting, alternative cropping patterns and irrigation
    techniques such as sprinklers, drips and micro irrigations to increase the groundwater
    potential of the water crisis zones. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res

    1. Introduction Groundwater is a vital source of freshwater used to sustain life
    on earth. It is utilized for various purposes such as drinking, agricultural and
    industrial activities around the globe. Around 2.5 billion people worldwide depend
    solely on groundwater resources to satisfy their daily needs for water (UNESCO,
    2015). In India, more than 60% of irrigated agriculture and 85% of drinking water
    supplies are dependent on groundwater. According to a world bank report, India
    withdraws an estimated 230 km3 of groundwater per year (World Bank, 2012). Importantly,
    irrigation with groundwater has been a source of livelihood security for farmers
    and has also been essential in maintaining drought resilience and food security
    across the country. Indeed, the success of the Green Revolution in India has often
    been attributed to assured irrigation from groundwater. Nevertheless, approximately
    0.6 million people in the nation still live under severe water scarcity, particularly
    during the summer, and 75% of the population in the country still lack access
    to potable water in their premises. The situation is far worse in arid and semiarid
    regions where the populations are highly dependent on groundwater since, in such
    regions, surface water and precipitation is scarce and unevenly distributed (Luo
    et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2019). Groundwater resources serve as the main source
    of drinking water in the rural regions of India due to the unavailability of piped
    drinking water or a safe drinking water supply. Additionally, urban residents
    increasingly rely on groundwater due to unreliable and inadequate water supplies
    (Mukherjee and Singh, 2018a). Groundwater is considered a safer water source in
    comparison to surface water, as it is purified and protected by the vadose zone
    of the earth (Subba Rao et al., 2018). The Birbhum district is a semi-arid region
    of West Bengal, India (Fig. 1) where residents of four blocks (namely, Murarai-II,
    Nalhati-II, Nanoor and Rampurhat-II) out of nineteen blocks are facing acute water
    scarcity. Although several rivers are flowing through the district (Fig. 2), and
    it receives substantial rainfall primarily during monsoon season, the district
    is recognized as a historically drought-prone region due to its undulating terrain
    capped with widespread laterite and lateritic soils (due to its higher permeability)
    which generates huge runoff, followed by a quick return of water into the atmosphere
    owing to higher evaporation rate (Mukherjee et al., 2019). Furthermore, the rivers
    are rainfed and non-perennial. Throughout the non-rainy seasons, the rivers become
    almost dry and during summer periods, small streams trickle down the center of
    the rivers. On the other hand, throughout the rainy season, rivers expand and
    flow with immense velocity. Areas with limited water located nearby are aided
    by the construction of river barrages and canals that provide a source of water
    for drinking and irrigation (Rudra, 2018). Nevertheless, such water supplies are
    inadequate during lean seasons, compelling the residents to use groundwater for
    drinking, cooking, irrigation and other domestic purposes. The demand for groundwater
    in the district has been increasing over the years, mainly due to irrigational
    activities which have created a significant water crisis in several regions of
    the district owing to a groundwater withdrawal rate that is higher than the groundwater
    recharge rate in unconfined and semi-confined aquifer zones (Mukherjee and Singh,
    2018b). Therefore, it is essential to identify the groundwater potential zones
    of the district to develop a sustainable water resource system, planning and management
    in the area. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 2. (a) Hydrogeological and (b) elevation map and drainage network of Birbhum
    district. Groundwater exploration in a region is a challenging task as it is a
    hidden natural resource and not easily detectable. Amongst all methods, drilling
    tests and stratigraphy investigations are popular and widely used to identify
    borewell location and aquifer thickness. However, these methods involve higher
    cost and time (Patra et al., 2018). Exploration using integration of Remote Sensing
    (RS) and the Geographical Information System (GIS) has gained special attention
    recently as it is an economic, efficient, effective and less time-consuming method.
    Researchers have employed various RS and GIS-based techniques such as multi-influencing
    factor (Anbarasu et al., 2019), decision tree (Duan et al., 2016, Lee and Lee,
    2015), frequency ratio (Guru et al., 2017, Lee et al., 2019, Trabelsi et al.,
    2019), artificial neural network (Corsini et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2018), random
    forest (Chen et al., 2020, Golkarian et al., 2018), logistic regression (Kim et
    al., 2019, Park et al., 2017), weights of evidence (Lee et al., 2012, Pourtaghi
    and Pourghasemi, 2014), fuzzy logic (Aouragh et al., 2017, Cameron and Peloso,
    2001) and entropy (Al-Abadi et al., 2017) models to demarcate the groundwater
    potential zones. However, the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was found
    to be an effective, reliable and convenient method for delineation of groundwater
    potential zones, therefore it was adopted for the present study. Several studies
    (Ajay Kumar et al., 2020, Al-Djazouli et al., 2020, Dar et al., 2020, Jahan et
    al., 2019, Kindie et al., 2019, Murmu et al., 2019, Rahmati et al., 2015) have
    adopted this method where weight assignment and classifications of the thematic
    layers was performed based on prior knowledge and site specific settings. The
    aforementioned studies were performed based on arbitrarily selected basic thematic
    layers (usually N = 5–8) such as lithology, lineament density, geomorphology,
    slope, soil, rainfall, drainage density and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), and the
    selection of the layers varies across the studies (Table 1). To attain a significantly
    higher accuracy from the model, the present study has evaluated the groundwater
    potential zones of the study area based on a higher number (N = 12) of thematic
    layers (such as LULC, geology, geomorphology, soil types, drainage density, slope,
    rainfall, roughness, curvature, lineaments, topographic wetness index and topographic
    position index) that directly/indirectly control the groundwater yield potential
    of a region. Moreover, the previous analogous studies have paid no attention to
    the multicollinearity analysis of the thematic layers. In this study, the thematic
    layers have undergone multicollinearity checks prior to their integration with
    the aim of improving the prediction accuracy of the model. The improvement in
    accuracy is achieved by determining the most influential thematic layers and excluding
    those which are redundant. This technique has also been applied by other RS/GIS-based
    models including landslide susceptibility (Chen et al., 2018, Mind’je et al.,
    2019), soil erosion susceptibility (Abdulkadir et al., 2019, Arabameri et al.,
    2019) and soil properties prediction (Forkuor et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2019),
    in order to minimize uncertainties. To identify the influential thematic layers
    in the model output, the study has performed the single parameter (Napolitano
    and Fabbri, 1996) and map removal (Lodwick et al., 1990) sensitivity analysis.
    These methods have been applied by a few groundwater and aquifer vulnerability
    assessments which are not based on the AHP technique (Awawdeh et al., 2015, Sadat-Noori
    and Ebrahimi, 2016, Souleymane and Zhonghua, 2017). Furthermore, the study validated
    the model output using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) cross-validation
    method (Hanley and McNeil, 1982) and by comparing the model output with the actual
    groundwater prospects of the observation wells obtained through in-situ measurements.
    In light of all these, the present study may play a significant role in the sustainable
    management of groundwater in the study area by accurately predicting the groundwater
    potential and evaluating the degree of correlation between the groundwater potential
    zones and associated sensitive parameters, which makes this study unique and novel
    for the study area. The main purposes of the study are to (a) develop the GIS
    and AHP technique-based model in order to demarcate and map the groundwater potential
    zones of the district after performing the multicollinearity check, (b) assess
    the performance of the prediction model, and (c) identify the influential thematic
    layers for groundwater potential of the study area. This study will be helpful
    for the planners, regulators, policymakers and local authorities to reduce the
    groundwater vulnerability in this area through proper utilization and management
    practices. Table 1. Literature review of identification of the Groundwater Potential

    district is part of the lower Ganga basin, situated on the north-western side
    of rarh Bengal, India, and located between 23°32′30″N (right above the tropic
    of cancer) to 24°35′00″N latitudes and 87°05′25″E to 88°01′40″E longitudes (Fig.
    1). The district encompasses a total area of about 4550 km2 and is composed of
    nineteen blocks and 2479 villages (Fig. 2a). According to Census (2011), the total
    population of the district was about 3.5 million, including a 3.4 million rural
    population. The study area experiences a dry sub-humid, sub-tropical climatic
    condition with a mean annual temperature of 26 °C and annual rainfall of 1300–1420
    mm. The area remains hot and dry during the summer (April–June) with temperatures
    soaring to 40 °C and above, occasionally reaching up to 45 °C, whereas in the
    winter (December–February), temperatures fall to 10 °C or below. The study area
    experiences moderate to high rainfall during monsoon season (June–September),
    which constitutes about 75–78% of the annual rainfall. There is a decreasing trend
    of rainfall in the study area in the northwest to southeast direction. Thereafter,
    the relative humidity ranges from 43 to 83%. The air is highly humid (75–83%)
    during the southwest monsoon season. Thereafter the relative humidity decreases
    progressively. The annual potential evapotranspiration varies from 1400 to 1600
    mm, which is higher than the annual average rainfall of the district. 2.2. Selection
    of the thematic layers GIS-based techniques were adopted for this study to outline
    the Groundwater Potential Zones (GPZs) of the Birbhum district using a knowledge-based
    multi-criteria analysis of several parameters (thematic layers) of the study area,
    namely LULC, local geology, geomorphology, soil types, drainage density, slope,
    rainfall, roughness, curvature, lineaments, the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
    and the Topographic Position Index (TPI) as groundwater occurrences and mobility
    are explicitly or implicitly governed/determined by these factors, as described
    below. Local geological and hydrogeological settings of a region play a crucial
    role in the occurrence of groundwater and its spatial distribution. The water
    holding capacity and recharge/discharge capability of a geological formation and
    aquifer layer are highly influenced by the aquifer characteristics (such as porosity,
    permeability and transmissivity), interconnectivity and rock types exposed to
    the surface and surface water sources (Mukherjee and Singh, 2020, Yeh et al.,
    2016). Cultivation fields with good vegetation density and forests play important
    roles in groundwater recharge of a region as they reduce the evaporation rate,
    prevent water loss through absorption via roots, prevent run-off and improve the
    infiltration rate (Mukherjee and Singh, 2018c). Furthermore, plant roots provide
    a pathway (through biological decomposition) for groundwater recharge and surface/rainwater
    leaching (Bayala and Prieto, 2019). Water bodies are also a good source of groundwater
    recharge. However, the infiltration rate is very low in rural and urban settlements
    and wasteland regions (Wakode et al., 2018). Because of this, LULC influences
    groundwater infiltration/recharge and the soil moisture of a region, therefore
    it was considered for this assessment. Moreover, geomorphological features of
    a region help to understand the spatial occurrence of various landforms as well
    as topographic information including the sub-surface movement of groundwater (Kumar
    and Krishna, 2018, Mukherjee et al., 2020). Percolation of surface water or rainwater
    through the soil layer to the groundwater is highly controlled by the porosity
    of the soil layers of a region, which is highly associated with the saturation
    level, adsorption capacity, voids ratio and impurities of the soils (Mukherjee
    and Singh, 2020). As such, geomorphological settings and soil types are also essential
    parameters for groundwater potential assessment. Rainfall is a critical component
    of the hydrological process of a region as it is the source of water for the surface
    water bodies and groundwater recharge through the percolation of water. In addition,
    rainfall also determines groundwater fluctuation in a region, however, the percolation
    depends on the intensity and duration of rainfall. Rainfall with short-duration
    and high-intensity results in less percolation due to higher surface runoff whereas
    long-duration and low-intensity rainfall results in higher percolation due to
    less surface runoff (Ibrahim-Bathis and Ahmed, 2016). The district is situated
    in the discharge zone of the several rainfed and non-perennial rivers/rivulets
    and canals. Rainfall is the primary source of groundwater recharge of the district.
    Furthermore, drainage density divides the landscape by its channels and is considered
    an inverse function of permeability (Mageshkumar et al., 2019). Therefore, regions
    with high drainage density are influenced by surface run-off and poor groundwater
    recharge. However, less drainage density in a region indicates high groundwater
    recharge and significant groundwater potential. Consequently, rainfall and drainage
    density are also crucial components for this assessment. Slope controls the surface
    runoff and vertical infiltration of water, especially rainwater; hence it is a
    crucial parameter for groundwater recharge. Infiltration of rainwater and surface
    water of a region is inversely correlated with the slope gradient. A higher slope
    provides insufficient residence time to infiltrate the rainwater/surface water
    due to rapid surface runoff and an augmented erosion rate (Ahmed and Mansor, 2018,
    Yang et al., 2019). Therefore, steeper slopes are responsible for very poor groundwater
    recharge. In contrast, flat to decent slopes provide higher retention time for
    rainwater/surface water infiltration and are responsible for a higher groundwater
    recharge yield. Terrain heterogeneity is also another important parameter to predict
    the groundwater potential of a region. The topographical undulation of a region
    is measured using roughness (Riley et al., 1999). A higher value of roughness
    indicates greater undulation which is a characteristic of hilly/rocky regions
    resulting in higher surface runoff and lower water percolation and groundwater
    recharge. Furthermore, curvature determines the rate of change in slope gradient
    or aspect in a direction. A topographic curvature profile can represent an upward
    convex surface (positive curvature), upwardly concave surface (negative curvature),
    or a flat surface (zero curvature) (Vijith and Dodge-Wan, 2019). Considering the
    heterogenous undulating topography and slope gradient of the study area, roughness
    and curvature have been chosen for the present assessment. Lineaments are anatomically
    controlled by the curvilinear and linear topographies and represent the faults,
    joints and fractures of a region. These features are hydro-geologically crucial
    because they act as conduits for groundwater movement and increase the secondary
    porosity and permeability of a geological zone, especially in hard rock terrains
    (Bagyaraj et al., 2013, Jahan et al., 2019). Lineaments are conducive to a high
    percolation rate of water; hence regions near to lineaments and their intersections
    are considered favorable for groundwater storage and the intensity of groundwater
    decreases with remoteness from the lineaments. Several buried faults, folds and
    lineaments are found across the study area, especially in the gneissic basement
    of the Bakreswar geothermal province which allow the groundwater to circulate
    through the deep granitic-gneissic aquifer zone with a long residence period (Mukherjee
    et al., 2019). Furthermore, the hot-springs water of the Bakreswar geothermal
    province is basically deep circulating meteoric groundwater. The hot-springs were
    rejuvenated elsewhere in the Chotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex (CGGC) in the
    early 1950s during the pre-bomb tritium period (Majumdar et al., 2009, Majumdar
    et al., 2005). Surface water and rainwater infiltration/run-off and groundwater
    recharge can also be determined by the TWI and TPI of a region. The TWI is typically
    used to assess the role of topographic control on hydrological processes and considered
    as a secondary topographical attribute of the wetness conditions of a region.
    This index represents the water accumulation tendency in a catchment and the propensity
    to move the water downslope due to gravitational forces (Ghorbani Nejad et al.,
    2017, Rinderer et al., 2014). Therefore, a higher value of the TWI reflects potential
    groundwater infiltration and groundwater recharge, caused by the effects of topography.
    On the other hand, the TPI is a widely used method for determining landform classifications
    and as an indicator of topographic slopes (Mokarram et al., 2015). Based on this
    index value, a region can be classified into ridgetops, hilltops or mid-slope
    (TPI > a certain threshold), valley bottoms or depressions (TPI < a certain threshold)
    and flat plains (TPI = ~0) (Nair et al., 2018). A higher value of this index indicates
    higher surface runoff and lower infiltration, hence poor groundwater recharge.

    methodology. 2.3. Data acquisition and thematic layers preparation Remote sensing
    data were obtained from the online archive database from the National Remote Sensing
    Centre (NRSC) available at http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in and pre-processed using ERDAS
    imagine (v16.1) and Geomatica (v2016) image processing software. ESRI ArcGIS (v10.4)
    software was used to carry out the graphical information techniques. The geological
    and geomorphological maps (scale 1:50,000) of the district were obtained from
    the Geological Survey of India (GSI, Kolkata) and scanned. The soil type and rainfall
    maps (scale 1:50,000) of the study area were obtained from the district planning
    map series of the National Atlas and Thematic Mapping Organization (NATMO). The
    maps were georeferenced using Georeferencing tools and digitized using the ArcScan
    tool from the ArcGIS software to create their thematic layers. The LULC map was
    prepared from Resourcesat-1 LISS-III (24 m) satellite data obtained from Bhuvan
    using ArcGIS software. The bands of the satellite images were combined to create
    a single raster using the Image Analysis tool and classified using the Maximum
    Likelihood Classification method (Image Classification tool) to obtain the LULC
    thematic layer. Furthermore, Cartosat-1 (spatial resolution of 2.5 m) Stereo Data
    satellite images (CartoDEM; 16 bits/pixel) were also obtained from Bhuvan to create
    the remaining thematic layers. The images obtained from Bhuvan were divided into
    multiple toposheets for the study area. Thereafter, the toposheets were merged
    using the Raster Dataset tool (Raster module) and then extracted according to
    the boundary of the study area using Raster Processing tools (Raster module).
    The DEM was projected to WGS 1984 UTM to coordinate the system (Zone 45 N) and
    processed further to create the other thematic layers. The slope and curvature
    layers were created from the projected DEM layer using the Surface function from
    the Spatial analyst tool. In order to create the roughness layer, minimum (FSmin),
    maximum (FSmax) and mean (FSmean) Focal Statistical layers were prepared using
    the Neighborhood tool and then Eq. (1) (Evans, 1972) with the support of the Raster
    Calculator (Map Algebra tool). (1) Drainage density (Dd) of a drainage basin represents
    the stream length per unit area and is calculated using Eq. (2) (Horton, 1932),
    which represents the extent of channelization of the study area. (2) where L is
    the total length of all channels and Ad is the area of the drainage basin. To
    create the drainage density map, a drainage network map was created using a set
    of functions from the Hydrology module (Spatial analyst tool), namely, Fill, Flow
    direction, Flow accumulation, Stream Order and Stream to Feature. However, the
    lineaments layer was created from the LISS-III raster using the automatic extraction
    method and complied with the lineament and fault density map obtained from Bhuvan.
    Line Density function from the Density module (Spatial analyst tool) was applied
    on the stream feature and lineaments and created the drainage density and lineaments
    density thematic layers, respectively. TWI was prepared based on the TOPMODEL
    index using Eq. (3) (Guisan et al., 1999, Weiss, 2001). (3) where α refers to
    the upslope contributing area and β refers to the topographic gradient of the
    slope. The TPI thematic layer was prepared using the Jenness algorithm (Jenness,
    2006) through application of the Topography tools extension. All raster thematic
    layers underwent transformation to a 12.5 resolution utilizing the resample technique
    from the GIS platform. 2.4. Multicollinearity checks Multicollinearity is a statistical
    problem in a multiple regression model where at least one input parameter (independent/predictor
    variable) of the model is highly correlated with a combination of the other input
    parameters (independent/predictor variables). It indicates that one input parameter
    can be linearly predicted from another input parameter of a model (for example,
    slope and slope aspects) which will result in a non-trivial degree of accuracy
    in the model output. Therefore, prior to running the regression model, it is necessary
    to validate the multicollinearity among the input parameters. To assess this validation,
    a linear regression analysis is performed where an input parameter (say Xi) is
    considered as the dependent variable and remaining input variables are considered
    as the independent variables and the R2 value is calculated (say, Ri2). This value
    is further used to calculate the tolerance and variance inflation factor (VIF)
    of that input variable using Eqs (4) and (5), respectively (Myers et al., 2010).
    (4) (5) The steps are repeated for each input parameter, and tolerance and VIF
    are calculated for the respective input variable. A tolerance of <0.10 or VIF
    of ≥10 indicate multicollinearity problems (Saha, 2017). Thematic layers with
    tolerance level <0.10 or VIF value ≥10 need to be excluded this assessment. To
    assess the multicollinearity issue among the thematic layers, 400 points (N =
    400) were selected randomly from the study area using the ‘Create Random Points’
    tool (package: Data management tools; toolset: Feature class) and data was extracted
    from each thematic layer for those randomly selected points using the ‘Extract
    Values to Points’ tool (package: Spatial analyst tools; toolset: Extraction) in
    the GIS platform. The test was performed using SPSS (v25) software. The same validation
    could have also been performed in the GIS platform using the ‘r.covar’ tool from
    the Grass GIS (v7.6.1) software, however, the present study preferred the above
    method as it is a common and widely used method to check multicollinearity of
    a GIS regression model (Table 2). Table 2. Collinearity statistics of the groundwater
    potentiality determining parameters. # Thematic layer Tolerance VIF # Thematic

    Hierarchical Process (Saaty, 1987) is a useful multi-criteria decision-solving
    method to delineate GPZs, hence it was employed for this study. The thematic layers
    were integrated using this method as these layers are considered influential factors
    that control the water storage and flow in a region. However, the influence of
    every layer was not the same. Therefore, a relative weight was assigned to each
    thematic layer according to Saaty’s scale from 1 to 9 (Table 3), their criticality
    and their water holding capacity. Assessing the criticality of a thematic layer
    over another is a knowledge-driven process and the backbone of AHP. Thus, the
    relative weights were assigned based on previous studies on other geographical
    regions and field experience. The detailed steps of the methodology can be found
    elsewhere (Mu and Pereyra-Rojas, 2017). Table 3. Saaty’s scale of preference between
    two parameters in AHP. Scale Degree of preference Description 1 Equally When two
    parameters contribute equally to the objective 2 Intermediate Preference between
    1 and 3 3 Moderately The judgment slightly-to-moderately favor one parameter 4
    Intermediate Preference between 3 and 5 5 Strongly The judgment strongly or essentially
    favors one parameter 6 Intermediate Preference between 5 and 7 7 Very strongly
    Very strong preference or importance 8 Intermediate Preference between 7 and 9
    9 Extremely Quite preferred or quite important The pairwise comparison matrix
    with intensity judgments was prepared for the thematic layers as illustrated in
    Table 4. The geology, geomorphology, soil types and LULC thematic layers were
    classified based on their formations/categories. The rainfall thematic layer was
    classified by NATMO based on the criteria defined by the India Meteorological
    Department (IDM), Government of India. The percentage deviations from the long
    mean rainfall >−60%, −60% to −20%, −19% to 19%, 20% to 60% and >60% are categorized
    as very low, low, medium, high and very high rainfall zones (Bhatla et al., 2019,
    Dave and James, 2017, MoSPI, 2016). The drainage density of the district is classified
    as coarse drainage texture (<4 km/km2), according to drainage density classification
    criteria defined by Smith (1950) and coarse to very coarse texture (very coarse:
    <2 km/km2 and coarse: 2–4 km/km2), according to the modified drainage density
    classification criteria (Aldharab et al., 2019). However, a >2 km/km2 drainage
    texture was recorded in a very small portion of the study area. Therefore, the
    present study has classified the drainage density layer into five categories based
    on natural break method in the GIS platform. Moreover, the aforementioned analogous
    studies have also classified the drainage density thematic layer based on certain
    arbitrary ranges or the natural break method and obtained satisfactory accuracy
    in model output. The slope thematic layer was classified into five sub-classes
    based on the SOTER model (Elewa and Qaddah, 2011). Roughness was classified into
    five sub-classes based on the roughness classification criteria defined by Wieringa
    (1992). A curvature value of <0 indicates a convex surface whereas curvature values
    = 0 and > 0 represent flat and concave surfaces, respectively (Al-Abadi et al.,
    2016, Benjmel et al., 2020). The present study has divided each of the concave
    and convex surfaces of the district into two subclasses based on the mean value
    of positive curvature values and mean value of the negative curvature values.
    One subclass was obtained with a curvature value of 0 and four more subclasses
    were obtained using the Jenks natural breaks classification method as it is a
    widely used method for generation of the curvature subclasses (Arulbalaji et al.,
    2019, Jothibasu and Anbazhagan, 2016). However, the classification ranges for
    the drainage density, lineaments density, TWI and TPI thematic layers were performed
    based on the Jenks natural breaks classification method due to a lack of any defined
    classification criteria (range vs. groundwater potential) for these layers. Moreover,
    several studies have adopted the Jenks natural breaks classification method to
    classify these thematic layers (Arulbalaji et al., 2019, Jothibasu and Anbazhagan,
    2016, Mallick et al., 2019). The sub-classes of each tangible thematic layer were
    reclassified by assigning higher values to the more suitable sub-classes using
    ArcGIS software (Section 2.2). A relative rank on a scale of 0 to 9 (Saaty’s scale)
    was assigned to each sub-class for each thematic layer based on their relative
    influence on the groundwater development (Table 4 and Table 5). Table 4. Pairwise
    comparison matrix for the thematic layers and consistency validation. Empty Cell

    on the pair-wise comparison of the thematic layers and sub-classes within the
    thematic layers were validated by evaluating the Consistency Ratio (CR) using
    Eq. (6) (Saaty, 1990). (6) The values of RCI were obtained from Saaty’s standard
    as illustrated in Table 6 and the values of CI were calculated using Eq. (7).
    (7) where λmax is the principal eigenvalue calculated using eigenvector calculation
    process as illustrated in Tables 4 and 5. According to Saaty (1990), a CR of ≤0.1
    indicates an acceptable judgement to continue the AHP analysis. However, if a
    CR of >0.1 is obtained, it is necessary to revise the judgement to find the reason
    for the inconsistency and correct it until a value of CR ≤ 0.1 is achieved. Table

    to each thematic layers and ranks are assigned to each sub-class of the thematic
    layers, the groundwater potential zones can be obtained by overlapping all the
    thematic layers using the weighted overlay method (Spatial analyst tool) in ArcGIS
    using Eq. (8). (8) where GPZ is the groundwater potential zone, WI is the weight
    of each thematic layer and Ri is the rank of the sub-classes of each thematic
    layer. The zones were classified into very low, low, moderate, high and very high
    based on the groundwater potential (Arulbalaji et al., 2019). 2.8. Sensitivity
    analysis To understand the influential thematic layers of the obtained GPZs and
    the influence of the assigned rank and weights to each class and thematic layer,
    the current study has adopted map removal and single parameter sensitivity analysis
    processes. The study used the ‘Raster Calculator’ (package: Spatial analyst tools;
    toolset: Map algebra) and ‘Raster Properties’ (package: Data management tools;
    toolset: Raster) tools in the GIS platform to perform these analyses. 2.8.1. Map
    removal sensitivity analysis This analysis is used to determine the impacts of
    removing any of the thematic layers used for the computation of the groundwater
    potential map where one thematic layer is removed at a time, a new GPZ map is
    produced with the remaining layers overlaying each other and each time a sensitivity
    index is calculated using Eq. (9) (Kindie et al., 2019). (9) where SI denotes
    the sensitivity index associated with a thematic layer when it is excluded, GPZ
    denotes the groundwater potential zone obtained using all thematic layers, GPZʹ
    denotes the groundwater potential zone obtained by excluding one thematic layer
    at a time, N is the number of thematic layers used to produce the GPZ map and
    n is the number of thematic layers considered to produce the GPZʹ map. 2.8.2.
    Single parameter sensitivity analysis This process is used to determine the impact
    of each of the thematic layers on the groundwater potential map by comparing the
    weighting factor for each of the thematic layers with the empirical weighting
    factor, allocated to the same layer in the potential map (Fenta et al., 2014).
    In this study, the effective weighting factor (W) for each thematic layer was
    computed using Eq. (10). (10) where Pr and Pw are the rates and weight values
    of each thematic layer, and GPZ is the groundwater potential index computed using
    all the thematic layers. 2.9. Accuracy assessment The GPZ map produced was validated
    against the tube-well and bore well data obtained from the Central Ground Water
    Board’s published reports (CGWB, 1985) on the Birbhum district (Table 7). The
    well''s locations were overlaid on the groundwater potential zones map to check
    the accuracy of the result in the various groundwater prospective zones (Murmu
    et al., 2019). Table 7. Accuracy analysis of the groundwater potential map with

    Multicollinearity analysis The result of the multicollinearity analysis is illustrated
    in Table 2. The result revealed that the VIF value is less than 10 and the tolerance
    value exceeded 0.1 for each thematic layer at ρ < 0.01 and ρ < 0.05 which implies
    no collinearity among the twelve thematic input layers used for this study and
    no uncertainties have been introduced to the model result due to multicollinearity
    problem. 3.2. Design of the thematic layers 3.2.1. Geological and hydrogeological
    settings The district is largely covered by hard clay infused with caliche nodule
    (~38%) and laterite (~24%) followed by scattered soft sediments such as sand,
    slit and clay (~18%), and granite gneiss (~15%) as depicted in Fig. 4a. Furthermore,
    basalt (~3.54%), black and grey shale with ironstone and sandstone (~0.77%), quartzite
    (~0.04%), pegmatite (~0.61%1) and, sandstone and shale (~0.04%) are found to appear
    in small parts of the district. The aquifers characteristics of the study area
    were explored by the CGWB up to a certain extent (Mukherjee and Singh, 2020, Ray
    and Shekhar, 2009). The study considered the hydrological importance of each of
    the geological settings of the district and the weights were assigned based on
    the aquifer characteristics as discussed below. Download : Download high-res image

    settings of Birbhum district. The gneiss formation of the study area is part of
    the Chotanagpur granite gneiss plateau and is constituted of slightly foliated
    hard rocks along with streaks of pegmatite, alkali feldspars, mica and other heterogeneous
    compositions and consists of several deep-seated faults, folds and lineaments.
    Groundwater occurs in the weathered residuum of granitic and gneissic rocks (hard
    rocks). The groundwater level in this region generally varies from 5 to 20 mbgl
    during pre-monsoon and < 5 to 10 mbgl during post-monsoon. The weathered layer
    is usually covered by an 8 to 10 m thick laterite which forms shallow aquifers
    for limited yield and acts as a recharge zone. Potential fractures in these rocks
    (70–100 mbgl) have a discharge rate of 10–20 m3/hr. However, the transmissivity
    and storativity of the aquifers varies between 2 and 28 m2/day and 1.6E−04 to
    6.91E−04, respectively. The regions with black and grey shale with ironstone and
    sandstone (hard and compact) are part of the Gondwana supergroup where groundwater
    occurs in the weathered residuum of sandstones (12–20 m thickness). Furthermore,
    groundwater from the regions with the Rajmahal trap geological setting occurs
    within 12 mbgl in the weathered residuum of basaltic rocks and is stored in the
    porous zone of the residuum. Potential fractures in such rocks were detected within
    65–80 mbgl and had a discharge rate of 5–20 m/hour. Transmissivity and storativity
    of the aquifers varies between 10 and 40 m2/day and 2.0E–04 to 3.5E–04. In the
    lateritic terrain of the district, groundwater occurs in the unconfined aquifer
    zone with a water level of 5–20 mbgl. However, in this terrain unconsolidated
    to semi-consolidated Tertiary sediments, overlain by Older Alluvium occur at a
    depth of 100–400 mbgl and have a yield prospect of 80–100 m3/hr. Due to higher
    porosity and permeability, groundwater potential is expected to be higher in a
    lateritic zone. However, groundwater occurs both under the unconfined and confined
    conditions in the recent alluvium regions. The aquifers are thick and regionally
    extensive with large yield prospects of ~150 m3/hr. 3.2.2. Geomorphology The district
    is primarily composed of upper mature deltaic plain (~51.41%) and pediplain/peneplain
    (~32.02%), followed by floodplain (~13.45%) and hills and valleys of the Rajmahal
    trap (~3.12%) as depicted in Fig. 4b. The prospect of groundwater is usually high
    in flood plain zones due to high infiltration of river water whereas, the potential
    is lower in the high elevation regions. In certain parts of the district, the
    soil erosion rate is higher due to undulating topography and the presence of loosening
    soil materials. The erosion soils were deposited in the eastern part and created
    depositional landform. Rocky areas of the study area usually have less groundwater
    potential due to run-off and therefore, recharge capacity is also lower (Mukherjee
    and Singh, 2020). 3.2.3. Soil types The study area is mainly comprised of laterite
    and lateritic soils (~48%), older alluvium (~21%) and red loamy soil (~17%) followed
    by younger alluvium aquifer (~7%) and red sandy soils (6%), as shown in Fig. 5a.
    The infiltration capability in finer soil is limited which results in poor groundwater
    recharge. Red loamy soils of the study area have poor permeability, hence have
    been assigned the lowest weight. In contrast, red sandy soils have moderate to
    very high permeability. Furthermore, laterite soils are very conducive to groundwater
    recharge due to their higher porosity. Older alluvium soils have moderate to high
    permeability and newer alluvium soils have poor to moderate permeability. Therefore,
    highest weights were assigned to sandy and laterite/lateritic soil classes (Table
    5). Download : Download high-res image (644KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 5. (a) Soil types and (b) drainage density of Birbhum district. 3.2.4. LULC
    LULC of the district represents agricultural land (~81%), rural settlements (~10%),
    forest (~4%), water bodies (~2%), industrial land (~1%), urban settlements (~1%)
    and wasteland (~1%), is illustrated in Fig. 1. The district is largely dominated
    by the agricultural land. Water bodies, forest and agricultural lands are considerably
    significant for groundwater recharge, as described in Section 2.2. Therefore,
    higher weights were assigned to these LULC classes whereas lower weights were
    assigned to the rural and urban settlements, industrial lands and wastelands (Table
    5). 3.2.5. Drainage density (Dd) The study area was dissected into five subclasses,
    namely, very low (<0.5 km/km2), low (0.5–1.0 km/km2), medium (1.0–1.5 km/km2),
    high (1.5–2.0 km/km2) and very high (>2 km/km2) as depicted in Fig. 5b. The interval
    value of the obtained sub-class ranges is 0.5 km/km2 (Section 2.4). As higher
    drainage density implies less infiltration, the study has assigned relatively
    higher weights to the regions with low drainage density and vice-versa. The drainage
    density of the study area is very dynamic as it is dependent on the course of
    the main streams which are perennial. Higher drainage density values are recorded
    at the Mayurakshi, Brahmani, Chila nala (tributary of Dwaraka) river basins. These
    terrains are more deselected compared to the other parts of the study area. Medium
    drainage density is observed at the Ajoy, Gamri (tributary of Dwaraka), Bakreswar
    and Pagla river basins whereas a lower value of drainage density was recorded
    at the Bansoli river basin. 3.2.6. Slope The slope of the study area varies from
    0° to 42° (Fig. 6a) and a large section of the district falls under a slope of
    <10° (flat to gentle slope). The slope of the district was reclassified into five
    classes, namely, flat (<2°), gentle (2–8°), medium (8–15°), steep (15–30°) and
    very steep (>30°). An elevated slope causes higher surface run-off, as explained
    in Section 2.2. The prospect of groundwater in the flat, gentle, medium, steep
    and very steep terrains are very high, high, moderate, low and very low (Elewa
    and Qaddah, 2011, FAO, 1993). Therefore, lower weights were assigned to the steep
    and very steep sub-classes. Download : Download high-res image (820KB) Download

    the western part and lower rainfall in the eastern part as depicted in Fig. 6(b).
    The rainfall of the district has been reclassified into five classes, namely,
    very low (<1100 mm), low (1100–1200 mm), moderate (1200–1300 mm), high (1300–1400
    mm) and Very High (>1400 mm) rainfall, covering approximately 5%, 8%, 40%, 26%
    and 21% of the study area, respectively. Higher weights were assigned to the higher
    rainfall subclasses and lower weights were assigned to the lower rainfall sub-classes,
    as illustrated in Table 5. 3.2.8. TWI TWI values of the district ranged between
    0.14 and 13.49 as depicted in Fig. 7(a). The values were reclassified into five
    classes, namely, very low (0.14–3.0), low (3.0–5.0), moderate (5.0–7.5), high
    (7.5–10.0) and very high (10.0–13.49). The high weights were assigned to higher
    TWIs and vice versa, as explained in Section 2.2. Download : Download high-res

    index and (b) topographic position index maps of Birbhum district. 3.2.9. TPI
    A higher weight was assigned to a low TPI value and vice versa. The TPIs of the
    district ranged between 27.17 to −17.76 as depicted in Fig. 7(b). The thematic
    layer was reclassified into four classes, namely, very low (−-1), low (−1 to 0.04),
    medium (0.04–1.27) and high (>1.27). Higher weights were assigned to the subclass
    with lower TPIs. 3.2.10. Roughness The roughness of the study area varied from
    0.07 to 0.9 as illustrated in Fig. 8(a). The roughness values were reclassified
    into five classes, namely, very low (<0.1), low (0.1–0.25), medium (0.25–0.5),
    high (0.5–0.75) and very high (0.75–0.9). Higher weights were allocated to the
    low roughness regions and vice versa as higher roughness implies higher surface
    run-off. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    Curvature Topographic curvature in the study area ranged from −6.64 to +6.74.
    Water tends to decelerate in convex surface and accumulate in the concave surface.
    The obtained curvature values were reclassified into five categories, viz very
    low (−6.64 to −3.32), low (−3.32 to 0), flat (=0), high (0–3.37) and very high
    (3.37–6.74), as illustrated in Fig. 8(b). High weight is assigned for high curvature
    value and vice versa. 3.2.12. Lineament density The lineaments density of the
    study area varies between 0 and 0.606 km/km2 as illustrated in Fig. 9(a). The
    density data was reclassified into five categories, such as very low (0–0.054
    km/km2), low (0.054–0.147 km/km2), moderate (0.147–0.249 km/km2), high (0.249–0.373
    km/km2) and very high (0.373–0.606 km/km2). The higher ranks were assigned to
    the higher lineament density classes. Download : Download high-res image (586KB)

    groundwater potential zones Before integrating the thematic layers using the weighted
    overlay method, consistency ratios were calculated for the thematic layers (Table
    4) and subclasses of each thematic layer (Table 5). The values indicated that
    the judgement matrices of this study were valid (<0.10) with reasonable consistencies.
    Therefore, the reclassified thematic layers were integrated based on their obtained
    weight (Table 5) using the weighted overlay method (Eq. (11)) and the groundwater
    potential map was produced (Fig. 9b). (11) Depending on the pixel values, the
    study area was divided into five categories (such as very low, low, moderate,
    high and very high groundwater potential zones) using the natural breaks/Jenks
    method in the GIS platform (Fig. 9b). To minimize the pixel speckling, the map
    was processed further using the majority filter in the GIS platform. The delineated
    groundwater potential map revealed prominent variations in groundwater potential
    of the study area. Approximately 11.14% of the district’s aerial spread has very
    low groundwater potential whereas the terrains with granite and basaltic hard
    rock underneath are highly susceptible to groundwater crisis. The map further
    demarcates approximately 24.24% of the district as semi-critical in terms of groundwater
    potential. Nevertheless, about 38.24%, 19.54% and 6.84% of the study area were
    identified as moderate, high and very high groundwater potential zones. Significant
    groundwater potential was observed at certain parts of the district along the
    Ajay and Mayurakshi rivers (floodplains of the major rivers) which might be due
    to higher availability of water bodies and good groundwater recharge. Blocks such
    as Nanoor, Labpur, Sainthia, Suri-II, Bolpur-Santiniketan and a certain part of
    Dubrajpur, Mayureswar-II, Rampurhat-II and Murarai-I (alluvial plains with croplands)
    had exhibited moderate to very high groundwater potential. The weathered mantle
    of the granitic gneiss aquifer at the Bakreswar geothermal province has also been
    identified as a zone with a higher groundwater storage potential. However, the
    remaining parts of the district were identified as groundwater shortage zones
    due to underneath hard rocks and undulating topology with limited water infiltration
    capability. 3.4. Sensitivity analysis of the groundwater potential map The statistical
    results of map removal (Table 8) and single parameter (Table 9) sensitivity analyses
    revealed that geology and geomorphology thematical layers were the most influential
    parameters in the groundwater potential estimation. However, soil type, LULC and
    lineament density were identified as moderately sensitive parameters. The higher
    variation index values were found after removal of the geological thematic layer
    followed by geomorphology and soil types criteria which implies that groundwater
    potential is highly influenced by the lithology of the study area. Alluvial floodplains
    of quaternary age favor groundwater storage due to the porosity and infiltration
    characteristics of the aquifers. Furthermore, higher weights were assigned to
    these layers which has increased the influence of these layers. Rainfall and TWI
    were also identified as the next influential parameters. Map removal analysis
    further revealed that removal of the geological and geomorphological layers increases
    the very poor groundwater potential area by 37.62% and 28.35%, and the poor groundwater
    potential area by 28.55% and 18.49%, respectively (Table 10). Similarly, exclusion
    of soil type, LULC, slope, rainfall, lineament density, TWI, roughness and curvature
    increases the very poor groundwater potential areas by 22.73%, 13.26%, 2.23%,
    15.81%, 20.73%, 1.25%, 3.18% and 2.28%, and poor groundwater potential areas by
    12.08%, 7.31%, 4.46%, 18.94%, 23.82%, 1.93%, 5.55% and 2.06%, respectively. Moderate,
    high and very high groundwater potential areas also varied significantly with
    exclusion of each thematic layer, indicating that a thematic layer which is a
    source of water or conducive to water infiltration is also an effective parameter
    for groundwater potential and the exclusion of any such parameter will significantly
    impact the demarcation of the GPZs. Therefore, the adaptation of artificial recharge
    techniques (such as rainwater harvesting and the development of percolation ponds,
    check dams, riverbank filtration and sprinkling infiltration) and water conservation
    practices might be helpful to reduce the stress on the aquifer condition up to
    a certain extent for the study area as these will replenish the aquifer (Huo et
    al., 2019, Lyu et al., 2019). Furthermore, increased land cover with plantation
    activities, alternative crop patterns, a reduced withdrawal of groundwater and
    the recycling of wastewater generated from the industrial areas (such as the Bakreswar
    thermal power plant area) might be effective remedies for water crises in the
    study area. Table 8. Statistical analysis of map removal sensitivity analysis.

    to check the accuracy of the generated groundwater potential map, it was further
    cross-validated against the borewell (observation well) yield data obtained from
    the CGWB (1985). A total of 41 borewells (stations) situated across the district
    and covering the diverse geological settings, land use/land cover and topographical
    variations were analyzed for this purpose (Fig. 10a). The borewells were categorized
    into three classes based on the obtained yield rate and the classes were – low
    yield (<10.8 m3/hour), medium yield (10.8–21.6 m3/hour) and high yield (>21.6
    m3/hour). To perform a comparative analysis, the generated map was reclassified
    into three classes such as low, medium and high, and the borewell locations with
    a yield classification label were overlaid on the groundwater potential map as
    illustrated in Fig. 10(a). The validation results indicated the classification
    of about 80.49% of the borewells accurately matched with the zonation of the generated
    groundwater potential map (Table 7). Certain parts of the alluvial croplands exhibited
    lower groundwater yield for the observation wells whereas the GPZ model predicted
    those regions to be moderate to high areas of potential. The discrepancy might
    be due to the long-term over-extraction of groundwater for agricultural activities
    that has compromised the groundwater recharge capacity at the present climatic
    condition of the study area. Access to groundwater for irrigational usage is also
    becoming increasingly vulnerable to risks of groundwater depletion which has been
    reported by several studies (Chindarkar and Grafton, 2019, Roy et al., 2008, Scanlon
    et al., 2012). Changing the traditional cropping pattern and adopting sprinklers,
    drips and micro irrigation practices might be useful for such regions in order
    to prevent extraction of groundwater (Birkenholtz, 2017, Kaarakka et al., 2019,
    Wang et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (521KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. Cross-validation of the groundwater potential map using
    (a) comparison between drilled borewell yield and predicted GPZ classification,
    and (b) ROC curve. The study further performed a quantitative validation of the
    predicted groundwater prospect map using the Receiver Operating Characteristic
    (ROC) curve (Fig. 10b). The validation was performed by comparing the borewell
    yield data with the generated map using SPSS software (v25). The ROC curve plots
    a true positive rate versus a false-positive rate for different cut-off points
    of a variable and each point on the curve signifies a sensitivity pair corresponding
    to a threshold. On the other hand, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the measurement
    of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups. An AUC
    value within a range of 0.5–0.6 indicates poor prediction accuracy whereas the
    ranges 0.6–0.7, 0.7–0.8, 0.8–0.9 and 0.9–1 signify average, good, very good and
    excellent prediction accuracy, respectively (Andualem and Demeke, 2019). The validation
    of results revealed good prediction using the AHP technique as the AUC of the
    GPZ map was 0.715. The GPZ assessment model is free from the uncertainties caused
    by the multicollinearity problem. All of the thematic layers considered are vital
    factors for controlling the GPZs of the study area and exclusion of any of the
    thematic layers will have a significant impact on the accuracy level obtained,
    as indicated by the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the GPZ map was produced
    by revising the judgement in order to resolve the inconsistencies among the thematic
    layers and subclasses of each thematic layers indicated by the consistency analysis.
    The GPZ map was produced with an accuracy level of 80.49% through comparison with
    the groundwater yield data and with a good prediction score of 0.715 using the
    AUC. Therefore, the present study has achieved a significantly higher accuracy
    level with the higher number of relevant thematic layers using AHP and GIS techniques.
    3.6. Limitations The study potentially faces certain limitations due to the nature
    of the adopted method. AHP is a knowledge-driven process, hence it may have inhibited
    certain errors in its prediction. Furthermore, the assessment was performed using
    a total of 12 different thematic layers such as geology, geomorphology, land use
    and land cover, fault and lineament density, drainage density, rainfall, soil
    type and soil texture, slope, roughness, the topographic wetness index, the topographic
    position index and curvature. Parameters such as lithology, soil texture, aquifer
    thickness, pond frequency, recharge rate, pre and post-monsoon groundwater depth,
    the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the amount of draft of water
    for irrigation and domestic usage also play important roles in controlling the
    groundwater potential which have not been taken into consideration for this study.
    Furthermore, the study area primarily represents a semi-arid rural tract with
    two meteorological parameters monitoring stations (gauges). Therefore, interpolation
    of rainfall using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method may not be the best
    interpolation method for the study area (Amini et al., 2019). In order to improve
    the accuracy of the GPZ, an interpolation method with less prediction error can
    be used to obtain the rainfall distribution after considering the rainfall data
    from all the gauges including neighborhood districts. In future, an improved groundwater
    potential map of the district can be produced by considering all these parameters.
    However, the study results are valid and scientific despite these factors in the
    research process and estimation. The outcome of this assessment may be useful
    for policymakers to improve the groundwater management of the district. 3.7. Landscape
    scale implications Different GIS factors such as the spatial resolution and scale
    of each thematic layer can affect the accuracy of each thematic map as well as
    the produced GPZs map, especially when the study is investigating a wider terrain
    (Arabameri et al., 2020). The present study has integrated the high scale (1:50,000)
    thematic layers and produced the GPZs map with a scale of 1:50,000 and spatial
    resolution of 12.5 m which should reduce the limitations associated with landscape
    scale implications. However, the study may still exhibit significant edge effects
    due to the integration of the georeferenced thematic layers (Ting and Shaolin,
    2008). 4. Conclusion In this study, an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach
    based on the AHP method was successfully applied to identify the groundwater potential
    zones of the Birbhum district. The cross-validation results identified AHP as
    an effective method to delineate the groundwater potential of the study area.
    The present study is scientifically accurate (accuracy = 80.49%) and might be
    helpful to the residents in locating effective drilling areas and also to the
    authorities engaged with water resource management and land use planning. Approximately
    35.38% of areas of the district were identified as vulnerable to semi-critical
    to the critical water crisis, although the areas exhibited moderate to high groundwater
    prospects. Therefore, adequate groundwater management is necessary for long-term
    sustainable socio-economic and agricultural development of the district. Adaptation
    of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) techniques including rainwater harvesting is
    recommended to increase the groundwater potential of the water crisis zones. As
    building new artificial recharge structure is cost-intensive, development of new
    ponds and, expansion and digging of the existing ponds might be helpful for groundwater
    recharge and storage in the district. The present study can be used in water conservation
    campaigns to create public awareness. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    systems worldwide rely on built solutions to support the smooth and safe functioning
    of societies. in the face of multiplying environmental threats, this approach
    alone can no longer provide the climate resiliency and level of services required
    in the 21st century. Natural systems such as forests, floodplains, and soils can
    contribute to clean, reliable water supply and protect against floods and drought.
    In many circumstances, combining this “green infrastructure” with traditional
    “gray infrastructure,” such as dams, levees, reservoirs, treatment systems, and
    pipes, can enhance system performance, boost resilience, lower costs, and better
    protect communities. Service providers such as water utilities, flood management
    agencies, irrigation agencies, and hydropower companies can deliver more cost-effective
    and resilient services by integrating green infrastructure into their plans. However,
    to guide its appropriate use in mainstream infrastructure programs, green infrastructure
    must be as rigorously evaluated and carefully designed as gray projects. This
    report guides developing country service providers and their partners on how to
    seize this opportunity. It offers service providers a framework to evaluate green
    infrastructure from a technical, environmental, social, and economic perspective,
    and to assess key enabling conditions, with illustrative examples. It also provides
    guidance for policymakers and development partners, who must set the incentives
    and enabling conditions to mainstream solutions that unite green and gray infrastructure.

    hydropower system is evaluated using a monthly simulation model for power production
    and irrigation releases. The hydropower production is assessed for two operating
    scenarios, namely, unconstrained and constrained scenarios based on hard bound
    constraint on powerhouse releases and also for various duration of hydropower
    plants operation. Further, the behaviour of the system is analysed using the statistical
    performance indices such as reliability, resilience and vulnerability. The results
    show that the power production is high for the unconstrained operating scenario
    due to unrestricted releases to the powerhouses. On the other hand, the constrained
    scenario has resulted in lesser but reliable steady power production irrespective
    of duration of operation. It is found that the power production can be increased
    by 14% without compromising the irrigation releases. The statistical performance
    analyses show that lesser the duration of operation of powerhouses, higher is
    the reliability and resilience with less vulnerability. Keywords: hydropower productionmulti-reservoirsimulationreliabilityresiliencevulnerability
    1. Introduction Hydropower is one of the sustainable potential for meeting the
    energy needs of a country. India is endowed with rich hydropower potential and
    the total installed capacity is around 40,320 MW including both small and large
    hydropower plants (Sukhatme 2011). However, most of the hydropower plants are
    not operated to its full potential. Some of the reasons highlighted by Arunkumar
    and Jothiprakash ( 2012) were (i) hydropower is produced through irrigation release
    in most of the plants; (ii) hydropower and irrigation releases are conflicting
    objectives; and (iii) disputes in sharing available water among different stakeholders.
    Operating a reservoir specifically for hydropower production is always under criticism
    from other stakeholders owing to the diversion of large quantity of water for
    hydropower production. However, the ever increasing demand on water and electricity
    from various sectors has necessitated the optimal operation of hydropower reservoirs
    to increase the power production for the economic development of the country.
    This calls for an evaluation of the existing hydropower reservoirs for efficient
    and effective operation considering various issues. Such an evaluation can be
    mathematically studied through a simulation model, which gives wide range of solutions
    through the analyses of behaviour of the system for various scenarios (Loucks
    et al. 1981). In addition, there are many statistical indicators to evaluate the
    performance of a reservoir based on its operation, among which the time and volume
    reliability are mostly used. Hashimoto et al. ( 1982) proposed two more measures,
    namely resilience and vulnerability indices to study the behaviour of the system
    based on its long-term operation. These three statistical indicators were widely
    used by many researchers to assess the performance of reservoir operations (Burn
    et al. 1991; Jain 2009; Kjeldsen and Rosbjerg 2004; McMahon et al. 2006; Umadevi
    et al. 2013). These indicators are estimated by simulating the operations of a
    reservoir for longer period for various scenarios. In spite of development of
    various optimization techniques, simulation remains as a primary tool for reservoir
    planning and management studies in practice (Koutsoyiannis et al. 2002). One of
    the early study carried out by Sigvaldson ( 1976) to assess the different operating
    policies of Trent River system, Canada reported that simulation model has lot
    of flexibility in analysing wide range of reservoir operating policies. Piper
    et al. ( 1989) evaluated various development scenarios for the combined reservoirs
    and irrigation schemes in Chi Basin, Thailand using a basin scale simulation model.
    Harboe and Ratnayake ( 1993) simulated the standard operating rules of Victoria
    Reservoir in Sri Lanka and reported that the stochastic results were more conservative,
    but had a higher reliability than deterministic models. Simulation technique is
    also used for assessing the operation of reservoirs for effective irrigation planning
    (Dayaratne 2000; Jothiprakash and Mohandoss 2010; Jothiprakash et al. 2012). Upon
    analysing various operating scenarios using a simulation model, some of the studies
    on hydropower projects reported that the power production can be considerably
    increased (Afzali et al. 2008; Beilfuss 2010; Cicogna et al. 2009). Bosona and
    Gebresenbet ( 2010) showed a 5.67% increase in power production by simulating
    the operations of Melka Wakana Hydropower Plant in Ethiopia. Detailed review about
    various simulation studies can be found in Wurbs ( 1993) and Rani and Moreira
    ( 2010). Thus, simulation technique has a wide range of application and remains
    as an effective tool for evaluating any system to improve its performance through
    the analyses of various scenarios. Wurbs and Carriere ( 1993) reported that the
    operating policies of a reservoir are need to be revised in line with the changing
    conditions (constraints) and increasing demand to achieve maximum benefits from
    the limited surface water system. In the present study, a monthly time step simulation
    model is developed to evaluate the power production from a large-scale multi-reservoir
    hydropower system for different operating scenarios, as well as for various duration
    of operation of hydropower plants. Further, the behaviour of the powerhouses and
    the system is analysed using the statistical performance indicators such as reliability,
    resilience and vulnerability. 2. Study area The Koyna Hydroelectric project (KHEP)
    in Maharashtra, India is considered as the case study in the present work. KHEP
    has four powerhouses and integrates the operation of two reservoirs, namely Koyna
    reservoir and Kolkewadi reservoir. The Koyna reservoir is one of the largest hydropower
    reservoirs in India with a gross storage capacity of 2797.40 × 106 m3 (KHEP 2005).
    The location of various powerhouses of KHEP is shown in Figure 1. The Koyna stage
    – I and stage – II are housed together as a single plant (henceforth referred
    as PH I) having 600 MW total capacity. The stage – IV (henceforth referred as
    PH III) is the major powerhouse in KHEP with a capacity of 1000 MW. The tail water
    of PH I and PH III is taken to Kolkewadi reservoir through a tunnel where the
    stage III (henceforth referred as PH II) of KHEP with a capacity of 320 MW is
    housed. The Kolkewadi reservoir is a balancing reservoir with a gross storage
    capacity of 36.22 × 106 m3 (KHEP 2005), which receives most of its inflow from
    Koyna reservoir and regulates the flow to PH III. These three powerhouses (PH
    I, PH II and PH III) are on the western side of the Koyna reservoir as shown in
    Figure 1. In addition to the power production, Koyna reservoir is also serving
    irrigation releases on the downstream of eastern side. In order to utilize the
    head available in the reservoir, the Koyna Dam Power House (KDPH) (henceforth
    referred as PH IV) was constructed at the dam foot with a capacity of 40 MW. All
    the powerhouses in the system are peak stations and are operated only for producing
    the peak demands. However, the power production at the dam foot powerhouse (PH
    IV) is incidental, which generates hydropower only through irrigation releases.
    Since, the power releases and irrigation releases are separate and in opposite
    direction, the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal (KWDT) limited the diversion of
    large quantity of water towards the western for power production (KWDT 2010).

    represents the hydrological behaviour of the system that are developed using the
    mass balance equation and other operating conditions (Rani and Moreira 2010).
    In the present study, a monthly time step simulation model is developed using
    the standard linear operating policy (SLOP) (Jain 2009; Kjeldsen and Rosbjerg
    2004) to assess the power production from KHEP for various powerhouse operating
    durations under different operating scenarios based on KWDT constraint on power
    releases. The stepwise methodology adopted in the present study is given in Figure
    2. The algorithm of the developed simulation model is given as a flowchart in
    Figure 3. The SLOP is that (i) if the available storage (active storage + inflow
    – evaporation) in the reservoir is less than the demand, then whatever storage
    available in the reservoir is released; and (ii) if the available storage is greater
    than the demand, then the demand is released. Finally, the overflow is estimated
    if the end storage exceeds the capacity of the reservoir, else the overflow is
    zero. Figure 2. Step by step methodology of the present study. Display full size
    Figure 3. Algorithm of the developed simulation model. Display full size The behaviour
    of the system based on its long-term operation is assessed for various scenarios
    using the statistical indices such as reliability, resilience and vulnerability.
    Karamouz et al. ( 2003) reported that reliability is a measure of system performance
    in meeting the demands, which is an important indicator for analysing the performance
    of water resources systems in normal conditions. In order to estimate dependability
    of the system, the time and volume reliability is estimated. The time reliability
    is the probability of the state of the system (xt) that occurs in satisfactory
    state (S) (i.e. number of time the demand is satisfied during the total simulation
    period). Conversely, it is also estimated by deducting the number of failure periods
    out of the total simulation period from one. This can be computed as: (1) where
    Relt is the reliability index, Fn is the number of failure periods during the
    total simulating time period ‘T’. In addition to the time reliability, volume
    reliability (Relv) is also computed which specifies the percentage volume of the
    total demand that is released from the reservoir during the simulation period.
    It is given as: (2) where Rn,t is the release to the powerhouse ‘n’ and Dn,t is
    the demand of the powerhouse ‘n’ during the time period ‘t’, N is the total number
    of powerhouses. For given system, the volume reliability will be higher than time
    reliability. In time reliability, if the release is not equal to the demand, then
    it is considered as a failure. However, in volume reliability, whatever the reduced
    releases made from the system during the failure period is also accounted. Resilience
    describes how quickly a system recovers from the failure state when failure occurred.
    It is basically a measure of the duration of the system in the unsatisfactory
    state. Resilience is an important indicator to assess the damages caused by droughts
    and floods (Karamouz et al. 2003). (3) Kjeldsen and Rosbjerg ( 2004) stated that
    resilience is equal to the inverse of the mean value of the time the system spends
    in an unsatisfactory state. It can be given as: (4) where M is the number of failure
    events and dj is the duration of the failure event j. The maximum resilience as
    (5) Vulnerability measures the magnitude of the failure event that occurred during
    the simulation period. Kjeldsen and Rosbjerg ( 2004) simplified the vulnerability
    measure stated by Hashimoto et al. ( 1982) and defined the overall system vulnerability
    as: (6) Where vj is the deficit volume of the failure event j. The maximum vulnerability
    is estimated using (7) The above developed simulation model has been used to assess
    the performance of KHEP for different operating scenarios based on release constraint
    and for various powerhouse operating durations. The results of the simulation
    model and the behaviour of the system from the statistical indices are discussed
    in the following section. 4. Results and discussion In the present study, the
    KHEP operations are evaluated using a monthly time step simulation model for two
    different operating scenarios based on KWDT constraint on power releases and also
    for various operating durations. The behaviour of the system is assessed using
    the statistical performance indicators such as reliability, resilience and vulnerability.
    Usually, hydropower releases are termed as non-consumptive, since the water can
    be used for some other purpose after power generation, mostly for irrigation.
    However in this case, the releases to major powerhouses and irrigation are in
    the opposite direction which makes the operation of the system very complex. The
    diversion of huge quantity of water for power production towards the western side
    is restricted by KWDT ( 2010), due to which the power production has decreased
    significantly. Hence in this study, two scenarios are analysed, (a) power production
    without tribunal constraint on releases (unconstrained scenario) and (b) power
    production with tribunal constraint on releases (constrained scenario) to powerhouses
    PH I and PH III on the western side. The unconstrained scenario will assess the
    full power production potential of the KHEP system and the constrained scenario
    will give the power production under restricted tribunal releases. In KHEP, all
    the powerhouses except PH IV are peak stations and are operated for only few hours
    in a day and do not have any specific demand. Based on this, three cases of simulation
    have been analysed. In case 1, it is considered as the power production is for
    four h in a day (4 h); in case 2, the power production is for six h in a day (6
    h) and in case 3, the power production is for eight h in a day (8 h). The monthly
    water demand for these cases are estimated based on the maximum turbine discharge
    capacity, number of hours of operation in a day and number of days in a month.
    The KHEP operations are simulated for 11 years of observed inflow data from 1999
    to 2010 using the developed simulation model. The release to powerhouse PH III
    is given first priority, since the MDDL for PH III is higher than other powerhouses
    and also it is the major powerhouse with high capacity in the system. Then the
    second priority is given to PH I and third to PH IV. The results of the simulation
    model are discussed in the following section. 4.1. Monthly releases to the powerhouses
    The monthly release to the powerhouses for 4 h operation is given in Figure 4.
    From the figure, it can be seen that the unconstrained scenario has resulted continuous
    releases to all the powerhouses for all the months of simulation period except
    in one month (May, water year 2003–2004). This is due to very less inflow in to
    the reservoir during that particular year. Whereas the constrained scenario has
    released most of the months in a year but failed to release at the end of the
    season in every year to the powerhouses PH I and PH III, since the total releases
    from the model have reached the maximum allowable limits. Thus, the results indicate
    that with the KWDT constraints all the powerhouses can be operated less than 4
    h per day. The releases to PH II are similar to PH I and PH III, since the operations
    of PH II is based on PH I and PH III releases. It is also observed that the constrained
    scenario has resulted in irrigation releases as per the irrigation demand in all
    the months of the simulation period. The unconstrained scenario failed in only
    one month to release for irrigation due to less inflow in that year, particularly
    at the end of the season. Figure 4. Monthly releases for 4 h of operation of various
    powerhouses for the unconstrained and constrained scenarios. Display full size
    The monthly release to the powerhouses for unconstrained and constrained scenarios
    for 6 h operation is given in Figure 5. The release is higher for 6 h operation
    of power plants and hence both the unconstrained and constrained scenarios have
    released only during the start of the season in every year. However, the unconstrained
    scenario has resulted release in most of the months compared to constrained scenario
    and failed in few months where inflow is very less during that particular year.
    In spite of having high storage in the reservoir, there are no releases in the
    constrained scenario at the end of the season for every year due to the restriction
    in releases. However, this has ensured the irrigation releases for all months
    of the simulation period in the constrained scenario. The unconstrained scenario
    failed in irrigation release for few months due to less inflow and also due to
    diversion of large quantity of water for power production. The 8 h duration of
    operation has also resulted similar to 6 h duration of operation for all power
    houses. Thus, from the releases resulted for various duration of operation, it
    is found that the unconstrained 4 h duration of operations is a viable scenario,
    since it has satisfied the irrigation releases as well as produces power every
    day. Figure 5. Monthly releases for 6 h of operation of various powerhouses for
    the unconstrained and constrained scenarios. Display full size 4.2. Power production
    The monthly power production for various duration of operation under unconstrained
    and constrained scenario is given in Figure 6. From the figure, it is found that
    there is large variation in monthly power production for different duration of
    operations for both unconstrained and constrained scenario. The 8 h duration of
    operation resulted in more power production than 6 and 4 h for both unconstrained
    and constrained scenarios, but produces power only part of the year. However,
    the unconstrained scenario has power production in most of the months in a year
    compared to constrained scenario due to the unrestricted releases. The power production
    also varies among the months for same duration of operation due to variation in
    storage levels and available net head. Figure 6. Monthly power production for
    different duration of operation. Display full size The annual power production
    for different duration of operation under unconstrained and constrained scenarios
    is given in Figure 7. It is observed that the annual power production under unconstrained
    scenario (Figure 7(a)) is higher than the constrained scenario (Figure 7(b)) for
    all the three duration of operation considered. The high power production is due
    to the unrestricted releases to the powerhouses on the western side of the reservoir.
    Also, there is a huge variation in annual power production among the years for
    6 h and 8 h operation in the unconstrained scenario. However, the variation in
    annual power production is less in 4 h operation over the years, which shows the
    power production is highly stable and reliable for this 4 h duration of operation.
    The remaining storage is carried over to subsequent years and hence there is a
    constant power production in all the years. However, in case of unconstrained
    scenario, the power production largely depends on the corresponding year inflow
    for longer duration of operation, since the carryover storage is very less. Hence,
    there is high variation in annual power production for different years in unconstrained
    scenario. Figure 7(b) shows the power production under constrained scenario for
    different duration of operation. It is observed that the annual power production
    is almost equal irrespective of duration of operation, even though the monthly
    power production varies largely. This is due to the total annual releases for
    different duration of operations are same in the constrained scenario, since releases
    to the powerhouses are restricted. This has led to only a small variation in annual
    power production in all the years for different duration of operation. It is also
    observed that the constraint on the releases has drastically reduced the power
    production. The total releases in unconstrained scenario are 12, 36 and 47% higher
    than the constrained scenario for 4, 6 and 8 h duration of operations, respectively.
    The power production is also increased by 14, 36 and 61% for 4, 6 and 8 h duration
    of operations in unconstrained scenario. The study shows that the 4 h operation
    without imposing the constraints on releases produces 14% more power every year
    at the same time meets the irrigations releases also, than the constrained release
    power production. Figure 7. Comparison of annual power production for the unconstrained
    and constrained scenarios. Display full size 4.3. End of month storage levels
    The resulted end of month storage levels for Koyna reservoir for unconstrained
    and constrained scenario is given in Figure 8. From the figure, it is found that
    there is huge variation in storage levels for different duration of operations.
    It is observed that the unconstrained scenario has resulted in lesser storage
    levels than the constrained scenario due to unrestricted releases. This shows
    that the unconstrained scenario has fully utilized the available storage in the
    reservoir for power production. Figure 8(a) shows the end of month storage levels
    for 4 h operation. There is no much variation in storage levels for most of the
    months in constrained and unconstrained scenarios. Both the scenarios have resulted
    in large storage for most of the time period due to less duration of operation
    and also resulted overflow in few months. Figure 8(b) and 8(c) shows the end of
    month storage levels for 6 and 8 h operation, respectively. Though both Figure
    8(b) and (c) looks similar, the storage level varies over the time period. It
    is observed that the storage depletes rapidly for 8 h operation due to high demand
    compared to 6 h operation. For both these cases, the constrained scenario has
    high storage and overflow due to the restriction in releases. The total releases
    to the powerhouses on western side reached their allowable limits within few months
    and hence the releases are zero at the end of the season in every year. The available
    storage in the reservoir is fully utilized for power production in the unconstrained
    scenario and hence resulted in dead storage at the end of the water year (June–May)
    for both 6 and 8 h duration of operation. However in few months, the unconstrained
    scenario has also resulted in overflow due to exceptionally high inflow to the
    reservoir. Figure 8. Resulted end of month storage levels of Koyna reservoir for
    the unconstrained and constrained scenarios. Display full size 4.4. Reliability
    The reliability of powerhouses and the system is estimated for both the unconstrained
    and constrained scenarios based on time as well as volume and is given in Table
    1. The time reliability shows how far the system has satisfied the demand during
    the total simulation period. The volume reliability shows to what extent the demands
    are satisfied in terms of quantity. From the table, it can be seen that the reliability
    of the system for the unconstrained scenario is higher than the constrained scenario
    for various duration of operation. The reliabilities of the powerhouses and the
    system for the constrained scenario are lesser, since the total releases to the
    western side powerhouses have reached the maximum allowable limit within few months
    and hence there are no releases at the later part of the year. However, this has
    ensured the irrigation supply and the reliability is high for PH IV for various
    duration of operation in the constrained scenario. Also, the reliability is high
    for short duration of operation for both unconstrained and constrained scenarios
    due to less demand. The volume reliabilities are slightly higher than the time
    reliability for both the operating scenarios. This is due to that the time reliability
    considers the releases less than the demand as failure during that time period
    however; the volume reliability accounts releases during that failure time period
    also. Table 1. Resulted time and volume reliability for unconstrained and constrained
    scenario. Download CSVDisplay Table 4.5. Resilience Resilience is the measure
    of how fast a system is likely to return to a satisfactory state from an unsatisfactory
    state. The mean and maximum resilience for the powerhouses and the system for
    the unconstrained and constrained scenario are given in Table 2. From the table,
    it is observed that both the mean and maximum resilience decreases with the increase
    in duration of operation. Both the mean and maximum resilience are almost same
    for 4 h duration of operation in the constrained and unconstrained scenarios.
    This shows that restriction of releases have no effect for short duration of operation
    of powerhouses. However, there is wide variation in mean resilience among powerhouses
    for longer duration of operation. The constraint scenario has satisfied the irrigation
    demands during all the simulation periods. Hence, there are no failure events
    for PH IV for all duration of operations and the resilience is zero. Table 2.

    likely damage of a failure event. The mean and maximum vulnerability of the powerhouses
    and the system under unconstrained and constrained scenario is given in Table
    3. From the table, it is observed that both the mean and maximum vulnerability
    increases with increase in the duration of operation. The mean and maximum vulnerability
    of the powerhouses and the system varies significantly for long duration of operation
    in the unconstrained scenario. However, it remains almost equal in the constrained
    scenarios. Also, the vulnerability of the powerhouses and the system is higher
    for long duration of operation in constrained scenario than the unconstrained
    scenarios, since the releases are restricted leading to higher deficits in the
    western side powerhouses. Table 3. Resulted mean and maximum vulnerability for
    the unconstrained and constrained scenario. Download CSVDisplay Table 5. Conclusion
    In the present study, the performance of the KHEP is assessed using a monthly
    time step simulation model for various duration of operation under unconstrained
    and constrained scenarios. The behaviour of the system is assessed using the statistical
    performance indicators such as reliability, resilience and vulnerability. From
    the results, it is observed that the power production increases by 14% for 12%
    increase in releases to the western side powerhouses for 4 h operation in the
    unconstrained scenario. This case has also satisfied the monthly irrigation demands
    during the simulation period. This unconstrained scenario also ensures that carryover
    storage is taken care. The reliability analysis shows that the system is more
    reliable for 4 h operation of powerhouses for both constrained and unconstrained
    scenarios. However, the unconstrained scenario has higher reliability than the
    constrained scenario. The high resilience and low vulnerability show that the
    power production is more stable and has continuous for 4 h duration of in both
    constrained and unconstrained scenarios. Thus, it may be concluded that all the
    powerhouses in the KHEP can be operated for 4 h per day without constrains on
    releases. Acknowledgement The financial support of Ministry of Water Resources,

    Get rights and content Abstract Climate change impacts and responses are presently
    observed in physical and ecological systems. Adaptation to these impacts is increasingly
    being observed in both physical and ecological systems as well as in human adjustments
    to resource availability and risk at different spatial and societal scales. We
    review the nature of adaptation and the implications of different spatial scales
    for these processes. We outline a set of normative evaluative criteria for judging
    the success of adaptations at different scales. We argue that elements of effectiveness,
    efficiency, equity and legitimacy are important in judging success in terms of
    the sustainability of development pathways into an uncertain future. We further
    argue that each of these elements of decision-making is implicit within presently
    formulated scenarios of socio-economic futures of both emission trajectories and
    adaptation, though with different weighting. The process by which adaptations
    are to be judged at different scales will involve new and challenging institutional
    processes. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords AdaptationVulnerabilityScenariosSustainabilityDecision
    making 1. Introduction Climate change is a reality. Observed impacts of climate
    change on physical and ecological systems over the past century (documented in
    McCarthy et al., 2001 and Parmesan and Yohe, 2003 for example) are a forerunner
    of things to come. Along with changes in mean climatic conditions, the earth potentially
    faces irreversible and catastrophic system feedbacks and impacts associated, for
    example, with collapse of thermohaline circulation, the melting of the Greenland
    ice sheet (Gregory et al., 2004), or other singular events (Alley et al., 2003).
    Societies, organisations and individuals have adjusted their behaviour in response
    to past climatic changes, and many are now contemplating adapting to altered future
    climatic conditions. Much of this adaptation is reactive, in the sense that it
    is triggered by past or current events, but it is also anticipatory in the sense
    that it is based on some assessment of conditions in the future. Adaptation is
    made up of actions throughout society, by individuals, groups and governments.
    Adaptation can be motivated by many factors, including the protection of economic
    well-being or improvement of safety. It can be manifested in myriad ways: through
    market exchanges (Smit et al., 2000), through extension of social networks (Adger,
    2003), or through actions of individuals and organisations to meet their own individual
    or collective goals. It can be undertaken by an individual for their own benefit
    or it can be made up of actions by governments and public bodies to protect their
    citizens. These levels of actions take place within hierarchical structures such
    that the levels interact with each other. Thus, individual adaptation actions
    are not autonomous: they are constrained by institutional processes such as regulatory
    structures, property rights and social norms associated with rules in use. The
    hierarchical structure extends beyond the nation state: Article 3 of the UN Framework
    Convention on Climate Change encourages governments to adapt to climate change,
    and the Delhi Ministerial Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainable Development,
    issued at the Eighth Conference of the Parties of the Framework Convention on
    Climate Change in 2002, stated that adaptation ‘is of high priority for all countries’
    and that ‘adaptation requires urgent attention and action on the part of all countries’.
    The scales of appropriate adaptation also extend to lower elements of the political
    and jurisdictional scale. Municipalities, cities, firms and markets are all adapting
    within the bounds of available technologies, regulatory systems and knowledge
    of future climate risks (e.g. Lindseth, 2004; Næss et al., 2005). If, as we argue,
    adaptation is an issue relevant at local, national and international levels, then
    it is possible to characterise effective or successful adaptation both independent
    of the scale and in its scalar context. In the broadest terms, the success of
    an adaptation strategy or adaptation decision depends on how that action meets
    the objectives of adaptation, and how it affects the ability of others to meet
    their adaptation goals. Crucially, an action that is successful for one individual,
    organisation or level of government may not be classed as successful by another.
    Success therefore depends on scale of implementation and the criteria used to
    evaluate it at each scale. This paper explores criteria for measuring the success
    of adaptation, taking into account explicitly the effect of scale. First, however,
    it is necessary to clarify the definition of adaptation and review who adapts
    to climate change and why. 2. Adaptation to climate change: scale matters 2.1.
    Defining adaptation: purpose and outcome We define adaptation to climate change,
    in a manner similar to the IPCC (2001), as an adjustment in ecological, social
    or economic systems in response to observed or expected changes in climatic stimuli
    and their effects and impacts in order to alleviate adverse impacts of change
    or take advantage of new opportunities. Adaptation can involve both building adaptive
    capacity thereby increasing the ability of individuals, groups, or organisations
    to adapt to changes, and implementing adaptation decisions, i.e. transforming
    that capacity into action. Both dimensions of adaptation can be implemented in
    preparation for or in response to impacts generated by a changing climate. Hence,
    adaptation is a continuous stream of activities, actions, decisions and attitudes
    that informs decisions about all aspects of life, and that reflects existing social
    norms and processes. There are many classifications of adaptation options (summarised
    in Smit et al., 2000) based on their purpose, mode of implementation, or on the
    institutional form they take. In this paper, to better explain adaptation, we
    have focussed on the intention of the adaptation and the impact of the adaptation.
    Adaptations are not isolated from other decisions, but occur in the context of
    demographic, cultural and economic change as well as transformations in information
    technologies, global governance, social conventions and the globalising flows
    of capital and (to a lesser extent) labour (see O’Brien and Leichenko, 2000).
    It can therefore be difficult to separate climate change adaptation decisions
    or actions from actions triggered by other social or economic events. Some adaptations
    can be clearly identified as being triggered by climate change, and those adaptations
    are often purposeful and directed, as can be seen in the UK government''s creation
    of a UK Climate Impacts Programme and the widespread implementation of that programme.
    Adaptations can also arise as a result of other non-climate-related social or
    economic changes: a householder deciding to move from an area at increasing risk
    of flooding to an area at lower risk, for example, may not be primarily motivated
    by climate change, but rather by other demographic or economic factors. Clearly,
    attributing adaptations to climate change is not a simple process. Irrespective
    of motivation for adaptation, both purposeful and unintentional adaptations can
    generate short-term or long-term benefits. But they may also generate costs when
    wider issues or longer timeframes are considered. Adaptations may amplify the
    impacts of climate change by ineffectual and unsustainable anticipatory action,
    as can be seen in the changing demand for air conditioning in cars and homes following
    a series of hot summers in the UK over the past ten years. Adaptations to non-climate
    drivers can increase vulnerability to climate change stress. For example, demand
    for riverside and coastal properties in the UK has increased over the past 30
    years as these properties are associated with higher quality of life; hence, they
    can also command higher prices (Hertin et al., 2003). More recent awareness of
    the heightened flood risk associated with living in flood prone areas may change
    the price signals that currently place a premium on coastal or riverside properties.
    The success of climate-related adaptation actions may therefore be negated by
    reactive adjustments by economic actors, governments, individuals, and biota that
    form part of the process of continual adjustment to social and ecological change
    driven by multiple factors. A further example of this can be seen in the UK construction
    industry. Instead of incorporating new technology or approaches into new home
    construction to build more ‘adaptive homes’, i.e. that are better suited to the
    changing climate, the current bidding processes for housing construction contracts
    seem to be constraining the capacity of the construction industry. The bidding
    processes tend to favour lowest cost bidders—which then leads to least-cost construction
    as opposed to most-appropriate construction (Sorrell, 2003). 2.2. Who makes adaptation
    decisions? Adapting to climate change involves cascading decisions across a landscape
    made up of agents from individuals, firms and civil society, to public bodies
    and governments at local, regional and national scales, and international agencies.
    As mentioned above, a broad distinction can be drawn between action that often
    involves creating policies or regulations to build adaptive capacity and action
    that implements operational adaptation decisions. The latter will often be constrained
    and influenced by a higher-level adaptation framework as well as the institutions
    that define all aspects of activity in that society. For both public and private
    agents, where objectives of adaptation are explicit, they are often diverse. Actions
    associated with building adaptive capacity may include communicating climate change
    information, building awareness of potential impacts, maintaining well-being,
    protecting property or land, maintaining economic growth, or exploiting new opportunities.
    The objectives associated with implementing adaptation decisions are more likely
    to focus on reducing the cumulative impacts of climate change, ensuring that adaptive
    measures taken by one organisation do not adversely impact upon others, avoiding
    anticipated adverse impacts of climate change, and ensuring that the distributional
    impacts of adaptation are minimised. Reilly and Schimmelpfennig (2000) point out
    that some adaptation occurs without explicit recognition of changing risk, while
    other adaptations incorporate specific climate information into decisions. Since
    unintentional adaptation has the capacity to reduce the effectiveness of purposeful
    adaptation, the integration of adaptation actions and policies across sectors
    remains a key challenge to achieve effective adaptation in practice. Classifications
    of purposeful adaptations based on objectives of adaptation strategies frequently
    focus on measures which share the loss, bear the loss, modify the event, prevent
    effects, change use or change location (Burton et al., 1993). This classification
    is an expansion of the three cornerstones of adaptation: reduce the sensitivity
    of the system to climate change; alter the exposure of the system to climate change;
    and increase the resilience of the system to cope with changes. Reducing the sensitivity
    of the effected system occurs by, for example, increased reservoir storage capacity,
    planting hardier crops that can withstand more climate variability, or ensuring
    that new buildings in flood plains are constructed with a floodable ground floor.
    Altering the exposure of a system to the effects of climate change can be achieved,
    for example, by investing in hazard preparedness and undertaking climate change
    mitigation activities. Increasing the resilience of social and ecological systems
    (Adger, 1999; Turner et al., 2003; Luers et al., 2003; Tompkins and Adger, 2004)
    can be achieved through generic actions which not only aim to enhance well-being
    and increase access to resources or insurance, but also include specific measures
    to enable specific populations to recover from loss. The spatial scale over which
    these three dimensions of adaptation can be implemented varies, as does the role
    of international and national policy, individual and collective action. All dimensions
    of adaptation can be implemented at any scale. In some cases, reducing exposure
    to impacts and changing the physical characteristics of impacts may only generate
    individual benefits if others collectively invest in these adaptations too. This
    may be the case in coastal communities where there may be a need for sea defences.
    In other cases, individual action will be adequate and specific public policy
    intervention may not be required to generate individual benefits from adaptation,
    although the adaptation actions are clearly reliant on permissive regulatory frameworks.
    In general, efforts to improve the ability of whole populations to recover from
    loss are more often tackled through public policy intervention at the national
    scale. The scales of adaptation can be illustrated with the example of anticipatory
    adaptation decisions in the context of public water supply in England and Wales.
    Arnell and Delaney (2004) map out the competing imperatives of adaptation across
    the scales involved. The UK national government requires water supply companies
    to take climate change ‘seriously’ and put in place plans that allow them to deal
    with a changing climate without specifying the detail of these plans. The broad
    aim of the policy advice is to ensure reliability of supply and the sustainable
    use of water resources at the national level. At the next tier of regulation,
    the environmental regulator (Environment Agency) and the economic regulator (Ofwat)
    both require companies to consider climate change, and provide some more specific
    rules to aid decision-making. The Environment Agency''s aim is to ensure the sustainable
    use of the water environment and to maintain a reliable supply, while the aim
    of the economic regulator is to safeguard the interests of customers whilst ensuring
    that companies remain commercially viable. At the fine-grained local scale individual
    private-sector water supply companies make decisions to ensure security of supply
    under climate change by changing the way they manage water resources or through
    demand management to encouraging individual consumers to alter their behaviour.
    Their aim is to continue to meet service standards specified in their licence
    to operate whilst providing appropriate returns to their owners. Individual customers
    adapt their water consumption habits, partly for altruistic reasons (‘to protect
    our rivers’) and partly for economic reasons, responding to price signals in metered
    domestic water supply. There are three major lessons from the literature on cross-scale
    dynamics for implementing adaptation actions across regulatory and stakeholder
    landscapes (e.g. Adger et al., 2004; Wilbanks, 2002; Rotmans and Rothman, 2003).
    First, the issue of adaptation can become a crucible for amplifying existing conflicts
    over objectives between private and public agents. Second, the institutional interactions
    in adaptation to climate change at different scales are not some natural pattern
    dependent on the physical risk. Rather, they are the outcome of interactions between
    the benefits of action or the costs of inaction. Environmental issues are defined
    by society to be appropriately tackled at a particular scale: ultimately the choice
    of how an environmental governance problem is handled within a jurisdiction is
    a reflection of the strength of the interests and power of the actors who define
    the problem. Understanding adaptation therefore requires consideration not only
    of different scales of human action, but also of the social construction of appropriate
    scales by institutions to further their own aims. The third lesson from the literature
    on cross-scale dynamics is that adaptation across scales in ecological systems
    adds complexity, since different biological and ecosystem processes dominate at
    different levels. The resilience of systems is defined by their ability to self-organise
    and is emergent from cross-scale and within-scale interactions (Peterson, 2000).
    At the same time, cross-scale linkages (crossing boundaries from local to global
    levels) are commonly asserted to be important in social processes. Yet in examining
    adaptation, the dynamic nature of linkages between levels of governance is not
    well-understood, and the politics of the construction of scale are often ignored.
    In examining the potential for adaptation in the management of Pacific salmon
    fisheries, for example, Miller (2000) demonstrates that various organisations
    choose to emphasise trans-boundary management issues in jurisdiction, while others
    choose to ignore those cross-scale issues. 3. Defining successful adaptation 3.1.
    Criteria for success We have argued above that adaptation actions are undertaken
    with different objectives. Defining success simply in terms of the effectiveness
    of meeting objectives, however, is not sufficient for two reasons. First, whilst
    an action may be successful in terms of one stated objective, it may impose externalities
    at other spatial and temporal scales. What appears successful in the short term
    turns out to be less successful in the longer term. The rush to install domestic
    and commercial air-conditioning in western Europe following summer heat waves,
    for example, represents an effective adaptation for its adopters, but is based
    on energy- and emissions-intensive technologies and therefore may not be sustainable
    in the long term. Second, whilst an action may be effective for the adapting agent,
    it may produce negative externalities and spatial spillovers, potentially increasing
    impacts on others or reducing their capacity to adapt. Much coastal planning for
    increased erosion rates, for example, involves engineering decisions that potentially
    impact neighbouring coastal areas through physical processes of energy dissipation
    and sediment transport (Pethick and Crooks, 2000). The definition of success clearly,
    therefore, depends on both the spatial and the temporal scale, and should not
    simply be assessed in terms of the stated objectives of individual adaptors. The
    issues of governance and the wider effectiveness of adaptation are also critical,
    and can be assessed through reference to equity, legitimacy and the economic efficiency
    of adaptation. Adaptation to climate change, therefore, can be evaluated through
    generic principles of policy appraisal seeking to promote equitable, effective,
    efficient and legitimate action harmonious with wider sustainability (see de Löe
    et al., 2001; Fankhauser et al., 1999; Burton et al., 2002). In the following
    sections, we address first the issue of effectiveness and efficiency, before examining
    the equity and legitimacy of adaptation actions. It is, however, important to
    note that these criteria of efficiency, effectiveness, equity and legitimacy are
    contested and context specific, and are based on competing values (Adger et al.,
    2003a). The relative importance attached to each criterion will vary between countries,
    between sectors within countries, and over time as attitudes and expectations
    change. Most importantly, the relative weight placed on these values varies between
    actors engaged in adaptation processes, depending on their world view and perceived
    limits to responsibility (Haddad, 2005). Arguably, conflicts over the allocation
    of resources, for adaptation and other purposes, reflect different perceptions
    of progress as a central dilemma of development (Low and Gleeson, 1998). Private-sector
    decisions are often assumed to focus on economic efficiency, particularly when
    the outcomes of the decisions are judged by share performance in capital markets.
    Decision-making by public bodies are also driven by economic efficiency—seeking
    to implement objectives such as those termed ‘best value’, for example in UK public
    expenditure. Nonetheless, the distributional effects and the legitimacy of the
    decision are also important. Less obviously, the relative importance attached
    to different criteria will vary with the perceived limits to an agent''s area
    of responsibility. A public sector agency may, for example, ignore the environmental
    or developmental effects of an action because they can be externalised in the
    decision-making process so that they become “somebody else''s problem”. The spatial
    scale over which the action will be evaluated, therefore, also influences the
    weighting given to different criteria. 3.2. Effectiveness in adaptation Effectiveness
    relates to the capacity of an adaptation action to achieve its expressed objectives.
    Effectiveness can either be gauged through reducing impacts and exposure to them
    or in terms of reducing risk and avoiding danger and promoting security (see for
    example Jones, 2001). The effectiveness of adaptation can sometimes be directly
    measured—for example, the number of houses removed from high hazard locations
    can be counted—but more often the effectiveness of an adaptation measure is more
    elusive: effectiveness depends on the sequence and interaction of adaptations
    over time. The impacts of interventions in public health to reduce the risks from
    extreme temperatures or epidemics, for example, can be estimated through standard
    techniques such as estimating the avoided impact of disease burden, and dose–response
    estimates of projected cases associated with particular risks (McMichael et al.,
    2004). Yet the complex causal chain of behavioural feedbacks makes any such estimation
    of the effectiveness of public health interventions and the effectiveness of individual
    actions problematic (McMichael and Githeko, 2001; Kahn, 2003). There are a number
    of issues surrounding measurement of the effectiveness of adaptation. First, there
    may be uncertainty over how a particular adaptation option will work even under
    defined conditions. The effectiveness of physical flood defences in reducing inundation
    is relatively well-known, for example, whilst the effectiveness of ‘softer’ engineering
    approaches—such as creation of coastal wetlands, river channel restoration or
    managing farmland to reduce flood runoff—may be equally effective. Yet this effectiveness
    is rather more difficult to predict or evaluate. Second, the effectiveness of
    an adaptation option introduced by an organisation may be reliant on actions taken
    by others. Demand reduction as an adaptation option in the water supply industry,
    for example, relies on individual consumers to reduce their consumption of water;
    the effectiveness of flood warning schemes depends on whether and how floodplain
    occupants respond to warnings. The individual uptake of adaptation options is
    highly uncertain, but there is considerable empirical evidence (often from hazard
    research: Wilbanks and Kates, 1999) that there are many constraints on individual
    adaptation. The effectiveness of adaptation measures which rely on individual
    actions may therefore be very difficult to assess. Third, the effectiveness of
    an adaptation action may depend on the future—unknown—state of the world. The
    effectiveness of a measure to reduce sensitivity to a physical hazard will depend
    on future climate. For example, the degree to which a new reservoir provides future
    security of water supply will depend on the extent of climate change, and the
    standard of service provided by a flood protection embankment will depend on the
    future flood regime. Effectiveness of an action may also depend on future social
    and economic conditions. Declining incomes, for example, may reduce the effectiveness
    of measures which rely on individuals taking adaptation actions themselves, and
    changes in attitudes towards regulation may influence the effectiveness of adaptation
    measures based on rules and regulations. Two key indicators of the effectiveness
    of an adaptation action are therefore robustness to uncertainty and flexibility,
    or ability to change in response to altered circumstances. Some adaptation measures
    are inherently more robust and less sensitive to changing conditions than others.
    For example, the future technical effectiveness of flood protection embankment
    depends on the future relationship between flood frequency and flood magnitude
    (in other words, its design standard may be significantly reduced in the future).
    In contrast, the effectiveness of a flood warning scheme would be unaffected by
    future changes in climate (as long as the climate change did not change the physical
    nature of the hazard). Fourth, whilst an adaptation measure may be effective at
    reducing the impacts of climate change or increasing opportunities in one location
    or time period, it may increase pressures “downstream”, or lessen the abilities
    of others to adapt to climate change. A flood embankment, for example, often simply
    increases flood hazard downstream. Potentially, any adaptation action can create
    unintended impacts on other natural and social systems. Measures to reduce exposure
    and sensitivity to a climate hazard have the greatest potential to impact on other
    elements of the physical and ecological environment. Measures to increase resilience
    are less likely to have an environmental impact, although clearly they can if
    they focus solely on achieving short-term objectives without taking into account
    wider sustainability considerations. In practice, there may be considerable uncertainty
    over the impact of an adaptation action. In some cases the impact may be clear
    and immediate, and past experience may be a very useful guide. In other cases,
    for example where the action is innovative, the consequences may not be known.
    The adverse effects of traditional ‘concrete’ engineering approaches to flood
    management, for example, are well-known, but the adverse and beneficial effects
    of soft engineering approaches (such as river channel restoration) are very uncertain.
    Significantly, however, the assessment of the effectiveness of an adaptation action
    may be dependent on the spatial and temporal scales over which the change is viewed.
    Longer time scales may reveal greater change as the natural and social systems
    adjust to altered circumstances; larger spatial scales may reveal “downstream”
    impacts of an action. 3.3. Efficiency in adaptation Adapting to climate change
    entails costs, but should also yield significant benefits. At the scale of the
    individual organisation the costs will be those of implementation, including transaction
    costs and the costs of inaccurate prediction (see also Ingham and Ulph, 2003),
    and the benefits, those of reduced impacts or enhanced opportunities. There is,
    however, at any scale of analysis far more to economically efficient adaptation
    than a simple comparison of quantified costs and benefits. Any assessment of the
    economic efficiency of adaptation actions requires consideration of, first, the
    distribution of the costs and benefits of the actions, second, of the costs and
    benefits of changes in those goods that cannot be expressed in market values,
    and, third, the timing on adaptation actions. The distributional issue in adaptation
    has itself two specific dimensions: the balance between private and public costs
    and benefits of adaptation actions, and the regulatory system that determines
    the ‘publicness’ of benefits. Some elements of adaptation to climate change response
    are, in effect, public goods. These include conservation of nationally or internationally
    important habitats, conservation of common cultural heritage and the conservation
    of resources for future use. Other types of adaptation effectively involve private
    goods. If private firms in the water industry invest in knowledge of climate change
    risks, the costs and the benefits of this response are largely private. Climate
    change planning by governments at present tends to concentrate on providing public
    goods such as scenario information, risk assessments in the public domain and
    public awareness campaigns (see Callaway, 2004). Hence, many response programmes
    at present avoid providing subsidies to private adaptation decisions. But the
    public and private elements of responding to climate change are not fixed: they
    are shaped by institutional and regulatory features in each sector of the economy.
    Further, they can change from public to private and back again over time (see
    Bakker, 2003 on the UK water industry, for example). The second issue in assessing
    efficiency of adaptation relates to decisions concerning non-market benefits.
    Any assessment of the efficiency of an adaptation that incorporates only goods
    with market proxies (such as property, human health, or economic production) risks
    seriously underestimating both costs and benefits. Government-led adaptation to
    climate change often stresses public good elements of the problem such as ecological
    and aesthetic impacts and non-traded ecosystem goods and services as much as private
    market impacts (Fankhauser et al., 1999; Azar, 1998; Azar and Schneider, 2003).
    Environmental economics research demonstrates, however, that estimates of stated
    or revealed preferences for non-marketed goods are based on reference points of
    priced marketed goods which themselves are non-sustainable and distorted (e.g.
    Common and Perrings, 1992; Arrow et al., 2003). In other words, the prices of
    traded goods which form the basis of valuation of costs and benefits of non-traded
    goods are the prices which have led to non-sustainable exploitation of resources
    in the first place. The assessment of the underlying social costs and benefits
    of adaptation, and their distribution, is therefore problematic. The timing of
    the adaptation action in relation to the climate change impact will also affect
    the perceived economic efficiency of an adaptation action. For organisations or
    individuals, where planning horizons are short (less than one year), capital turnover
    rates are high and systems can readily adjust, adaptation to short-term climate
    variability is all that is required to create an economically efficient response
    to climate change. A farmer deciding on which crops to plant next year needs to
    know the likelihood of drought next year rather than the likelihood of drought
    in 50 years time: long-term events are not relevant. On the other hand, where
    planning horizons are long, capital turnover rates are low and systems cannot
    quickly adjust, longer-term climate changes have to be factored in order to avoid
    costly planning errors. For example, a farmer considering investing in expensive
    irrigation works with a long life will need to take longer-term climate change
    into account to ensure that the investment generates net benefits. 3.4. Equity
    and legitimacy in adaptation The success of an adaptation action can be argued
    to depend not only on its effectiveness in meeting defined goals, but also on
    issues of equity and perceived legitimacy of action. It is important to note here
    that present-day adaptations to the risks from climate change are imposed on present-day
    society as a result of previous actions in perturbing the climate system. The
    whole issue of adaptation therefore begins from a sub-optimal and ‘unfair’ starting
    position because of the intergenerational nature of the problem. Equitable adaptations
    can be evaluated from the perspective of outcome (i.e. who wins and loses from
    the adaptation) as well as who decides on the adaptation to take. The distributional
    consequences of environmental decisions range from the uneven spatial impacts
    of environmental change to the distribution and consequences of political and
    social change. The fairness of the rules by which decisions are made is fundamentally
    determined by the underlying distributions of power within the institutions that
    manage resources and often create vulnerabilities (Adger et al., 2005). There
    are diverse principles of equity in outcome: these include principles of desert
    (i.e. who deserves to win or lose), equality, or need. Each principle has its
    own strengths (see Müller, 2001). For adaptation, equity in outcome means identifying
    who gains and who loses from any impact or adaptation policy decision. Assessments
    of this nature often demonstrate that many present-day adaptation actions reinforce
    existing inequalities and do little to alleviate underlying vulnerabilities (see
    Adger et al., 2003b, Adger et al., 2005; Thomas and Twyman, 2005). Reactive adaptation
    (such as reinstatement of infrastructure after impacts of extreme events) in particular
    tends to exacerbate vulnerabilities. Glantz and Jamieson (2000) among others,
    for example, argue that the impacts and recovery from Hurricane Mitch in Central
    America reinforced inequalities inherent in social and economic structures of
    land tenure and entitlement. On the other hand, anticipatory adaptation actions
    that seek to cushion the effects of climate on exposed populations and facilitate
    recovery from impact, i.e. measures to improve the ability to respond to climate
    impacts, can ‘level the playing field’. Measures to reduce poverty and increase
    access to resources could reduce present-day vulnerability as well as vulnerability
    to both climatic variability and climate change. Mangrove replanting in Vietnam,
    for example, is being undertaken to buffer coastal environments to reduce the
    vulnerability of coastal communities in the present day. Whilst the mangroves
    provide some physical protection, the greatest benefits come from the increased
    wealth generated from the ecosystem goods and services provided by mangrove forests
    on an annual basis (Tri et al., 1998). In terms of equitable outcomes of climate
    change adaptations, the rules by which decisions are being made and the underlying
    distributions of power influence the legitimacy of the decisions. Legitimacy is
    the extent to which decisions are acceptable to participants and non-participants
    that are affected by those decisions. Legitimacy can be gained as well as compromised
    through the evolution of adaptation strategies. There are no universal rules for
    procedures that guarantee the legitimacy of policy responses because cultural
    expectations and interpretations define what is or is not legitimate (Brown et
    al., 2002). But again the social acceptability of the procedures for implementation
    of adaptation actions, such as land use zoning and planning controls or provision
    of flood shelters, is an important characteristic. Legitimacy and trust are also
    scale dependent—while individuals consent to adaptation strategies and policies
    implemented by their governments for the public good, they are less likely to
    recognise the legitimacy of action by other countries to meet their own adaptation
    objectives. Further, the legitimacy of adaptation decisions by governments rests
    on the authority of the information in the political sphere (in this case the
    perception of climate change risks) and on the legitimacy of the instruments of
    policy. In summary, equity of outcome and legitimacy of decision-making are both
    central to the resilience and ultimately the perceived success of adaptation.
    Equity is important for instrumental reasons: development which is inequitable
    undermines the potential for welfare gains in the future (see Boyce, 2002 for
    example) and developments which lack legitimacy have less chance of full implementation.
    Equity and legitimacy are also goals in themselves (Low and Gleeson, 1998) in
    that fair public action defines both our relationships to the natural world and
    is a component of long-term sustainability. In addition, equity defines the relationship
    of how individuals relate to and respect other sections of society, locally and
    globally. 3.5. Evaluating success Successful adaptation that balances effectiveness,
    efficiency and equity through decision-making structures that promote learning
    and are perceived to be legitimate is an ideal from which much adaptation inevitably
    diverges. One major hypothesis implied in the discussion above is that the sustainability
    of adaptation depends on the heterogeneity of adaptive capacity across different
    stakeholders. In contrast, in resource management theories, heterogeneity in capacity,
    benefits and objectives has been shown to be detrimental to sustainable resource
    management (Agrawal, 2002). The divergence between these two ideas applies as
    much to future capacities as to present capacities. It is clear from the diversity
    of development pathways that the success and sustainability of future adaptations
    will depend on how institutions and social and cultural attitudes change. The
    IPCC''s Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES: IPCC, 2000) presents four
    different narrative storylines describing the way world population, economies
    and political structure may evolve over the next few decades. There are, of course,
    other sets of narrative storylines describing future worlds (e.g. UNEP, 2002;
    Kemp-Benedict et al., 2002). The SRES storylines are defined along two dimensions,
    characterising a market versus community orientation, and a global versus local
    perspective. These narrative storylines demonstrate that both the basis for adaptation
    and the weight given to the suggested criteria for successful adaptation change
    radically (see Arnell et al., 2004 for methods of development of the SRES storylines).
    Table 1 presents our assessment of the implied weighting of the four success criteria
    for adaptation discussed above within the main storylines. Table 1. Interpretations
    of criteria for successful adaptation implicit under the SRES storylines Storyline
    Brief characterisation Implicit interpretations of elements of success in adaptation
    A1 Very rapid economic growth with increasing globalisation, an increase in general
    wealth, with convergence between regions and reduced differences in regional per
    capita income. Materialist-consumerist values predominant, with rapid technological
    change. Strong focus on economic efficiency and welfare maximisation at aggregate
    level and excluding the possibility of welfare losses or increased vulnerability
    of marginalised sectors. Effectiveness interpreted in local, physical terms. Little
    attention paid to the equity or legitimacy of societal processes. A2 Heterogeneous,
    market-led world, with more rapid population growth but less rapid economic growth
    than A1. The underlying theme is self-reliance and preservation of local identities.
    Economic growth is regionally oriented, and hence both income growth and technological
    change are regionally diverse. Strong focus on economic efficiency and welfare
    maximisation at aggregate level—emphasis on nationally agreed objectives. Effectiveness
    interpreted in local, physical terms. Little attention paid to the equity or legitimacy
    of societal processes. B1 Same low population growth as A1, but development takes
    a much more environmentally sustainable pathway with global-scale cooperation
    and regulation. Clean and efficient technologies are introduced. The emphasis
    is on global solutions to achieving economic, social and environmental sustainability.
    Strong emphasis on equity and legitimacy – an assumed social contract for sustainability
    within nations. Effectiveness of adaptations interpreted broadly. Large-scale
    economic criteria are relevant, with focus on distributional effects. B2 Population
    increases at a lower rate than A2, with development following environmentally,
    economically and socially sustainable locally oriented pathways. Strong emphasis
    on equity and legitimacy – an assumed social contract for sustainability and explicit
    consent for adaptation actions for governments at multiple levels. Effectiveness
    interpreted broadly, with emphasis on locally agreed criteria for success. Economic
    efficiency relevant, with focus on distributional effects within local regions.
    Source: Storylines summarised from IPCC (2000). These storylines demonstrate that
    where rapid economic growth over this century is based on global economic integration;
    the possibility that such pathways create new vulnerabilities in populations that
    are either excluded from such growth, or whose economic activities suffer as a
    consequence of such globalising trends are ignored (e.g. O’Brien and Leichenko,
    2000; O’Brien et al., 2004). Thus, such scenarios give much greater implicit weighting
    to efficiency in the capacity to adapt in future, than those storylines associated
    with locally negotiated (B1)-type worlds. Finding a balance between these four
    success criteria can lead to one criteria being completely disregarded, as to
    achieve success in one criteria may lead to abandonment of another. For example,
    we can see the inherent trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency when considering
    flood defences. Most measures to reduce the physical impact of climate change
    are designed to provide some level of service or protection, i.e. a prescribed
    level of effectiveness. A flood protection scheme designed today to protect against
    the 100-yr return period flood, for example, will continue to provide protection
    to that physical level as climate changes over time, but the risk of overtopping
    will change. Clearly, installing such a flood protection scheme today to cope
    with climatic variability will also serve to lessen the impacts of climate change
    over the next few decades, but the standard of protection provided will vary over
    time. When planning for climate change, the degree to which trade-offs can be
    made between these different success criteria remains unknown. Initial findings
    from a project exploring long-term coastal planning processes in Christchurch
    Bay, in southern England (see Few et al., 2004), reveal that the effectiveness
    of coastal defences, the net costs of the various plans, as well as the distribution
    of costs and benefits and the legitimacy of the decision-making process are all
    important to local and national decision-makers as well as the affected communities.
    Few and colleagues (2004) conclude that these apparent conflicts can be overcome
    by developing a more effective cross-scalar approach to coastal management and
    by encouraging new forms of collective involvement in decision processes. Such
    changes in the process of decision-making might also change the relative weighting
    that is given to the success criteria. 4. Conclusions We have argued that adaptation
    to climate change impacts is necessary, that it is already occurring, and will
    occur with greater urgency in the future at a range of scales. Subsequent papers
    in this special issue demonstrate that the pathways towards adaptation, the technologies
    and the institutional forms of collective action are diverse, and that ensuring
    their sustainability and resilience in the context of uncertain futures represents
    a major challenge. Since climate change impacts are presently observed, adaptation
    should also be observable in contemporary society. There have been documented
    adaptations in markets such as insurance and reinsurance, coastal planning, health
    interventions, built environment, water resources, and adjustments and adaptations
    within resource-based livelihoods. The present process of national-level planning
    for adaptation by developed and developing countries represents a major resource
    effort in anticipatory planning and provides a first guide to its potential sustainability.
    We have argued that adaptation that requires large-scale investment is likely
    to be episodic and staggered. It is likely to be triggered through extreme events
    that raise the consciousness of climate change within policy-making and hence
    giving legitimacy to governmental action. We have also argued that adaptation
    operates at different spatial and societal scales and that success or its sustainability
    needs to be evaluated against different criteria at these different levels. Elements
    of effectiveness, efficiency, equity and legitimacy are important in judging success,
    but the relative weight allocated to each criterion is not given but rather emerges
    from societal processes of consent and action. The degree of success critically
    depends on the capacity to adapt and the distribution of that capacity. The relative
    importance of success criteria is contested and will vary over time. Acknowledgements

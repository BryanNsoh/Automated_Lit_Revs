    Get rights and content Abstract: This chapter begins by introducing wireless sensor
    network (WSN) technology and its current development. It then extensively reviews
    the applications of WSNs in the areas of environment monitoring, precision agriculture,
    precision livestock farming, greenhouse management, and food traceability systems.
    The chapter also discusses the obstacles and challenges faced in the development
    and deployment of WSNs in agriculture and food production. Finally, the future
    trends in application of WSN technology in agriculture and food production are
    presented. References (0) Cited by (13) A Bibliometric Analysis of the Evolution

    Smart Sensor Networks OECD Digital Economy Papers The OECD Directorate for Science,
    Technology and Innovation (STI) undertakes a wide range of activities to better
    understand how information and communication technologies (ICTs) contribute to
    sustainable economic growth and social well-being. The OECD Digital Economy Papers
    series covers a broad range of ICT-related issues and makes selected studies available
    to a wider readership. They include policy reports, which are officially declassified
    by an OECD Committee, and occasional working papers, which are meant to share
    early knowledge. More English, French More On Toggle Dropdown ISSN: 20716826 (online)

    Technologies and Applications for Green Growth This report gives an overview of
    sensor technology and fields of application of sensors and sensor networks. It
    discusses in detail selected fields of application that have high potential to
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reviews studies quantifying the environmental
    impact. The review of the studies assessing the impact of sensor technology in
    reducing greenhouse gas emissions reveals that the technology has a high potential
    to contribute to a reduction of emissions across various fields of application.
    Whereas studies clearly estimate an overall strong positive effect in smart grids,
    smart buildings, smart industrial applications as well as precision agriculture
    and farming, results for the field of smart transportation are mixed due to rebound
    effects. In particular intelligent transport systems render transport more efficient,
    faster and cheaper. As a consequence, demand for transportation and thus the consumption
    of resources both increase which can lead to an overall negative effect. Less

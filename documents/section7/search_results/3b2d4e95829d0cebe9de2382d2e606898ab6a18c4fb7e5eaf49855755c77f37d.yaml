  description: In order to promote the application of modern information technology
    in the field of management of saline-alkali land and get an effective mean for
    evaluating improved effect on soil, a real-time information collection and control
    system was designed, including online underwater pipe monitoring subsystem, field
    microclimate monitoring subsystem, pest diagnosis subsystem, crop growth monitoring
    subsystem, and automation irrigation subsystem. And ZigBee multi-hop ad-hoc network
    was constructed for field data transmission. Based on the regional characteristics
    of Dongying Agricultural High Technology Zone, a cost function was defined in
    the comprehensive consideration of maximum network connectivity, robustness and
    timelines. And then, a global optimization deployment scheme for ZigBee network
    nodes was proposed with the maximum connectivity of the network. Meanwhile, a
    local data collection software with LabVIEW and the remote cloud service platform
    under Brower/Server structure were all achieved. The communication between local
    control software and remote server was achieved through TCP/IP, where the communication
    reliability was guaranteed by the mechanism of offline detection and reconnection.
    A large amount of monitoring data can be accumulated in the remote server, providing
    data support for the treatment of saline soil in the future. The system was put
    into use, the test showed that the system met the functional requirements of data
    monitoring and automation control for irrigation and fertilization, where monitoring
    data can be shown on the website in real-time and control commands can reach the
    correct actuator through the website quickly. Meanwhile, the communication test
    showed that the packet loss rate of the designed ZigBee network data transmission
    was less than 1%.

    the Chinese Society for Agriculture Machinery (CSAM), in charged of China Association
    for Science and Technology (CAST), sponsored by CSAM and Chinese Academy of Agricultural
    Mechanization Science(CAAMS), started publication in 1957. It is the earliest
    interdisciplinary journal in Chinese which combines agricultural and engineering.
    It always closely grasps the development direction of agriculture engineering
    disciplines and the published papers represent the highest academic level of agriculture
    engineering in China. Currently, nearly 8,000 papers have been already published.
    There are around 3,000 papers contributed to the journal each year, but only around
    600 of them will be accepted. Transactions of CSAM focuses on a wide range of
    agricultural machinery, irrigation, electronics, robotics, agro-products engineering,
    biological energy, agricultural structures and environment and more. Subjects
    in Transactions of the CSAM have been embodied by many internationally well-known
    index systems, such as: EI Compendex, CA, CSA, etc.    下载PDF阅读器 相似文献(共20条): [1]

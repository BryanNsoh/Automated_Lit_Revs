    I. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations, “the world’s population is expected to grow to almost ten billion by
    2050, which requires a 60% increase in global food production” [1]. Meanwhile,
    food security is threatened by the increase in pests and diseases, lack of qualified
    labor, and climate changes [2], [3]. The rise in food demand and the challenges
    faced on the production side motivated the shift from traditional agriculture
    to smart farming (SF). SF refers to incorporating technologies in the field to
    either decrease human involvement or increase the quality and quantity of production
    yield [4]. SF and its literature have experienced an explosion in development
    that includes integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) devices, advanced actuation systems, and data analytics techniques. The
    increased volume of research literature has made it difficult for individuals
    to assess the vast quantity of work to identify suitable technologies and best
    practices for a particular technology. To this extent, there have been previous
    efforts to provide an overview of different technologies in SF, such as IoT [5],
    [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19],
    data analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques [14], [18], [20], [21], [22],
    [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], sensor networks [12],
    [17], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], and intelligent actuation systems [39],
    [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. As those papers are technology-oriented, they focus
    exclusively on providing a technical overview of the domain and/or tracking the
    most recent advancements in a field, giving little to no awareness to nonspecialists
    on technology integration guidelines. Other general survey papers focused on identifying
    trends and patterns of research on SF [45], [46], [47] or highlighting the role
    of different technologies in the agricultural industry in a particular region
    [48], [49]. A limitation of previous literature reviews is that they target researchers
    and technology developers rather than farmers and practitioners. The contribution
    of this article is to provide guidance to SF practitioners by surveying the most
    recent scientific literature and analyzing the technology integrated into SF.
    This article examines various integration options for each technology and highlights
    the key challenges faced during technology integration and the proposed solutions.
    The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II presents the
    procedure followed to collect, organize, and analyze the literature. Section III
    shows an in-depth analysis of all technology integrated into SF literature, along
    with their key challenges and solutions. Section IV provide a discussion of systems
    that integrate multiple technologies. SECTION II. Methods This study was designed
    in accordance with the Cochrane reporting methodology for systematic review guidelines.
    The Cochrane protocol was adopted as it guarantees highly structured and transparent
    research outcomes [50]. The methodology entailed identifying the research papers
    included in the survey, preparing the documents for in- depth analysis through
    an initial assessment, and then evaluating and analyzing the literature. A search
    statement that fits a prespecified eligibility/inclusion criterion was applied
    to the IEEE database to find all relevant research papers. The inclusion criteria
    attempt to collate all documents that contribute to studying or applying new technology
    in the field of SF. To meet this criterion, a two-word search statement was used.
    The search statement comprised one word from each of the following sets: [smart,
    precession, intelligent, advanced] and [greenhouse, farming, agriculture]. Truncation
    symbols were used to ensure that plural forms and variant spellings were included
    in the results. The “all fields” option was selected in the search engine to ensure
    inclusiveness. In addition, the publication years were specified to be between
    2015 and 2021. The choice of this particular period is justified by considering
    that SF is a new phenomenon, and the older literature could be misleading in describing
    the current state of the art and research. The search statement was applied to
    the IEEE database to collect papers to be surveyed. The IEEE database was chosen
    for the quality and credibility of its scientific publications, as reflected by
    the 2020 Journal Citation Report [51]. In addition, the IEEE database provides
    access to a comprehensive source of bibliographic citations covering the scope
    of technologies in different fields, including smart agriculture. At this stage,
    2300 papers were obtained. The selection of the IEEE as the only database was
    to balance time restraints and thoroughness. Using IEEE solely is justifiable
    as it is the most extensive database for advancing technologies that guarantee
    to identify sufficient eligible studies and ensure that there is no bias. After
    an initial data set had been collected, a primary analysis has been performed
    to: 1) exclude irrelevant papers based on an exclusion criterion and 2) identify
    research themes. The exclusion criterion was set to ensure that any out-of-scope
    paper should be eliminated. The exclusion criterion was based on papers’ contributions,
    and it included papers that are not related to farming and papers that tackle
    SF from a nontechnology perspective. Papers that are not related to farming included,
    but were not limited to, documents about wind and solar farms, smart cities, animal
    welfare monitoring, and greenhouse gas emissions. Other papers that tackle SF
    from an out-of-scope perspective discuss issues such as designing platforms that
    provide advice to farmers, connecting farmers with other food industry stakeholders
    (customers and retailers), and performing social studies related to SF. The exclusion
    criteria were manually applied to filter papers out. The irrelevant papers were
    filtered manually as adding the “NOT” option in the search criteria would have
    eliminated relevant papers. After filtering the irrelevant papers, the team was
    left with 588 papers. To provide an integral view of the research activity in
    the field of SF, the primary analysis included assessing the papers to identify
    the technology they incorporate. After reviewing all documents, the most analyzed
    SF literature has provided research insight into one of the following themes:
    sensors, big data, communication, actuators and machines, and data analysis. Big
    data refer to techniques adopted to handle issues arising from the difficulties
    in storing, processing, and analyzing the enormous volume of data. After papers
    have been reviewed and tagged with them based on the technology that they incorporate,
    an exhaustive analysis was performed. All included studies were analyzed to draw
    a conclusion on all identified research themes in an impartial and objective way.
    Fig. 1 provides an insight into the structure of each of the themes found that
    will be analyzed holistically in this study. Fig. 1. Taxonomy of the SF literature.
    Show All While some of the literature researches implanting a single technology
    in the field, others show to integrate more than one technology to form a system.
    Fig. 2 shows the breakdown of literature in SF and their contribution to different
    themes and systems. Remote monitoring, automation, and decision support are examples
    of systems present in SF. Any of those systems would include at least two technologies.
    As seen in Fig. 2, the most dominant technology is sensors since they are the
    basis of any SF system. The numbers in Fig. 2 show that some papers do not fit
    in any of the identified themes, while others fall into two or more categories.
    Fig. 2. Heatmap of the SF literature. Show All SECTION III. Analysis: Enabling
    Technologies A. Sensors Sensors are integrated into SF to gather data for various
    reasons, including, but not limited to, environmental monitoring, crop quality
    monitoring, and fertilizers’ control. The deployment of sensors typically takes
    the form of sensor nodes and groups of synchronized sensors that collect data
    and send it to a destination through wireless communication. A sensor node typically
    consists of sensors, a battery, a controller, and a transceiver. A group of connected
    sensor nodes is referred to as a wireless sensor network (WSN). This section focuses
    on sensors and sensor node topologies, including key challenges and solutions
    related to deploying sensors in SF. 1) Sensor Modules: Few papers discuss novel
    sensing techniques [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59] or sensors’
    fabrication [60], [61]. The majority of literature uses commercial off-the-shelf
    sensor modules. Table I lists examples of sensors for environmental and soil-related
    measurements. The sensors listed in Table I have different measuring ranges, accuracies,
    and prices. Practitioners need to choose sensors that work best for their applications.
    An algorithm that optimizes sensor selection for a given application has been
    proposed [62]. TABLE I Commercial of the Shelf Sensor Modules Used in the SF Literature
    2) Sensor Nodes’ Placement and Interconnection in a WSN: Sensors placed in an
    agricultural field can be either stationary or remote. Remote sensors can be accomplished
    in the air through the use of a flying drone [63], [64], [65], [67] or on the
    ground via a patrolled vehicle [68], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]. The choice between
    stationary and remote sensor networks comes with a tradeoff between flexibility
    and cost as stationary uses a fixed sensing grid, which limits reconfigurability
    but lower implementation and use cost. A mobile system can adapt to changing uses
    but has higher implementation and use costs. To guarantee the best coverage area
    for stationary sensors, a design process, which ensures that sensors are optimally
    placed, has been utilized. Typical design considerations for static sensors include
    choosing the sensor locations infield and setting a sensor network architecture.
    The two approaches for placing sensors are equal-distanced sensor placement [84],
    [85], [86], [87] and the trial-and-error method [84]. While the former is more
    common, the latter results in more accurate measurements but a longer design process
    [84]. A computational model that ensures strategic deployment of the equal-distanced
    sensor was developed in [55]. Compared to stationary sensors, remote sensors can
    provide a more accurate representation of the field conditions—i.e., better ability
    to detect microclimates—with fewer sensors. However, battery life is an important
    issue that limits the flight time of drones and other mobile platforms. Also,
    remote sensing needs a navigation system. This can be autonomous, such as unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) [68], or may require an operator [88]. Autonomous navigation
    systems are computationally extensive and would require additional spatial measurements.
    Sensor network architecture is concerned with connections between sensors and
    other components to ensure optimal network configuration. Plane and hierarchal
    architecture are two common architectures implemented in the SF literature. A
    plane architecture is where all nodes have the same status, abilities, and roles.
    On the other hand, a hierarchal structure involves having more superior nodes
    responsible for collecting and forwarding data. A plane structure is more straightforward
    and less affected by an individual node’s failure. However, it is impractical
    in a larger network as it will demand extensive energy [104]. A two-level node
    hierarchal structure is more common [85], [105], [106] where the first level (slave
    nodes) senses and sends the data to a more advanced node (referred to as a sink
    or a master node) that sends data to an external source and coordinates the slave
    nodes. A group of slave nodes managed by a master is referred to as a cluster,
    and the master is the cluster head. Clustering sensors to form nodes can be done
    by grouping like sensors together and powering them with different sources according
    to their different needs [107] or making each node heterogeneous to ensure similar
    power demand among nodes [108]. The first is easier to design and requires less
    human work for battery replacements; however, it might be more expensive. Methods
    for calculating the sensor nodes’ energy demand are presented in [108] and [109].
    3) Challenges: A technical concern when deploying a WSN is energy. In a WSN, the
    energy is constrained to the capacity of the battery powering them. The entire
    sensor node fails once the battery is depleted and not recharged or replaced [110],
    [111]. Hence, minimizing the power consumption of the sensor nodes is critical.
    It is also possible to harvest ambient energy to power the sensor node. To reduce
    the power consumption of the sensor node, research utilizes methods that switch
    the nodes [107], [112], [113] or their transceivers (most power-hungry block)
    [85], [114] OFF when not used. This is also known as putting nodes in the sleep
    mode. The sleep time can occur at prescheduled fixed intervals [107] or event-based
    such as to report changing weather conditions [85] (i.e., a rainy, cloudy day
    would require more awake time than a typical summer day). The fixed-interval sleep
    mode saves energy but risks missing data instances when the node is OFF. Also,
    the setup time taken by the transceiver once it wakes up leaves the node more
    vulnerable to transition delays. Another power-saving method is to continuously
    reconfigure the data routing paths (reassigning master and slave nodes) [108],
    [115], [116]. The operating principle of those methods is to develop an algorithm
    that keeps changing the master node, since it is the most energy-intensive, to
    give all nodes a longer lifetime and guarantee that all nodes will be depleted
    together. Reducing the quantity of data that need to be transmitted is important
    for minimizing power [117]. Spatial data compression (nearby nodes talk to check
    repeated patterns in the data) has been used to lower the amount of transmitted
    data [117]. Although data compression requires some additional computations at
    the node level, it was shown that the computation power is much less than the
    power for long-distance communication [117]. Power saving has also been achieved
    using a low-power microcontroller (e.g., MSP430FR5969 and ESP8266EX) that offers
    increased performance at a lower energy budget [102], [118], [119]. Power consumption
    and battery life shape a burden in remote sensing platforms. That is, since using
    the traditional battery charging stations has an impact on mobility, alternatively,
    replacing the battery when depleted requires additional manual work and higher
    initial investment as one would need spare batteries. To this extent, wireless
    power transfer has been investigated to overcome this burden [73], [120], [121].
    Solar energy harvesting has also been deployed in the literature to solve the
    limited power available to sensor nodes [102], [118], [122], [123]. An additional
    power converter accompanies the integration of solar energy to regulate the power
    supply and the battery charging. BQ25570 IC is an example of a commercialized
    power regulator used [102], [124]. Another energy harvesting technique that overcomes
    the limitations of solar, being weather dependent, is using the radio frequency
    (RF) signal to provide energy to the sensor node [125]. A second challenge faced
    is the risk of losing data due to power loss or failure of components. To mitigate
    this risk, IdealVolting, a technique used to explore the possibility of operating
    below the minimum power specifications without compromising the measurement [126],
    has been studied. Moreover, the literature investigates using ML to predict the
    data to interpolate missing points [98], [127], [128] B. Communication The advances
    in the communication field and the IoT architectures have resulted in many protocols
    that can be utilized in SF, leaving flexibility for users’ selections depending
    on their needs and constraints. Generally, the pattern followed is using two communication
    pathways. Machine-to- Gateway (M2G): Communication back and forth between sensors
    or actuators nodes and microcontrollers. Machine-to- Cloud Communication (M2C):
    Passing data through the transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP)
    network to a final destination. The choice of data transmission platform is subject
    to many constraints, including available bandwidth, the required transmission
    rate, latency, data volume, and reliability. This section discusses the used protocols
    and challenges faced when designing a communication network. 1) M2G Communication
    Protocols: Various protocols have been utilized to establish M2G communication,
    including: 1) standard protocols, such as Zigbee [77], [129], [130], [131], [132],
    [133], [134], [135], Bluetooth [136], [137], [138], Wi-Fi [89], [90], [139], [140],
    [141], cellular networks [110], [129], [130], [131], [133], [142], and RF identification
    (RFID) [95], [121], [143], [144], [145], [146] and 2) low-power wide area networks
    (LPWANs), such as LORA [147], [148], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154],
    [155], NB-IoT [156], [157], and Sigfox [99], [158], [159]. RFID is an energy-efficient
    communication technique, but it has a limited coverage area. Zigbee is based on
    an IEEE standard and can be connected easily through an Xbee module. The advantage
    of Zigbee is its low cost and low power consumption. However, Zigbee is limited
    in terms of data rate and coverage area. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are alternatives
    that offer improved data rates. Bluetooth connection can be established by attaching
    the HC-05 module to the Arduino [128], [130], while Wi-Fi can be through the ESP8266
    [132], [133], [134] module or directly through the Raspberry Pi with a built-in
    Wi-Fi module. The main limitation of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is their narrow coverage
    area, which is overcome in cellular networks that offer high-speed communication
    and a wide coverage range. The SF literature has captured the most recent advancements
    in the cellular network to increase the transmission data rate as in [110], which
    utilizes the critical techniques in 5G to accommodate more sensor nodes and prolong
    the lifetime of the WSNs. However, the use of cellular networks consumes more
    energy. LPWAN is a set of emerging network protocols capable of transmitting data
    over a long distance (couple of kilometers) with relatively lower power to overcome
    standard network limitations. The most common LPWAN protocol, in SF, is LoRaWan,
    an open-access protocol that uses LoRa technology. To set up an LoRaWan network,
    one can use a microcontroller that supports an LoRa module, such as Arduino Uno
    that works with the LoRa/GPS shield [160] or the STM32F103 that is compatible
    with the Lora module Ra01 [161]. Setting up the LoRa network requires calibration
    of the sender and receiver antenna gain [160]. NB-IoT is another LPWAN technology
    that offers more coverage area than LoRa [156], and it can be integrated through
    the SIM7020, which can be connected to a Raspberry Pi [157]. Sigfox has also been
    utilized in SF through the Sigfox ship, SFM11R2D [158], or the Sigfox Shield for
    Arduino (UNASHIELD-V2S) [159]. The main drawback of LPWAN is that it has a relatively
    low data rate in comparison to other traditional protocols. The low data rate
    makes utilizing LPWAN impractical for high density of sensors. A solution to mitigate
    this drawback is to utilize a multichannel gateway [152]. Another drawback of
    LPWAN is the risk of data collision when two nodes are sending data simultaneously.
    This challenge has been addressed in [161] by allocating independent time slots
    for transmission for each node. The solutions proposed to overcome LPWAN limitations
    increase power consumption; hence, optimization is needed between power consumption,
    coverage area, and data rate. 2) M2C Communication Protocols: On the other hand,
    the most common method to establish M2C communication in SF is to connect the
    microcontroller to the local wireless network connected to the Internet. Alternatively,
    some papers use the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) [89], [162], the message
    queue telemetry transport (MQTT) [97], [163], [164], or the constrained application
    protocol (CoAP) [165], TCP/IP protocols that are used to establish M2C communication,
    known as IoT protocols. 3) Challenges: The limited resources assigned to the devices’
    communication create challenges in deploying communication networks. In other
    words, the challenge associated with designing a communication network is the
    desire to achieve a firm, reliable, and fast data delivery while optimizing factors
    such as power consumption, cost, and coverage area. Unfortunately, the literature
    did not state one solution that fits all. Hence, SF integrators should explore
    existing solutions and choose according to their application requirements. This
    section demonstrates an overview of the commonly used communication protocols,
    there are many other factors to be considered. For instance, the performance can
    drastically if deployed indoor or outdoor, urban, or rural, and many other factors.
    Detailed comparisons are available in [158], [166], [167], [168], and [169]. C.
    Actuators and Machines In agriculture, robotics has been applied to various fields
    of agriculture. The SF literature that focuses on robotics revolves around two
    issues. The first is designing new robots that perform tasks in the field. The
    second is to improve the performance of existing irrigation machines. 1) Robots:
    The literature used robots for multiple purposes, including spraying or removing
    pesticides [170], [171], [172], [173], irrigation [174], [175], picking crops
    [171], [176], [177], sewing seeds [178], [179], [180], plowing soil [181], [182],
    and harvesting [162], [183]. Robots’ design and development considerations include
    controlling robots, and their parts’ movement [162], [184], [185], selecting and
    integrating motors [180], [186], and the mechanical design of the body/chaise
    [174], [181], [186], [187] are discussed design issues. The most common method
    to track the movement’s motion is utilizing an ultrasonic sensor [171], [174],
    [181], [182]. As for the motors, dc [175], [176], [181], [188] and servo [172],
    [181], [182], [189] motors are the most common motors used. In addition to the
    robots’ design considerations, achieving long-term autonomy is a significant challenge.
    Although advanced control methods exist in different applications, the nature
    of agricultural fields (vast and numerous arrangements of crops) makes it challenging.
    To address the challenge of robots’ motion, adaptive motion control strategies
    have been proposed [73], [190]. Those strategies showed significant improvement
    over methods that require detailed field information. 2) Irrigation System: As
    irrigation is the basis of agriculture, the literature has explored methods to
    achieve efficient automatic irrigation. The most straightforward practice for
    automating the irrigation system is using pipes controlled via a solenoid valve
    [103], [191], [192], [193]. A solenoid valve is an electromechanical device that
    can be switched by a relay placed on solenoid power cables. Using a solenoid valve
    solely might not be adequate for applications that need applied pressure for water
    transfer. Hence, water pumps have been used for irrigation in SF [119], [194],
    [195]. Pumps allow more flexibility in the system design; however, they demand
    more energy. To overcome limited energy, solar-powered irrigation systems [196],
    [197], [198], [199], [200] or passive irrigation systems have been studied. Passive
    systems use pressure-generated columns derived from the water potential to actuate
    the valve [201] or utilize the siphon concept [202]. While those systems do not
    demand any power, they are adequate for limited-field architectures. Hence, there
    is a tradeoff between design flexibility and power consumption. 3) Challenges:
    The challenge faced while designing an SF irrigation system is the limited amount
    of water available in some fields. The research explored methods to minimize water
    consumption, including reusing wastewater (recycling) [196], [202], [203] to overcome
    this challenge. Another water conservation approach is to adopt water management
    schemes to minimize unnecessary watering of the crops [101], [200]. Also, using
    drip irrigation reduces the amount of water used as it is proven to be the most
    water-efficient irrigation method [168], [196], [199], [200]. D. Managing Big
    Data The enormous volumes of data captured by sensors in SF motivate addressing
    big data management in the literature. Managing big data is a discipline concerned
    with using techniques, tools, and platforms to address storage, preprocessing,
    processing, and security challenges. This section discusses the challenge of handling
    big data and presents the techniques adopted to mitigate those challenges. The
    most significant challenge when dealing with big data is the extensive processing
    power and memory needed for its storage and processing. To deal with the limited
    processing and storing capabilities, most literature chooses to send data to a
    central cloud designed to manage a huge amount of data. Thing speak [89], [134],
    [137], [203], [204], [205], [206], Ubidots [94], Blynk [207], [208], OneNet [209],
    Amazon web services [100], and GoogleColab [210], [211] are examples of free IoT
    cloud services. The advantage of using those cloud services is the ease of integration.
    In addition, most clouds are accompanied by a dashboard that provides real-time
    data visualization and can easily be configured to user interfaces (web services
    or mobile applications). However, sending data to the cloud is accompanied by
    costs inherited from the data transfer and latency due to the time taken to send
    signals. To reduce the cost inherited with the transfer, Gia et al. [155], Alonso
    et al. [212], and Ribeiro et al. [213] proposed methods of filtering data at the
    edge, sending only useful data to the cloud. Alternatively, computational and
    data storage procedures can be brought closer to the sensor or actuator node by
    utilizing existing devices’ capacity (known as edge or fog computing) [206], [214],
    [215], [216], [217]. Unlike cloud computing, a single node having infinite capabilities,
    edge and fog computing deploy multiple distributed nodes with limited computational
    abilities and require resource management to ensure proper deployment. To address
    this issue, resource management techniques optimize the use of resources at the
    edge and guarantee fulfilling the application needs [212], [215]. Another challenge
    faced is the deterioration of data quality due to their exposure to cybersecurity
    attacks or accusation and transmission faults, leaving missing and inconsistent
    data. To handle this problem, papers implemented blockchain technology to ensure
    data privacy and authenticity [218], [219], [220]. Darkweb technology has also
    been used to boost the performance of blockchains as it avoids exposure to malicious
    denial of service attacks [221]. Another method used to enhance the security of
    the data is implementing access control systems to ensure that only authorized
    users can control the data [222], [223]. The later problem has been solved by
    utilizing techniques to identify uncertainties or noise in the data and mitigate
    them. Algorithms based on the Boltzmann ML [224], the Kalman filter [225], and
    the longest common subsequence (LCSS) [226] have been utilized for data processing.
    Enhancing the quality of data has also been achieved through interpolation models
    based on fuzzy and neural network (NN) technology [128] and the anomaly detection
    algorithm based on matching old and new data [227]. E. Data Analysis 1) Machine
    Learning Techniques: As SF advances, ML techniques are widely adopted due to their
    potential to achieve reliable solutions to complex problems. Those techniques
    provide useful insight into the massive data generated by sensors through analyzing
    patterns and identifying trends. This section presents applications of data-driven
    decision-making in SF. ML is the process of using data to acquire a model that
    represents the SF system and predicts its outcome. Broadly, ML in SF can be classified
    into regression and classification. Regression algorithms are used to find the
    relationship between continuous variables, while classification algorithms are
    concerned with determining class membership. The functionality, complexity, and
    data required for those algorithms vary significantly. Simple regression algorithms—including
    linear, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stacked regressors—have been
    utilized to estimate the crop yield [228], [229], [230]. Decision tree, K-nearest
    neighbors (KNNs), random forest, naïve Bayes classifier, and support vector machine
    (SVM) are simple classifiers used to predict the most suitable crop for a region
    [210], [231], [232], [233], [234], [235], [236]. The simplicity of those algorithms
    enables presenting the relationship between data without demanding extensive computation
    power and, hence, can be employed at the edge. On the other hand, those models
    are incapable of doing more complex functions; hence, they have limited applications.
    With the development of more advanced computing approaches, deep learning (DL)
    became the mainstream approach. DL utilizes NN models, the network of simple information
    processing units (known as neurons), to model complex relationships and extract
    features from huge datasets. The connection between neurons has a weight associated
    with them, which assigns a weighted sum to inputs of the neuron, and then, the
    resulted sum is passed through an activation function that determines the neuron’s
    final output value. NN has been used in SF for different purposes including soil
    or atmospheric parameter forecasting [98], [237], [238], optimal Environmental
    Conditions prediction [239], and artificial neural networks (ANN) based controller
    to optimize irrigation [240]. The desire of achieving tasks is to produce accurate
    results using NN, while minimizing the training time made the literature use tailored
    architectures, such as recurrent NNs (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs). RNN has a memory buffer that stores the output of hidden layers and feeds
    it back to itself along with the upcoming input. This buffer makes RNN more suitable
    for processing sequential data. The ability to take the sequential information
    into consideration made RNN suitable for forecasting crop yield [241]. CNNs are
    tailored for image recognition tasks as neurons in an early layer of the network
    would extract local visual features, and neurons in later layers would combine
    these features to form higher order features. CNNs proved high accuracy in feature
    extraction in different SF applications, including detecting and diagnosing diseases,
    and weed-infected areas [242], [243], [244], [245], [246], [247], [248], [249],
    [250], determining the plants’ quantity [92], [234], and detecting animals’ intrusion
    [251]. 2) Challenges: One of the challenges faced when applying ML in SF is the
    ability to find sufficient data to train the model. Finding a large data set that
    contains all possible usual conditions (anomalies) is a prerequisite for the success
    of the ML. To overcome this limitation, the literature utilized different sources,
    including weather repositories [217], [252] and image databases [246], [253],
    besides data collected in the field to train the ML model. However, an online
    task-oriented dataset might not be available. Another approach is to use data
    augmentation techniques to create new instances of data from the existing ones
    [248]. Another challenge faced is the noise in datasets, which might be misleading
    if used to train the ML model. Noisy data have been removed by experts in [254].
    Alternatively, Kalman filtering to smooth the data [255] has been used. The high
    computation power and long training time of NNs shape a burden. To overcome this,
    papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that adjusts a model trained for
    a different task instead of training from scratch [211], [244], [253], [256],
    [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain effective results at reduced cost using
    the pretrained model. SECTION IV. Technology Integration Into Systems Numerous
    papers focused on integrating two or more of the aforementioned technologies to
    create an independent system. Among those systems, remote monitoring and autonomous,
    and discoing-making are the most common. Fig. 3 shows the enabling technologies
    used in forming each system. Fig. 3. Breakdown of SF systems. Show All A. Remote
    Monitoring Systems Remote monitoring systems (RMSs) collect data from the physical
    layer (sensors and actuators) and send it to users through a visualization service
    (e.g., mobile app) and/or store data on a database server for further analysis.
    RMS provides the opportunity for farmers to observe the state of their farm, while
    he is away at any moment. Setting up an RMS requires the interconnection of a
    sensor network, a communication network, and a monitoring platform. Due to the
    varying farmers’ capabilities and demands, the RMS architecture did not converge.
    Its complexity ranges from a single sensing node that delivers data locally to
    multiple node systems that include an Internet connection to send data to a back-end
    IoT system. The former system operates on an internal application running on the
    same server, which has been achieved through deploying the global system for mobile
    communications (GSM) network and sending short message/messaging service (SMS)
    to users [189], [258], [259] or through a mobile application that receives data
    via Bluetooth [136]. The advantage of a local system is that it does it require
    an Internet connection from the farmer. This is vital in the case of an emergent
    message being delivered, such as fire. Having no Internet connection is also preferred
    in some developing countries where Internet availability is not guaranteed. However,
    the GSM network that can send a limited amount of data makes it impractical for
    applications requiring the exchange of huge data amounts. The latter system, which
    is more common, utilizes the IoT concept (exchanging data through the Internet),
    which can be done by directly connecting the sensors to the TCP/IP network or
    through a middle layer, as shown in the communication techniques in Section III-A.
    The gateway can be any device composed of a CPU and equipped with a transceiver
    compatible with the used communication protocol. Raspberry Pi is the most common
    gateway. A sample of different IoT solutions is shown in Table II. TABLE II Different
    Arrangements for RMS B. Autonomous Systems Autonomous systems have recently drawn
    researchers’ attention because of the advantages that it brings to the farm, including
    eliminating the need for manual work and saving a significant amount of water
    [94], [261]. The most common autonomous system discussed in the SF literature
    is the irrigation system. Other autonomous systems include controlling the temperature
    using cooling fans [135], [194], [262], heating fans [135], skylight opening [263],
    wet curtains [264], or bare tube heating systems [265], controlling light intensity
    using shutters [194] or artificial lights [135], [262], [266], [267], [268], and
    controlling humidity using water fans [269] or fogging system [268]. Also, systems
    that automate additives such as adding nutrient solutions [270], [271] or pesticides
    [272] in water or injecting carbon dioxide in the air [273] have been considered
    in the literature. The design process of the above autonomous systems involves
    developing control logic and hardware to operate the actuators along with elements
    discussed in Sections III-A–III-C: connectivity of sensors, local data transmission,
    and actuators. The link between the system components requires synchronization
    to ensure flawless operation. Control logic is an algorithm that generates instructions
    to switch actuators, usually through acquiring and analyzing sensors’ data. Time-based
    [274], [275], farmer-based [91], [270], [276], limit-based, and model-based are
    the classes of control logic implemented in the SF literature. Time- and farmer-based
    methods do not use sensors’ readings as they control the actuators according to
    scheduled time slots or instructions from farmers. Limit-based is the most common
    with a predefined threshold. The output of the limit-based can either be binary
    (ON/OFF) [204], [226], [277], [278], [279], [280], [281] or, more flexibly, fuzzy
    [194], [266], [282], [283], [284], [285], [286], [287], [288], [289], [290], [291].
    Model-based algorithms take actions in accordance with a reference model, which
    can be based on scientific equations [101], [292], [293] or on previous data (i.e.,
    ML models) [163], [239], [268], [294], [295], [296]. The fuzzy-based algorithm
    is preferred over other control algorithms as it enables multiple control variables
    without using more complicated mathematical or database models. Achieving the
    desired status of the actuators generated by the control logic has been done in
    the SF literature through two different hardware arrangements. One is by adding
    a hardware interface between the microcontroller and actuators. The second is
    using designated controllers that directly connect to the actuators. Relays [96],
    [142], [207], [233], [267], [271], [279], [292], [297], [298], [299], [300], [301],
    [302], transistors [303], and motor drivers [205], [261] are examples of blocks
    that operate in conjunction with the microcontroller. An alternative arrangement
    is replacing the microcontroller and the additional hardware with a programmable
    logic controller (PLC) [272], [286], [304]. PLCs can be programed to complete
    the entire automation process as their input can be connected to sensors, and
    their output can be connected to the actuators. PLCs are simpler to set up and
    program than combining a microcontroller with a hardware interface. However, they
    are more expensive and enable less freedom for the onboard control logic. C. Intelligent
    Decision-Making Systems Making decisions through sensors embedded in the field,
    data analysis techniques, and methods of handling big data has reshaped agricultural
    practices. Intelligent decision-making systems are included in all SF stages,
    starting from preplantation to postplantation activities. Predicting which crop
    suits the given environmental conditions and estimating expected crop yield are
    examples of preplantation decision-making. Decision-making during the plantation
    process includes identifying plant diseases, recognizing pests, and providing
    optimal nutrients and irrigation needs. Postplantation decision-making is concerned
    with counting and classifying crops. The high computation power and long training
    time of NNs shape a burden. To overcome this, papers integrate transfer learning,
    a technique that adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training
    from scratch [211], [244], [253], [256], [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain
    effective results at reduced cost using the pretrained model. Table III summarizes
    all decision-making systems utilized in the literature. Table III shows that the
    most common decision-making system is the disease detection systems. Intelligent
    disease detection systems also provide the benefit of early detection and diagnosis,
    which can minimize losses. Weed detection and finding plants’ needs are the literature’s
    second and third most common decision-making systems. All those systems rely on
    plant pictures to extract features (e.g., color, size, morphology, and texture)
    and then classify them. The most common ML technique used is CNNs, as it has proved
    to produce accurate results for feature extraction and object classification.
    The high accuracy of CNN comes at the cost of demanding higher processing power
    and more extensive data volumes that are not always affordable. To overcome the
    limitations of CNN, many papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that
    adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training a model from
    scratch or other ML techniques with CNN. TABLE III Intelligent Decision-Making
    Systems in SF The high computation power and long training time of NNs shape a
    burden. To overcome this, papers integrate transfer learning, a technique that
    adjusts a model trained for a different task instead of training from scratch
    [211], [244], [253], [256], [257]. Transfer learning proved to obtain effective
    results at reduced cost using the pretrained model. Table III also lists various
    sources of data in SF. The selection of the data source is a significant concern
    as it is a prerequisite for the success of the ML approach. Finding the appropriate
    data source is challenging because most ML algorithms need to be trained on a
    large dataset to optimize many parameters. In addition, supervised ML methods
    require the labeling of the data set, which requires a large amount of the experts’
    work. Given those challenges, four sources of data were used in SF literature:
    1) installed sensors; 2) weather stations collecting meteorological data; 3) online
    databases; and 4) agricultural reference material. SECTION V. Discussion The main
    observation of surveying papers on SF is that none of the solutions is satisfactory
    for all SF applications. Hence, practitioners need to choose the one that fits
    their needs and obliges them to their constraints. For instance, sensor integrators
    need to consider the cost, power consumption, and design complexity while choosing
    the sensor types, quantity, and placement methods. As for the communication network,
    there is a tradeoff between power consumption, coverage area, and data rate. On
    the actuation side, having flexibility in designing the irrigation system comes
    at the cost of demanding high power to operate. Finally, on the data side, there
    is a tradeoff between the functionalities provided by the data analysis technique,
    the computation power, and the amount of data demanded. To this end, although
    many papers discuss using commercial off-the-shelf software and hardware platforms
    to provide the needed functionality, none of them performs a technoeconomic analysis.
    The SF literature lacks an analysis of technology integration’s effect on crop
    yield and returns on investment. In addition, the SF literature should have more
    discussion on the scalability and robustness of the proposed technologies. This
    can be done by expanding this work from a theoretical/experimental concept to
    an applicable industrial model and evaluating its effectiveness. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    The field of agriculture is heavily shifting toward utilizing technological solutions
    to enhance agriculture productivity, SF. This article presented a comprehensive
    survey of the state-of-the-art research performed in the field of SF. To this
    end, this article identified the most influential technologies affecting farming
    practices and structures. Analysis of technology integration is presented highlighting
    their advancements, challenges, and solutions. The discussion in this article

    that the world population faces today, and on which researchers from all over
    the world are working, are globalization, global warming, and the supply of food.
    In order to address the latter, it is necessary to develop modern solutions that
    allow the optimization of costs and increased yields, such as the smart management
    of water for precision irrigation in agriculture [1,2]. In recent years, many
    researchers have been integrating the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    into the field of agriculture, thus helping the development of what is known as
    precision agriculture. Precision agriculture aims to provide a decision support
    system that helps farmers to implement efficient agricultural practices, with
    the aim of increasing profitability, reducing environmental risks, and preserving
    natural resources [3,4]. So-called smart agriculture or digital agriculture uses
    intelligent networks and data management tools to employ all of the information
    and experience available in order to enable the automation of sustainable processes
    in agriculture. This agriculture is based on connected and knowledge-based agricultural
    production systems and makes great use of information and communication technologies
    (ICT), both for data collection and for subsequent processing. For this reason,
    the design and implementation of efficient and economic devices in agriculture
    are currently an important line of research [5]. Due to the characteristics of
    the agricultural sector, the use of wired systems for the collection of information
    is practically unfeasible, which is why work is currently underway to develop
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in order to minimize the economic cost and impact
    of installation in agricultural environments, thus avoiding hindering the work
    of the farmer [5,6]. WSN solutions for establishing different parameters in agriculture
    should include certain requirements for smaller farmers to implement this type
    of system on their farms, such as inexpensive devices (i.e., the cost of a radio
    chipset being less than 2€ and an operating cost of 1€ per device per year), low
    energy consumption (i.e., 10+ years of battery lifetime), and a long range of
    communication (i.e., up to 10-40 km in rural zones)—three areas in which we must
    work in the future [2,7,8]. Currently, there are some challenges to be overcome
    that still prevent the use of IoT for irrigation. Firstly, there are still many
    rural areas that do not have Internet connectivity. Secondly, they do not have
    electricity either. Thirdly, monitoring with soil sensors requires scalability,
    but this comes at a price. Finally, the integration of different and advanced
    sensors requires adequate standards. In order to solve the aforementioned problems,
    this paper develops and assesses an inexpensive WSN solution based on long-range
    (LoRa) technology with very low power consumption and high autonomy to control
    water needs for precision irrigation in agriculture. Many additional mechanisms
    have been proposed to increase the battery life of WSN end-devices and to accomplish
    energy saving, irrespective of whether the devices are already of low consumption.
    However, we found it difficult to compare them due to the diversity of the methodologies,
    end-device components, sensors used, and types of experiment. Therefore, the main
    contribution is that due to the fact that existing WSN systems for precision irrigation
    are mostly theoretical with limited proof of concept experiences in practice,
    providing details of devices and equipment as well as irrigation techniques [2,4],
    this work compares consumption to show a more energy-efficient end-device configuration.
    2. Wireless Sensor Networks in the Context of Smart Agriculture We can see different
    solutions for monitoring crops using WSNs. Many of these proposals have only been
    tested in the laboratory and still have to be developed and implemented on real
    crops. A low-cost, small-scale system to remotely monitor and control a greenhouse
    was created in [9]. In this study, the information was collected by an Arduino
    Mega and sent to a web page through ethernet communication. In [10], a system
    based on short message service (SMS) communication using a global system for mobile
    (GSM) module was developed to measure parameters such as soil moisture, pH, and
    atmospheric pressure. With these data, irrigation could be controlled and the
    farmer informed of the state of his crops. Similarly, the authors of [11] developed
    a WSN system with a soil moisture sensor and a temperature and humidity sensor.
    One of the most widely used technologies for creating wireless sensor networks
    in agriculture is the ZigBee technology. In [5,12,13], a WSN was presented for
    monitoring crops by measuring parameters such as soil moisture, pH, conductivity,
    salinity, and ambient light. General packet radio service (GPRS) technology can
    also be used in agriculture to create WSNs [6]. In [14], the authors developed
    an automated irrigation system to optimize the use of water in crops by combining
    the ZigBee and GPRS technologies. By means of this system, the humidity and temperature
    of the land can be measured. Furthermore, in [15], an IoT-based irrigation system
    was presented using soil moisture sensors controlled by ATMEGA 328P on an Arduino
    UNO board, along with a GPRS module. NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) is an LPWAN technology
    based on narrow band radio technology that can coexist with GSM and long-term
    evolution (LTE) under licensed frequency bands. NB-IoT is standardized by the
    3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and its specifications were released
    in June 2016; thus, additional time is needed before its network is established
    [16]. SigFox is a new technology used in IoT applications. In [17], a geolocation
    system was developed to locate herds of cattle. As advantages of the SigFox technology,
    we can highlight its wide range of coverage and low consumption, which makes it
    very appropriate for IoT solutions. With SigFox, LoRa technology has started to
    be used in precision agriculture in recent years as an alternative to previous
    protocols [18,19]. It is a long-range and low-power wireless communication system
    whose objective is to be used in long-term devices [20]. Based on the LoRaWAN
    technology, the MoniSen end-device [1] used the ATMEGA324P processor and the RN2473
    chip to establish LoRa communication, to measure parameters such as ambient temperature
    and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, and light intensity received by the
    plant. In a smart irrigation system [19], the end-device achieved a distance of
    7 km in the field tests. Table 1 shows a comparison of the different communication
    technologies discussed above for the creation of WSNs [8,16,21,22]. Table 1. Comparison
    between the different communication technologies for end-devices. If we analyze
    the data shown in the table above, we can see that GPRS technology, apart from
    its high cost, is not entirely suitable for the communication of wireless sensors
    due to its high energy consumption, which means it is little used in the creation
    of high autonomy nodes. Currently, the ZigBee wireless communication protocol
    is considered one of the best technologies in precision agriculture, given its
    low consumption. If we compare it with the LoRa and Sigfox technologies, we can
    see that all three have low consumption and low cost, making them ideal for the
    creation of WSNs. However, one of its main disadvantages is its short reach between
    nodes—100 m in open spaces, as shown in Table 1—which is both lower than the other
    wireless communication protocols and a great limitation for agriculture. NB-IoT
    is preferred for applications that require guaranteed quality of service, whereas
    applications that do not have this constraint could choose both LoRa or Sigfox.
    Furthermore, the additional energy consumption because of synchronous communication
    reduces NB-IoT’s end-device lifetime as compared to them. In addition, NB-IoT
    is not suitable for rural areas that do not benefit from LTE coverage. Thus, for
    applications that do not have large amount of data to send, Sigfox and Lora are
    the best options [8,16]. In the field of agriculture, a long battery lifetime
    of sensor devices is required. Using temperature, humidity, and electrical conductivity
    (EC), sensors could significantly reduce water consumption and improve yield,
    as discussed in [23]. Devices update sensed data a few times per hour, as the
    environment conditions do not radically change in this time period. Thus, Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN are ideal for this application. Moreover, various farms do not have
    LTE cellular coverage, thus NB-IoT is not a solution for agriculture in the near
    future. Although the LoRa and SigFox technologies have a great technical similarity,
    LoRa technology was used in this work for two reasons: Firstly, because we wanted
    to build a WSN that avoided dependence on third parties. One of the main features
    of this technology is that any user can build their own network, thus avoiding
    having to subscribe in order to use an external network. Secondly, because with
    LoRa, we can support coverage in remote rural areas. Finally, commercial wireless
    detection modules such as eKo Pro [24], MicaZ [25], TelosB [26], Zolertia [27],
    Adcon Telemetry GmbH [28], AquacomSensor Hub Aquaflex [29], Enviroscan [30], or
    Waspmote [31] for agriculture and its irrigation are still very expensive—usually
    exceeding 1000.00€—making it impossible for smaller farms to implement this type
    of system, as well as for smart farms, which require a large number of wireless
    end-devices for data collection that support reliable decision making. 3. Materials
    and Methods In the first instance, we installed the LoRa gateway in an elevated
    position [32], in the headquarters of an agricultural cooperative from which coverage
    of nearby crops could be given. Thanks to the LoRa technology, we could easily
    cover an area of about 5 km around this cooperative; this is less than other studies,
    but we did not modify the LoRaWAN PHY layer and did not point the antenna toward
    the test area [32,33]. Then, end-devices (BoXmotes, Bo True Activities SL, Huelva,
    Spain) were installed in the crop, which were equipped with the most suitable
    sensors, depending on the parameters that were to be measured. In this way, the
    BoXmote took measurements at regular intervals and sent them to the gateway through
    the LoRa technology. Once the gateway received the data, they were sent to a server
    via the ethernet connection. When the data reached the server, the farmer could
    consult them through a mobile application. 3.1. Hardware Description In this section,
    a complete description of the hardware that makes up our end-device is given.
    When choosing the hardware that forms our end-device, it should be noted that
    all of the components were selected with low consumption in mind, thus increasing
    battery life to the maximum. Each end-device comprised a radio transceiver, a
    micro-controller, sensors, and an antenna, along with other circuitry that would
    enable it to communicate with the gateway to transmit information collected by
    the sensors [34]. 3.1.1. Monitored Parameters and Sensors According to [4], the
    majority of papers monitored between three and four parameters with soil moisture
    being the most used in soil sensors, and air temperature and humidity as atmospheric
    parameters. Soil temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), and luminosity are
    other parameters that are measured regularly [5]. In relation to the measurement
    of soil moisture, most studies use the conductivity between two electrodes that
    are inserted into the soil by measuring the constant dielectric of the soil. Most
    published works use the low-cost sensors YL69 (Sparkfun Electronics, Niwot, CO,
    USA) and VH400 (Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) that operate with Arduino.
    However, we both tested and discarded them because they did not behave stably
    under real conditions. Thus, to measure the soil parameters, we used well-known
    commercial sensors [35] (see Table 2) as the capacitive sensor of the frequency
    domain reflectrometry (FDR) type ECH2O 10HS (Meter Group, Inc, Pullman, WA, USA)
    to measure soil moisture, and ECH2O 5TE to measure soil moisture and temperature,
    as well as EC. These sensors were not specifically created to be integrated in
    an Arduino measuring system, but we developed our own code written in the open
    source Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software and uploaded
    it to the board to be able to work with it. Table 2. Popular wireless nodes used
    in the agriculture domain. The low-cost DHT11/DHT22 sensors (Adafruit Industries,
    New York, NY, USA), which provide temperature and relative humidity readings,
    as well as light-dependent resistance (LDR), are the most commonly used sensors
    for smart irrigation monitoring [4]. Just as we did to test low-cost soil sensors,
    we tested these sensors for a year in real conditions and they worked well, and
    since IoT irrigation systems generally do not need the highest level of accuracy,
    we decided to use them for our work. 3.1.2. LoRa Technology LoRa, whose meaning
    is “long range”, is a long-range communications system promoted by the LoRa Alliance
    [36]. This system is aimed to be used in devices where energy consumption is of
    the utmost importance. LoRa can commonly refer to two distinct layers [20]: 1.
    A physical (PHY) layer, the so-called LoRa, that uses the radio modulation technique
    chirp spread spectrum (CSS). 2. A medium access protocol (MAC) layer in which
    LoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and the specific access network architecture.
    The LoRa modulation physical layer (Semtech Camarillo, CA, USA) allows a wide
    range at low power. We used the RN2483 transceiver module for Lora Class A, which
    operates in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band of 868
    MHz. The payload of each transmission can vary from 2 to 255 octets and the data
    rate can reach 50 Kbps [1]. LoRaWAN provides a MAC mechanism, which allows many
    end-devices (end-nodes) to communicate with a single gateway using LoRa modulation.
    A typical LoRa network shows a star-of-stars topology, which includes three different
    types of devices—the end-devices, the LoRaWAN gateways, and the network service
    [20,32]. In the basic architecture of a LoRaWAN network (Figure 1), the end-nodes
    communicate with the corresponding gateway using LoRa with a LoRaWAN link, and
    the gateways send LoRaWAN frames to a network server via a broadband link (i.e.,
    Ethernet or GPRS) [20]. Figure 1. Photograph of the wireless sensor node. 3.1.3.
    Sensor Node The node is the device in charge of collecting the necessary data
    in the field to later transmit to the gateway. Its two main characteristics must
    be low consumption and being able to establish communication at the greatest possible
    distance. Arduino boards (Smart Projects Srl, Scarmegno, Italy), such as Arduino
    UNO and Arduino Mega, are the most utilized nodes for the implementation of irrigation
    systems, and the most utilized controller is the ATmega328 (Atmel, San José, CA,
    USA) [4]. The selection of the best node for an IoT irrigation system depends
    on the necessities and the characteristics. We opted for developing our own design
    for the nodes, with the aim of addressing our own particular requirements of low
    power consumption and autonomy. Our end-node includes a processor fully compatible
    with Arduino IDE. Moteino (LowPowerLab, LLC, Michigan, MI, USA) is ideal for IoT
    applications because of its very small size (1.3 × 0.9 inch). The moteino used
    is a versatile low-cost and low-power Arduino based on the Atmel ATMega328P microcontroller.
    Moteino gives years of run time at a low transmission rate, with a 2000–2600 mAh
    battery. During sleep mode the radio power consumption is about 0.1 uA; during
    receive mode around 15mA; and in transmit mode the power consumption is up to
    130 mA. On the other hand, to establish LoRa communication with the gateway, the
    node has the RN2483 chip. This chip was also optimized to obtain the lowest possible
    consumption, in addition to being certified by the LoRa alliance. As small farmers
    cannot afford commercial solutions, we designed a shield for implementing the
    low-cost IoT irrigation system. This system can integrate numerous sensors that
    measure a large number of agricultural parameters, both soil and atmospheric (See
    Figure 1). A lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery with a nominal voltage of 3.7
    V and a capacity of 2000 mAh, equipped with a protection circuit that prevents
    overcharging as well as deep discharging, was used to power the node. As an alternative,
    Li-Ion batteries with 3.7 V nominal voltage and a capacity of 2600 mAh can also
    be used, obtaining greater autonomy. LiPo batteries were chosen as they can achieve
    a high load density with a very small weight and size. Additionally, with the
    implementation of a small solar panel and the TP4056 module, the battery could
    be recharged continuously, increasing the device´s autonomy and providing the
    discharge effect. In order to guarantee correct communication, the node was equipped
    with an omnidirectional antenna with SubMiniature version A (SMA) connector with
    an operating frequency of 868 MHz. Finally, all of the components were placed
    in a polyester enclosure (IP66) with a silicone lid seal, in which all of the
    necessary holes were drilled to mount the connections of the antenna and the sensors.
    To connect the (external) sensors to the (internal) electronics, we used cable
    glands (IP68) (Bopla Gehäuse Systeme GmbH, Bünde, Germany) for the BoXmote placed
    in the field test. In the following image (Figure 2), the completely assembled
    node (end-device for the lab test) is shown. Figure 2. Node sensor (end-device
    for the lab test). 3.1.4. Gateway The Gateway is the element in charge of receiving
    the information from the nodes and taking it to the network. It consists of a
    microprocessor, a concentrator, and an antenna. First, the antenna receives the
    information sent by the node and communicates it to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
    (Sony, Pencoed, Wales) microprocessor through the IC880a concentrator, which includes
    a Semtech SX1301 chip. The base-station placements were at the edge of the rooftop
    on a building in the University of Huelva for the laboratory test, and on the
    rooftop of a cooperative for the field test. The base-stations employed in our
    experiments were ISM-868MHz outdoor omnidirectional antennas (SIRIO GP 868 C and
    GP901C models). Then, the Raspberry Pi is responsible for processing all of the
    information necessary to upload the information to the network through the previously
    installed software. In this work, we estimated the consumption in a rural scenario
    using fixed positions from the end-device to the gateway, not under mobility conditions
    [32]. 3.2. Software Description Since the Moteino driver is fully compatible with
    Arduino, it was programmed using the Arduino IDE software with the C++ programming
    language. The software operation of the node is shown in the flow diagram (Figure
    3). When the device is activated, the different outputs and inputs of the processor
    are configured. Next, the RN2483 chip is initialized, through which the information
    is later transmitted. Then, the necessary data are collected from the different
    sensors that are connected to the node at that moment. Since the sensors deliver
    a specific voltage depending on the physical parameter we wish to measure, it
    is necessary to transform this reading into specific physical units. To this end,
    data processing is carried out following the guidelines set by the manufacturers.
    To save battery, only the necessary data are processed (fog computing). The rest
    is processed in the cloud. Once the desired data are obtained, these are sent
    through the RN2483 module to the nearest gateway. Figure 3. Flow chart of the
    node sensors. After having sent the information, the LoRa module enters a “sleep”
    mode, through which it is possible to lower its consumption drastically. Then,
    the same is done with the Moteino microcontroller. In this way, the device has
    minimum consumption during the time between measurements, preserving the battery
    life well. The time between measurements must be programmed to extend the battery
    life, but also, in turn, to have sufficient precision to quickly detect changes
    in soil moisture or weather conditions, and it is not necessary to monitor the
    parameters in real-time [4]. In our experience, for the cultivation of berries
    in hydroponics, taking measurements every 30 min is sufficient. In irrigated systems
    with trees, they tend to be taken with less frequency, as well as in outdoor irrigated
    crops too. Thus, we used the most extreme case. 4. Results As already mentioned,
    one of the main characteristics that an IoT device must have is low consumption.
    Specifically, in the agriculture sector, it is essential to design a very low
    consumption device with which a great autonomy is achieved [37]. In this way,
    the farmer does not have to worry about the maintenance of the device during the
    months of maximum work, being able to devote his time to other tasks. Given the
    importance of a high autonomy of the device in agriculture, in this study we focused
    on quantifying the consumption of our BoXmote, performing a consumption test in
    the laboratory. Then, from the data obtained in the said test, the life of the
    battery in a real crop was estimated. Finally, a comparison of the results obtained
    with other existing devices was made. For the experiments, we followed the methodology
    used in [1,6,13,38]. The node used to perform the experiment consisted of a Moteino
    microcontroller and a LoRa module with the RN2483 chip. To measure volumetric
    water content, soil temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity data, it was
    decided to use ECHOH2O 5TE and ECHOH2O 10HS sensors, which are widely used in
    agriculture. As regards the battery, a lithium battery with a nominal voltage
    of 3.7 V and a capacity of 2000 mAh was available. To perform the experiment,
    the node was configured to take measurements every 93 s. It was decided to perform
    the test with such a short interval between measurements in order to decrease
    the total duration of the experiment. In order to save the battery as much as
    possible in the intervals in which the node is not working, the different components
    go to sleep mode, drastically lowering the consumption and preserving even more
    the battery charge. The node was located in the laboratory at a temperature of
    approximately 20 °C with the meter sensors in the air, and at an approximate distance
    between the node and the Gateway of 600 m. In order to correctly evaluate the
    consumption of the device, its process was divided into three states: Active mode:
    in this mode, the node configures the microcontroller and initializes the RN2483
    chip. Once these actions have been carried out, it proceeds to read the data provided
    by the sensors and performs the subsequent processing of the information. Send
    mode: this mode of operation is the one that consumes the most energy, since it
    is the moment in which the information is sent to the nearest gateway. “Sleep”
    mode: Unlike in the previous case, this mode saves the maximum battery charge
    as it is not necessary to take or transmit measurements. To do this, both the
    microcontroller and the RN2483 chip “fall asleep.” Figure 4 shows the BoXmote
    with which the battery consumption test was carried out. As previously mentioned,
    the 5TE and 10HS sensors were incorporated, since they are currently the most
    widely used in agriculture. Figure 4. Node with ECH2O soil moisture sensors. 4.1.
    Experimental Laboratory Setup In the first experiment, real measurements of consumption
    were taken in the different modes of operation, as well as the time that each
    one remains active. We used a Digital Multimeter JHS MY-64 [39] to realize the
    current measurement. To ascertain the state of the end-device, we added a light-emitting
    diode (LED, sleep mode indicator) to monitor it. The consumption shown takes all
    the parts of the node (antenna, all sensors, processing, etc.) into consideration.
    The measurements were performed by averaging. The statistical procedure of one
    sample t-test was used to determine if the sample of observations could have been
    generated by a process with the experimental average value. The results obtained
    are summarized in the table below. In Table 3, we can see how the node spends
    most of the time in \"sleep,\" mode with a consumption of 0.036 mA. This consumption
    increases up to 9.4 mA while the microcontroller is in active mode, acquiring
    data through the sensors. Finally, while the information is sent through the LoRa
    module, the consumption is 22 mA for approximately one second. Table 3. Average
    power consumption (mA) for the different modes. From the data shown in Table 3,
    we can calculate the average device consumption for this time interval between
    data collection as follows: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 9.4 mA×4 s+22 mA×1 s+0.036 mA×88 s 93
    s =0.674 mA Once the average consumption of the node is obtained, and knowing
    the capacity of the battery, we can calculate its theoretical duration: 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛=
    2000 mAh 0.674 mA =2967 h=123 days As will be seen later, this theoretical duration
    is only useful for performing a first estimate. Normally, the actual duration
    of the battery is well below the theoretically calculated value. The second test
    had as its objectives obtaining the discharge curve of the battery and its real
    duration. Thus, measurements of the voltage supplied by the battery were taken
    periodically during the operation of the device. In this way, we were able to
    estimate its state of charge, as well as the time for which the device can operate
    without needing maintenance or battery change. Next, the voltage values measured
    against the number of days that it was in operation were plotted on a graph. As
    can be seen in Figure 5, the voltage supplied by the battery starts at 4.1 V and
    decreases rapidly during the first few days. Meanwhile, as we get closer to the
    nominal voltage of the battery (3.7 V), the curve decreases more slowly toward
    this value. Once the voltage drops below the nominal value of the battery, it
    drops drastically. This behavior is typical of lithium batteries, as is the case
    here. Figure 5. Node battery voltage. During the experiment, the node ran for
    a total of 72 days, during which it took measurements every 93 s. In this time
    period, more than 49,000 measurements were taken. If we compare the battery life
    obtained in the real experiment with the theoretically calculated one, we can
    verify that its real life is approximately 60% of the theoretical one. These data
    may vary depending on the characteristics or battery and environmental conditions.
    For example, in [1], a value of 70% is taken to estimate the duration of the battery.
    In contrast, [6,13,38] did not use any correction factor to calculate battery
    life. 4.2. Field Test The farm selected as a case study is a berry farm located
    in Huelva (Andalusia, Spain), one of the most important berry producing areas
    in Europe and where 100% of the crop is irrigated under plastic (Figure 6). In
    climatic terms, this is a semi-arid zone with an annual rainfall of approximately
    630 mm. The validation tests were carried out on a blueberry crop that covers
    two plots of approximately 4 hectares each. Figure 6. Experimental site for the
    field test. The devices were installed in this crop for 6 months (January–June,
    2018) (Figure 7). Figure 8 shows the snapshots of real data from the sensors.
    Figure 7. Installed device taking measurements every 30 min. Figure 8. User interface
    of the application web. Because the parameters that are be measured in the crop
    do not show large variations in short time intervals, it was decided that if measurements
    are taken every 30 min, a correct balance between battery life and adequate precision
    would be obtained, allowing us to evaluate the state of the crop in real time.
    Thus, if we use the data previously measured in the different operating modes,
    we can calculate the average of the device for a time between measures of 30 min
    in the following way: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 9.4 mA×4 s+22 mA×1 s+0.036 mA×1795 s 1800 s
    =0.069 mA Taking into account the calculations performed previously, and assuming
    that the actual duration is 60% of the theoretical calculation, the estimated
    duration of the battery for a time between data collection of 30 min would be
    the following: 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 2000 mAh×0.6 0.069 mA =17391 h=724 days With this autonomy,
    the end-device would be able to operate for two years without the need for battery
    change or any maintenance. 5. Discussion Estimating the energy efficiency for
    an IoT device is very difficult when there are several communication technologies,
    electronic components, and measuring devices, as well as a multitude of environmental
    conditions and particular situations for each crop and its needs. These limitations
    are commented upon in some works [40]. It was not the objective of this work to
    modify hardware and software parameters to reduce consumption, but to decide on
    the most appropriate technology and components that would allow us to develop
    an end-device with low consumption. We also decided on the best intervals for
    data collection and sending, and the microcontroller was programmed to achieve
    minimal consumption. Finally, we compared the results with other similar works
    in the field of smart irrigation. The results achieved in this study improve upon
    the recently published ones. For instance, [13] present a node formed by the Msp430F1611
    Texas Instruments processor and wireless communication at 2.4 Ghz with a gateway.
    To measure the different terrain parameters, they used two Hydra Probe II sensors.
    The measurements were taken every 30 min, obtaining an average consumption of
    0.5035 mA. The calculated autonomy was 223 days, achieved by installing a 2700
    mAh battery. In [1], a device using LoRa communication was developed to measure
    temperature and humidity parameters and soil data. With a time between measures
    of 60 min, the average consumption of the device was 0.4026 mA, achieving a range
    of 73 days for a 2400 mAh battery. Unlike the previous case, the author corrected
    the duration of the battery by the factor 0.75, thus achieving a result closer
    to reality. The GAIA2 system [5] communicates via radio at 2.4 GHz with a gateway.
    In laboratory tests, with a node and a humidity and temperature sensor SHT71,
    an average consumption of 0.089 mA was obtained. On the other hand, a real field
    experiment was carried out in which two MPS-2 sensors were used, capable of measuring
    the water potential and soil temperature, obtaining a total battery life of 56
    days. Finally, the LoRa irrigation system proposed by [19], which uses a lithium
    battery with 4800 mAh, consumes, in their different operative modes, 2.0987 mA
    on average, equating to a battery life of 57 days under the same conditions as
    our experiment. We presented a system capable of an average consumption of 0.069
    mA, thus providing a battery life of up to 724 days. If we compare these results
    with those obtained in previous articles, we can see that consumption has been
    reduced significantly, along with a significant increase in battery life. The
    following Table 4 shows a comparison of the results obtained in other studies.
    Table 4. Comparison of data obtained with other methods. If we compare the results
    obtained in our study with those obtained by [13], we can see that both devices
    take measurements every 30 min and have two sensors that measure various parameters
    of the soil. However, the average consumption obtained by our device is a reduction
    of 86% compared to the consumption of the other device. Regarding the life of
    the battery, our device is capable of increasing the life of the battery by more
    than 300% compared to the work in [13]. Comparing the results of our BoXmote with
    those obtained by [1], we can see that our average consumption is 82% less than
    that of their device. Bearing in mind that in this case the time between measurements
    is 60 min, this would mean that average consumption would be even higher if the
    time were reduced to 30 min. Regarding the life of the battery, the BoXmote has
    an autonomy 990% greater than the device presented by [1]. Finally, if we compare
    the results of our BoXmote with [5], we can see that both devices have two soil
    sensors and a time between measurements of 30 min. In this case, the life of the
    battery is increased by 1292%, which represents a significant improvement over
    the solution proposed by [5]. As can be seen, a significant increase in battery
    life was obtained in terms of wireless sensor networks. In this way, one of the
    great problems that these devices present during their operation is solved. Another
    advantage that our system has over other similar ones that are currently marketed
    is its low cost. The BoXmote has a cost of 70.00€ compared to the usual cost of
    end-devices around 350.00€. This low cost allows us to distribute a large number
    of nodes for the crop, thus obtaining much more precise information. 6. Conclusions
    Most of the papers related to WSN do not include quantitative results about the
    impact of the WSN’s deployment in the field [41]. In this paper, we presented
    a low-cost system based on LoRa technology capable of taking measurements of the
    parameters most used in precision agriculture, such as humidity and ambient temperature,
    light received by the plant, and soil temperature, soil moisture, and EC. The
    results obtained show better consumption than that of commercial wireless sensors.
    The consumption of the node was measured in its different operating states, and
    the battery discharge curve was obtained, achieving, if measurements were taken
    every 30 min, an approximate battery duration of 724 days. All the consumption
    required by data acquisition and sending to the gateway was taken into consideration.
    In order to increase the battery life and take into account the discharge effect,
    a solar panel could be installed in the node and evaluation performed on how it
    affects the consumption of the battery. Another line of work is related to the
    type of battery installed. In this case, the operation of the node can be compared
    with another type of power, such as alkaline or lithium-ion batteries. We are
    aware that more work is needed on energy consumption, both from a theoretical
    and practical point of view. The analysis of gateway consumption is another interesting
    topic for agriculture, especially in remote areas or developing regions. Finally,
    a more detailed study on the evolution of NB-IoT technologies versus LoRaWAN and
    SigFox should be analyzed. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.D.B.; Methodology,

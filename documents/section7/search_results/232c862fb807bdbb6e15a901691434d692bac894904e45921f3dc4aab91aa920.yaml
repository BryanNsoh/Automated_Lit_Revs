    1. Introduction According to the United Nations, agriculture accounts for approximately
    70% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals, with the majority of the water being
    used for irrigation activities (WWAP, 2015). However, with the global freshwater
    shortage crisis worsening due to rapid population growth and climate change, there
    is a pressing need for effective water management strategies, particularly in
    relation to irrigation activities, in order to address the growing freshwater
    shortages. Closed-loop irrigation scheduling, which utilizes feedback to provide
    crops with precise water amounts at optimal times, has been proposed as a solution
    for ensuring efficient water management in irrigation. In the context of designing
    closed-loop irrigation schedulers, machine learning techniques and model predictive
    control have emerged as valuable tools. 1.1. Unsupervised learning in irrigation
    scheduling To improve water-use efficiency in closed-loop irrigation scheduling,
    it is essential to consider the inherent variability in agricultural fields, which
    necessitates the development of variable rate closed-loop schedulers. A key aspect
    of designing variable rate schedulers involves dividing the field into distinct
    irrigation management zones, which are characterized as homogeneous areas with
    similar soil properties and cropping conditions. This zoning approach enables
    a targeted irrigation approach, optimizing the allocation of water across different
    zones. Unsupervised machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering (Galambošová
    et al., 2014, Haghverdi et al., 2015), fuzzy c-means clustering (Fontanet et al.,
    2020, Li et al., 2007) and Gaussian Mixture (Yuan et al., 2022) have emerged as
    valuable tools in delineating fields into irrigation management zones, utilizing
    attributes such as yield maps, topography, satellite photographs and soil electrical
    conductivity. Despite the reported effectiveness of current management zone delineation
    approaches, designing model-based irrigation schedulers for these zones presents
    challenges. A significant challenge is that existing methods do not explicitly
    consider crucial model inputs, such as soil hydraulic parameters, mainly due to
    difficulties in obtaining accurate field-scale hydraulic parameter data. One practical
    approach to obtain soil hydraulic parameters at field scale is to estimate these
    parameters using field measurements. Remarkably, the literature has not yet investigated
    the utilization of estimated soil hydraulic parameters for the purpose of defining
    irrigation management zones that can be effectively modeled using agro-hydrological
    models. 1.2. Supervised learning in irrigation scheduling Supervised machine learning
    techniques have been utilized to develop efficient and accurate agro-hydrological
    models, enabling the design of robust irrigation schedulers. Notably, long short-term
    memory networks (LSTMs) (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023, Jiménez
    et al., 2020) and feed-forward neural networks (Gu, Zhu, Jiao, Xu, & Qi, 2021)
    have gained attention in this context. Despite their success, challenges persist
    in these modeling approaches. For example, previous LSTM models (Adeyemi et al.,
    2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023) predicted soil moisture at a single location
    within the crop’s rooting depth, neglecting the fact that crops extract water
    from multiple locations. An attempt to address this in Gu et al. (2021) involved
    training multiple feedforward neural networks to predict soil moisture at specific
    locations within the rooting depth, with irrigation schedules derived through
    a weighted average of the model predictions. However, this method, while effective,
    poses challenges for optimization-based irrigation schedulers, as integrating
    multiple neural network predictions significantly increases computational complexity
    and time. Additionally, the feed-forward neural network in Gu et al. (2021) has
    a limitation, considering only a single rooting depth and not accommodating the
    time-varying nature of rooting depth, potentially impacting irrigation schedule
    accuracy. The literature has yet to explore the development of a concise data-driven
    model using machine learning to directly predict root zone soil moisture content
    while considering dynamic changes in rooting depth. 1.3. Scheduling In a broad
    context, ‘scheduling’ involves determining the optimal allocation of limited resources
    to achieve a specific objective. Scheduling is a decision-making process aimed
    at optimizing one or more objectives, considering the ongoing processes and their
    interactions with the environment. The challenges of scheduling are prevalent
    in various manufacturing and chemical processing systems. Numerous approaches
    have been proposed to address scheduling problems in chemical process systems.
    For instance, dynamic optimization-based scheduler formulations, as seen in Flores-Tlacuahuac
    and Grossmann (2006) and Zhuge and Ierapetritou (2014), have been employed to
    account for the dynamic nature of chemical processes. Furthermore, insights from
    Subramanian, Maravelias, and Rawlings (2012) have facilitated the transformation
    of scheduling models into state–space form. Reactive scheduling (Mendez and Cerdá,
    2004, Touretzky et al., 2017), robust scheduling (Li & Floudas, 2014) and closed-loop
    scheduling (Gupta et al., 2016, Subramanian et al., 2012) approaches have been
    introduced to handle uncertainties’ impact on schedule quality. Another emerging
    area is the integration of production scheduling and process control (Burnak et
    al., 2018, Zhuge and Ierapetritou, 2012), driven by the substantial economic benefits
    derived from a closer integration of scheduling and supervisory control. 1.4.
    Model predictive control Model Predictive Control (MPC) has significantly shaped
    control practice, especially in addressing constrained multivariable control problems.
    It operates by synthesizing control inputs through the iterative solution of finite
    horizon optimal control problems across overlapping horizons. Recently, MPC theory
    and methods have found application in addressing scheduling problems (Subramanian
    et al., 2012). Notably, MPC has been extended to scheduling-related domains like
    inventory control (Yi & Reklaitis, 2015) and supply chain management (Subramanian,
    Rawlings, & Maravelias, 2014). In the field of irrigation scheduling, set-point
    tracking MPC (Delgoda et al., 2016, McCarthy et al., 2014) and zone MPC (Nahar,
    Liu, Mao, Liu, & Shah, 2019) have been utilized to calculate irrigation schedules.
    It is important to note that these MPC-based irrigation schedulers primarily focused
    on continuous-valued inputs. However, scheduling problems inherently involve combinatorial
    aspects, requiring discrete decisions to allocate limited resources over time.
    For instance, in the daily irrigation scheduling problem, determining the irrigation
    time involves discrete decision-making. Recent research has shown that discrete-valued
    controls can be directly integrated into the MPC framework with minimal adjustments
    to stability properties (Rawlings & Risbeck, 2017). Consequently, this has led
    to the application of mixed-integer MPC to address scheduling challenges in various
    domains, including chemical production systems (Risbeck et al., 2018, Subramanian
    et al., 2012). In the field of irrigation scheduling, a novel approach, namely
    LSTM-based mixed-integer MPC with zone control, was proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo
    et al. (2023) to address the daily irrigation scheduling problem. Despite advancements
    in optimization techniques, mixed-integer MPC still encounters computational challenges,
    particularly in large-scale systems. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques
    that can efficiently solve mixed-integer MPC problems within a reasonable time
    frame. In this context, the sigmoid function approach was employed to enhance
    the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation schedulers
    (Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023). Despite its success, it is essential to address
    its limitations, such as approximation errors and occasional challenges with poorly
    conditioned optimization problems. Overcoming these issues can be achieved by
    leveraging the current achievements of reinforcement learning in addressing complex
    problems. An additional under-explored aspect is the comprehensive evaluation
    of the real benefits associated with adopting MPC methods in irrigation scheduling.
    Despite the potential advantages, such as enhanced irrigation water-use efficiency
    compared to the widely-used triggered approach, a notable research gap exists
    in the lack of extensive comparative analyses between MPC-based scheduling and
    the standard approach. Bridging this gap is important for promoting the wider
    adoption of MPC-based schedulers in practical irrigation settings. 1.5. Reinforcement
    learning in irrigation scheduling Reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of machine
    learning designed for decision-making in dynamic environments, plays a pivotal
    role in addressing key challenges in irrigation scheduling. Applied to this context,
    RL has demonstrated its utility in handling uncertainties associated with weather
    conditions, improving robustness, automating sensor data acquisition, and calculating
    irrigation schedules (Chen et al., 2021, Ding and Du, 2020, Yang et al., 2020).
    RL has also introduced a new approach to solving complex optimal control problems
    like mixed-integer MPC (Vinyals et al., 2019). Various strategies, such as hierarchical
    structures (Masson et al., 2016, Wei et al., 2018), and hybrid actor–critic approaches
    (Fan, Su, Zhang, & Yu, 2019), have been proposed to adapt RL algorithms for handling
    both discrete and continuous actions inherent in mixed-integer optimal control
    problems. Despite these advancements, research on RL for mixed-integer optimal
    control problems in engineering applications remains limited (Xu & Lin, 2023).
    Furthermore, the application of RL techniques to mixed-integer MPC problems in
    irrigation scheduling has not been explored. 1.6. Scope of work From the above,
    it is evident that existing irrigation schedulers primarily focus on utilizing
    individual machine learning paradigms to tackle specific challenges inherent in
    the irrigation scheduling problem. Likewise, MPC-based irrigation schedulers primarily
    integrate one of these machine learning paradigms into their design. The potential
    advantages of harmonizing these methodologies have yet to be explored within a
    single irrigation scheduling framework. Accordingly, the main objective of this
    study is to propose a novel irrigation scheduling framework that incorporates
    all three machine learning paradigms and mixed-integer MPC within a unified framework.
    In the effort to integrate all three machine learning paradigms and mixed-integer
    MPC into a single framework, this work makes the following contributions: 1. The
    development of a three-stage irrigation management zone process that incorporates
    k-means clustering and estimated soil hydraulic parameters to delineate large-scale
    agricultural fields into irrigation management zones optimized for agro- hydrological
    modeling. 2. The utilization of LSTM networks to develop a computationally efficient
    data-driven models capable of directly predicting root zone soil moisture content
    while accounting for dynamic nature of the crop rooting depth. 3. The use of decentralized
    hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting irrigation management
    zone to enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC for irrigation
    scheduling in agricultural fields with multiple management zones. 4. The demonstration
    of the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling approach on a real field. During
    this demonstration, a comparison between the proposed MPC-based scheduling approach
    and the widely employed scheduling approach is performed in terms of irrigation
    water-use efficiency and total prescribed irrigation. This paper extends the findings
    presented in Agyeman, Nouri, Appels and Liu (2023). In contrast to Agyeman, Nouri
    et al. (2023), the current work introduces a new approach that leverages LSTM
    networks to develop computationally efficient data-driven models. Additionally,
    this study employs decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and introduces the
    concept of a limiting management zone to enhance the computational efficiency
    of the mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation scheduler. Furthermore, the paper conducts
    a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed scheduling framework on a large-scale
    agricultural field. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. k-means clustering for management
    zone delineation In the context of designing efficient closed-loop irrigation
    schedulers, the process of management zone delineation assumes an important role
    as an essential initial step. To this end, this study proposes a three-stage approach
    for management zone delineation that incorporates k-means clustering and estimated
    soil hydraulic parameters. The resulting management zones from this approach are
    optimized for agro-hydrological modeling. A detailed explanation of the various
    stages is provided below. 1. Stage 1: delineation according to crop type. The
    initial step in the proposed approach involves creating uniform areas within an
    agricultural field based on the diverse crops present. This step is important,
    as irrigation scheduling is significantly influenced by the varying water requirements
    of different crops. Given the common practice of cultivating a variety of crops
    in irrigated fields, using crop type as a basis for the initial delineation allows
    the subsequent stages of the proposed approach to effectively address the specific
    water needs of individual crops present in the agricultural field. 2. Stage 2:
    delineation according to elevation and soil-hydraulic parameters. In this stage,
    the management zones identified in Stage 1 undergo further refinement into uniform
    areas by incorporating elevation and soil hydraulic parameter attributes. The
    inclusion of elevation information is vital for ensuring effective irrigation
    management, as elevation significantly governs water movement within agricultural
    fields. Similarly, soil hydraulic parameters play a crucial role in irrigation
    scheduling, influencing soil moisture dynamics and water availability to crops.
    Elevation information can be readily obtained at the field scale through methods
    such as surveying or utilizing digital elevation models. Nevertheless, accurate
    determination of soil hydraulic parameters at the field scale poses challenges.
    To overcome this, this study employs a computationally efficient offline estimation
    technique, as previously proposed in Agyeman, Orouskhani, and Liu (2022) and Orouskhani,
    Agyeman, and Liu (2022), for acquiring soil hydraulic parameters in this stage.
    In this offline estimation step, soil moisture and hydraulic parameters are simultaneously
    estimated by assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture observations into the
    Richards equation using the extended Kalman filtering technique. For further details
    on the estimation approach in this stage of the delineation process, interested
    readers may refer to Agyeman et al. (2022) and Orouskhani et al. (2022). The specific
    hydraulic parameters used in this stage include saturated hydraulic conductivity
    ( ), saturated moisture content ( ), residual moisture content ( ), and curve
    fitting parameters ( , ). After obtaining the elevation information and soil hydraulic
    parameters attributes, they are combined to form the primary dataset for management
    zone delineation. Due to differences in magnitudes between elevation values and
    the soil hydraulic parameter estimates, the primary dataset exhibits features
    with considerable variations in magnitude. Consequently, the dataset undergoes
    normalization to standardize all features to a consistent magnitude level. To
    identify the optimal number of clusters or management zones, the elbow method
    is employed. Once identified, clustering is conducted on the normalized data using
    the k-means method to obtain the distinct management zones. The choice of the
    k-means clustering method is justified by its efficiency in handling large datasets
    and its simplicity in implementation. A summary of the key steps involved in this
    stage of the delineation process can be found in Fig. 1. 3. Stage 3: mapping homogeneous
    areas to irrigation equipment resolution. Subsequent to the clustering in the
    second stage, the resultant management zones often display irregular shapes, presenting
    challenges in the efficient application of water using the field’s irrigation
    equipment. To overcome this, the management zones are refined by subdividing them
    into smaller, more uniform sub-zones. This adjustment aligns the zones with the
    resolution of the field’s irrigation equipment, enhancing precision and efficiency
    in irrigation application. Remark 1 While the k-means approach is chosen for its
    simplicity, computational efficiency and extensive use in management zone delineation,
    it is important to acknowledge that it does not guarantee the discovery of the
    optimal number of clusters (or management zones). This limitation arises from
    its tendency to converge to local optima solutions, a consequence of the iterative
    nature of the algorithm starting from random initial centroids. On the other hand,
    alternative clustering approaches, such as the Global Optimal Search (GOS) (Tan,
    Broach, & Floudas, 2007), offer the potential to overcome this limitation. GOS
    is more likely to converge to a global optimum, especially when a reliable initial
    guess for the clustering data is available. In situations where achieving a globally
    optimal solution is key, approaches like GOS becomes more suitable. The GOS method
    can replace the k-means approach in the proposed management zone delineation process
    in a straightforward manner. Download : Download high-res image (230KB) Download

    The second pivotal phase in designing a model-based closed-loop irrigation scheduler
    involves creating agro-hydrological models that are both computationally efficient
    and accurate in describing soil moisture dynamics within each irrigation management
    zone obtained in Section 2.1. This section introduces an approach for identifying
    concise data-driven agro-hydrological models using LSTM networks. LSTM networks
    are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture long
    term dependencies. This special type of RNN is selected for its effectiveness
    in representing complex causal systems, such as an agro-hydrological system. It
    is noteworthy that leveraging long-term, in situ soil water measurements and weather
    data from agricultural fields is one of the most effective approaches for accurately
    identifying data-driven agro-hydrological models. However, in situations where
    long-term data is not readily available, utilizing open-loop simulated data from
    properly calibrated mechanistic models serves as a valuable alternative for developing
    accurate data-driven models. In this study, the latter approach, depicted in Fig.
    2, is employed to identify data-driven agro-hydrological models for the delineated
    management zones. The management zone delineation approach presented in Section
    2.1 relies on soil hydraulic parameters estimated from real-time soil moisture
    measurements obtained from the field under study. Consequently, the soil hydraulic
    parameters corresponding to the centroid of each management zone (or cluster)
    are expected to offer a reliable representation of the soil properties within
    each respective zone. By calibrating a mechanistic agro-hydrological model with
    these centroidal soil hydraulic parameters, the mechanistic model is anticipated
    to accurately describe the soil moisture dynamics in each management zone. Subsequently,
    open-loop simulated data from this calibrated model can be utilized to develop
    an accurate data-driven agro-hydrological model for the respective management
    zone. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. LSTM network development. This section begins with a description
    of the mechanistic agro-hydrological model, specifically the Richards equation,
    that is employed in this study. It concludes with a discussion on how LSTM networks
    can be leveraged to identify a compact data-driven agro-hydrological model capable
    of predicting root zone soil moisture content in each management zone while accounting
    for the time-varying nature of crop rooting depth, using open-loop simulated data
    from the calibrated Richards equation. 2.2.1. Richards equation The Richards equation
    is a mechanistic agro-hydrological model that can be used to model the transport
    of water in soil. In this study, the 1D version (in the axial direction) of the
    Richards equation, calibrated with the centroidal soil hydraulic parameters in
    each management zone, is employed to accurately describe the water transport within
    each zone. This choice is justified by considering that elevation information
    was factored into the management zone delineation process, and as a result, the
    elevation profile within a specific management zone is expected to remain relatively
    uniform. The 1D version of the Richards equation is expressed as: (1) In Eq. (1),
    is the capillary pressure head, which describes the status of water in soil, represents
    time, is the spatial coordinate, is the unsaturated hydraulic water conductivity,
    is the capillary capacity. Note that and are parameterized functions that are
    relevant for solving Eq. (1). is a dimensionless stress water factor, is the root
    water uptake model which is a function of the crop coefficient , the reference
    evapotranspiration , and the rooting depth . In order to solve the 1D Richards
    equation numerically, the following boundary conditions are typically imposed:
    (2) (3) where , , and in Eqs. (2), (3) represent the depth of the soil column,
    the irrigation rate and the evaporation rate, respectively. The method of lines
    numerical approach proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023) is employed to solve
    Eq. (1). Additionally, the precise mathematical expressions for , and can be found
    in Agyeman et al. (2021). Interested readers may refer to the aforementioned references
    for a detailed explanation of the numerical approach. Furthermore, once a numerical
    value of the capillary pressure head is obtained, the volumetric soil moisture
    content can be obtained as follows: (4) where the parameters in Eq. (4) are as
    defined in Section 2.1. In the calibration process of the 1D Richards equations,
    the centroidal hydraulic parameters are utilized to parameterize functions , ,
    and . The calibrated 1D Richards equation, after applying the method of lines
    approach, can be written in state–space form as: (5) (6) where represents the
    state vector containing capillary pressure head values for the spatial nodes in
    the soil column. represents the input vector containing the irrigation amount,
    precipitation, daily reference evapotranspiration, the crop coefficient, and the
    rooting depth. is the model disturbance, and represents the 5 centroidal hydraulic
    parameters. The volumetric water content is chosen as the output . Eq. (6) is
    thus a general representation of Eq. (4) and represents the output vector containing
    volumetric soil moisture content values for the corresponding spatial nodes in
    the soil column. 2.2.2. Training data generation The training dataset is generated
    by solving Eqs. (5), (6) for randomly generated inputs and initial states , with
    some level of noise included in the simulations to account for model uncertainty
    and to enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the LSTM network.
    Model uncertainty is treated as additive in nature. During open-loop simulations
    of the Richards equation, this uncertainty is modeled through realizations drawn
    from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The variance of this distribution
    is determined based on simulation experiments, ensuring a realistic representation
    of uncertainty. The use of randomly generated inputs and initial states is suggested
    to ensure that the dataset encompasses the dynamics of soil moisture under various
    conditions. For irrigation scheduling purposes, it is important to focus on the
    soil moisture dynamics in the entire root zone of a particular management zone.
    Thus, once the open-loop simulations are completed, the computation of root zone
    soil water content at each time step in the dataset becomes necessary. In this
    study, this is achieved by utilizing the volumetric soil moisture content vector
    obtained at each time step in the dataset. To determine the root zone soil moisture
    content, a weighted sum is applied to the elements in the volumetric soil moisture
    content vector. The weights are assigned as follows: 40% to the average volumetric
    moisture content value in the upper quarter of the rooting depth , 30% to the
    average value in the second quarter, 20% to the average value in the third quarter,
    and 10% to the average value in the last quarter. This weighting effectively captures
    the relative importance of moisture at different depths within the crop rooting
    depth, ensuring an effective representation of root zone soil moisture dynamics
    for irrigation scheduling purposes. 2.2.3. Model design The LSTM network is trained
    to make daily predictions of the root zone volumetric moisture content. Its primary
    objective is to forecast the root zone volumetric water content one day ahead
    ( ), denoted as . To achieve this, the network utilizes both current ( ) and past
    inputs ( , , …, ), where represents the time lag (in days) or sequence length
    used for model development. The specific inputs to the network include the root
    zone volumetric water content , precipitation (i.e. the sum of rain and irrigation
    rate) , crop coefficient , reference evapotranspiration , and the rooting depth
    . The incorporation of rooting depth as an input into the model is crucial because
    it enables the network to account for the time-varying nature of the rooting depth.
    Mathematically, the identified LSTM model can be expressed as: (7) where ≔ and
    . In Eq. (7), is a compact representation of the weights and biases of the LSTM
    network . 2.2.4. Model evaluation A comparative study is conducted to assess the
    predictive performance of the trained LSTM networks. In this comparative study,
    a specific initial state is chosen, and predetermined trajectories are defined
    for the precipitation, crop coefficient, and reference evapotranspiration inputs
    over a specified period. Subsequently, both the identified LSTM network and its
    corresponding calibrated 1D Richards equation are simulated using the selected
    initial state and predefined input trajectories. The predictions generated by
    the data-driven model are then compared against the computed root zone soil moisture
    content obtained from the calibrated Richards equation. The assessment of prediction
    accuracy utilizes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as expressed by Eq. (B.1)
    in Appendix B.3. 2.3. Mixed-integer MPC with zone control for irrigation scheduling
    The irrigation scheduling problem, originally proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al.
    (2023), is modeled as a variant of the warehouse location problem, where the irrigation
    implementing equipment plays the role of a warehouse, and the decision to operate
    the equipment is treated as the decision to operate a warehouse. In this context,
    the fixed cost of operating the equipment is analogously considered as the fixed
    cost of opening a warehouse, while the variable cost of supplying water to the
    agricultural field is equated to the variable cost of operating a warehouse. The
    objective function is to minimize the total cost (fixed and variable) of operating
    the irrigation equipment over a planning horizon, subject to constraints that
    ensure that the demand for water in each management zone is met, and that the
    total supply of water does not exceed the capacity of the irrigation equipment.
    To modify the formulation to maintain the root zone soil moisture within a target
    zone, a penalty for violating the target zone is added to the objective function,
    and the constraints are updated to ensure that the root zone soil moisture is
    maintained within the target zone. Furthermore, the dynamics of root zone soil
    moisture must be considered during the planning horizon, as the root zone soil
    moisture level changes over the planning horizon. This modified formulation results
    in a mixed-integer MPC problem with zone objectives (zone control), where the
    identified data-driven agro-hydrological model for each management zone is employed
    as the dynamic model in the formulation. Additionally, a soft constraint approach
    is employed to realize the objective of maintaining the root zone soil moisture
    in the target zone where slack variables are introduced in the formulation to
    relax the bounds of the target zone. By solving the mixed-integer MPC with zone
    objectives problem, the optimal schedules (daily irrigation decision and daily
    irrigation rate) for operating the irrigation equipment can be determined that
    minimize the total cost of operation while maintaining the root zone soil moisture
    within the target zone throughout the planning horizon. To facilitate a better
    understanding of the proposed scheduler formulation for fields comprising multiple
    management zones, the formulation is initially applied to a field with a single
    management zone. For day within a planning horizon of days, the scheduler is formulated
    for a single management zone as follows: (8a) (8b) (8c) (8d) (8e) (8f) (8g) where
    , ≔ , ≔ , ≔ , ≔ , and ≔ where . and ((8a), (8g)) are nonnegative slack variables
    that are introduced to relax the bounds of the target zone in (8d). In this work,
    and (also known as the threshold volumetric moisture content ) are calculated
    as follows: (9) (10) where is the volumetric moisture content at field capacity,
    represents the volumetric water content at the wilting point, and MAD refers to
    the management allowable depletion, which indicates the fraction of the total
    available water that is permitted to be depleted. The per-unit costs associated
    with the violation of the lower and upper bounds of the target zone are represented
    with and , respectively. and represent the per-unit cost of the applied irrigation
    amount and the fixed cost associated with operating the irrigation implementing
    equipment, respectively. The binary decision variable encodes the daily irrigation
    decision. The cost function (8a) incorporates the objectives of maintaining the
    root zone volumetric moisture content in a target zone in order to ensure optimal
    water uptake in crops by minimizing the violation of the target zone , minimizing
    the irrigation cost , and minimizing the irrigation amount . Constraint (8b) corresponds
    to the LSTM model of the root zone volumetric moisture content, and in this constraint
    represents the weights and bias terms associated with the identified LSTM model.
    In this work, the initial state is represented with Constraint (8c). Its value
    is assumed to be known during the evaluation of the scheduler. In particular,
    it is chosen to be the estimated state obtained after the state and parameter
    estimation step outlined in Section 2.1 has converged. Constraint (8e) refers
    to the maximum amount of water that can be supplied during an irrigation event
    on day . When the irrigation decision on day is “a no decision” ( ), Constraint
    (8e) requires that the irrigation rate must be set to 0. Conversely, when the
    irrigation decision on a particular day is “a yes decision” ( ), Constraint (8e)
    specifies that the prescribed irrigation rate must not exceed its upper bound
    ( ) and must be at least as large as its lower bound ( ). After providing a detailed
    description of the scheduler design for a single management zone, the daily scheduler
    for a field with management zones is formulated as follows: (11a) (11b) (11c)
    (11d) (11e) (11f) (11g) where , , ≔ , ≔ , and ≔ . is a closed set that contains
    the positional indices of the management zones. Essentially, the formulation aims
    to duplicate the formulation for each of the management zones present in the field.
    Furthermore, it is apparent that in all management zones, the binary values over
    the planning horizon remain the same in . 2.4. Enhancing the computational efficiency
    of : Decentralized hybrid actor-critic agents and limiting management zone While
    numerical optimization methods, such as the branch and bound technique, can be
    used to solve , they may encounter computational challenges, especially when dealing
    with agricultural fields comprising a large number of irrigation management zones.
    To overcome these computational issues, this study proposes an alternative approach
    employing decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting
    irrigation management zone to enhance the computational efficiency of . This section
    begins with a detailed description of how the hybrid actor–critic agent is employed
    to train an agent for a specific management zone of the field. It concludes with
    a discussion of how the decentralized agents and the concept of a limiting management
    zone are combined to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler. 2.4.1.
    Agent design and training This study proposes the training of a RL agent for each
    of the management zones present in the agricultural field. Each agent is trained
    to determine the daily irrigation decision (discrete action) and the daily irrigation
    rate (continuous action) that optimize root water uptake while minimizing irrigation
    costs and total water consumption in a management zone. The hybrid actor–critic
    approach, as originally introduced in Fan et al. (2019), is adopted for the training
    of each agent due to its demonstrated effectiveness in handling both discrete
    and continuous action spaces. This hybrid actor–critic architecture comprises
    two parallel actor networks, where one actor learns the discrete action (daily
    irrigation decision in this work) and the other learns the continuous action (daily
    irrigation rate in this work). The parallel actors share a single critic network,
    which serves as an estimate of the state-value function. The RL framework of the
    agent is modeled as a fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP), comprising
    several elements such as observations, actions, rewards, and transition/dynamics
    functions. This section begins with a detailed description of the environment
    with which the hybrid actor–critic agent interacts during its training stage.
    Additionally, the design of the observations which serve as inputs to the agent’s
    policy is outlined. Subsequently, the reward design employed in agent training
    is discussed, followed by a discussion of the agent’s training. Environment design.
    In the training process of a hybrid actor–critic agent, the environmental dynamics
    are represented by a 1D Richards equation calibrated with the centroidal hydraulic
    parameters of the relevant management zone. The delineation of management zones
    is based on soil hydraulic parameters estimated from real-time observations in
    the agricultural field. Utilizing a 1D Richards equation calibrated with the centroidal
    hydraulic parameters of each management zone ensures an accurate description of
    the soil moisture dynamics within the considered management zone. The transition
    dynamics for this calibrated 1D Richards equation are detailed in Eqs. (5), (6).
    Observation design. The policy of the hybrid actor–critic agent receives as input
    the output vector , denoting the volumetric moisture contents obtained from Eq.
    (6), alongside the reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, and rooting
    depth on day . These inputs, collectively represented as , provide essential information
    to the agent’s policy, aiding in the accurate determination of daily irrigation
    schedules. The output vector, constituting the first element of the observation
    vector, is considered a reliable representation of the volumetric soil distribution
    in the management zone under consideration. This reliability arises from its initialization
    with converged volumetric moisture content estimates obtained from the offline
    simultaneous state and parameter estimation in Stage 2 of the management zone
    delineation process. Additionally, reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient
    can be readily obtained from weather predictions and empirical relations, respectively.
    The rooting depth can also be determined based on the crop’s growth stage. Thus,
    it is reasonable to assume that the observation provided to the policy of the
    proposed agent is known, justifying the adoption of the fully observable MDP framework
    during the training of the agents. Reward design. The reward function employed
    during the training of the agents is expressed as: (12) (13) In Eqs. (12), (13),
    , , , , , and have the same definitions as in the scheduler formulation of . represents
    the root zone soil moisture on day , which is calculated using the weighted average
    approach outlined in Section 2.2.2. The agent incurs a penalty of when its actions
    result in the root zone soil moisture content falling below the lower threshold
    . Similarly, the agent is penalized with if its actions cause the root zone soil
    moisture content to exceed the upper threshold . When the agent successfully maintains
    the root zone soil moisture within the desired range, it receives a reward of
    0. A penalty of is incurred when the agent decides to perform irrigation (indicated
    by a “yes” decision) and a penalty of is incurred for a non-zero irrigation rate.
    Agent training. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schulman, Wolski,
    Dhariwal, Radford, & Klimov, 2017) is applied for policy optimization in the parallel
    actors. During the training stage of the agent, to generate a stochastic policy
    for the irrigation decision, the discrete actor network of the hybrid PPO outputs
    two values for the 2 discrete actions (0,1). Additionally, the discrete action
    is sampled from the softmax distribution. The continuous actor network of the
    hybrid PPO generates the stochastic policy for the daily irrigation rate by outputting
    the mean and variance for the daily irrigation rate action. For a more detailed
    understanding of the PPO algorithm and the hybrid PPO approach, interested readers
    may refer to Fan et al. (2019) and Schulman et al. (2017), respectively. Fig.

    Hybrid actor–critic architecture, and agent–environment interaction. 2.4.2. A
    multi-agent MPC paradigm: Limiting management zone and evaluation of After training
    the hybrid PPO agents, each agent is utilized to determine the irrigation decisions
    and rates for its corresponding management zone. As these agents are intended
    to contribute to the solution of formulation , each agent undergoes evaluation
    across the planning horizon used in . The evaluation of each agent over the horizon
    involves providing the necessary inputs, such as the initial volumetric moisture
    content for a specific day and predicted/forecasted uncontrolled inputs (reference
    evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, and rooting depths) over the prediction
    horizon, to the policy of the trained agent. In response, the trained agent yields
    optimal or near-optimal irrigation decisions and rates for the planning horizon
    by interacting with the calibrated 1D Richards equation of the relevant management
    zone. The interaction between a hybrid agent and its environment is illustrated
    in Fig. 4. In this figure, the predicted uncontrolled inputs over are represented
    as , with the initial volumetric moisture content denoted as . Furthermore, and
    in Fig. 4 correspond to the daily irrigation decision and daily irrigation depth
    prescribed by the agent. This evaluation yields an irrigation decision sequence
    and an irrigation depth sequence, designated as and , respectively. The evaluation
    process is repeated for all agents to generate irrigation decision sequences and
    irrigation depth sequences. The decentralized approach employed during the training
    of the hybrid agents results in a situation where the irrigation decision sequences
    obtained for all the management zones are nonuniform. However, this nonuniformity
    in irrigation decision sequences is inconsistent with the requirements of formulation
    , which demands a uniform irrigation decision sequence across the management zones.
    The concept of a limiting management zone is employed to address the nonuniformity
    arising from the decentralized nature of agent training. The limiting irrigation
    management zone is defined as the th management zone that exhibits the earliest
    non-zero irrigation decision within the planning horizon. The irrigation decision
    sequence of the limiting management zone is chosen as a binding irrigation decision
    sequence for all the management zones. By adopting the irrigation decision sequence
    from the limiting management zone as the binding sequence, the scheduler can ensure
    timely irrigation across all management zones. An illustrative example can help
    clarify the concepts of the limiting irrigation management zone and binding irrigation
    sequence. Consider a field divided into three management zones: , , and . Each
    zone has its own hybrid PPO agent with a designated policy: , , and . On a given
    day, denoted as , the observations within each management zone are represented
    as , , and . It is assumed that the agents are evaluated for a planning horizon
    of seven days. After evaluating the agents, the following irrigation sequences
    ( ) were obtained: , , and . Based on the irrigation sequences obtained, it is
    evident that exhibits the earliest non-zero irrigation decision among all the
    management zones. Consequently, is identified as the limiting irrigation management
    zone. By designating as the limiting management zone, it is established that the
    irrigation decisions made within serve as the reference for irrigation scheduling
    in the other zones. The binding sequence of , , is enforced in and . Once the
    binding irrigation decision sequence is determined, it is enforced in . Given
    that the binary variables over the planning horizon (binding irrigation decision
    sequence) in have already been calculated, the nonlinear programming version of
    can be solved to determine the irrigation rates over the planning horizon in the
    management zones. This approach transforms from a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program
    (MINLP) to a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem, significantly enhancing the
    computational efficiency of . The solution of the NLP version of can be avoided
    altogether. Instead, copies of the NLP version of corresponding to the management
    zones can be solved in parallel, after the binding irrigation decision sequence
    has been enforced in each formulation. It is evident from that the irrigation
    decision sequence is responsible for the coupling among the management zones in
    . Additionally, formulation merely replicates formulation in the management zones.
    Thus, after the irrigation decision sequence in has been determined using the
    binding irrigation decision sequence approach, the NLP version of can be solved
    in each of the management zones in parallel. This parallel execution can take
    advantage of the multicore architecture of modern CPUs, leading to substantial
    reductions in computation time and significantly improving the overall computational
    efficiency of the scheduler. Fig. 5 illustrates the comprehensive approach incorporating
    hybrid PPO agents, the limiting management zone, and the copies of . The irrigation
    rates determined by the hybrid PPO agent in the limiting management zone can be
    directly implemented as they align with the binding irrigation decision sequence
    across the planning horizon. However, for the remaining management zones, the
    irrigation rates obtained from the hybrid PPO agents can only serve as a reliable
    initial guess, as they do not precisely match the binding sequence. In these management
    zones, the NLP versions of must necessarily be solved to obtain the optimal irrigation
    rates. Notably, an irrigation rate sequence is considered to align with an irrigation
    decision sequence when a non-zero irrigation rate in the sequence corresponds
    to a decision of an irrigation decision of 1, and a zero irrigation rate in the
    sequence corresponds to an irrigation decision of 0. This consistency must be
    maintained for all days within the planning horizon. Remark 2 The integration
    of decisions from hybrid actor–critic agents into the MPC layer demonstrates a
    cooperation between multi-agent systems and MPC, leading to what can be referred
    to as a multi-agent MPC paradigm. This approach shares some similarities with
    distributed MPC and coalitional MPC methods, where decisions are made locally
    by individual agents/control units based on localized information to achieve a
    global objective. However, there are notable differences between the proposed
    approach and these control methods. Hybrid actor–critic agents, which eventually
    aid in determining irrigation decisions, are trained in a fully decentralized
    manner, without inter-agent communication during their training phase. This training
    also ignores the coupling constraint of the irrigation scheduling problem that
    necessitates uniform daily irrigation decisions across all management zones/agents.
    To manage this constraint, the proposed approach adopts a heuristic method based
    on a limiting management zone to reconcile the daily irrigation decisions when
    the agents are executed. This decentralized training contrasts with distributed
    or coalitional methods that generally involve agent communication to enhance performance.
    Moreover, the heuristic method for addressing coupling constraints deviates from
    consensus algorithms and coordination schemes typically used in distributed training
    techniques to handle coupling constraints. Furthermore, the proposed approach
    relies on the reconciled irrigation decisions to solve multiple MPCs in parallel
    so as to determine the optimal irrigation rates for each management zone. This
    process is characterized as fully decentralized MPC since it does not involve
    communication between the local MPCs of different management zones, differing
    from distributed or coalitional MPC approaches that would involve inter-local
    MPC communication. Importantly, the adoption of a fully decentralized MPC approach
    in determining the irrigation rates for different management zones assumes a weak
    coupling between these zones. While this approach is suitable for large-scale
    fields, such as the field considered in the work, it is inappropriate for smaller,
    spatially variable fields where a stronger coupling exists between management
    zones. In such scenarios, a distributed MPC approach, which involves communication
    between local MPCs to ensure the system’s closed-loop stability, would be more
    suitable. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the formulation , determining the irrigation depths for the management zones.
    2.5. Comparative evaluation of proposed and triggered irrigation scheduling methods
    Evaluating the benefits of the proposed irrigation scheduling approach over the
    entire crop growing season is essential for understanding its effectiveness. To
    achieve this, the study employs the widely employed triggered irrigation scheduling
    approach as a benchmark. A comparison is made between the proposed scheduler and
    the triggered approach in terms of Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE), also
    known as water productivity and total irrigation prescribed. Despite the fundamental
    differences, comparing the two approaches in terms of IWUE and total prescribed
    irrigation is considered essential for several reasons. Firstly, the triggered
    approach serves as a widely adopted and practical benchmark, allowing for the
    evaluation of potential improvements offered by the more advanced MPC-based scheduling.
    Furthermore, the comparison offers insights into the water conservation capabilities
    of each approach, providing valuable considerations for the adoption of sustainable
    agriculture practices in response to the challenges of global water scarcity.
    This section first provides a description of the triggered irrigation scheduling
    approach. It then proceeds to explain the calculation of the irrigation water
    use efficiency. 2.5.1. Triggered irrigation scheduling This scheduling approach
    aims to maintain the root zone soil moisture within the lower and upper bounds
    of a target zone. In this approach, an irrigation event is triggered on a specific
    day, denoted as , when the daily root zone moisture content, represented by ,
    falls below the lower bound of the target zone, denoted as . When such a situation
    occurs, the irrigation rate for that day, denoted as , is calculated using the
    following formula (Gu et al., 2021): (14) In Eq. (14), represents the rooting
    depth, while corresponds to the upper bound of the target zone. indicates the
    cumulative precipitation that occurs from day to . The interested reader may refer
    to Gu et al. (2020) and the references therein for a thorough discussion of this
    scheduling approach. 2.5.2. Irrigation water use efficiency In this work, the
    Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE) in kg/m is calculated as follows (15) where
    is the predicted yield in (kg/m2) and IRR is the total prescribed irrigation depth
    applied in meters ( ). The detailed calculation of can be found in Appendix A.
    2.6. Study area A large-scale agricultural field is employed to assess the benefits
    of the proposed scheduling approach. The field in question is a Research Farm
    operated by Lethbridge College and it spans an area of 26.4 hectares. The field
    is located in Lethbridge, southern Alberta, with geographic coordinates approximately
    at latitude 49.72°N and longitude 112.80°W. A layout of the investigated field
    is shown in Fig. 6(a). The average elevation of the area is 888 m. Regarding the
    soil composition, the predominant texture in the field is clayey loam, with occasional
    presence of sand lenses. To facilitate effective irrigation management, a five-span
    center pivot system has been installed in the field. This mechanized irrigation
    system follows a circular pattern around a central pivot and the pivot has a total
    length of 294 m. Furthermore, the center pivot system incorporates a commercial
    variable rate irrigation system, enabling variable irrigation application rates.
    To monitor soil moisture levels of the field during the rotation cycle of the
    pivot, microwave remote sensors have been installed on the five spans of the pivot.
    The field exhibits varying elevations, ranging from 886 m at the lowest point
    to 890 m at the highest point. An interpolated field elevation map, depicted in
    Fig. 6(b), visually represents this elevation distribution. To prepare for the
    implementation of the proposed management zone delineation approach and the evaluation
    of proposed irrigation scheduler, soil moisture observations were collected using
    microwave remote sensors installed on the center pivot of the field. These observations
    were utilized to estimate both the soil water content and soil hydraulic parameters
    across the entire field. The estimation process covered the period from May 16,
    2022, to August 31, 2022. In this section, two of the estimated parameters are
    presented: the saturated hydraulic conductivity ( ) and the curve fitting parameter
    ( ), to provide a brief overview of the estimation results. The spatial maps of
    these two estimated hydraulic parameters are depicted in Fig. 7. Download : Download

    Management zone delineation of the study area In this section, the proposed three-stage
    management zone delineation process is applied to the study area, and the results
    of the delineation are presented in Fig. 8. During the first stage of delineation,
    the field under study was divided into 4 management zones, labeled as Quadrants
    1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 8. This initial division is based on the fact that 4 different
    crop types are commonly planted in the respective quadrants of the study area.
    Consequently, the initial delineation of the field according to crop types results
    in these 4 management zones. After the initial delineation, the second stage of
    the process involved refining the management zones using the elevation and the
    estimated soil hydraulic parameters attributes within Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    As shown in Fig. 8, this resulted in 5 irregularly shaped management zones in
    Quadrant 1, 4 irregularly shaped management zones in Quadrant 2, and 3 irregularly
    shaped management zones in Quadrants 3 and 4. Finally, in the third stage of the
    delineation process, the irregularly shaped management zones obtained in the second
    stage were mapped to the resolution of the field’s center pivot. Specifically,
    the field’s center pivot has a resolution of 12 zones and 45 zones in the radial
    and azimuthal directions, respectively. For simplicity and comprehensive analysis,
    the results for the third quadrant of the field are isolated and discussed in
    detail. Fig. 9(a) depicts the management zone map obtained after the second stage
    of the management zone delineation process. It is evident that the clustering
    approach resulted in three distinct, irregularly shaped management zones. Fig.
    9(b) displays the spatial distribution of the three irrigation management zones,
    which were mapped to align with the resolution of the field’s center pivot. Based
    on the centroidal hydraulic parameters and the centroidal elevation, Management
    Zone 1 (MZ ) was found to have an average soil hydraulic parameter set corresponding
    to loamy soil, with an associated elevation of 889 m. Similarly, Management Zone
    2 (MZ ) exhibited an average soil hydraulic parameter set of loamy soil, but with
    an average elevation of 888 m. In Management Zone 3 (MZ ), the average soil type
    was identified as sandy clay loam, and the average elevation measured 888.5 m.

    Subsequently, the remaining steps of the proposed scheduling approach are specifically
    implemented in Quadrant 3 of the study area, for the sake of simplicity. This
    adopted approach also allows for a thorough examination of the outcomes obtained
    through the proposed scheduling approach. It should be noted that applying the
    same steps to the remaining quadrants can be done straightforwardly, without any
    loss of generality. 2.7. Simulation settings In this section, specific details
    regarding the simulation settings and parameters used during the application of
    the remaining steps of the scheduling approach to Quadrant 3 of the study area
    are provided. The section begins by presenting the settings and parameters employed
    during the development of the 3 LSTM networks for soil moisture content modeling
    in the 3 management zones of Quadrant 3. It then proceeds to describe the settings
    and parameters used during the training of distinct hybrid PPO agents for the
    3 management zones of Quadrant 3. Finally, the settings, parameters, and weather
    data employed during the evaluation of the proposed scheduler on a large-scale
    agricultural field are presented. It is noteworthy that the performance of the
    scheduler is assessed over two growing seasons. Additionally, for each growing
    season, evaluations are conducted for two different Mean Absolute Difference (MAD)
    values: specifically, 40% and 65%. 2.7.1. LSTM network training Prior to generating
    the open-loop data for LSTM network development, the dynamics of soil moisture
    in each of the 3 management zones of Quadrant 3 was modeled using the 1D Richards
    equation. These Richards equations were calibrated with the centroidal hydraulic
    parameters specific to each irrigation management zone. Subsequently, extensive
    open-loop simulations of these calibrated Richards equations were conducted, incorporating
    randomly generated inputs (i.e. reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient,
    and irrigation rate inputs) and initial states (capillary pressure head and volumetric
    soil moisture content). The simulation settings used during these open-loop simulations
    of the Richards equation are detailed in Table B.6 of Appendix B.1. To ensure
    accurate irrigation scheduling for the crop type present in Quadrant 3, which
    in this case was spring soft wheat, the LSTM training stage incorporated two different
    rooting depths: 0.5 m and 1.00 m. The reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient
    were randomly generated within the ranges of 0.1 mm/day to 8.99 mm/day and 0.4
    to 1.02, respectively, for all three management zones. The irrigation rate was
    randomly generated between 4.0 mm/day and 52.0 mm/day for MZ , 4.3 mm/day and
    59.6 mm/day for MZ , and 5.0 mm/day and 62.3 mm/day for MZ . It is important to
    note that the selection of input ranges for the open-loop simulations of the calibrated
    1D Richards equation was informed by historical weather data and local irrigation
    management practices. After computing the root zone soil moisture content at each
    time step using the methodology outlined in Section 2.2.2, the LSTM models were
    trained using the Keras Library in Python. The model architecture and hyperparameters
    employed during the training process are provided in Table B.7 of Appendix B.2,
    and it is worth mentioning that these values were determined through experimentation.
    Consequently, it is plausible that more optimal results could be achieved through
    a systematic tuning of the hyperparameter values. 2.7.2. Hybrid PPO agent training
    A summary of the final parameter values for the formulations and used in training
    3 distinct hybrid PPO agents for the three management zones in Quadrant 3 is provided
    in Table D.9 of Appendix D. It is important to note that the per unit costs in
    these formulations were considered as tuning parameters in this study. Tuning
    these costs involved exploring multiple scenarios by adjusting the per unit costs
    in and . Through an iterative process, the performance of the agents was evaluated
    under different cost configurations, leading to the determination of the most
    suitable values for achieving the desired irrigation management objectives. The
    values of the volumetric moisture content at field capacity and wilting point
    for the various soil types present in the 3 management zones in Quadrant 3 were
    obtained from Ref. Huffman, Fangmeier, Elliot, and Workman (2012). To represent
    the policies of the actor networks for the discrete (daily irrigation decision)
    and continuous (daily irrigation rate) actions in each hybrid PPO agent, a fully
    connected multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers and a hyperbolic tangent
    (tanh) activation function was employed. The hyperparameters utilized during the
    training of the agents, as well as other settings specific to the PPO algorithm,
    are summarized in Table C.8 of Appendix C. Additionally since the evaluation of
    the scheduler under a particular growing season is done for MAD values of 40%
    and 65%, 3 distinct hybrid PPO agents are trained for an MAD of 40%, and another
    set of 3 hybrid PPO agents are trained for an MAD of 65%. The training of the
    hybrid PPO agents was conducted using the Tensorforce library (Schaarschmidt et
    al., 2018) in Python. 2.7.3. Evaluation setup and parameters for proposed scheduler
    As has already been mentioned, the proposed scheduler is evaluated over two growing
    seasons: the 2015 and 2022 seasons, for MAD values of 40% and 65%. Fig. E.16 of
    Appendix E.1 presents the relevant weather data utilized in this study, specifically
    from the selected growing seasons. It is important to note that a MAD value of
    40% is commonly used for irrigation management on the Research farm, and in irrigation
    management, this value can be considered to be conservative. Therefore, the scheduler
    was further assessed using a less conservative MAD value of 65% to evaluate its
    ability to ensure optimal plant growth when allowing for more water depletion
    in the root zone. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the 2015 season had
    lower total rainfall of 141.7 mm compared to the 2022 season which recorded a
    total value of 230.9 mm. These seasons were chosen to assess the performance of
    the scheduler in relatively dry and wet conditions. Soft spring wheat was cultivated
    in the investigated quadrant during the 2022 season, and this crop was also considered
    for the 2015 growing season. To determine the initial volumetric moisture content
    (and for that matter the initial capillary pressure head) for each management
    zone, the converged volumetric soil moisture estimates obtained from the estimation
    procedure outlined in Section 2.1 were first mapped to the management zone map
    of Quadrant 3. For each management zone, the volumetric soil moisture estimates
    corresponding to the driest plot were selected as the basis for initializing the
    scheduler. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy of these volumetric
    moisture estimates are expected to decline over time, and soil moisture content
    observations from the management zones in the field under study should be used
    to correct these estimates using various data assimilation techniques. The incorporation
    of data assimilation techniques in model-based irrigation schedulers is outside
    the scope of this work, and the interested reader may explore references such
    as Agyeman et al. (2021) and Bo and Liu (2020) that delve into soil moisture estimation
    in agro-hydrological systems. The scheduler is implemented in a receding horizon
    manner, where the calibrated 1D Richards equations of the three management zones
    serve as the representation of the real field. In the evaluation phase, a prediction
    horizon of 14 days is utilized. It is noteworthy that a control horizon of 14
    days was also employed during the evaluation stage. Simulation experiments revealed
    that a 14-day prediction horizon effectively captures the essential dynamics of
    the agro-hydrological system examined in this study. This period also enables
    the scheduler to utilize the most accurate weather forecasts available. Additionally,
    the selected timeframe was found to be sufficiently long to ensure that the receding
    horizon implementation of the scheduler is stabilizing. Moreover, a 14-day prediction
    horizon was found to ensure computational efficiency of the scheduling process
    by facilitating a timely optimization process. While the true weather information,
    such as rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, and average temperature, is known
    during the simulations, uncertainty is incorporated into the weather forecasts
    used over the prediction horizon. This was done to assess the robustness of the
    scheduler to uncertainties in weather forecasts. The uncertainty in the weather
    forecast is modeled as a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a specified
    standard deviation. As the prediction horizon extends further into the future,
    the standard deviation values are gradually increased to reflect the increasing
    uncertainty associated with longer-term weather predictions. Table D.9 of Appendix
    D provides the relevant parameters of formulation used in evaluating the scheduler.
    The evaluation period for each growing season spanned from 5th May to 4th September,
    encompassing a total of 123 evaluations. In each evaluation, the three hybrid
    PPO agents were initially assessed using relevant observations from all three
    management zones to obtain irrigation decision sequences for the prediction horizon.
    Subsequently, the binding irrigation sequence was determined, and three copies
    of formulation (y) were simultaneously evaluated to optimize the irrigation rates
    for each management zone using the interior point optimization solver (Wächter
    & Biegler, 2006). In accordance with the receding horizon implementation of the
    scheduler, the first element of the optimal irrigation rates for all the three
    management zones were then applied to the calibrated 1D Richards equations. The
    soil water content resulting from the implemented irrigation rate in each management
    zone was then used to initialize the subsequent evaluation of the scheduler. Throughout
    the evaluation process, a rooting depth of 0.5 m was considered from 5th May to
    15th July. From the 16th of July to the end of the growing season, a rooting depth
    of 1.0 m was used to determine the irrigation schedules. It is worth noting that
    this practice is consistent with irrigation management of the soft spring wheat
    crop. Both the triggered approach and the proposed approach were utilized to generate
    irrigation schedules for the selected growing seasons and specific MAD values.
    For the evaluation of the predicted yield under both scheduling schemes, the parameters
    and in Eq. (A.1) were set to 0.88 kg m−2 and 1.15, respectively. These values
    were obtained from Ref. Bennett and Harms (2011) and represent calibrated values
    specific to the study area. 3. Results and discussion In this section, the results
    obtained after the application of the proposed irrigation scheduler to Quadrant
    3 of the field are presented and discussed in detail. This section begins with
    a presentation and discussion of the results obtained from the validation experiment
    conducted on the identified LSTM networks for soil moisture dynamics modeling
    in Quadrant 3. Next, the results of the hybrid PPO agents are presented, after
    which a discussion of these results is presented. Finally, the irrigation schedules,
    and the corresponding root zone soil moisture content obtained under the proposed
    and triggered irrigation scheduling schemes, over the two growing seasons, are
    presented and discussed in detail. 3.1. Validation of the trained LSTM networks
    The results of the validation experiment, which was conducted over a 30 day period,
    is depicted in Fig. 10. From this figure, the soil moisture predictions can be
    deemed accurate, since there is a good agreement between the root zone soil moisture
    predictions and the actual root zone soil moisture content derived from the calibrated
    1D Richards equation. This accuracy is reinforced by the low RMSE values shown
    in Table 1, which serve to support the good predictive capacity of the identified
    LSTM models for root zone soil moisture content across all three management zones
    at depths of 0.50 m and 1.00 m. The results obtained from the validation experiment
    further highlight the accuracy of the identified LSTM networks in performing multi-step-ahead
    predictions. In this experiment, the LSTM models, originally trained to predict
    a single day ahead, were employed in a recursive manner across the 30-day period.
    This recursive strategy involved using the output at a specific time step as an
    input in the subsequent time step. This recursive use of the identified LSTM networks
    holds significance within model predictive control frameworks, such as the mixed-integer
    MPC with zone control formulation that is adopted for irrigation scheduling in
    this work. The obtained results in this section provide evidence that the proposed
    LSTM network root zone soil moisture modeling in the delineated management zones
    is both robust and accurate. These findings align with several other studies that
    have also utilized LSTM models to describe soil moisture dynamics in agro-hydrological
    systems (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023). Furthermore, these
    findings imply that a neural networks’ capacity for universal approximation can
    be harnessed to directly characterize root zone soil moisture content. This approach
    is anticipated to enhance the computational efficiency when employed in schedulers
    that require the solution of a numerical optimization problem. This new approach
    stands in contrast to earlier works (Gu et al., 2021), where distinct neural network
    models were trained to predict the soil moisture content at different depths within
    the soil profile, after which a weighted approach was employed to obtain the root
    zone soil moisture content from the soil moisture predictions. The results of
    the validation experiment further confirms the hypothesis that by including the
    rooting depth as one of the inputs to the LSTM network, the time varying nature
    of the rooting depth and its effect on the root zone soil moisture can be effective
    modeled. Table 1. Predictive performance of the trained LSTM models over a period

    of the hybrid PPO agents To provide a concise summary, the trajectories of the
    rewards obtained during the training stage for the MAD of 40% are presented. Fig.
    11 demonstrates the average episodic rewards obtained after running each agent
    10 times, showing an upward trend that indicates an improvement in agent performance
    over successive training iterations. Additionally, the hybrid PPO agents exhibit
    convergence to stable and optimal policies, as evidenced by the rewards reaching
    a plateau during the training stage. Overall, the trained hybrid PPO agents can
    effectively provide optimal irrigation decisions tailored to their respective
    management zones. This finding aligns with earlier studies (Fan et al., 2019,
    Xu and Lin, 2023) that have demonstrated the ability of the hybrid actor–critic
    approach in achieving stable learning when employed in mixed-integer optimal control
    problems. The proposed hybrid actor–critic paradigm adds to the range of approximation
    methods aimed at simplifying mixed-integer optimal control problems. Notable alternatives
    include the sigmoid approximation (de Oliveira, Da Silva, Pereira, & Carneiro,
    2005) and the time-step grouping (Richards & How, 2005) approach. The proposed
    approach offers advantages over the sigmoid approach used in the mixed-integer
    MPC for irrigation scheduling proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023) and Agyeman,
    Nouri et al. (2023). Specifically, the RL approach, by directly learning an optimal/near-optimal
    policy for the binary variable, eliminates the approximation errors associated
    with the sigmoid function. Additionally, the RL approach addresses interpretability
    issues encountered in the sigmoid approach. Moreover, compared to the complexity
    introduced by time step grouping method, the hybrid actor–critic paradigm, simplifies
    the process by directly learning optimal policies for binary variables at each
    time step, eliminating the need for manual decisions on strategies to group binary
    variables across timesteps. Despite these benefits, it is essential to note that
    the RL training process is time-consuming due to its complexity. Future research
    should explore methods to expedite agent training and determine the optimal number
    of training episodes for efficient agent learning. Download : Download high-res

    and utility of the proposed scheduler Figs. 14 and 15 depict the prescribed schedules
    and the dynamics of the root zone soil moisture during the 2022 growing season
    for MAD values of 40% and 65%, respectively. Similarly, Fig. 12, Fig. 13 show
    the prescribed schedules and the corresponding root zone soil moisture dynamics
    for the 2015 growing season with MAD values of 40% and 65%, respectively. Table
    2, Table 3 present a summary of the total prescribed water and other relevant
    costs computed for the 2022 growing season, considering MAD values of 40% and
    65% respectively. Similarly, Table 4, Table 5 provide the summary for the 2015
    growing season with MAD values of 40% and 65% respectively. As mentioned previously,
    the 2015 growing season experienced lower total rainfall compared to the 2022
    season. Consequently, both scheduling approaches resulted in higher total irrigation
    rates for the 2015 season compared to the 2022 season. Additionally, the results
    demonstrated that for an MAD of 40%, both scheduling approaches exhibited higher
    total irrigation rates compared to a less conservative MAD of 65%. Similarly,
    both approaches made more frequent irrigation decisions for an MAD of 40% compared
    to an MAD of 65%. This observation aligns with the definition of MAD, as a lower
    MAD implies a smaller allowable depletion of root zone soil moisture, necessitating
    more frequent irrigations and higher total irrigation application depths. Across
    all considered scenarios, the proposed approach consistently achieved lower total
    irrigation rates compared to the triggered approach. Specifically, for MAD 40%,
    the proposed approach saved approximately 6% and 7% of irrigation water in the
    2015 and 2022 growing seasons, respectively. Similarly, for MAD 65%, the savings
    were about 14% and 23% for the same seasons. The obtained IWUE values indicated
    higher predicted crop yields under the proposed scheduling, evident from the higher
    IWUE values compared to the triggered approach. For MAD 40%, the proposed approach
    led to a 12% and 10% increase in IWUE in the 2022 and 2015 growing seasons, respectively.
    Likewise, for MAD 65%, there was a 35% and 20% increase in IWUE in the 2022 and
    2015 growing seasons, respectively. The proposed approach exhibited more substantial
    water savings, particularly under the less conservative MAD value of 65%. Similarly,
    the enhancement in IWUE was more evident with the less conservative MAD value
    of 65%. The use of a conservative MAD value of 40% in irrigation scheduling aims
    to enhance the scheduler’s robustness against potential disturbances that could
    lead to crop stress. By setting the threshold further from the wilting point (critical
    point) with such conservative values, the likelihood of reaching critical soil
    moisture levels is reduced in the presence of disturbances. However, the simulation
    results suggest that less conservative MAD values can be employed under the proposed
    scheme, leading to reduced total irrigation rates while minimizing the risk of
    critical soil moisture levels. This indicates that the proposed approach offers
    flexibility in MAD selection, enabling a more efficient use of water resources
    while ensuring optimal crop development. In comparing the computational time between
    the proposed scheduler and the triggered approach, it became evident that the
    design and evaluation of the proposed approach required more time and computational
    effort. The estimation of soil hydraulic parameters for management zone delineation,
    along with the training of the decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and LSTM
    models, constitutes the most computationally intensive and time-consuming aspects
    of the proposed scheduler. Notably, the use of a high-dimensional field model
    in the estimation increases the computational effort needed for Jacobian calculations
    in the EKF step. Additionally, the iterative processes and hyperparameter adjustments
    associated with agent and LSTM model training contribute to extended training
    times. However, it is crucial to clarify that these computationally demanding
    steps are performed offline, thereby reducing the computational load during real-time
    operation. During online execution, involving the evaluation of hybrid agents,
    determining the limiting irrigation sequence, and solving the optimization problem
    for irrigation rates in all management zones of the field, the proposed approach
    demonstrated efficient performance. Parallel computing significantly influenced
    this efficiency during the optimization problem solution. While the current solution
    time is considered adequate for a scheduler sampling time of 1 day, applying the
    proposed approach to shorter sampling times may pose computational challenges,
    especially for fields with numerous management zones. Further studies are necessary
    to improve the computational efficiency of the proposed scheduler to ensure timely
    completion of the optimization problem within the sampling time. Exploring suboptimal
    solutions could be a potential avenue, though this may impact the water-saving
    benefits of the proposed approach. Table 2. Comparison between the triggered and

    hydraulic parameters, derived from the offline estimation in Stage 2 of the management
    zone delineation, as a basis for identifying the LSTM models, plays an important
    role in reducing parametric uncertainty and effectively addressing plant-model
    mismatch within the proposed scheduler. While this offline strategy serves as
    a good starting point for real-time implementation of the scheduler, it has limitations
    in adapting to real-time variations in field parameters. A more attractive approach
    to handle parameter variations involves performing online parameter estimation,
    utilizing real-time field observations for fine-tuning soil hydraulic parameters.
    However, it is essential to note that this online estimation approach may introduce
    additional computational demands to the online implementation of the scheduler.
    A valid alternative worth considering is the adoption of an offset-free MPC approach
    by incorporating a disturbance model. In this approach, managing plant-model mismatch
    is achieved by estimating disturbances through measurements, utilizing an augmented
    system that integrates the nominal model and the disturbance model. In the design
    of an offset-free MPC, the work presented in Cao, Son, Moon, and Kwon (2021) could
    serve as a helpful reference. 4. Conclusion In conclusion, this study successfully
    demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating the three machine learning paradigms
    (unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning) with model predictive control
    and multi-agent principles to design a precise irrigation scheduler for large-scale
    fields. By employing a three-stage process with the k-means clustering approach,
    irrigation management zones were accurately delineated to match the resolution
    of the irrigation equipment. This process included elevation and estimated soil
    hydraulic parameters as attributes, resulting in optimized management zones suitable
    for agro-hydrological modeling. Leveraging the universal approximation capability
    of neural networks, specifically long short-term memory models, this study directly
    modeled the dynamic behavior of root zone soil moisture content in each irrigation
    management zone, while accounting for the time varying nature of the rooting depth.
    Based on the developed data-driven models, a mixed-integer MPC framework with
    zone objectives was designed to determine the daily irrigation decisions and rates,
    aiming to enhance soil water uptake while minimizing overall water consumption
    and associated irrigation costs. Furthermore, a multi-agent MPC paradigm was adopted
    where decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting management
    zone were employed to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler. The
    application of the proposed approach to a large-scale field demonstrated its capability
    to achieve substantial water savings and improved irrigation water use efficiency.
    The proposed approach also allowed for the utilization of less conservative MAD
    values, resulting in improved water savings and optimal crop growth. While the
    proposed approach shows promise, there are several modifications that can be made
    to further enhance its effectiveness. One priority is improving the optimality
    of the binding irrigation decision sequence by employing distributed techniques
    when training the hybrid actor–critic agents. Utilizing a hierarchy of agents
    that communicate with each other can result in an irrigation decision sequence
    that is optimal for all the management zones of the field. Additionally, this
    study acknowledges the potential advantages of integrating advanced time-series
    transformer models, as indicated in recent literature (Sitapure & Kwon, 2023).
    These transformer models are recognized for their proficiency in capturing complex
    contextual relationships, including faults, abnormalities, and parametric dependencies.
    While the current study employs LSTM models, considering the replacement of the
    LSTM approach with advanced time-series transformer models is considered a promising
    avenue for enhancing predictive capabilities in irrigation scheduling. Furthermore,
    to enhance the overall robustness of the scheduler, it is advisable to implement
    it alongside a lower-level controller. This controller’s task would be to track
    the prescriptions made by the proposed scheduler on an hourly basis. By integrating
    these components, the scheduler can adapt and respond in real-time to deviations
    or unforeseen circumstances, ensuring effective irrigation management. Implementing
    these modifications will contribute to the continued improvement and practical
    application of the scheduler, making it more effective and reliable in optimizing
    irrigation decisions while maintaining system robustness. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world. In Europe,
    Italy is the main producer of rice, with almost all production concentrated in
    the northeast of the country. Traditionally, rice is grown in fields that are
    flooded from before planting until just before harvest. This water management
    technique requires a great deal of labour for farmers who have to manually adjust
    the inlet and outlet gates to maintain a constant ponding water level in the fields,
    especially when there is fluctuation of water supply at the farm inlet, for example
    as a result of rainfall. In addition, the practice of flood irrigation is very
    water-intensive. New technologies based on remotely and automatically controlled
    gates are being studied to increase the efficiency of this irrigation method.
    The objective of this work is to explore the potential of a coordinated and intelligent
    system of gates for efficient farm irrigation management and ponding water level
    maintenance. Based on information and measurements from a real case study consisting
    of a 40-hectare paddy rice farm located in northern Italy, where automatic gates
    and water level sensors were placed at strategic points of the farm canals and
    fields, respectively, a proportional-integral (PI) and a non-linear model predictive
    control (NMPC) of water levels were implemented and compared through modelling
    and simulation experiments. The results show that the proportional-integral control
    reproduces the actions that the farmer uses when faced with situations of surplus
    of water in the fields or a shortage of water in the farm canal. In particular,
    the general coordination of the gates is lost, and the individual binomial field-gate
    prevails as an independent system in the farmer's operation. Conversely, non-linear
    predictive control coordinates the gate operation to obtain a uniform ponding
    water level in the fields when there is a shortage of water, or significant water
    conservation when there is an excess of water as a result of rainfall. In conclusion,
    a nonlinear predictive control model seems to be a suitable strategy to advance
    irrigation management in rice farms, allowing rice farmers to continue the tradition
    of flooding while increasing its performance.

    control model 1. Introduction Rice is the third most produced crop in the world
    and a staple food for more than half of the world''s population, mostly living
    in developing countries (Fukagawa and Ziska, 2019). In this context, Italy is
    the leading rice producer in Europe, accounting for more than half of the total
    production of this high-value crop (Facchi et al., 2018). Typically, rice is grown
    in fields that are flooded from planting to pre-harvest, and this traditional
    irrigation technique (i.e., continuous submergence) is considered an important
    sink of water resources. This technique is dominant in most areas and is characterized
    by low irrigation efficiency (Cesari de Maria et al., 2016). In addition, irrigation
    management requires a lot of human labour, as it is still based on maintaining
    a predetermined water level in the paddies by manually regulating the irrigation
    inflow rate (Masseroni et al., 2017). In this context, the application of flexible
    and automatic control devices for irrigation management in paddy rice farms appears
    to be a viable solution that can be exploited to (i) increase the water use efficiency
    of rice cultivation and (ii) reduce the effort dedicated to irrigation flow rate
    regulation at field and farm scale, without changing the traditional irrigation
    flooding practices. More specifically, hydraulic infrastructures based on a system
    of coordinated gates located at strategic points of the farm irrigation network
    can allow to maintain optimal water levels in the farm channels and rice plots,
    providing more consistent and reliable irrigation flows through the farm service
    points. A recent review on the identification of smart automatic irrigation techniques
    for sustainable rice environments shows that there is a great potential for water
    conservation through the use of automatic and coordinated gate systems in permanently-flooded
    rice farms, with benefits in terms of both increasing the quality and quantity
    of crop production (Champness et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the review highlighted
    that these systems applied in paddy rice contexts are still in an embryonic stage
    and their application is limited to individual rice plots (Masseroni et al., 2018).
    Table 1 shows the degree of automation and sensor components developed in the
    main automated gravity surface irrigation system experiments for rice. In general,
    all have successfully developed a desktop-based system for remote control of irrigation,
    but only Masseroni et al. (2018) have developed a system using commercially available
    infrastructure in a commercial-scale. Table 1. Summary of the components and capabilities

    aimed to improve the sustainability of agricultural water use has indirectly stimulated
    irrigation modernisation projects. For example, the Lombardy region (the most
    important region in Italy from an industrial and agricultural point of view, with
    over 7000 km2 of irrigated land) is promoting bottom-up initiatives in the form
    of \"information and pilot project actions\". The main aim of these initiatives
    is to demonstrate the potential of innovative irrigation management systems at
    farm and district level, and to promote a shared understanding of modernisation
    objectives. In this study, we analyse and reflect on the results achieved in one
    of these pilot initiatives. Specifically, the project represents a pioneering
    example of the transition to a flexible and harmonised approach to irrigation
    management in paddy farms. In particular, a new modelling framework adopted for
    a coordinated and centralized flowrate regulation is described. The control algorithm
    implemented to maintain a predetermined ponding water level in the fields according
    to site-specific conditions is presented and tested under two different scenarios
    of shortage and surplus of water supply to the farm. The impact of this new centralised
    management of farm gates on water conservation was compared with the impact of
    a traditional decentralised management of gates, which roughly simulates the operations
    carried out manually by the farmer. The results may provide indications for improving
    flood management in rice cultivation, taking into account the effects of climate
    change on freshwater availability and rainfall patterns. 2. Control strategies
    for a sustainable agricultural water management Advanced but still little explored
    strategies for achieving coordinated control of complex systems of physical devices
    for irrigation (e.g. gates, valves, pumps) are those represented by proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) or predictive controls (van Overloop et al., 2005, Bertsekas, 2005). The
    first class of controls offers a mid-point between simple bang-bang controls (i.e.
    feedback controllers that switches abruptly between two states - on or off - when
    a desired target (setpoint) has been reached) and model-based controls such as
    predictive ones (Huang et al., 2022). In agricultural water management, PID control
    has been mainly used for real-time control of soil moisture (Harper, 2017), management
    of sprinkler irrigation equipment (Jacob et al., 2019), and control of irrigation
    canal operations (Litrico et al., 2007). A good description of the application
    of predictive control in the field of water resource systems is provided by Castelletti
    et al. (2023). In particular, they consider three main areas of interest in the
    application of the model predictive control (MPC), namely the water reservoir,
    the open channels and the urban water network. In the first case, reservoirs are
    usually multi-purpose systems serving power plants, irrigation districts, urban
    and industrial water users, as well as contributing to other objectives such as
    flood control, environmental management, navigation, water quality, etc. Traditionally,
    reservoir control is implemented by a human operator who can act on the basis
    of static control curves or control actions proposed in real time by a decision
    support system (DSS). In this case, the predictive control strategy can help to
    decide the release from the reservoir at time t + 1 depending on the release decision,
    the storage and the net inflow (usually affected by potential disturbances) to
    the reservoir at time t. In the second case, open channels are stretches of water
    between two control structures. Actuators are hydraulic infrastructure, such as
    gates, weirs and dams, available for water control purposes. Finally, nodes represent
    channel junctions, i.e. locations where a stream flows into or branches off from
    the main stream (these are known as tributaries and distributaries, respectively).
    The dynamics of open channels are best described by the Saint-Venant equations,
    a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. In this case, the predictive
    control strategy can help, for example, to maintain a pool between two actuators
    (to limit fluctuations in water diverted by tributaries). It can also support
    a bottom-up approach to gravity water distribution for irrigation, where the actual
    irrigation requirements of the fields are incorporated into the gate operations
    on the irrigation canals and ultimately the release function from the reservoir.
    In the third case, the urban water network is affected by the integrated urban
    water cycle, which consists of several infrastructural and operational components,
    including water source management, water treatment, water transport and distribution,
    sewerage/sewage collection and rainwater/stormwater drainage systems, with the
    main objective of providing water for human needs reliably, efficiently and safely,
    and then returning it to the environment with the least possible impact. Taking
    water transport and distribution networks as an example, an optimal control problem
    (possibly involving a predictive control strategy) is typically formulated as
    an optimal pump operation and valve setting control problem, aiming at resource
    and economic savings in energy consumption and associated costs, while ensuring
    that water is delivered to end users to meet their water needs. The main application
    of predictive control strategy (Bwambale et al., 2023) in irrigation management
    is in water, energy and fertiliser conservation. In particular, this strategy
    has largely been applied in the areas of irrigation canal flow control and regulation
    (Álvarez et al., 2013), while limited experiences were found in irrigation scheduling
    (Abioye et al., 2021), soil water potential regulation (Chen et al., 2020), soil
    moisture regulation (Ayaz et al., 2020) and lastly prediction of precipitation
    and evapotranspiration (Guo and You, 2018). Nothing to the author''s knowledge
    has been found on the application of predictive control model on irrigation management
    at field or farm scale and in particular on paddy rice. 3. Material and methods
    3.1. The pilot case study The flexible and coordinated irrigation management system
    was implemented at Cascina Ca'' Granda Milano, a rice paddy farm (40 ha in size)
    located in the south of Milan, consisting of 10 fields with an average size of
    about 4 ha each (Fig. 1). The fields are characterized by a toposequence (from
    north to south), which facilitates the irrigation procedures. More specifically,
    the fields are divided into five different blocks (i.e., bc, d, ehi, fg, lm),
    which are characterized by a single point of entry of the water flow. For example,
    in block bc, the only entry point is located in b. From b, the water flows into
    c, since it is topographically lower than b. According to the toposequence, the
    fields are irrigated as follows: block bc is irrigated first, followed by block
    d, third block ehi, then block fg, and finally block lm. Download : Download high-res

    farm canal network is indicated by blue arrows. Subdivision of fields [b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,l,m]
    in block is shown in red. All the fields have been sown with rice (Leonida variety)
    and the irrigation practice adopted is continuous flooding. In particular, rice
    is sown in dry soil at the end of April and the fields are flooded when the rice
    is around the three-leaf stage (i.e. about one month after sowing). Harvesting
    is typically scheduled for mid-September, while the fields are drained at the
    end of August. Eleven boreholes were drilled within the fields to determine soil
    hydraulic properties. On average, the soils are characterized by a silt loam texture
    with slight variability between blocks. The low conductivity layer thickness was
    approximately 30 cm, characterized by an average saturated hydraulic conductivity
    of approximately 1.8 mm/h. The nominal flow rate delivered to the farm by the
    irrigation agency is about 200 l/s continuously during the irrigation season (i.e.,
    April to September). The water is delivered to the farm from the north, i.e. upstream
    of points P1 and P2. There are no drainage points in the fields, while only one
    farm canal drainage point is activated in case of overflows. 3.1.1. Equipment
    At strategic points of the farm canal (P1–4 in Fig. 1) four automatic and remote
    controlled PikoMeter® gates (Rubicon Water, AU) were installed (Fig. 2a) to control
    the irrigation within the blocks. The PikoMeter® consists of three main components:
    an ultrasonic level sensor inside the gate frame, a flow meter and a steel gate.
    The flow meter measures the flow rate across the gate; hence the volume integrating
    the flow rates during irrigation. This meter consists of a cylindrical box with
    20 ultrasonic transducers in 5 measurement planes. The flow meter can measure
    with an accuracy of + /- 2.5% for velocities greater than 25 mm/s. The water level
    obtained by the ultrasonic level sensor is measured with an accuracy of 0.5 mm
    and a resolution of 0.1 mm. The gates are equipped with adaptive control software
    that allows their operation to be managed through three different setpoint configuration
    levels, i.e. maintaining a fixed (i) gate opening, (ii) upstream water level (U/S)
    or (iii) downstream flow (D/S). Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    known as Ferit®, are depicted in the upper right corner of the image. In addition
    to the PikoMeter®, five ultrasonic water level sensors (Ferit®) were installed
    in each field block (Fig. 2b). The position of the Ferit® in the field was decided
    according to the farmer''s experience, i.e. where its measurement would be representative
    of the water level in the block (L1-L5 in Fig. 1). Each Ferit® continuously monitors
    the water level in the rice field (with a resolution of +/- 1 mm) and sends the
    information to a master control system (FarmConnect® Gateway - Rubicon Water AU).
    The FarmConnect® Gateway can potentially provide a cellular network interface
    between PikoMeter® and Ferit®, but it has not yet been developed to control the
    gate operations. This interface uses the Telstra NextG protocol to routinely upload
    the data [via a Global System for Mobile Connection (GSM)] to a host server for
    remote monitoring and control. Biophysical parameters were continuously measured
    over the agricultural season by a standard agro-meteorological station of the
    Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPA), located a few kilometres from
    the rice farm. 3.2. Rice farm modelling framework The main elements of paddy rice
    farm (i.e. fields, canal, gates) were modelled using the Modelica simulation environment
    (Modelica Association, 2021). Modelica is an object-oriented, declarative, multi-domain
    modelling language for component-oriented modelling of complex systems. There
    are two main differences between Modelica and common object-oriented programming
    languages such as C+ + or Java. First, Modelica is a modelling language, not a
    traditional programming language: Modelica classes are not compiled in the conventional
    sense, but are translated into objects which are then exercised by a simulation
    engine. Second, Modelica is essentially based on equations, not assignments, although
    algorithmic components are still allowed, such as algorithms in programming languages
    or blocks in causal simulation environments (e.g. Simulink). In other words, Modelica
    allows an acausal approach to physical modelling: equations have no predefined
    causality and can have expressions on both the right and left sides. The simulation
    engine symbolically manipulates the equations to determine the order in which
    they are solved, as well as to determine the overall inputs and outputs of the
    model. Because of these features, the Modelica language allows a truly modular
    approach to the modelling of complex systems. This improves the readability, modifiability,
    and reusability of plant component models (Mattsson and Elmqvist, 1997), as well
    as the extension of the packages of physical domains by adding models of new components.
    In addition, models can be assembled graphically by dragging, dropping and connecting
    component icons, taking advantage of the graphical capabilities of the adopted
    (open source) interpreter, OpenModelica. The basic modelling components of the
    pilot rice farm were collected in a Modelica library (Field_Package). It contains
    definitions of constants (e.g. atmospheric pressure, gravity acceleration, water
    density etc.), classes (e.g. connectors), and subpackages (e.g. fields, canals,
    gates). Each element included in the Field_Package is described in detail in the
    Supplementary Material, whereas at the link https://github.com/looms-polimi/Field_Package
    the reader can freely download the rice farm Modelica library. In Fig. 3 the general

    Additional information about the symbols can be found in the Supplementary Material.
    Since in the control theory the number of control and controlled variables must
    be equal (Glasser, 1985), only the blocks d (6 ha), ehi (4.9 ha), lm (8.9 ha)
    and fg (13.2 ha) were considered in the modelling experiment. These blocks are
    directly irrigated by the water flows through P1, P3, P4 and by the difference
    of the flow rate derived between the gate P2 and the combination of P3 and P4.
    For simplicity, the blocks d, ehi, lm, and fg will be referred to as Field 1,
    2, 3, and 4, respectively, and the gates P1, 2, 3, and 4 will be referred to as
    gate G1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The core of the rice farm modelling is the
    field water balance. Rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration, and percolation
    were considered as dominant water fluxes, while surface drainage was neglected
    because each field has no outflow. The details of the field water balance are
    entirely reported in the Supplementary Material. The water balance was calibrated
    based on ponding water level measurements in the fields under a condition of near
    steady flow into the fields. Specifically, the calibration involved adjusting
    the percolation flux (through a percolation coefficient) so that the simulated
    ponding water level matched the real one. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between
    the measured and modelled ponding water levels within Field 3, the latter obtained
    with different percolation coefficients. We found that the range of percolation
    coefficient between 0.01 and 0.04 allowed a good fit between the observed and
    simulated ponding water levels in all fields. However, in the modelling framework
    we decided to use a single percolation coefficient equal to 0.01 for all fields.

    level, c – percolation coefficient. 3.3. Control strategy The goal of the control
    system is obviously to regulate the ponding water level within the fields. This
    is done by modulating the opening of the sluice gates (G1–4). The controlled variables
    are therefore the water levels within the fields, while the control variables
    are the opening height of the gates. The main disturbances are essentially the
    rainfall, percolation, evapotranspiration, and the flow rate in the canal. All
    states of the model are measured, including the farm canal levels. Therefore,
    there was no need to implement state estimators. A first simple approach to the
    design of the control system was to consider the binomial field-gate as an independent
    system. This approach can be defined as a decentralized control strategy. The
    interactions that occur mainly through the connection between fields and farm
    canal can be neglected with this approach (i.e. canal water is not considered
    a limiting factor for field water supply). For this strategy, a Proportional-Integral
    (PI) controller was used to control the ponding water level within the fields
    (Ang et al., 2005). However, the decentralized control system based on PI regulators
    suffers from three main drawbacks. First, each control system tries to achieve
    its goal independently of the others, which would be plausible under conditions
    of dynamic decoupling and unlimited water availability, while in reality the water
    availability in input to the farm could be reduced as a results of upstream regulations
    controls or water scarcity. Secondly, the adoption of anti-wind-up algorithms
    makes it possible to manage the return from saturation conditions of the control
    variables, but it is obviously not able to predict or avoid them. Finally, the
    decentralized controllers act on the error, i.e. the consequence of any disturbances,
    only after these disturbances have produced their effect, which does not allow,
    for example, to exploit perturbation forecast systems and thus anticipate the
    control action. To overcome the above drawbacks an advanced centralized control
    strategy was implemented. For this strategy, the Non-linear Model Predictive Control
    (NMPC) was used (Blanco et al., 2010), since it is suitable to deal with nonlinear
    systems with slow dynamics such as represented by the management of rice irrigation
    during flooding period (Ding et al., 2018). NMPC is a control strategy based on
    the sequential, online resolution of multiple open-loop optimal control problems
    defined over a finite, receding time horizon (Bertsekas, 2005). At each time step,
    the resolution of an NMPC problem yields a sequence of optimal control actions
    (i.e., gate openings) over the future horizon, given a predicted trajectory of
    the disturbances over the same horizon. The optimization is generally formulated
    considering a single objective; when the problem involves multiple objectives
    (e.g., water supply, hydropower production, flood control, environmental protection,
    irrigation, transport, etc.), these are generally aggregated using a scalarization
    function (e.g., weighted combination) or via the lexicographic goal programming
    technique in cases where there is a clear hierarchy of priorities across the objectives
    (e.g., Horváth et al., 2022). The online optimization scheme is reiterated forward
    in time over a receding horizon during the operational life of the system. After
    each optimization, only the control action in the current time step of the optimized
    control sequence is actuated, before reiterating the optimization at the next
    time step. Through this reiteration of the model-based optimization, NMPC determines
    the control law implicitly in a closed-loop form, as it computes the optimal control
    action at each time step t based on the observed state of the system. The flexibility
    to directly use any models available for the systems to be controlled is one of
    the main advantages of this approach, especially for the control of highly nonlinear
    systems, while the flexibility to work with (nonlinear) constraints, either explicit
    physical constraints (e.g. limits of actuators) or legal constraints, is another
    advantage of MPC compared to other control methods. The Supplementary Material
    provides the mathematical details of each control strategy applied to the Cascina
    Ca’ Granda pilot case study. 3.4. Simulation experiments The performances of the
    decentralized and centralized controls, based on Proportional Integral (PI) and
    Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategies, respectively, were evaluated in terms
    of the system''s adaptive capacity to respond to external requirements or disturbances,
    using three different modelling experiments. The objective of the first experiment
    was to verify the correct operation of the two control systems under standard
    flood management conditions. Specifically, the modelling exercise simulates a
    theoretical situation in which the control system works to change the ponding
    water level in the fields from an initial condition to a new reference one (in
    this example from 4 cm to 5 cm). This is a typical operation that could occur
    when the ponding water level needs to be adjusted during an irrigation season.
    The simulation assumes no external disturbances, such as the presence of rainfall
    events, and a constant nominal flow rate at farm inlet of 200 l/s. The second
    experiment examined the response of the control systems to a reduction in the
    flow rate at the input to the farm. In particular, starting from a standard water
    level within the farm canal and rice plots, the effect of reducing the nominal
    flow rate at farm inlet (200 l/s) to 100 l/s on the ability of both control systems
    to maintain a uniform ponding water level within the blocks is investigated. This
    scenario can happen if water becomes scarce during the agricultural season (dry
    season), or if the water supply changes as a result of gates being maneuvered
    on irrigation district channels upstream of the farm. The response of both control
    systems to an external disturbance derived from a rainfall event was evaluated
    in the third experiment. Specifically, the possibility of taking advantage of
    rainfall forecasts and using them to predict the advance status of water levels
    in farm canals and rice blocks was used to evaluate the adaptive capacity of the
    control systems. Specifically, the selected event occurred in the 2021 agricultural
    season on the case study and consisted of a rainfall volume of about 33 mm and
    duration of 10 h, with a peak of 18 mm. In this case the nominal flow rate was
    maintained at 200 l/s in input to the farm. The potential water conservation of
    the PI and NMPC strategies was also investigated. Specifically, using the decentralized
    strategy (i.e., PI control) as a benchmark, the benefits of adopting centralized
    control (i.e., NMPC) in terms of water conservation were estimated as additional
    information on the performance of a coordinated system of gates. 4. Results 4.1.
    Performance of PI and NMPC under standard conditions of flood management The performance
    in time of both control strategies (i.e. PI and NMPC) under standard conditions
    of flood management are presented in Fig. 5. In particular, the comparison between
    the PI and NMPC approaches was evaluated for (i) the ponding water level in the
    fields, (ii) the opening height of the gates and finally (iii) the water level
    in the farm canal. In general, both control strategies respond effectively to
    bring the system to the new ponding water level configuration (i.e., from 4 cm
    to 5 cm). The new ponding level is reached gradually for both control strategies
    in a similar time horizon (about 10 h), depending on real inertias observed in
    the field system. The objective of increasing the water level in the fields led
    to the initial opening of the gates and their subsequent gradual adjustment. In
    both strategies, because the area of each field is different and therefore the
    flow rate needed to raise the ponding water level in each field is different,
    the initial gate opening height was different for each field. The adjustment of
    the gate opening after the initial moment is managed in a different way by the
    control action for each gate, both for PI and for NMPC. This is due to the need
    to have different flow rates in the input to the fields in order to reach the
    new ponding water level. However, since the opening height of the gates is similar
    at the end of the control action, both strategies can be considered coherent.
    Finally, the increase in the flow rate required to reach the new pond level in
    the fields influenced the water level in the farm canal, which at first quickly
    dropped below its initial height (about 1 m) and then returned to a level suitable
    to meet the water needs of the fields, since the inflow to the farm is not limited.
    In this case, the differences between the two control strategies are particularly
    evident. PI causes the water level in the canal to fall by approximately half
    compared to the initial condition, while the fall in the water level is less pronounced
    with NMPC. The return to the initial state of the water level in the canal takes
    twice as long for PI than for NMPC. Download : Download high-res image (169KB)

    and centralized (NMPC) control strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment,

    in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 1: standard condition of flood management. The
    effects of both control actions on the ponding water level of the other fields
    and on the other gate opening are presented in Appendix 1. 4.2. Performance of
    PI and NMPC under limited water supply conditions Often the water supply at the
    head of a farm is not constant over time. This can happen when a dry agricultural
    season is expected. Fig. 6 shows for the Field 1 the performance of PI and NMPC
    control actions on ponding water level and gate opening when the nominal inflow
    rate to the farm canal was rapidly reduced from 200 l/s to 100 l/s. The ponding
    water level in the field decreases as a result of the inflow rate reduction. At
    the end of the simulation time, the levels reached are very similar (2 mm of difference).
    The PI control action responds to the falling of ponding water level in the field
    by opening the gate to draw as much water as possible from the farm canal. The
    gate changes its opening height up to the maximum allowed (i.e. 1), since the
    gate operates independently of the others and responds only to the needs of its
    own field. The gate takes about 20 h to saturate. In the other fields and gates,
    similar behaviour was observed. The general effect of this action is to remove
    almost all the water from the canal, which is reduced to a water level of a few
    centimetres. It follows that, the new inflow rate (i.e. 100 l/sec) is not sufficient
    to maintain the reference water level inside the fields (i.e. 5 cm). As a result,
    at the end of the control action, the ponding water level was lower than the reference
    threshold. Download : Download high-res image (168KB) Download : Download full-size

    strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment, (ii) gate opening height
    and (iii) water level in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 2: limited water supply.
    The ponding water level inside Field 1 (and thus for the other fields as well)
    was also lower than the reference threshold at the end of the NMPC control action.
    However, the NMPC uses a completely different strategy to reach this new configuration.
    The gate does not only look at the state of its own field, but also at the state
    of the other gates and at the farm canal. This integrated approach ensures that
    the gate does not saturate when it opens (i.e. it never reaches the maximum opening
    height) and the water level in the farm canal is not drastically depleted (as
    properly shown in Fig. 6). Furthermore, the gate opening equilibrium was achieved
    in about half time with respect to the PI control. The effects of both control
    actions on the ponding water level of the other fields and on the other gate opening
    are presented in Appendix 2. A positive feature of the NMPC strategy is that it
    allows for compensation of flood conditions among fields even when ponding water
    levels cannot be maintained at the target level for the reduced inflow rate in
    input to the farm. This is clearly shown in Fig. 7, which compares the effects
    of PI and NMPC approach on the ponding water level within the fields. A decentralized
    control action approach results in different ponding water levels within the fields,
    while a centralized control action approach makes the ponding water level between
    the fields uniform (although lower than the target water level). Download : Download

    Water Level (PWL) adjustment with respect to the target (PWL target), and (ii)
    gate opening height of all fields (Field 1–4)and gates (Gate 1–4). Scenario 2:
    limited water supply. It is interesting that a uniform PI controller response
    corresponds to a varying ponding water level between the fields. In fact, every
    gate responding to a field''s request for water opens and gets saturated (Fig.
    7). Conversely, a tailored control action by the NMPC system for each gate results
    in a uniform ponding water level between the fields. In this case, the opening
    height of each gate is related to the water demand of the field, which in this
    case study strictly depends by the field area. In fact, the opening height of
    gate 4 (which serves Field 4 - of about 13 ha in size) at the end of the control
    action is about three times greater than the opening height of gate 2 (which serves
    Field 2 - of about 4 ha in size) and two times greater than the opening height
    of gate 3 (which serves Field 3 - of about 6 ha in size). In the NMPC strategy,
    the gates are not saturated (i.e., the gates do not reach their maximum opening
    height), but are opened only to the extent necessary to meet the predictive water
    request. 4.3. Performance of the PI and NMPC in the presence of an instantaneous
    water supply The effect on ponding water level and gate operations of the decentralized
    (i.e. PI) and centralized (i.e. NMPC) strategies stressed by an instantaneous
    water supply disturbance to the farm generated by a rainfall event is presented
    in Fig. 8 for the Field 1 and Gate 1. The PI approach works only when the precipitation
    starts. In particular, when rainfall begins, the gate begins to close until the
    opening height is equal to zero (i.e. gate completely closed) when rainfall has
    reached the peak. The ponding water level in the field increased up to 7 cm (i.e.
    2 cm above the reference target), with a peak around the moment of maximum rainfall
    intensity. At the end of rainfall event the ponding water level within the field
    return to the target value. The same behaviour was observed in the other fields
    and gates as reported Appendix 3. The PI strategy reproduces the behaviour of
    a farmer and the effect it has on the water level in the fields when it rains.
    In fact, the farmer operates on the gates only when he sees that the water level
    in the fields is changing. This difficulty in adapting the system before the rain
    starts leads to a significant perturbation in the ponding water level inside the
    fields, as a consequence of the inertia that a real system composed of large fields
    has in recovering the initial configuration after a disturbance. On the contrary,
    the NMPC approach tries to prevent the additional volume of water supplied to
    the fields before the rainfall event, modifying the state of the system so that
    it can absorb the disturbance without excessive change in the ponding water level.
    Specifically, the forecasting model that constitutes the NMPC works by closing
    the gates in anticipation of the onset of rain (about 5 h on average before the
    rain, but the beginning of the gate closing action can vary between fields). The
    ponding water level drops a few centimetres below the target and then rises when
    it rains. However, the increase of ponding water level is less than about 20%
    of that obtained with the PI, highlighting the great capacity of the NMPC to maintain
    the target ponding water level even under instantaneous disturbances. Download

    (PI) and centralized (NMPC) control strategies on flow rate in input to the fields
    (Field 1–4). Scenario 3: presence of an instantaneous water supply as a result
    of rainfall event. By integrating the water flows entering each field over time
    of rainfall event, the potential water conservation operated by NMPC with respect
    to the PI action has been calculated. Specifically, the NMPC results in 11% on
    average of water conservation with respect to PI strategy. This conservation is
    due to the anticipation of closing the gates in preparation for the rain event.
    The NMPC control action was further stressed by assuming an hour advance or delay
    in the rainfall event. This simulation was used to investigate the response of
    the NMPC strategy when potential errors in the weather forecasts occur. The results
    of these two additional simulations are presented in Fig. 11, where the effects
    of NMPC strategy on ponding water levels and gate opening heights are shown for
    all fields and gates. The advance of the rainfall event has no significant effect
    on the control action, except for the anticipation of the closure of the gates.
    Conversely, the delay of the rainfall event leads to a temporary opening of the
    gates due to the fact that in the window of the prediction horizon (i.e. 15 h
    - see Supplementary Material) the forecast of the rainfall evolution pattern was
    not fully included. In fact, the model is not able to predict what will happen
    after the prediction horizon, so since the ponding water level decreased excessively,
    the control action ordered the opening of gates. However, when the rainfall increase
    was detected, the controller sent a signal to close the gates again. Download

    challenges for the future of sustainable rice irrigation is to cope with climate
    change and adapt to fluctuations in freshwater availability. Without improvements
    in irrigation management (data-driven modelling and management of irrigation interventions,
    flexible and predictive gate operation, real-time flow control, etc.), traditional
    rice irrigation practices of flood irrigation may be abandoned in favour of other
    less water-intensive irrigation techniques (Lampayan et al., 2015). Although the
    modelling framework presented in this paper offers the possibility to safeguard
    the traditional method of rice irrigation (i.e. flood irrigation), in practice,
    the transition to a new irrigation technique does not affect the ability to use
    the automatic technologies and control approaches presented in this paper. The
    ability to well regulate the ponding water level within rice fields during the
    season has potential water saving and environmental benefits. In the case of the
    rice water balance (see Supplementary Material), it shows a proportional relationship
    between ponding water level and percolation flux (Toung et al., 1994). This relationship
    illustrates how a good control of the ponding water level within the fields can
    provide direct control of hydrological losses at field/farm scale by minimising
    the latter. This could be seen as an important achievement of the coordinated
    control approach, as hydrological losses are beyond the control of the farmer.
    Finally, previous studies have shown that continuous submergence and good control
    of ponding water levels during the rice growing season are more effective in controlling
    weeds, reducing herbicide use and improving the environmental sustainability of
    flooding practices. (Aravinth et al., 2023). Therefore, the NMPC could enable
    this weed control at farm level more efficiently than the PI approach, as shown
    in scenario 2, where the centralised control of the gates attempts to equalise
    the ponding water level within the fields. Given these examples, the introduction
    of automatic control into current flooding management practice could increase
    the sustainability of traditional rice irrigation. This would require the installation
    of a new hydraulic infrastructure (automatic gates) to replace the manual one,
    capable of accepting control software. The costs of this modernisation are relevant
    but sustainable, as already shown by Masseroni et al. (2018), and will become
    even more so as the cost of water increases. Concerning the modelling framework
    presented in this work, it has some simplifications, which can be more detailed
    if the Modelica library would really be included in the gate control software
    of the pilot farm. One of them is the choice of a single percolation coefficient
    for the fields. In our results, the differences in the control effect between
    the fields are exclusively due to the different field size, while specific characteristic
    of each field could be included in the water balance model equations. In this
    respect, it must be pointed out that the OpenModelica generated Functional Mock-up
    Unit (FMU) can already be used to calibrate uncertain model parameters (i.e. percolation
    coefficients), through Python optimization routines, thus paving the way to adaptive
    NMPC, while the use of the aforementioned FMU for the solution of the optimal
    control problem, also based on (open source) Python functions, is currently being
    studied. Additionally, predictions are the key feature for an intelligent control
    action achieved by NMPC strategy. In our modelling experiments, only rainfall
    forecasts are included in the NMPC, while better control performance could be
    obtained if temperature forecasts (which affect crop development) were included
    in the centralized control strategy. For this purpose, the correct choice of the
    prediction horizon can help to avoid unexpected opening and closing of the gates
    during their operation, increasing water conservation. Long-term forecasts of
    biophysical variables could also be included in the model. However, this could
    increase both the uncertainty in the reliability and robustness of the control
    action and the computational time. Therefore, it would be optimal to combine the
    control action with the farmer''s experience. The latter could, for example, help
    decide which fields should maintain the target ponding water level in case of
    water shortage, instead of having a uniform ponding water level between fields
    but below the threshold. Lastly, the ponding water level target could be variable
    during the agricultural season, following the flooding best practices for the
    specific rice cultivar or crop phenological stages, or to practice alternate wetting
    drying flood management (Rejesus et al., 2011, Mayer et al., 2019, Gilardi et
    al., 2023). 6. Conclusion This paper presents an advanced control technique for
    precision flood irrigation in paddy rice farms. The proposed technique has been
    tested on a real case study through a series of simulation experiments in the
    Modelica environment and is based on a nonlinear model predictive control strategy.
    This strategy has been compared with that obtained by a proportional-integral
    control action, which roughly reproduces the traditional farmer gate operations.
    Simulation reveals that the nonlinear model predictive control strategy can accurately
    control ponding water level within the fields both under standard conditions of
    flood management and under limited or instantaneous water supplies to the farm.
    Furthermore, its application to a real rainfall event showed that nonlinear model
    predictive control has the potential to significantly reduce water consumption
    compared to proportional-integral control. Therefore, the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy appears to be a viable solution for improving the performance
    of flood irrigation in paddy rice farms, although some slight improvements in
    the modelling algorithm should still be made before implementing this technique
    in a real system of sluice gates. Implementing the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy in the gate management software and testing its operation under
    different agricultural seasons will be the next step. Declaration of Competing

  description: In the face of increasing water scarcity and uncertainties of climate
    change, improving crop water use efficiency and productivity, while minimizing
    negative environmental impacts, is becoming crucial to meet the surging global
    food demand. Smart irrigation has a potential of improving water use efficiency
    in precision agriculture especially when efficient irrigation control strategies
    are adopted. Conventionally, irrigation systems rely on heuristic methods to schedule

    the crop physiological characteristics as well as the water use efficiency. To
    tackle this menace, model-based irrigation management has been overemphasized.
    A closed-loop irrigation control strategy relies on a mathematical model of the

    using an ATMOS41 weather station, TERROS 12 soil moisture sensor and a YFS-201
    flow sensor for crop evapotranspiration and precipitation, soil moisture and irrigation
    volumes respectively. Data driven modelling was then performed using the system
    identification toolbox in a MATLAB environment. The model formulation was a multi-input
    single-output (MISO) system with reference evapotranspiration, irrigation and
    rainfall as inputs and soil moisture as the output. Different model structures
    including transfer functions, state space models, polynomial models and ARX models
    were evaluated. Model performance was evaluated using the mean square error (MSE),
    final prediction error (FPE) and estimated fit of the model approaches. Simulation
    results indicate that the soil moisture dynamics model provides a satisfactory
    approximation of the process dynamics with a state space model giving an estimated
    fit of 97.04 %, MSE and FPE of 1.74×10−7 and 1.75×10−7 respectively. This model
    will be used to design a model predictive controller for smart irrigation scheduling

    scarcity at a global scale is increasing, making it perplexing to achieve sustainable
    agricultural production [1], [2], [3]. Agricultural water scarcity is projected
    to increase in more than 80 % of the world''s countries by the year 2050 [4].
    This coupled with the increasing population, climate change impacts and competition
    from other sectors, puts food security at stake [5]. Irrigated agriculture is
    one of the major water users accounting for about 70 % of freshwater withdraws
    [6],[7]. Irrigation accounts for 40 % of the world''s food and fibre production
    and will therefore play a crucial role in feeding the 9.7 billion people by 2050
    [8],[9]. Water withdrawal for irrigation is projected to hit 29000 km3 by 2050
    with most of the high demand in developing countries translating into 20 million
    hectares under irrigation [10]. The need to enhance water use efficiency has never
    been over emphasized throughout the research community and industry as it is presently.
    Enhancing water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture necessitates effective
    use of available water resources to respond to real-time crop irrigation requirements.
    This requires monitoring water use and controlling how the irrigation water is
    applied. The goal of monitoring the crop environment in real-time is to control
    the root zone soil moisture between specific thresholds; field capacity and permanent
    wilting point [11]. On the other hand, irrigation control deals with applying
    what will keep the soil moisture between that threshold at the set time with precision.
    Emerging technologies, such as wireless communications, remote sensing, machine
    learning, crop physiology and soil environment monitoring systems, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and big data, have expounded the scope of irrigation monitoring
    and control [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. These technologies facilitate the generation
    of large amounts of data which when processed and analyzed can be utilized for
    predictions. This has given rise to the paradigm shift from open loop irrigation
    control to model-based irrigation management [17,18]. In model-based irrigation
    management, data from soil, weather and plant makes an integral part of the predictive
    control strategy to improve crop water use efficiency while minimizing negative
    environmental consequences [19], [20], [21], [22]. Over the years, the soil agro-hydrological
    model has been utilized to depict the soil moisture dynamics in the rootzone [23]
    as a basis for model based irrigation scheduling. The model characterizes the
    hydrological cycle between the soil, the atmosphere, and the crop [24]. Modelling
    soil moisture dynamics is very critical in irrigation automation. Unlike conventional
    irrigation systems that rely on open-loop irrigation strategies, closed-loop irrigation
    control for smart irrigation uses a plant model and the system''s current state
    to predict future irrigation amounts [25], [26], [27]. Nonetheless, these models
    have been developed for controlled environment agricultural systems especially
    in developed countries like USA, China and Australia. About, 95 % of food consumed
    in developing countries is from open field agricultural systems where most of
    the water losses occur. Therefore, developing models on which irrigation scheduling
    decisions can be based in open field agriculture is of significant importance.
    Several researchers have modelled soil moisture dynamics in an attempt to improve
    irrigation scheduling. For example, Saleem et al. [28] and Lozoya et al. [29]
    developed a soil moisture dynamics model for closed-loop irrigation The authors
    assumed negligible precipitation and ignored the crop coefficient in the evapotranspiration
    model. The drawback then becomes its suitability in different agroclimatic zones
    where supplementary irrigation is necessary. Additionally, crops need different
    volumes of water per growth stage. Similarly, Mao et al. [30] used the agro-hydrological
    model to predict the future states of an agricultural system. The authors, however,
    rely on historical data for irrigation scheduling. This means real-time plant
    water needs are dependent on past data instead of real-time soil, weather, and
    plant system parameters. Recently, Abioye et al. [31] developed an Internet of
    Things (IoT) and data-driven modelling to model soil moisture dynamics in a controlled
    environment agricultural system. The authors developed a multi-input single-output
    (MISO) system with evapotranspiration and irrigation volumes as inputs and soil
    moisture as the output. Open field agricultural systems, however, depict a more
    dynamic nature of soil moisture with many factors contributing to changes in soil
    moisture compared to controlled environment agricultural systems. There is considerably
    a small body of studies that modelled soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems using data-driven approaches. This is partly attributed to the costly
    monitoring equipment required to provide the data for all the parameters in the
    water balance equation. The major objective of this study is to therefore develop
    a soil moisture dynamics model in an open field agricultural system to aid model-based
    irrigation management for enhancement of water use efficiency in arid and semi-arid
    regions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The experiment was conducted
    at the University for Development Studies, Nyankpala campus at WACWISA experimental
    site located at 90 24’ 37” N and 00 58’53” E of the Equator as shown in Fig. 1.
    A drip irrigation experiment was designed on a 20*18m plot under tomato production
    spaced at 0.5m. The drip irrigation system consisted of 20mm HDPE laterals with
    online emitters with a flow rate of 2.1litres per hour. The experimental data
    was collected from September 21st to November 26, 2022, resulting in 9674 data
    sets for developing the soil moisture dynamics model collected in 10-mibute time-steps.

    experiment with monitoring sensors. 2.2. Agro-hydrological balance model This
    model describes the soil moisture dynamics in an open field agricultural system.
    The agro-hydrologic balance model states that changes in rootzone soil moisture
    at a particular point in time is due to water inflows including rainfall, capillary
    rise, irrigation less the water outflows, deep percolation, water runoff and evapotranspiration
    as depicted in Fig. 3 [27]. The agro-hydrological model can be mathematically
    expressed as in Eq. (1) [28,32]. (1) Download : Download high-res image (151KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Agro-hydrological system. Where; ,
    , , , , , and In most agricultural fields the lateral water inflow is negligible,
    or the total effect is always zero. Likewise, the capillary rise contribution
    in soils with a deep-water table is zero. The runoff in a well-designed smart
    irrigation system is taken as zero, and thus the change in rootzone soil moisture
    becomes as shown in Eq. (2). (2) 2.2.1. Evapotranspiration The crop evapotranspiration
    then is a product of reference evapotranspiration and the crop coefficient as
    depicted in Eq. (3) [33]. Allen et al. [33] defines the crop evapotranspiration
    under standard conditions, denoted as ETC, as the evapotranspiration from disease-free,
    well-fertilized crops, grown in large fields, under optimum soil water conditions,
    and achieving full production under the given climatic conditions. The FAO Penman
    Monteith model for reference evapotranspiration was adopted for this study. (3)
    Where; ETc is the crop evapotranspiration(mmday−1), ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration(mmday−1)
    and Kc is the crop factor which depends on the growth stage of the plant. (4)
    Where; is Reference evapotranspiration (mmday−1), is the slope vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), is net radiation at the crop surface (MJm−2day−1), is Soil heat
    flux density (MJm−2day−1), is Psychometric constant (kPa °C−1), is Air temperature
    (°C), is Wind speed (ms−1), is Saturation vapour pressure (kpa), is Actual vapour
    pressure (kpa) An ATMOS 41 weather station was used to monitor the plant environment
    in real-time and the data was sent to a wireless Zentrac data logger and stored
    in the cloud. The automated weather station gives solar radiation, air temperature,
    vapour pressure, vapour pressure deficit, precipitation, and wind speed among
    other parameters. Net radiation at the crop surface Rn, Soil heat flux density
    G, slope vapour pressure curve and psychometric constant were derived from measured
    parameters using procedures described in Allen et al. [33]. Weather data used
    in the calculation of reference evapotranspiration was collected at 10-minute
    intervals and stored on the Zetracloud. Using the FAO Penman Monteith Equation,
    a 10-minute reference evapotranspiration was determined for the 9674 samples.
    2.2.2. Soil Moisture Soil moisture measurements were conducted by using a Terros
    12 volumetric water content sensor from meter group. The sensor was located at
    a depth of 30 cm in order to measure the soil moisture at the effective rootzone
    depth of tomato crop. The crop grows over a sandy loam type of soil with a field
    capacity and permanent wilting point of 24.5 and 12.6, respectively and an infiltration
    rate of 12 l/h. 2.2.3. Irrigation Similarly, in order to estimate the irrigation
    volume, the IoT based flowmeter produces a digital output pulse which has been
    counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the water flow rate during irrigation.
    The water flowrate is calibrated in Eq. (5) and flow volume in Eq. (6). (5) (6)
    2.3. Model Structure 2.3.1. Transfer functions For a dynamical system that does
    not change over time, the transfer function provides a useful representation.
    [34]. Inspection or basic algebraic manipulations of the differential equations
    that characterize the systems can yield the transfer function. Even infinite-dimensional
    systems driven by partial differential equations may be understood with the help
    of transfer functions. Experiments on a system can be used to establish its transfer
    function. Eq. 7 depicts the mathematical formulation of a transfer function [35].
    (7) Where are matrices 2.3.2. The Box Jenkins Model The Box Jenkins model uses
    a rational polynomial function to give totally separate parameterization for the
    dynamics and noise. Eqs. 8a and b represent the Box Jenkins model [36]. (8a) Where
    (8b) Water content in volume at time t is denoted by y(t), input variables are
    denoted by u(t), and estimate error is denoted by e(t). A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x),
    and F(x) are the polynomials that determine the model''s output, inputs, and estimate
    errors, respectively. 2.3.3. The State Space Model In statistics, a state-space
    model is a kind of probabilistic graphical model that graphically expresses the
    probabilistic dependency between a latent state variable and an observed measurement.
    [37]. It represents the dynamics of an Nth order system as a first-order differential
    equation in an N-vector, which is called the state [38]. The important attribute
    of the state vector x(t) in the state space formulation is that it entirely specifies
    the system at a time t [39]. Future states are determined solely by the current
    state, x(t), and any inputs, u(t), at time t and beyond. The current state x(t)
    summarizes all previous states and the full input history; it thus encompasses
    all of the system''s memory. Eqs. 9a and 9b can be used to represent state space
    models. (9a) (9b) Where, is the state vector at time n, u is a vector of inputs,
    A is an state transition matrix, B is an input coeffient matrix, is a column vector
    of the output variables , is an matrix of the constant-coefficient that weight
    of state variables and is an m x n matrix of the constant-coefficient weight of
    the system inputs. 2.3.4. The Output Error Model When only white measurement noise
    is affecting the process output, the Output Error model structure is used as represented
    in Eqs. 10a and b [40]. (10a) This model can be expressed as (10b) 2.3.5. The
    Autoregressive with External Input Model (ARX) Model The ARX model is derived
    from Eq. 11 [41]. (11) Where and . These are polynomial matrices; d is the delay
    of the system. The ARX model is therefore simplified using equation 12 as shown.
    (12) 2.3.6. The Autoregressive Moving Average with Extra Input Model This autoregressive
    moving average with external input model (ARMAX) is in broader structure compared
    to the ARX as shown in Eq. 13. (13) Where . This is a polynomial where the noise
    term is explicitly modelled and expressed as shown in Eq. 14. (14) 2.4. System
    Identification in MATLAB Environment System identification toolbox in MATLAB was
    used to model the soil moisture dynamics starting with a lower order, increasing
    and decreasing the order of the polynomial and the variable delay. Fig. 4 shows
    the interface of the system identification toolbox where various model structures
    were used. A total of 9674 samples collected at 600s time steps were used in the
    modelling with 70 % of the data as estimation and 30 % as validation data. Additionally,
    pre-processing of the experimental data was performed to get rid of the trends,
    outliers, and means. as suggested by [42]. Download : Download high-res image

    toolbox. 2.5. Model Evaluation With the help of the lowest order of the system''s
    dynamics, the models constructed inside the MATLAB system identification toolbox
    are able to predict the behaviour of the system''s output and graphically represent
    the relationship between the system''s input and output variables [31]. Best fit,
    final prediction error (FPE), and mean square error (MSE) are three statistical
    measures that may be used to evaluate the efficacy of the developed models [31].
    2.5.1. Final Prediction Error Model quality is quantified by the absolute value
    of the prediction error obtained during validation on an independent data set.
    According to Abdul-Rahim et al. [43] the accuracy of the derived model is dependent
    on how small the FPE is. This is expressed in Eq. 15. (15) Where; Estimation data
    is denoted by N, and the associated prediction errors are represented by e(t),
    a vector of dimensions (n, -1). The estimated parameters are denoted by , while
    the total number of parameters is denoted by d 2.5.2. Mean Square Error The mean
    square error (MSE) is a statistical metric used to evaluate prediction quality
    in the same unit of the variable. The MSE score is near to zero, indicating that
    the model prediction is correct. The MSE is defined by Eq. 16: (16) Where; are
    observed and predicted values at time (i = 1,2,3,…n) and n is the data point.
    2.5.3. Estimated Fit The estimated fit (%) is a measure of the correlation between
    the measured output and the predicted output . This is computed as shown in Eq.
    17. (17) 3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Daily and Solar Radiation Fig. 5 presents
    the relationship between reference evapotranspiration , and Solar Radiation Rs,
    during the experimental data collection. It is observed that peak solar radiation
    received in the afternoon which translates into peak values of . The maximum recorded
    during the study period is 4.8 mmday−1 while the maximum solar radiation was 1357.9

    irrigation management. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download

    period. 3.2. Reference evapotranspiration, water content and precipitation The
    soil moisture content at the start of the experiment was 0.34 m3/m3 as depicted
    in Fig. 6. During this time precipitation values were high given that the rainy
    season was coming to an end. As the precipitation reduced, the soil moisture content
    reduced to field capacity where it was being maintained through irrigation. The
    dynamics may be seen altering because of plant water absorption and environmental
    (weather) effects that induce water loss from the soil, resulting in a changing
    variation in the volumetric water content. As evapotranspiration causes water
    loss, the volumetric water content of the soil changes, indicating that more or
    less water is required to be provided for irrigation. As a result, these variables
    have a direct influence on the amount of water applied to the plant. Download

    period. 3.3. Statistical Performance of the Models From the system identification
    simulation results in MATLAB presented in Table 1, it is evident that state space
    model performed better than other model structures (Transfer Functions, ARMAX,
    Box Jenkins, ARX and Output Error model). The state space mode yielded an estimated
    fit of 97.04 % being the highest amongst all the model structures evaluated. Additionally,
    in terms of the mean square error and final prediction error, the state space
    model performed better with the least values of the statistical criterion. The
    Output Error model on the other hand performed poorly amongst all the model structures.
    It could not mimic the soil moisture dynamics in the field and hence was not chosen
    for a model predictive controller design. The step ahead prediction results presented
    in Table 2 also support the state space model''s ability to represent the dynamic
    nature of the soil-water agricultural system. With a 5-steo ahead prediction it
    gives an estimated fit of 98.92 % making it the best choice for MPC design. The
    chosen model estimated the parameters as shown in Eqs. 15 and 17 in discrete-time
    state space model. Fig. 7 shows the 5-step ahead prediction of the system. Table

    the step response of the model structures evaluated in the MATLAB environment.
    The model structures are graded using the lowest order of the dynamic response.
    The first-order models'' output was found to be steady, with no overshoot or undershoot
    but a sluggish response time. There is no lag and a faster rising time compared
    to other models, even the Box Jenkins model with an offset. The frequency response
    curve, shown in Fig. 9, reveals that the dynamics of all model structures are
    identical over a wide range of frequencies. The purpose of this data-driven modelling
    was to create the forecasting models integral to creating a model-based controller
    for the physical system. The results show that despite the nonlinearity of the
    inputs, the output is quite steady. Despite experimental validation, the prediction
    model created in this study has some margin of error. Download : Download high-res

    Curve. The step and frequency response of the models can provide valuable information
    for practical agricultural purposes. For example, the step response can help to
    understand how quickly the system responds to changes in input (e.g., irrigation)
    and to identify any delays or oscillations in the response. The frequency response
    can help to identify the natural frequencies of the system and to design controllers
    that can regulate the system at different frequencies. 4. Conclusion Improving
    water use efficiency in precision agriculture is of paramount importance. Model-based
    irrigation management is one of the approaches through which irrigation scheduling
    can be responsive in real time especially for open field agricultural systems.
    This study demonstrates a data-driven approach where data from monitoring sensors
    in a drip irrigated tomato experiment is used to develop a soil moisture dynamics
    model using system identification. The resulting model is a state space model
    for great performance in terms of statistical evaluation criteria. In comparison
    to other model structures, it gives an estimation of fit of 97.04%, mean square
    error of 1.74 × 10−7 and final prediction error of 1.75 × 10−7. Future research
    will involve utilizing the state space model to develop a model predictive controller
    which will later be deployed on a micro-controller in an open field agricultural
    system. Funding Information The Institute de Recherché pour le Development (IRD),

  description: In this study, a three-stage irrigation management zone delineation
    approach and a model-based scheduler are proposed to provide variable rate irrigation
    schedules for a 26.4-hectare field at the Alberta Irrigation Technology Centre
    in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. After an initial demarcation of the investigated
    field into quadrants according to the four different crops growing in the field,
    the k-means clustering approach is used to delineate each quadrant further into
    smaller irrigation management zones on the basis of soil hydraulic parameters,
    elevation of the field and the variable rate irrigation resolution of the center
    pivot system. For each management zone, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural
    network model is then developed to characterize the soil water dynamics in the
    root zone. Based on the LSTM models, and based on the LSTM models, a mixed-integer
    model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to prescribe irrigation schedules
    for the various management zones in each quadrant to ensure optimal crop water
    uptake while minimizing water consumption and irrigation costs. The applicability
    of the proposed approach is illustrated in simulations. The results show that
    the proposed approach achieves 26% water savings compared to a triggered scheduling
    scheme.

    controlPrecision irrigationSystem identification 1. Introduction The current and
    future generations face significant challenges in ensuring that nutritious food
    is sustainably produced from limited land and water resources. The FAO''s food
    and agriculture report of 2020 posits that 40% of the world population are inhabitants
    of water-scarce agricultural areas; of these, 37% inhabit agricultural zones with
    severe water scarcity [27,51]. Coupled with the rising population indices, meeting
    the food demand by 2050 will need a 70% increase in food production [28]. In addition
    to developing quick maturing and high-yielding plant varieties, scientists need
    to ensure that less water is used to produce more food. It is estimated that about
    70% of the water abstracted for irrigation is lost through conveyance losses and
    poor water allocation methods [76]. This means that a lot of water is presently
    used to produce a unit of food. Improving water use efficiency in irrigation systems
    requires intelligent irrigation monitoring and control systems to ensure that
    no water is wasted and precise water application is achieved [15]. Sustainable
    precision irrigation presents a timely solution to water wastage in irrigated
    agriculture by ensuring that intended irrigation amounts are applied at the right
    time and place. Precision irrigation scheduling is striving to achieve efficient
    water use per plant, in space and time, in the right quantities to compensate
    for losses. This is possible through effective monitoring and optimal control
    strategies, reducing pumping costs. Over the years, there has been a paradigm
    shift from traditional irrigation methods to smart irrigation systems. This has
    somewhat improved the water use efficiency by reducing conveyance losses. However,
    irrigation control is still a challenge due to the complex nature of agricultural
    systems. For example, most irrigation systems are designed based on historical
    climatic data, and irrigation schedules are developed based on this data. Precision
    agriculture has been facilitated by the tremendous advancement in the agricultural
    Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) through remote sensing
    [32,69]. The controlled monitoring of agricultural systems has enhanced the sapience
    of the changing dynamics of the water, plant and soil environment throughout the
    cropping season [5]. With advances in Big data analytics, more agricultural systems
    are becoming data-driven for decision-making purposes rather than relying on heuristic
    physics-based models [68]. Sustainable irrigation necessitates the adoption of
    irrigation control strategies that precisely direct irrigation water to the plant''s
    root zone. Boman et al. [11] observed improved water, energy, and fertilizer use
    efficiency when precision irrigation control strategies are implemented. Precision
    irrigation control strategies are divided into two, namely, closed-loop systems
    and open-loop systems. Whereas open-loop systems apply a preset action like in
    simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive feedback from sensors, make
    decisions and implement the resulting findings in the irrigation system [15].
    Several authors have reviewed and classified closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    into three, namely, linear control, intelligent control and optimal control [4,15,23].
    Model predictive control has evolved over the past four decades with advances
    in real-time data measurements and an increase in computational power. Model Predictive
    Control (MPC) refers to a category of advanced computer-controlled algorithms
    that use an explicit process model to predict a plant''s future response [23].
    Developed in the 1960s, Model Predictive Control emanates from optimal control.
    The basic principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to predict system behavior
    and optimize the prediction to decide the control move at the current time [71].
    In addition to its flexibility, Model predictive control repeatedly solves constrained
    optimal control problems online ([57]b). The ability to handle multivariate processes
    and address state and input constraints has made MPC indispensable in modern manufacturing
    industries [23,56,55,70]. In a control problem, the model predictive controller''s
    goal is to compute the plant input to follow the desired reference [60]. MPC uses
    a plant model to predict future plant output behavior and an optimizer that ensures
    that the predicted plant output tracks the desired reference [15,60] MPC has been
    widely studied and applied in processing industries ([4,23,33]; F. [38,52]; L.
    [78]). However, in the agricultural sector, not much has been reported on the
    application of model predictive control in modelling dynamic agricultural systems.
    The most recent review by Ding et al. [23] focused on model predictive control
    applications in agriculture in general. [23] assert that the application of MPC
    to agriculture can yield significant productivity and efficiency benefits despite
    its limited use in the past years. However, no review of data-driven model predictive
    control in precision irrigation applications has been reported. MPC has been applied
    to agriculture, but it has not been applied in all respects. This work builds
    upon existing reviews in the field of agriculture with a particular focus on precision
    irrigation. This review presents an overview of model predictive control in section
    2; data-driven MPC can be done through system identification, machine learning,
    and iterative learning control, as discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents
    the specific application domains of data-driven MPC in irrigation systems. The
    challenges and future perspectives of data-driven MPC are discussed in section
    5. Finally, the conclusion and future research are presented. 2. Overview of model
    predictive control 2.1. Historical perspective of model predictive control The
    concept of model predictive control dates way back in the 1960s to 1970s [66].
    However, MPC found its way into process industries until the 1980s [23]. Since
    then, model predictive control has undergone several stages of development. The
    first stage involves classical model predictive control between 1980 and 1990
    and mainly solves multivariable constraint control problems [52]. As a result
    of the failure to handle nonlinear systems in process industries, improved MPCs
    evolved towards the end of the 20th century giving more computational power with
    an extraordinary ability to handle constraints. This phase saw the continued penetration
    of the commercial MPC algorithms into various industries and a sound theoretical
    foundation for it. In the 1st decade of the 21st century, latest MPC evolved as
    many industries adopted model predictive control [52]. The latest MPC methods
    reduced computation time by decentralizing large-scale problems, reducing computation
    time directly, or simplifying computational processes [23]. The fourth phase has
    seen the evolution of data-driven model predictive control techniques aided by
    machine learning and data science advancements. Table 1 summarizes the different
    types of MPC since 1980. Fig. 1 presents the evolution of model predictive control.

    control. There has been a progression from the past decades in the category of
    systems where model predictive control is applied. Literature has reported a significant
    rise in MPC application in mechanical and electrical systems [52]. Some of the
    application domains include suspension [34], vehicle traction control [12], direct
    injection stratified charge engines [35], Grain drying processes [82], traffic
    management [48], automatic boats for aquaculture [81], modelling temperatures
    in buildings [25], amongst others. This is facilitated by the precedent developments,
    which enable MPC implementation on hardware, making it faster than traditional
    processes. 2.2. Main components of model predictive control The key to effective
    implementation of a control strategy is understanding how model predictive control
    works. Model predictive control has seven essential components (Fig. 2): prediction,
    receding horizon, modelling, performance index, degrees of freedom, constraint
    handling, and multivariable [73]. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download

    the system''s transient and steady-state behavior [73]. Therefore, the prediction
    horizon dictates how far the future state will be predicted. Receding horizon:
    This is the horizon over which system dynamics are predicted. After defining the
    optimal trajectory of the future state, the actual control input to the plant
    only takes the first sample of the control signal, neglecting the rest of the
    trajectory [78]. Modelling: Prediction of a system''s future state requires a
    plant model. A good dynamic model will give a consistent and accurate prediction
    of the future. A mode of the system shows the dependence of the output on the
    current measured variable and the present/future inputs. Performance index: Performance
    index measures the numerical definition of the best input trajectory. Performance
    indices of a model change with time as the system''s internal model gets better
    over time. Performance indices must therefore be realistic and matched with model
    accuracy. Degree of freedom: Degrees of freedom describe the complexity of input
    trajectories. Brownlee [13] defined degree of freedom as the sum of parameters
    in the model that are determined from data. This is inclusive of the coefficients
    of the model and the data used to calculate the error of the model. Constraint
    handling: Model predictive control embeds constraints into the strategy development.
    The proposed input trajectory is optimal while satisfying constraints. The systematic
    embedding of constraint information is critical to effective and robust closed-loop
    behavior. Multivariable: Almost all dynamic systems have numerous inputs and outputs.
    Model predictive control can handle multi-input-multi-output systems (MIMO) systematically.
    In traditional control like Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), it is complex
    to design MIMO systems because limited data about the plant is used in the model
    design, and interaction becomes cumbersome. On the other hand, model predictive
    control algorithms require a model and thus utilize more data, making it easier
    to handle MIMO systems. 2.3. Theoretical formulation of model predictive control
    A model predictive controller is designed based on the state space equation of
    the process dynamics model as described by Rawlings et al. [71]. A state-space
    model is a probabilistic graphical model that describes probabilistic dependence
    between the latent state variable and the observed measurement [16,20]. Model
    predictive control solves an optimal control problem over a receding horizon,
    subject to system constraints, to determine the next control action ([43], 2018).
    The optimization is iterated at each time step, and the control law is updated
    Fig. 3a . Kaiser et al. [44] formulates a receding horizon control problem as
    an open-loop optimization for every time step with an optimal sequence of control
    inputs u (Fig. 3b ) (1) ≔ Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download

    current measurement that minimizes a cost over the prediction horizon , where
    is the timestep of the model. The control horizon is less than or equal to the
    prediction horizon such that then the input u is assumed constant after that.
    The first control value is then applied and the optimization is reinitialized
    and repeated at each subsequent timestep to solve for the unknown sequence . This
    results in an implicit feedback control law. (2) The cost optimization at each
    timestep is described as minimizing a performance index with up to three terms;
    an output penalty, an input penalty, and an input rate penalty; (3) The minimized
    cost function J is subject to constraints on the inputs and outputs; (4) 2.4.
    Data-driven model predictive control Data-driven control systems are broadly classified
    under control systems. The identification of the process model and the design
    of the controller are based entirely on experimental data collected from the plant
    [9]. Learning dynamical systems models from data is a vital challenge in mathematical
    physics, with a rich history dating back as far as the time of Kepler and Newton
    and the discovery of the laws of planetary motion. Initially, modelling of dynamic
    systems relied on a combination of high-quality measurements and expert intuition.
    With vast data and increasing computational power, the automated discovery of
    governing equations and dynamical systems is a new and exciting scientific paradigm.
    Data-driven models require automatic data collection, as they can react in real-time
    to changes in the input variables [31]. The data-driven models’ response can create
    a feedback loop into a larger online system. However, automatic data collection
    is associated with some challenges, and thus, characteristics of big data, namely,
    volume, velocity, variety, value and veracity (5Vs), need to be considered (Fig.
    4). Download : Download high-res image (285KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. The 5Vs of data-driven modelling. 3. System identification System identification
    is a form of machine learning, where an input-output map of a system is learned
    from training data in a representation that generalizes the data that was not
    in the training set [14]. Ljung [53] defined it as the art and science of building
    mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. System
    identification is essential where first principles or physics-based modelling
    of the system is not possible. Here, nothing is known about the system dynamics,
    also known as the black-box approach. Data is used to learn a mathematic model
    that mimics the input-output relationship using a model structure that represents
    the system behavior and parameter selection for fitting the data. A better understanding
    of the model is achieved with system identification, and future prediction becomes
    easy. Fig. 5 represents a flowchart for a system identification process Download

    System identification process. System identification can be done for linear systems,
    nonlinear systems and online and recursive systems. 3.1. Nonlinear system identification
    for control Powerful model-based control techniques like linear optimal control
    and model predictive control are aided by data-driven techniques that characterize
    the input-output dynamics from observed measurements without relying on first
    principles modelling. Nonlinear systems identification is made possible due to
    high computing power and powerful data-driven techniques. Once a low order model
    of the input-output dynamics from actuation u to measurements y and a full state
    x of the system is measured, then identification of dynamics f is made possible
    that satisfy (5) This then is discretized since data is collected in time steps
    and control laws are digitally implemented. This state dynamics then becomes.
    (6) 3.2. Online and recursive system identification Online systems identification
    means that the algorithm is running during the operation of the physical system.
    Online system identification algorithms estimate the parameters and states of
    a system model as data is obtained in real-time or near real-time from measuring
    devices [24]. Referring to the agro-hydrologic balance equation, the process dynamics
    of the system can be described as one with three inputs, rainfall, irrigation,
    and crop evapotranspiration and one output, soil moisture, as shown in Fig. 6.
    The process dynamics model assumes that deep percolation in an irrigated agricultural
    system is proportional to soil moisture. Download : Download high-res image (144KB)

    a discrete model for the soil moisture. (8) Where is the sampling interval The
    discrete-time dynamics then can be written as, (9) Where; is the crop coefficient
    and varies according to the crop growth stage. A soil model can be developed over
    time by updating the model parameters each time step. For example, the algorithm
    could measure irrigation and compare it with the predicted irrigation amount to
    produce a prediction error. An online algorithm adjusts the model parameters to
    reduce the error. In the next step, a new set of measurements is recorded and
    compared with the model prediction. An error is again obtained and added to the
    old measurements and the process repeats itself. Online system identification
    is crucial where the model parameters are time-variant, especially as is the case
    for the weather parameters in the crop evapotranspiration model. 4. Machine learning
    control Machine learning is a rapidly developing field transforming our ability
    to learn and characterize dynamic systems [14]. Machine learning makes the control
    of complex, nonlinear systems possible because of its high dimensional, nonlinear
    and optimization techniques [26]. For example, given a schematic in Fig. 7 with
    high dimensional dynamics with external disturbances to achieve a high-level objective
    function. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Schematic of machine learning control. The objective is to design
    a controller based on sensor measurements of the system that can then drive the
    system through actuation. Examples of machine learning methods include genetic
    algorithms, genetic programming, reinforcement learning and adaptive neural networks
    (Fig. 8). These machine learning algorithms use biological principles like neural
    networks, evolutional algorithms, and reinforcement learning. Detailed information

    of machine learning control. 5. Iterative learning control Iterative learning
    control (ILC) is an efficient technique used to improve the performance of transient
    systems that operate repetitively [79]. The aim of ILC is to improve the transient
    response through input adjustment based on observed errors. A standard iterative
    learning control scheme assumes stable dynamics, and the system returns to the
    same initial conditions at the start of each trial of the same length. A schematic
    of data-driven iterative learning control is presented in Fig. 9 [65]. Download

    Iterative learning control process. An Iterative Learning Control takes the form
    (10) Where;  = input to the system during the kth repetition,  = tracking error
    during the kth repetition and  = design parameter representing operations on  .
    There has to be a convergence of the input signals as k becomes large. This will
    ensure perfect tracking through the iteration process. The rate of convergence
    represents the desirable need for a rapid iterative learning process. Despite
    the uncertainty about the process dynamics, good algorithm performance is desirable.
    The operation   ranges from simple scalar gains to sophisticated optimization
    computations and is necessary to achieve design objectives. 5.1. Applications
    of data-driven model predictive control in precision irrigation management Owing
    to the similarity of agricultural processes to industrial processes, model predictive
    control has been applied in product processing, agricultural production, greenhouses
    and irrigation systems [23]. For example, model predictive control has been applied
    in canal flow control and regulation, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential
    regulation, soil moisture regulation and precipitation and evapotranspiration
    prediction. 5.2. Irrigation canal flow control and regulation Model predictive
    control has found applicability to canal flow control and gate operation. The
    management objective of MPC for irrigation canals is to keep the water levels
    as close to the setpoints as possible [45]. Therefore, a suitable model representing
    the canal water level dynamic is needed. Furthermore, the models need to be set
    up in such a way that they contain the appropriate dynamics of the water system
    for water level regulation. In this regard, MPC has been applied to model the
    behavior of the water movement in the open channel, maintaining certain water
    levels at various locations and the water flows that influence these water levels
    [29,30,63,79,80,84]. Control structures are used to manipulate the water flows,
    through which the controller can achieve the management objective [45]. However,
    achieving this objective is not straightforward, as some varying inflows and outflows
    disturb the water system. To predict the future water levels and flows as a result
    of disturbances and control actions, the water system (canal reaches, structures,
    disturbances, controller) needs to be modelled. Fig. 10 depicts a typical irrigation
    canal with water flowing by gravity and different offtakes along the canal reach.

    equations Eqs. (11) and (12) accurately describe the water flow dynamics in the
    irrigation canal. (11) (12) Where; y is the depth of water in m, T the top width
    of the canal at the water surface in m, Q is the water flow rate in the canal
    m3/s, x is the longitudinal distance on the flow direction in m, q the lateral
    outflow per unit length of the channel in m2/s, v the velocity in m/s, A is the
    wetted cross-sectional area, g the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2), so
    the channel bottom slope and sf is the friction slip of the irrigation canal.
    Several scholars have used model predictive control in controlling irrigation
    canal flows. Puig et al. [70] used model predictive control to generate flow control
    strategies from the water source to the consumer and irrigation areas in the Guadiana
    River. The results showed effectiveness in the use of model predictive control.
    Zhang et al. [83] designed a non-cooperative distributed model predictive control
    algorithm based on Nash optimality for water level regulation in irrigation canals.
    The system simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
    To effectively deliver canal flow without fluctuations, Han & Qiao [39]; Hashemy
    et al. [41,40]combined model predictive control with online water storage to compensate
    for an existing time delay and avoid wave disturbances. The results showed significant
    improvement for canal operations employing automation. Recently, Kong et al. [50]
    used model predictive control toolbox to control gate interval and water level.
    The authors tested it on a simulation model of an irrigation canal in Beijing
    consisting of 13 cascaded canal pools. The authors affirmed that model predictive
    control is a useful control strategy for gate opening at different intervals [49].
    6. Irrigation scheduling Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the
    frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water to apply to meet the crop
    water requirements [59]. In conventional irrigation systems, irrigation scheduling
    is determined through experience, observation, and heuristic methods. On the other
    hand, precision irrigation systems rely on feedback from sensing devices. Irrigation
    scheduling can be achieved through weather-based, soil-based, or plant-based approaches.
    Precision irrigation systems aim at spatio-temporal irrigation scheduling depending
    on weather, soil, and plant physiological characteristics [3]. Model predictive
    control is used to perform irrigation scheduling using real-time field data to
    calibrate a crop and soil model and then using the calibrated model to determine
    optimum irrigation schedules [61]. Plant and soil real-time measurements are crucial
    to calibrate the model during the growing stages of the crop as irrigation advances.
    Considering the soil moisture balance model, the plant input is the irrigation
    amount, whereas the plant output is the soil moisture deficit. The crop evapotranspiration
    and precipitation values are considered disturbances as they cannot be controlled.
    Delgoda et al. [22], Lozoya et al. [56], and Saleem et al. [74] used model predictive
    control to predict the frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water using
    a soil moisture dynamics model. The authors used a combined mechanistic and data-driven
    modelling approach to describe the dynamics of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    using sensing devices for real-time feedback to the control algorithm. However,
    the authors neglected the effect of precipitation and crop water use on the system
    dynamics. Delgoda et al. [21] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above model
    predictive control framework. The authors employed a disturbance affine feedback
    control approach and uncertainty modelling techniques to account for the dynamic
    nature of rainfall and crop water use. Moreover, the study reported optimal system
    performance in a humid region where considerable uncertainties in climate variables
    existed. Recently, Abioye, Abidin, Aman, et al. [2] and Abioye, Abidin, Mahmud,
    et al. [2] used a data-driven model predictive control to schedule irrigation
    in a greenhouse irrigation experiment. The authors used Laguerre functions in
    order to reduce the computation complexity brought about by input constraints.
    6.1. Stem water potential regulation Another important aspect in precision irrigation
    management is the soil water potential. It determines the ease with which plants
    can extract water from the soil. Soil water potential is a measure of the energy
    status of the soil water relative to that of water at a standard reference [59].
    On the other hand, stem water potential (SWP) is the direct measure of water tension
    within the plant [75]. Suter et al. suggested that plant moisture status needs
    to be determined through SWP measurements rather than the soil moisture content.
    Chen et al. [18] developed a stem water potential model using data-driven model
    predictive control to help reduce uncertainty in weather forecast errors. The
    authors formulated a state-space model that captures water dynamics in a plant-root-soil
    system. The water status of the system was modelled by monitoring water flow in
    the soil, root and plant system. Precipitation in the system was the water inflow,
    and evapotranspiration was the driving force in the system. The state-space model
    was linearized to reduce the computation burden caused by robust nonlinear optimization.
    The authors used the formulation of a robust optimal control problem that maintained
    stem water potential within certain limits. The authors reported a 7.9% reduction
    in the water consumption in almond trees using data-driven robust model predictive
    control. 6.2. Soil moisture regulation Irrigation aims to maintain the root zone
    soil moisture between field capacity and the permanent wilting point (Fig. 10).
    When the soil moisture goes above the field capacity, the soil becomes saturated,
    and below the wilting point, the plant experiences water stress and eventually
    dies. Management allowable depletion of 50% is adopted for most irrigation designs
    to ensure that the available moisture does not get depleted before irrigation
    occurs. This available moisture in the root zone depends on the plant''s effective
    root zone. Model predictive control has been used to minimize root zone soil moisture
    and irrigation amounts within a specific threshold or at specific set points [22,55,62].
    However, recent studies argue that a zone needs to be considered rather than a
    reference set point to ensure maximum water extraction from the root zone. The
    aim should be to regulate the soil moisture within the readily available moisture
    zone. Mao et al. [57c] proposed a methodical approach to system identification
    and root zone model predictive control design for soil moisture control of agro-hydrological
    systems. First, the authors simulated the soil water dynamics of the field from
    a mechanistic soil-water balance model. The model consisted of a nonlinear partial
    differential equation with source and sink terms characterizing the root water
    extraction, evaporation and transpiration, precipitation, and irrigation. A linear
    parameter varying model was identified based on the input and output data of the
    soil-water balance model, which was then used for zone model predictive control
    design. The authors report a satisfactory approximation of the soil moisture dynamics
    and the designed zone model predictive control suitability. 6.3. Precipitation
    and evapotranspiration prediction One of the challenges in precision irrigation
    management is the scarcity of climate data. Precision irrigation requires real-time
    data to aid in irrigation decisions. In developed countries, prediction systems
    are used to predict future weather events, and this data is availed to farmers
    for irrigation management decisions. In the absence of such, there is a need to
    bridge the gap using model predictive control to quantity the sources of uncertainty
    in the soil moisture dynamics model. To address this, Guo and You [37] used a
    novel data-driven local precipitation and evapotranspiration prediction by implementing
    an artificial neuro-network (ANN). It was embedded in the model predictive control
    toolbox and updated in real-time to formulate the dynamic uncertainty set to account
    for weather prediction errors in the irrigation control system. The authors reported
    effective control of the root zone soil moisture. A summary of studies conducted
    in the different application domains is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary

    and future perspectives of data-driven modelling in smart irrigation Data collection
    that is representative of the real dynamic system is challenging. When more data
    is provided, machine learning can be used in data-driven modelling to fit data
    and make predictions when more data is required. Some of the challenges encountered
    in data collection are discussed in this section. One of the major challenges
    affecting precision irrigation is the high cost of obtaining data in irrigation
    systems. To develop a data-driven model for smart irrigation, data about the soil,
    plant, and environment need to be monitored. Plant sensors need to monitor the
    physiological processes in plant-like crop water use. The different growth stages
    and their effect on the crop factors need to be established. The climatic factors
    that affect the rate of evapotranspiration need to be monitored in real-time,
    otherwise relying on historical data that is not representative of the real system.
    The data collection strategies and control methods are discussed in [4,15]. The
    challenges relating to data availability range from sampling frequency, incomplete
    data, sensor malfunction, working conditions, communication exceptions or database
    shutdown. This can affect the integrity of the experimental dataset collected,
    thereby resulting in poor model development. In addition, developing models from
    data requires capturing a large volume of data to represent the real systems and
    capture any variations. For example, in irrigation, the components of the agro-hydrological
    model vary from time to time. This variation must be captured, which makes the
    data collection process time-consuming. This may involve monitoring the dynamics
    for the entire season or year to get a representative model for the dynamics.
    Predictions are a key feature of data-driven models for irrigation optimization
    and intelligent decision-making. System boundaries define the capability of data-driven
    models. If the data is only a subsection of the field, the model may fail to make
    accurate predictions for an entire irrigation field. Therefore, it is pertinent
    to define the system boundaries and ensure model data development extends to the
    boundaries ensuring that only predictions made from the model boundaries are acted
    upon. The application of model predictive control in irrigation is still limited
    compared to processing industries. Large water and irrigation systems must reduce
    computation times and now incorporate data-driven model predictive control. In
    the future, there''s a need to model soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems as past studies stopped at simulation or implemented in a controlled environment
    agricultural system where disturbances to the model are minimized. Model predictive
    control can be applied to diverse aspects of precision agriculture to enhance
    agricultural productivity in the future. These application domains include aquaponics,
    hydroponics, viticulture, controlled environment agriculture, aquaculture, disease
    and pest control, and mechanization systems. 7. Conclusion Data-driven modelling
    in agriculture is on the rise due to the advancement of Internet of Things technologies
    and improved computational power. This article presents an overview of model predictive
    control over the past four decades, and data-driven model predictive control is
    discussed. From the review, model predictive control has been used in precision
    irrigation management, ranging from irrigation canal control, irrigation scheduling,
    stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation, and precipitation prediction
    and evapotranspiration. It is noted that for data-driven MPC to solve complex
    dynamic systems in irrigation, the availability of data, variability, boundary
    conditions and model evaluation must be harmonized for one to come up with a good
    representative model of the system. There is more research opportunity to explore
    on the application of data-driven modelling and controller development for predictive
    irrigation management. 8. Author contributions Conceptualization, EB; methodology,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Atlanta, GA, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    According to a U.S. Geological Survey report, agriculture is a major user of ground
    and surface water in the U.S., and irrigation accounted for 42 percent of the
    Nation’s total freshwater withdrawals in 2015 [1]. Water stress is the largest
    contributor to crop loss, and low water availability affects approximately 45
    percent of the U.S. land surfaces [2]. At the same time, drought has been increasing
    in intensity and frequency in the U.S. [3]. Agricultural production increasingly
    requires water inputs to sustain high crop productivity in a changing climate.
    However, the current agricultural water use is not sustainable in many parts of
    the U.S. In the Central High Plain regions alone, about 30 percent of the water
    stored in Ogallala Aquifer has already been consumed. At current use rates, as
    much as 80 percent of the stored aquifer water will have been consumed by 2060
    [4]. The southeast region has experienced several large droughts since 2000. During
    the 2016 drought, 98% of Alabama, 68% of Georgia, and 100% of Mississippi by area
    were classified by the U.S. Drought Monitor as being in severe drought or worse.
    Irrigation has been increased by 60% in Alabama and 56% in Georgia since 1998,
    the largest increases among the 31 Eastern States [5]. Driven by the above factors,
    research on irrigation optimization and management has drawn increasing interests
    in recent years [6]–[10]. In particular, model predictive control (MPC) has been
    widely studied as a real-time irrigation control method [7]–[11]. In these studies,
    the system is usually modeled by a soil water balance approach, which models the
    water balance around the plant root-zone [12]. As shown in Figure 1, precipitation
    (rain), irrigation and capillary rise contribute to the inflows of the water balance,
    while evapotranspiration, runoff, and deep percolation contribute to the outflows.
    Either soil moisture content, or the difference between plant water demand and
    the actual soil moisture content (a.k.a., soil moisture deficit) has been used
    as the control target in existing research [10], [11]. When soil water balance
    model is used, it is necessary to know the effective values of precipitation,
    irrigation and crop evapotranspiration. Where there are field data available,
    these parameters can be estimated based on system identification principles [8],
    [13]. However, when field data are not available, these parameters are often assumed
    to be 1’s [7], [11]. Since they are affected by both soil and crop types, in this
    work, we use a crop simulator, namely the decision support system for agrotechnology
    transfer (DSSAT) [14], to improve the system model without field data, and to
    more realistically evaluate the performance of different irrigation control strategies.
    DSSAT simulates dynamic growth, development and yield of a crop over time in single
    or multiple seasons at any location. It incorporates models of over 42 different
    crops (as of Version 4.7.5) and considers weather, genetics, soil water, soil
    carbon and nitrogen, and management [14], [15]. DSSAT and its crop simulation
    models have been used for a wide range of applications at different spatial and
    temporal scales. In this work, under different irrigation control schemes, DSSAT
    is utilized to compute soil moisture content, crop growth, development and yield
    trajectories for a maize field in Piracicaba (Brazil) with soil, genetics, and
    weather data (in the year of 2002) provided in DSSAT. The simulator outputs are
    utilized to evaluate the water use efficiencies (WUE), which is defined as the
    yield over the total amount of irrigation, of these schemes. Figure. 1 Basic water
    balance model (Adapted from [10]) Show All SECTION II. Preliminaries A. Hydrological
    balance The following hydrological balance or soil water balance has been widely
    used in many irrigation control applications dθ dt =ir(t)+rf(t)+cr(t)−e t c (t)−dp(t)
    −ro(t) (1) View Source where θ is soil moisture level, reflecting water inflow
    and outflow terms on the right-hand side. Irrigation (ir), rainfall (rf), and
    capillary rise (cr) contribute to the inflows of the water balance; while crop
    evapotranspiration (etc), deep percolation (dp), and run-off (ro) contribute to
    the outflows of the water balance. t is the daily-basis time step in this problem.
    Several terms in Eqn. (1) can be neglected with proper assumptions such as the
    field condition, climate condition, weather, and soil properties. In this work,
    capillary rise (cr) is neglected. Deep percolation (dp), and run-off (ro) are
    assumed to be proportional to soil moisture level (θ). The precipitation or rainfall
    (rf) itself will be constrained to further address runoff and deep percolation
    by considering the field capacity (illustrated in Figure 1), where soil moisture
    level will have an upper limit as a constraint in the model. This concept is also
    utilized in DSSAT [14]. With these simplifications, the soil moisture balance
    equation can be expressed as dθ dt =ir(t)+rf(t)−e t c (t)−cθ (2) View Source where
    c is the deep percolation and run-off coefficient. Weather data from the simulation
    site (Piracicaba, Brazil) for the year of 2002 have been taken from DSSAT for
    the crop growth simulation. Evapotranspiration is assumed to be under the scenario
    that sufficient water is supplied to the field during the growth season, which
    is called potential evapotranspiration in DSSAT. The value is to be averaged in
    daily basis. As a result, the rainfall and average potential evapotranspiration
    data from the DSSAT are used as the system disturbance while simulating the closed-loop
    MPC controller throughout the growth season. B. State Space Model and MPC The
    simplified soil moisture balance in the previous section, Eqn. (2), is discretized
    to make a linear time invariant (LTI) state space model. Under Euler method, the
    discretized model is expressed as follows θ( k i +1)=(1−c)θ( k i )+ir( k i )+rf(
    k i ) −e t c ( k i ) (3) View Source Equation (3) is further changed for notational
    simplicity, x m ( k i +1)=(1−c)A x m ( k i )+ B u u( k i ) + B d d( k i ) y( k
    i )=C x m ( k i ) (4) (5) View Source where d( k i )= [P( k i )E( k i )] T ,ir(
    k i )=u( k i ), B d =[1−1] and ki refers to time steps in the discretized model.
    To develop an MPC controller, this discretized model is to be augmented to embed
    integrators in the state space model. x(ki) is current soil moisture level and
    u(ki) is the optimized irrigation solution from MPC. rf and etc are considered
    as the system disturbances. The augmented state space model is constructed with
    an embedded integrator [16], [17]. With the following difference Δ x m ( k i +1)≜
    x m ( k i +1)− x m ( k i ) (7) View Source the new state space, in the form of
    vector matrix, is introduced to construct an augmented state space model, which
    is used in MPC design, x( k i )= [Δ x m ( k i )y( k i )] T (8) View Source Using
    this new state vector expression, the discrete LTI model can be written as the
    following augmented state space model x( k i +1)=Ax+BΔu( k i )+ B d d( k i ) y(k)=Cx(
    k i ) A=[ 1 1 0 1 ],B=[ 1 1 ], B d =[ 1 1 −1 −1 ], C=[ 0 1 ] (9) (10) (11) View
    Source The augmented state space model, Eqn. (9)-(11), uses measured disturbances
    d (ki) from DSSAT. Based on the control horizon Nc, the MPC model predicts the
    future trajectory of irrigation plan as well as constrained soil moisture level.
    In this work, the control horizon is 5 days, the augmented state space model considers
    5 days predicted precipitation and evapotranspiration as measured disturbances
    and updates the next input signal to calculate the next day soil moisture level
    in a receding horizon manner, as shown in Eqn. (12). Y=Fx( k i )+ΦΔU+ΨΔD Y= [y(

    and xmax are the wilting point and field capacity respectively based on the soil
    property from DSSAT. The minimal value of irrigation (Imin) is set to be 0 mm
    and the maximum amount of irrigation (Imax) is 13mm per day. Precipitation has
    been constrained with respect to the upper limit and lower limit of soil water
    uptake. Evapotranspiration has been collected from DSSAT assuming the sufficient
    water supply for crop growth is guaranteed during the growth stage, which is measured
    as potential evapotranspiration from DSSAT. Some remarks on the implementation
    of the MPC controller are summarized as follows. The initial state is assumed
    to be known or measurable – the initial state from DSSAT is used to compute future
    input signals. The deep percolation and run-off coefficient is tuned to address
    the runoff and deep percolation such that the soil moisture trajectory calculated
    based on Eqn. (2)-(4) are consistent with the DSSAT soil moisture trajectory.
    SECTION III. Case Study In this work, DSSAT is utilized to compute soil moisture
    content, crop growth, development and yield trajectories for a maize field in
    Piracicaba (Brazil) with soil, genetics, and weather data (in the year of 2002)
    provided in DSSAT. Figure 2 shows the precipitation and evapotranspiration data,
    which are used as the measured disturbances. Figure. 2 Precipitation and potential
    evapotranspiration from DSSAT at the selected simulation site of Piracivaba, Brazil
    for the year of 2002 Show All Two irrigation control scenarios are designed. In
    the first scenario (MPC1), a constant set-point soil moisture level is used as
    the reference for MPC to track while minimizing the input signal within each prediction
    horizon. The reference soil moisture level is set to 430mm based on the initial
    conditions from DSSAT. The second scenario (MPC2) exploits stepwise set-point
    trajectory for MPC to track. The crop growing stages are roughly divided into
    three different stages for maize: germination to floral initiation (30days), silking
    to beginning of grain filling (60days), and middling of grain filling to maturity
    (30days). In each stage, the gradual increase in crop water demand is satisfied
    by maintaining each corresponding soil moisture level. The initial environmental
    conditions, such as soil properties, soil moisture level, are obtained from DSSAT
    using its built-in function Xbuild. The default crop management and initial environmental
    conditions are used for the simulation except three different irrigation strategies
    – MPC1, MPC2, and default rule-based irrigation from DSSAT. The input signal (i.e.,
    the optimal irrigation strategy) and output signal (i.e., the soil moisture level)
    for MPC1 and MPC2 are showed in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. The precipitation
    has been scaled to consider both runoff and deep percolation during the optimization.
    Figure. 3 Output (top) and input together with disturbances (bottom) for MPC with
    constant set-point tracking (MPC1) Show All Figure. 4 Output (top) and input together
    with disturbances (bottom) for MPC with stepwise set-point tracking (MPC2) Show
    All Figure. 5 Cumulative effective irrigation amount from three different plans:
    Default from DSSAT, MPC1 and MPC2. Show All For the first scenario with a constant
    set-point (MPC1), the total amount of effective irrigation is 156 mm after scaling
    with an irrigation efficiency factor [19]. The efficiency factor is set to 90%
    based on the default irrigation management setting of DSSAT. For MPC2, the total
    effective irrigation is 260 mm. The cumulative effective irrigation amounts are
    shown in Figure 5 where the default irrigation plan from DSSAT (with total effective
    irrigation of 274 mm) is also shown. It can be seen that MPC2 provides similar
    irrigation as the DSSAT default plan, except that at the beginning MPC2 irrigate
    significantly more in order to track the moisture set-point, while MPC1 almost
    stopped irrigation after 65 days after sowing (DAS). As a result, MPC1 requires
    significantly less water than MPC2 and DSSAT default. The soil moisture trajectories
    from DSSAT based on the three irrigation strategies are shown in Figure 6. Since
    MPC-based optimal irrigation trajectories shown in Figures 3 and 4 are fundamentally
    originated from the simplified LTI state space model (i.e., Eqn. (4)), there are
    discrepancies between the soil moisture trajectories of MPC1 and MPC2 in Figure
    6, which are DSSAT simulated, and the soil moisture trajectories in Figures 3
    and 4, which are calculated based on Eqn. (4). However, it can be seen that with
    proper deep percolation and run-off coefficient in Eqn.(4) and reference set-point,
    the system model agrees with the DSSAT simulator relatively well without other
    historical information. Figure. 6 Soil moisture levels from DSSAT with three different
    irrigation plans: Default from DSSAT, MPC1 and MPC2. Show All Table I Yield Productivity
    The crop productivity indexes under the three different irrigation plans have
    been measured through the simulation of DSSAT. These results about crop growth
    are shown in Figure 7. Before the silking stage is finished, the grain weight
    (Figure 7, top) is not measurable. After day 65, all three different irrigation
    plans show very similar growth trajectories. Only after day 103, the constant
    set-point tracking MPC1 is showing a slower grain weight growth compared to the
    other irrigation plans. At the harvest point, the grain weights are 4979 kg/ha,
    4624 kg/ha, and 4960 kg/ha for DSSAT default, MPC1, and MPC2 respectively. Vegetative
    weight (defined as the sum of stem and root weights, Figure 7, middle) shows exponential
    growth during floral and silking stages and reaches maximum values of 5297 kg/ha,
    5326 kg/ha, and 5331 kg/ha for DSSAT, MPC1, and MPC2 respectively. For the biomass
    (Figure 7, bottom), the three different crop simulations show similar trajectories,
    only separated right before reaching maturity and harvest stage. 12084 kg/ha,
    11712 kg/ha, 12138 kg/ha of biomass have been produced from DSSAT default, MPC1,
    and MPC2 respectively. When the crop only relying on the precipitation (i.e.,
    rainfed) during the growing season, the maize yield at the end of simulation is
    measured as 1192 kg/ha. These results are summarized in Table I. In order to compare
    the irrigation efficiency, the following relative productivity is defined. Y ¯
    = Y irrigation − Y rainfall i r e (20) View Source where Yirrigation is the yield
    (i.e., the grain weight) under different irrigation plans; Yrainfall is the yield
    with rainfall only (i.e., no irrigation). ire is the effective irrigation amount
    under different irrigation plans. The relative productivities of the three different
    irrigation plans are shown in Table I. It can be seen that both MPC1 and MPC2
    outperform DSSAT default in terms of relative productivity. However, the relative
    productivity does not take into account the price factors of the grain vs. water.
    Therefore, although MPC1 leads to the highest relative productivity, it may not
    be the best plan economically. On the other hand, it would be challenging to put
    a price tag on the long-term environmental and sustainability impacts of irrigation
    water usage. Figure. 7 DSSAT simulated grain weight, vegetative (root + stem)
    weight, and biomass under the three different irrigation plans (the results of
    DSSAT and MPC2 overlap each other most of the time). Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion
    In this work, the DSSAT crop simulator is utilized to evaluate the performances
    of two MPC irrigation control schemes in comparison to the parametric rule-based
    irrigation plan from DSSAT which uses historical weather data, soil information,
    and detailed crop management and genetics. It is shown that although the MPC model
    does not consider the water stress for the crop, which DSSAT uses for the rule-based
    irrigation plan, with a careful determination of a growth-stage-based moisture
    trajectory as the set-point, MPC can achieve similar crop yield with less total
    irrigation water amount. There are several limitations of this work. For example,
    the uncertainties in the disturbances are not considered. In addition, the discrepancy
    between the system model and the simulator is not truly resolved. These limitations
    should be addressed in the future work. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: Rapid urbanization and climate change exacerbate water scarcity. Thus,
    irrigation conservation is an important endeavor in food security. Conservation
    efforts have centered on the ability to monitor and manage the amount of water
    in rice fields. In this framework, there have been advances in simple rule-based
    irrigation scheme such as safe alternate wetting and drying (Safe-AWD). Safe-AWD
    provides a robust rule set that mitigates yield reduction due to the decrease
    in irrigation. However, the extent of the adverse effects from induced drought
    stress are often hard to predict across different factor combinations of crop
    variety, environment, and management practices. In this light, the integration
    of crop models offers additional precision in the amount of irrigation for specific
    conditions. Moreover, the availability of crop models allows the use of methods
    in control theory for irrigation management. In particular, Model Predictive Control
    (MPC) is robust and able to handle multi-objective and practical real world constraints.
    Importantly, it has been studied for irrigation set point tracking in water balance
    based models (WB-MPC). Thus to address variable crop response, this work augments
    MPC irrigation with a crop model to track growth trajectories of biomass, leaf
    area index, and grain formation throughout the planting season (CG-MPC). Presented
    are simulations that compare irrigation management techniques - namely traditional
    ponding, Safe-AWD, WB-MPC, and CG-MPC. Based on water savings and yield reduction,
    results show that Safe-AWD has the greatest irrigation conservation while WB-MPC
    and CG-MPC can be designed to have comparable water usage. However, CG-MPC produced
    the best yield reduction and has minimal variance across different field scenario
    simulations. This presents design opportunities for tuning risk trade-offs between
    yield reduction and water savings.

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. INTRODUCTION Agricultural crops rely on some amount
    of water supply to produce profitable yield. However, securing this water supply
    is becoming more difficult with the onset of climate change and rapid urbanization
    [1]. Thus, there have been efforts to develop technologies that reduce water usage
    for agricultural consumption while mitigating the adverse effect on crop yields.
    The application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the agricultural crop industry
    aims to improve water efficiency and has gained popularity in recent years [2],
    [3]. The IoT approach utilizes on-site field sensors, off-site environmental sensors,
    or a combination of both to determine precise timings in irrigation. Field sensors
    such as water level sensors, moisture content, and soil water potential have been
    deployed to determine proper irrigation management [4], [5]. Environmental sensors
    that estimate evaporation and crop transpiration or evapotranspiration are also
    used to calculate overall water demand in the field [6], [7]. With the availability
    of these sensor information, crucial decision points on when and how much to irrigate
    can be determined precisely. For this work, we focus on rice for the study of
    irrigation control with sensors as it is considered the most water intensive crop.
    Due to this biological property, the traditional method of achieving the characterized
    optimal rice yield is to maintain ponded water. However, there can be substantial
    water savings using two approaches. One approach is the use of weather forecasts
    in advance control methods such as model predictive control (MPC) [8], [9], [10].
    Another approach is to empirically characterize the physiological mechanisms of
    crop growth in a simple rule based irrigation management technique called alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) [11]. This study designs crop growth dynamics in an MPC
    framework combining the principles of the two aforementioned water saving approaches.
    There are two main contributions. First, we present crop growth models in an MPC
    framework and numerical relaxations for tractability. Second, we simulate and
    compare the performance of different irrigation management techniques with the
    proposed MPC framework. By integrating crop growth dynamics into the MPC framework,
    our results indicate greater precision in mitigating the adverse effects of reduced
    water consumption across different fields and seasons. A. Crop growth Experimental
    studies on irrigation management have shown that there can be intermittent drying
    periods with small to medium effect on yield production depending on the intensity
    and duration of the drying event [12]. A conservative variant called ’Safe-AWD’
    was developed to take into account crop growth characteristics to minimize yield
    reduction [13]. Safe-AWD in rice allows for water to subside in the field up to
    15cm below the soil surface. Supplemental rules require to suspend AWD and revert
    to ponded irrigation at certain phases in the crop development to minimize crop
    drought stress. This ponding event should be implemented at the beginning of sowing
    and during the middle of panicle formation phase of crop growth. These ponded
    timings are crucial points where the crops growth efforts are focused in creating
    organs for maximal crop yield. There are also points in crop growth where the
    crop gradually become less drought sensitive. This occurs right before flowering
    and a few weeks before grain harvest. There are complex interacting growth dynamics
    as well. For example, the later phases will require slowing down leaf growth to
    prioritize grain growth [14]. These qualitative descriptions of crop growth are
    important to note as they will be useful in validating results of different irrigation
    schemes. While the rules of Safe-AWD capture best practices, the challenge is
    to contextualize crop drought stress and water savings in a mechanistic viewpoint.
    And there have been several works that present rice growth models. These rice
    crop growth models commonly describe systems of equations for leaf, biomass, and
    grain formation [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, they are too complex and often
    reserved for exploratory studies on crop management and not real time control
    such as MPC. In contrast, this work presents crop growth models derived from system
    identification techniques to be used in MPC. B. MPC in Irrigation MPC is a robust
    controller that can accommodate well defined system constraints and multi-objective
    decision making. Using a combination of on-site and off-site sensors, MPC has
    been applied in precision irrigation. But these utilize water balance model that
    only consider water supply and demand in the field [14]. The objective is to track
    a desired amount of water in the soil. The model does not account for the physiological
    effects undergone by the crop under such irrigation decisions. Our work differs
    in this aspect as the use of both crop growth and water balance model allows for
    design trade-offs between water savings and yield reduction. C. Outline Sect.
    II describes crop growth and water balance model to be used in an optimization
    problem for MPC. Sect. III presents our experimental methdology. Next, Sect. IV
    compares the performance of our crop growth MPC (CG-MPC) with water balance based
    MPC (WB-MPC), Safe-AWD benchmarked with traditional ponded irrigation. We conclude
    with Sect. V, which summarizes the impact of the study and future works. SECTION
    II. Models for Irrigation In this section, we present the crop growth model and
    the water balance model. We discuss linear approximations for characteristics
    of growth dynamics. The overall MPC problem is presented as a mixed-integer quadratic
    programming (MIQP). A. Crop Growth Model Crop growth variables leaf area index,
    biomass, and grain yield formation are used to build the model. While crop growth
    is often characterized as a non-linear equation, it can be approximated by piece-wise
    linear dynamic equations separated by growth phases [19]. There are four main
    phases in rice development namely; basic vegetative phase (BVP), photosensitive
    phase (PSP), panicle formation phase (PFP), and grain filling phase (GFP). These
    phases indicate a particular point in crop growth where important organs are developed
    and has significant changes in the growth trajectory of the crop [20]. To standardize
    varying growth rates across different combinations of genetic varieties and environmental
    conditions, a quantitative developmental stage index (DVS) is used. From seedling
    to harvest, DVS values ranges from 0.0 to 2.0. Each phase will switch to the next
    once a certain value of DVS is reached. Then, it is translated back to its equivalent
    in days after seedling emergence. For brevity, we will only mention that DVS index
    is determined using weather data and a set of pre-determined parameters specific
    to a crop variety. This index can be pre-computed in a rice growth simulation
    software. [18] In each variable, the dynamic growth equations have the same model
    structure. The parameters of each dynamic equation differ for each stage k. The
    growth dynamics are described as follows, LA I i+1 BI M i+1 Gr Y i+1 = a k 0 +
    a k 1 ⋅LA I i + a k 2 ⋅BI M i + a k 3 ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + a k 4 ⋅ D i  for k=1,2,3,4
    = b k 0 + b k 1 ⋅LA I i + b k 2 ⋅BI M i + b k 3 ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + b k 4 ⋅ D i  for
    k=1,2,3,4 = c k 0 + c k 1 ⋅LA I i + c k 2 ⋅BI M i + c k 3 ⋅Gr Y i + c k 4 ⋅ D
    i  for k=3,4 (1) (2) (3) View Source where i is time in days. The model parameters
    are a k i , b k i ,and c k i where k = 1, 2, 3, 4 represent BVP, PSP, PFP, and
    GFP respectively. Eq. (1) models Leaf Area Index (LAI) which describes the canopy
    density of the crop. LAI is a dimensionless variable with range 0-10 indicating
    the ratio of leaf area over ground area. Eq. (2) models biomass (BIM) which is
    the weight of plant material per area (Kg/ha). Eq.(3) models grain formation per
    area (GrY , in Kg/ha), the endpoint of which is the overall crop yield. Note that
    (3) is present only when the crop developmental phases are at PFP and GFP. Solar
    radiation (Rad, MJ/hr) is an external variable acquired from the meteorological
    data on the field’s location. The interaction between leaf area index and solar
    radiation (LAI·Rad) relates biomass acquired from photosynthesis by the crop canopy.
    Lastly, D (mm) is water deficit referenced at the soil surface. Parameters a k
    4 , b k 4 , and  c k 4 specifically translate this water deficit to stress in
    the growth equations. B. Water Balance Model The soil water balance equation accounts
    for water that is coming in and out of the field and is dictated by the dynamic
    equation, W i+1 = W i + I i + R i −E T i − P i (4) View Source where W is the
    water level (mm), I is the amount of irrigation applied (mm), R is the amount
    rain (mm), ET is the evapotranspiration (mm), and P is percolation (mm). Here,
    we disregard runoff which is the amount of water spilled over when water level
    exceeds the height of constructed field bund. The scenario is unlikely to happen
    under mild drought conditions and will be further constrained by MPC implementation.
    Negative and positive water level values pertain to water level being below and
    above the soil surface respectively. Percolation and evapotranspiration is determined
    jointly by environmental factors such as air temperature, wind speed, and soil
    type as well as crop physiological conditions. Physiological conditions however
    are difficult to estimate. For example, the plant will inhibit transpiration by
    closing its stomata to preserve water and combat drought stress [21]. Thus, previous
    works on MPC were limited to utilize environmental factors to estimate evapotranspiration
    in water balance models. But in our work, we explicitly relate our crop growth
    model variables LAI and BIM to estimate the combined demand of evapotranspiration
    and percolation by, ETA P i = d k 0 + d k 1 ⋅LA I i + d k 2 ⋅BI M i + d k 3 ⋅LA
    I i ⋅Ra d i + d k 4 ⋅E T ref i + d k 5 ⋅E T ref i ⋅LA I i + d k 6 ⋅E T ref i ⋅BI
    M i + d k 7 ⋅E T ref i ⋅LA I i ⋅Ra d i + d k 8 ⋅ETA P t−1 + d k 9 ⋅ D t−1 fork=1,2,3,4
    (5) View Source where ETAPi is the overall water demand of the crop-soil system,
    ETAref is the reference evapotranspiration which is the evapotranspiration of
    a theoretical plant in stress free condition. Variable ETAref is determined by
    meteorological data and considered as an external variable to the system. Parameter
    d k 0 describe percolation. Parameter d k 1−2 links to direct effects of the states
    LAI and BIM to evapotranspiration. Parameters d k 3−7 denote the interaction effects
    of external environmental variables with crop growth variables. All parameters
    d k 0−9 have different values for each growth phase k. The piece-wise modeling
    of the system allows to capture physiological phenomenon wherein certain phases
    in crop development are more resilient to drought stress from water deficit. Water
    deficit is then translated from water level as, D i ={ 0 W i , , if W i ≥0 if
    W i <0 }. (6) View Source When there is ponding, water deficit should be D = 0.
    This consideration is important as it is assumed that there should be no drought
    stress when the soil is fully saturated. Likewise, this also ensures increasing
    water levels over fully saturated soil does not boost growth. This introduces
    conditional non-linearities in the formulation and can be relaxed using the big-M
    technique, W i ≥M⋅( B i −1) W i <M⋅ B i D i = W i ⋅ B i B={0,1} (7) (8) (9) (10)
    View Source where M is a sufficiently large constant and B is a binary variable.
    C. MPC Formulation The MPC algorithm solves an optimization problem at each time
    step. The problem solves a multi-objective expression, V LAI i V BIM i V GrY i
    V = (LA I i −LA I opt i ) 2 = (BI M i −BI M opt i ) 2 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ (Gr Y i −Gr Y opt
    i ) 2 0 ,if k=3,4 ,if k=1,2 ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ = ∑ i=1 i=H−1 (λ⋅ I i + γ 1 ⋅ V LAI i + γ 2
    ⋅ V BIM i + γ 3 ⋅ V GrY i ) + v 1 ⋅ V LAI H + v 2 ⋅ V BIM H + v 3 ⋅ V GrY H (11)
    (12) (13) (14) View Source where LAIopt, BIMopt and GrYopt are optimal leaf area
    index, biomass, and yield trajectories. These optimal trajectories can be predetermined
    before optimization by simulating ponded irrigation where there is no drought
    stress. The objective weights λ, γ1−3, υ1−3 pertains to irrigation action, set-point
    tracking, and endpoint tracking. The MPC is formulated as a MIQP due to constraint
    in the water deficit equation, min. subjectto W 1 LA I 1 Gr Y 1 V eqs.1−3(crop
    growth) eqs.4−5(water balance) eqs.7−10(waterdeficit) I – ≤ I i ≤ I ¯ = W t =L
    A ^ I t ,BI M 1 =B I ^ M t =G r ^ Y t ,ifk=3,4 ∀i=1,2,…,H (15) (16) (17) (18)
    View Source where H is the optimization horizon. Irrigation constraints are defined
    by (15) where the lower and upper constraints are I = 0mm and Ī = 100mm respectively.
    The current water level reading from the sensor is constrained to be the initial
    starting point of the optimization in (16). Though there are no real time sensor
    reading of LAI, BIM, and GrY , they are updated by their estimates from the result
    of previous optimization as in (17),(18) and set to typical initial values at
    the beginning of the MPC run. In the sequence of solution for the irrigation variables,
    only the first I1 is used for actual irrigation and the process is repeated until
    harvest. The optimization horizon H shrinks to the days left until harvest when
    the horizon is longer. We summarize the primary limitations of this model. First,
    it is assumed fertilizer application is within standard management. Second, we
    ignore the delaying effect on crop growth due to severe drought stress [21]. This
    means that transitions across developmental phases are mainly driven by the external
    variable in weather temperature. Given sensor measurements and weather forecast,
    the exact timing of model phase switching is determined before solving the optimization
    problem. Lastly, the depth where crop’s roots can reach available water in the
    soil is considered constant. This is a reasonable assumption for rice planting
    practices. Furthermore, this allows (4) to describe a single soil layer which
    reduces model complexity. These are assumed because MPC is designed to operate
    under milder drought conditions. SECTION III. Experimental Simulations Identifying
    model parameters directly from experimental data is challenging, particularly
    for leaf area index and biomass since they require destructive methods such as
    sampling subplots in the field for laboratory analysis. We present our methodology
    to characterize our model and control performance across wet and dry seasons.
    In this section, we numerically solve our MIQP problem for entire planting seasons.
    All calculations were done on a laptop computer with dual core 2.5GHz processor
    and 8GB RAM using python 3.7 with gurobi solver [22]. Simulation time for each
    field scenario is less than a minute. Using ponding irrigation as a benchmark,
    we evaluate the performance of CG-MPC against WB-MPC, and Safe-AWD. A. Parameter
    Estimation The problem of sparse data is circumvented by interpolating experimental
    data with a specialized rice simulation software ORYZA3. The software ORYZA3 generates
    a best fit model from collected data for specific rice varieties. Input data for
    the ORYZA3 simulations are composed of rice variety specific quantitative properties,
    soil properties, and meteorological data. The ORYZA3 simulation produces daily
    data on all the necessary crop variables that can now be used to explore different
    irrigation scenarios. The scenarios generated should provide sufficient excitation
    in finding the parameters of our crop growth model. The International Rice Research
    Institute has a dataset of varieties experimentally calibrated with ORYZA3. The
    rice variety chosen for this study is IR72 and the data can be found in [23].
    For this particular dataset, transplanting was done hence growth trajectories
    would exhibit a drop due to shock on the 12th day. The phenomenon is most evident
    for leaf area index. Simulation starts on the 18th day (DVS=0.2) to discount the
    effect of transplanting shock. The calibrated DVS values corresponding to the
    start of developmental phases BVP, PSP, PFP, and GFP are 0.0, 0.5, 0.9, and 1.5
    respectively. This allows us to pre-determine the specific days for each developmental
    phase k. The average duration of the planting season is 107 days after seedling
    emergence. Note that this parameter estimation process needs to be repeated for
    different calibrated rice variety and soil type, but it needs to be done only
    once. We use the coefficient of determination score (R2) to quantify the performance
    of our model in comparison to 160 randomly generated test scenarios in ORYZA3.
    Crop variables LAI, BIM, and GrY have R2 scores of 0.97, 0.99, and 0.98 respectively.
    For simulating MPC irrigation management, eight scenarios are explored. The scenarios
    are varied combinations of weather and calibrated soil properties from actual
    experimental data. It comprises of six dry and two wet season conditions. It was
    not possible to get continuous data from ORYZA3 to update the MPC simulation at
    each iteration. Our own model was augmented by the model error characterized from
    the parameter estimation process to provide an ad-hoc solution instead. B. Irrigation
    Schemes and Metrics Ponding irrigation management is set at about an upper water
    level threshold of 50mm then allowed to lower at 10mm which it is then irrigated
    50mm/day until upper threshold is reached again. Ponded irrigation is considered
    as the non-drought stress optimal growth trajectory and used as a benchmark for
    water savings and grain yield. The trajectories are pre-determined using ORYZA3.
    Safe-AWD rules are implemented as previously descibed. The water balance based
    MPC (WB-MPC) is formulated using only the water balance equation as dynamic constraints.
    The objective is to track water level 10mm below the soil surface which is a conservative
    target with good water savings relative to ponding. Upon some investigation, longer
    horizons improve MPC solution. However, the horizon length should realistically
    consider the ability to forecast meteorological data. We find a horizon of 28
    days is suitable enough. To focus on the crop variables, we restrict our MPC simulations
    to perfect forecast of meteorological data for this horizon. The objective weights
    of CG-MPC were tuned to prioritize tracking optimal growth trajectories over water
    savings. But it is further tuned to be at least relatively competitive to WB-MPC.
    Total irrigation reduction (%) can be computed using applied irrigation, Ponded−Irrigation
    Ponded ⋅100%. Likewise, grain yield reduction (%) is simlarly computed as, Ponded
    yield−Irrigation yield Ponded yield ⋅100% . The root mean square error (RMSE)
    is used to compare the tracking of optimal growth trajectories of each irrigation
    scheme. SECTION IV. Results and Analysis We first analyze the average behavioral
    results of each irrigation scheme. In Fig. 1, we see that RMSE of CG-MPC has the
    best tracking for all crop variables. The graph of leaf area index shows WB-MPC
    and Safe-AWD deviates from the optimal trajectory. For WB-MPC, it starts to occur
    slightly before PSP. This early deviations in biomass and leaf area subsequently
    affected grain yield in the latter phases. Even a conservative water level tracking
    of -10mm creates adverse effects. It can be remedied by having an elevated water
    set-point at the beginning then switch to an aggressive one later. However, this
    highlights the limitation of WB-MPC. Knowing the right water level set-point for
    different rice varieties and soil properties is not intuitive. It also produced
    highly non-sparse irrigation control which is operationally expensive. For Safe-AWD,
    leaf area index deviation starts to occur in the middle of PSP which corresponds
    to the drying event. Note, it is not always critical to have high leaf area. Recall
    the aforementioned phenomenon of the crop inhibiting leaf growth to minimize transpiration
    during drought stress. At PSP, drying event is beneficial since biomass nutrients
    will be directed towards building grain instead of leaves when heading into PFP.
    Further evidence is given by Safe-AWD having better grain formation RMSE, even
    though the leaf area index RMSE of WB-MPC is lower than Safe-AWD. Safe-AWD has
    lower biomass RMSE than WB-MPC. With enough tracking of optimal biomass, good
    recovery from drought stress is possible. This shows that drought stress should
    generally be avoided during BVP while it can be induced during PSP. Although the
    drying event is comparatively less aggressive, the timing of drying in CG-MPC
    was similar to Safe-AWD. During PSP for example, the crop was generally allowed
    to recover with some irrigation event around DVS=0.6. In the water level recharging
    for PFP, CG-MPC maintains water at the soil surface by an irrigation peak event
    around DVS=0.9, while Safe-AWD injects two peak irrigation events to reach ponding
    threshold and gradually allows it recede. As previously mentioned, the rules developed
    for Safe-AWD were rigorously studied and determined by numerous field experiments
    while the model derived for CG-MPC followed mechanistic principles in crop modeling
    literature. The timing similarity of induced drought of CG-MPC to Safe-AWD validates
    that the crop model presented captured the latent physiological dynamics of rice.
    A summary of the result is shown in Fig. 2. Safe-AWD has an advantage over the
    two MPC schemes as it produces the largest gap in trade-off between irrigation
    and yield as shown in Fig 4. The WB-MPC result produced comparable levels in terms
    of water savings with CG-MPC but with high variance. WB-MPC performed worst in
    terms of yield reduction mitigation due to it being agnostic of crop dynamics
    even with the conservative water level set-point. However, CG-MPC showed virtually
    negligible adverse effects of drying events on yield with very high precision
    across different environmental conditions and still with significantly good controlled
    reductions in irrigation. SECTION V. CONCLUSIONS Simulations of irrigation schemes
    for rice were performed. The result highlights the importance of the timing and
    degree of alternately wetting and drying in rice crop. Though yield reductions
    are relatively small, the wide-scale adoption of Safe-AWD or WB-MPC is often challenged
    with the variability of its yield reduction across specific rice variety, soil
    type, and meteorological interactions. The yield reduction can sometimes be the
    marginal difference in a famer’s income. The integration of mechanistic crop growth
    dynamics in MPC irrigation can now be used to significantly and precisely manage
    the risk of yield reduction with water savings. This demonstrates the potential
    to reliably incorporate irrigation limits or water contracts for future sustainable
    irrigation policies under climate change. Future work needs to explore the following:
    develop non-invasive measurement methods to collect real-time leaf area index
    and biomass estimates, comparison of different calibrated varieties, robustness
    against differing degrees of forecast uncertainty, and implement a schedule constraint
    to minimize abrupt changes in irrigation events caused by daily MPC computation
    in order to ease practical implementation. Fig. 1. Average growth and water trajectories
    of irrigation schemes: Ponding (dotted), CG-MPC (solid line), WB-MPC (dashed),
    Safe-AWD (dotted dash), and Rain (bars). The RMSE was computed across all eight
    scenarios using the Ponding result as baseline. The RMSE for leaf area index are
    the following: 0.21 for CG-MPC, 0.35 for WB-MPC, and 0.46 for Safe-AWD. The RMSE
    for biomass are 189.56 for CG-MPC, 488.49 for WB-MPC, and 387.59 for Safe-AWD.
    The RMSE for grain yield formation are 35.31 for CG-MPC, 244.89 for WB-MPC, and
    101.56 for Safe-AWD. Show All Fig. 2. Effect of Irrigation Scheme on Yield and

  description: 'Water conservation starts from rationalizing irrigation, as it is
    the largest consumer of this vital source. Following the critical and urgent nature
    of this issue, several works have been proposed. The idea of most researchers
    is to develop irrigation management systems to meet the water needs of plants
    with optimal use of this resource. In fact, irrigation water requirement is only
    the amount of water that must be applied to compensate the evapotranspiration
    loss. Penman-Monteith equation is the most common formula to evaluate reference
    evapotranspiration, but it requires many factors that cannot be available in many
    cases. This leads to a trend towards behavior model estimation. System identification
    with control is one of the most promising applications in this axis. The idea
    behind this proposal depends on three stages: First, the estimation of reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) by a linear ARX model, where temperature, relative humidity,
    insolation duration and wind speed are used as inputs, and ET0 estimated by Penman-Monteith
    equation as output. The results show that the values estimated by this method
    were in good agreement with the measured data. The second part of this paper is
    to manage the quantity of water. For this purpose, two controllers are used for
    testing, lead-lag and PID. To adjust the first controller and optimize the choice
    of its parameters, Nelder-Mead algorithm is used. In the last part, a comparative
    study is done between the two used controllers.'

    PDF Abstract Water conservation starts from rationalizing irrigation, as it is
    the largest consumer of this vital source. Following the critical and urgent nature
    of this issue, several works have been proposed. The idea of most researchers
    is to develop irrigation management systems to meet the water needs of plants
    with optimal use of this resource. In fact, irrigation water requirement is only
    the amount of water that must be applied to compensate the evapotranspiration
    loss. Penman-Monteith equation is the most common formula to evaluate reference
    evapotranspiration, but it requires many factors that cannot be available in many
    cases. This leads to a trend towards behavior model estimation. System identification
    with control is one of the most promising applications in this axis. The idea
    behind this proposal depends on three stages: First, the estimation of reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) by a linear ARX model, where temperature, relative humidity,
    insolation duration and wind speed are used as inputs, and ET0 estimated by Penman-Monteith
    equation as output. The results show that the values estimated by this method
    were in good agreement with the measured data. The second part of this paper is
    to manage the quantity of water. For this purpose, two controllers are used for
    testing, lead-lag and PID. To adjust the first controller and optimize the choice
    of its parameters, Nelder-Mead algorithm is used. In the last part, a comparative
    study is done between the two used controllers. Keywords Evapotranspiration; water;

    ISSUE This article is part of the Sirish Shah Festschrift special issue. 1. Introduction
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue globally.
    It is critical to increase the efficiency of water usage especially in agriculture
    since it consumes the largest portion of fresh water (70% approximately). (1,2)
    Traditionally, agriculture irrigation decisions are primarily made in open-loop
    on the basis of empirical or heuristic knowledge, and no real-time feedback information
    (e.g., soil moisture) from the field is used. These open-loop irrigation methods
    are not precise and typically lead to significant over irrigation. In the past
    decade, there has been an increasing interest in lower-level closed-loop agriculture
    irrigation for precision irrigation. Different control algorithms based on real-time
    field feedback like soil moisture measurement have been reported in the literature.
    For example, Goodchild et al. proposed a modified proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) control to improve the irrigation precision. (3) Kim et al. developed a
    closed-loop irrigation control system for a self-propelled lateral-move sprinkler
    irrigation system. (4) Model predictive control (MPC) has also been investigated
    in the optimal control of agriculture irrigation. Park et al. used MPC to maintain
    the field at desired soil moisture and salt levels. (5) McCarthy et al. used crop
    production models in MPC to optimize irrigation time and amount. (6) Delgoda et
    al. implemented MPC to minimize root zone soil moisture deficit and irrigation
    amount with a limit on water supply. (7) Recently, Mao et al. developed a zone
    MPC algorithm to maintain soil moisture within a target zone instead of a set-point.
    This approach was shown to lead to further water conservation. (8) The above-mentioned
    irrigation control studies all focus on short time (hourly or daily) irrigation
    management. A typical objective of these studies is to maintain the soil moisture
    or root zone soil moisture deficit at a predetermined set-point or zone. Irrigation
    scheduling is another important subject in agriculture irrigation management,
    which considers water management over a much longer time period (e.g., the entire
    growing season of a crop). In general, a water balance accounting for plant water
    consumption, evaporation and drainage loss, historical weather data, and available
    soil moisture is used in irrigation scheduling. (9−11) Different objectives were
    considered in irrigation scheduling including, for example, profit maximization,
    (12) crop yield maximization, (13) and irrigation uniformity optimization. (14)
    One common feature of the above scheduling studies is that the scheduling optimization
    problem is only solved once at the beginning of the crop growing season, and the
    solution is used for the entire season. In this work, we introduce feedback into
    irrigation scheduling and integrate it with irrigation control to form a hierarchical
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme. It is well recognized in chemical process
    industries that the closed-loop scheduling and control can bring improved economic
    performance. (15−19) The primary objective of this work is to study the closed-loop
    scheduling and control in agriculture irrigation management and investigate whether
    closed-loop scheduling brings any benefits to irrigation management. In the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme, a scheduler operates in the top layer
    with the objective to maximize the crop yield. The scheduler calculates the target
    soil moisture value and passes it to a lower layer irrigation controller. The
    lower layer controller’s primary objective is to follow the target soil moisture.
    Both the scheduler and the controller are designed in the framework of MPC. The
    scheduler uses a prediction horizon that covers the entire growing season of the
    crop (maize in this work). The scheduler is re-evaluated every week on the basis
    of updated weather forecast and soil moisture measurement from the field with
    a shrinking horizon. The controller uses a prediction horizon of 1 week and calculates
    irrigation commands to follow the target soil moisture determined by the scheduler.
    The soil water dynamics of the field are described by an agro-hydrological model
    that consists of a partial differential equation. To alleviate the computational
    complexity of the scheduler and the controller, a linear parameter varying (LPV)
    model is identified for the scheduler and the controller, respectively, based
    on input and output data from the agro-hydrological model. The main contributions
    of this work include: A method to identify an LPV model for the scheduler to describe
    the interaction between soil water and the crop over the entire growing season
    that contains different growing stages. The LPV model is computationally efficient
    for online optimization. A detailed closed-loop scheduler and controller design
    to maximize crop yield and water conservation. Extensive simulations that investigate
    the performance of the closed-loop scheduler with respect to the traditional open-loop
    scheduling. 2. System Description ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The system considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment. The interaction between
    the soil, the water, the atmosphere, and the crop is described by an agro-hydrological
    model. The yield of the crop is characterized using the ratio of the actual evapo-transpiration
    to the potential evapo-transpiration. The crop considered is maize. A schematic
    of the considered system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1. System considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment over the entire growing
    season of the crop maize. 2.1. Agro-hydrological Model We consider an agro-hydrological
    system that characterizes the interaction between the soil, the water, the atmosphere,
    and the crop. The system is modeled by a set of empirical and physical relations.
    The dynamics of the water flow inside soil is described using the Richards equation:
    (20) (1) where θ is the soil moisture content (cm/cm), K is the hydraulic conductivity
    (cm/h), z is the vertical distance inside soil matrix (cm) taken positive upward,
    S includes the source and sink terms (h–1), such as soil water extraction rate
    by plant roots, and h is the matric potential (cm) also known as soil suction.
    The hydraulic conductivity K can be expressed in terms of soil moisture content
    as follows: (21) (2) where Ksat is saturated hydraulic conductivity, λ = 0.5 is
    the shape parameter, (22) and Se is the relative saturation given by (3) where
    θres is the residual moisture content (cm/cm), θsat is the saturated moisture
    content (cm/cm). The relation between soil moisture content θ and matric potential
    h is described by the Van Genuchten model: (23) (4) where η and m are empirical
    shape factors, and αv is the inverse of air entry suction (cm–1). In general,
    m is considered as a dependent variable of η such as . Thus, the Richards equation
    can be described as follows: (5) where C is the hydraulic capacity, which accounts
    for the change of soil moisture due to the change of soil matric potential; that
    is, C = dθ/dh. In the Richards equation, eq 5, S(h) represents the soil water
    extraction rate by the crop roots, which accounts for the transpiration rate T.
    The top water flux qtop at the soil-atmosphere interface is considered in the
    top boundary calculation of the Richards equation. The top water flux qtop can
    be expressed as follows: (6) where qtop is the top flux, I is the irrigation rate,
    P is the precipitation rate, and E denotes evaporation. The transpiration T and
    evaporation E are calculated following the method in SWAP model. (24) The top
    boundary of this agro-hydrological system is time varying depending on the surface
    soil moisture condition, and may switch between the flux and the pressure head
    boundary conditions. Both of these boundary conditions are determined using the
    qtop value as described in the work of Van Dam and Feddes. (25) In this study
    the bottom boundary condition is taken as free drainage. Following the method
    used in the work of Van Dam et al. (24) and Nahar et al., (26)eq 5 can be discretized
    using the implicit finite difference method with explicit linearization of the
    hydraulic conductivity K(h). Let us consider that the spatial domain is discretized
    into ND compartments with the top one as compartment 1 and the bottom one as compartment
    ND. After discretization, at compartment i (i = 2, ..., ND – 1), the water content
    dynamics are described as follows: (7) where hi is the matric potential of the
    i-th compartment, n denotes the discretized time with a sampling period of a hour,
    , , , , ui(k) = Si(k)Δzi, and Δzi denotes the thickness of compartment i. In eq
    7, Ki+1/2 denotes the average hydraulic conductivity between compartment i and
    i + 1. The boundary conditions of the system define i = 1 and i = ND. Defining
    h = [h1h2 ... hND]T, combining the equations for the ND compartments together,
    and splitting the inputs to the system into manipulated inputs and uncontrolled
    inputs, the overall dynamics can be written in the following compact form: (8)
    where u is the manipulated input (irrigation) and w denotes disturbances and uncontrolled
    inputs such as rain and weather conditions. Note that h is a column vector whose
    size depends on the number of discretization points ND in the spatial domain.
    On the basis of eq 4, the soil moisture is a function of the matric potential
    h. For the soil moisture at each compartment i, we can use eq 4 to find the corresponding
    matric potential hi. For brevity, we write these equations in the following compact
    form: (9) where the function g represents the relation between θ and h as expressed
    in eq 4. Note that when i = 1, it indicates the top surface. Eqs 8 and 9 define
    the system equations for the dynamics of water flow inside soil. For more details
    of the derivation of eqs 8 and 9, the reader may refer to Nahar et al. (26) 2.2.
    Crop Yield Model The crop yield is modeled as a function of the potential evapo-transpiration
    and the actual evapo-transpiration as follows: (12) (10) where Ya is the actual
    yield, Yp is the potential maximum yield, ETa is the actual evapo-transpiration
    and ETp is the potential evapo-transpiration, and is the crop sensitivity factor
    (also known as yield response factor) for the growing period at time k. Crop sensitivity
    factor is a measure used to indicate the impact of water stress (at different
    growing stages) on the overall yield of the crop. When the actual yield is equal
    to the potential yield, eq 10 takes its minimum value zero. In eq 10, represents
    the yield reduction or the yield deficiency and represents the relative reduction
    in evapo-transpiration or ET deficiency. The potential and the actual evapo-transpiration
    values of a crop are defined as follows: (27) (11) (12) where is an empirical
    crop factor that describes the relation of ETp to the potential evapo-transpiration
    of the reference crop (grass) ET0, and is the water stress factor, which is a
    function of the soil moisture and relates ETa to ETp. In eq 11, the reference
    evapo-transpiration ET0 is calculated using Penman–Montieth equation based on
    hourly weather data. (27) In eq 12, the water stress factor is modeled following
    the method in Feddes’s work (28) and will be made clear in Section 3.3.1. It is
    noted that eq 12 holds when other factors such as nutrient deficiency or diseases
    are not present. Combining eqs 10 and 12, the following relation can be obtained
    to describe the relation between the crop yield and soil moisture: (13) In this
    work, following the work of Van Dam et al., (24) a simple maize model is used
    to calculate the evapo-transpiration amounts at different growing stages. Note
    that the crop water requirement increases as the crop grows. This implies that
    more water is required to keep the soil moisture at the same level as crop grows.
    3. Problem Formulation and Proposed Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 3.1. Closed-Loop
    Scheduling and Control Problem Formulation In this section, we describe the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control framework for precision irrigation. The scheduler
    and the controller form a hierarchical decision making system. In this work, both
    the scheduler and the controller will be designed in the framework of MPC. The
    primary objective of the scheduler is to maximize the crop yield at the end of
    the entire growing season. It considers a much longer horizon that covers the
    entire growing season and uses historical weather data, available weekly weather
    forecast, and soil moisture measurement from the field to calculate the soil moisture
    reference trajectories for the lower layer controller. The primary objective of
    the controller is to track the soil moisture reference calculated by the scheduler.
    It uses a fixed prediction horizon of a week and takes into account the soil moisture
    measurement and daily weather forecast in its irrigation command calculation.
    A schematic of the closed-loop scheduling and control framework is shown in Figure
    2. Figure 2 Figure 2. Structure of the closed-loop scheduling and control system.
    Left: Process block diagram; Right: The design of prediction horizon. 3.2. Scheduling
    and Control Model Identification The direct use of the agro-hydrological model,
    eqs 8 and 9, in the scheduler and the controller is computationally challenging
    due to the stiffness of the nonlinear system when the soil moisture is low, the
    high dimensions of the discretized system, and the large horizon covered by the
    scheduler. In order to overcome the computational challenge and to capture the
    dynamics between the input and the output of the agro-hydrological system, we
    propose to identify an LPV model for the scheduler and the controller, respectively.
    The two LPV models can be identified based on the simulated input–output data
    from the agro-hydrological model. LPV models have been widely used to describe
    nonlinear processes due to its simple structure and its ability to approximate
    complex nonlinear systems. (29−32) 3.2.1. Scheduling Model The output of the scheduling
    model is the average root zone soil moisture content described as follows: (14)
    where θs is the average root zone soil moisture, θi is determined by eq 9, and
    Nr < ND is the deepest node that contains the crop roots. Note that Nr changes
    over time as the length of roots grows. The LPV model consists of a set of linear
    models that are connected with varying parameters which are functions of scheduling
    variables. (33) The scheduling variables are the ones that can be used to reflect
    the nonlinearity of the dynamics of the system. For the scheduling model, two
    scheduling variables are used. They are the soil moisture s1 (s1 = θ) and the
    root depth s2. The sampling period used in the scheduling model is 1 day. For
    each scheduling variable, a few working points need to be determined and around
    those working points, linear models are identified. Let us assume that we have
    H working points for s1 and G working points for s2. These working points define
    a mesh with HG nodes. For each of these nodes, a linear model should be identified.
    Let us also use (i, j) (i = 1, 2, ..., H, j = 1, 2, ..., G) to denote the node
    defined by the i-th s1 working point and the j-th s2 working point. For each node
    (i, j), a linear model of the following form is identified: (15) where m denotes
    the discrete time with a sampling period of a day, xi,j is the output of the linear
    model for (i, j), api,j (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi,j (q = 1, 2, ..., nb), and di,j
    are model parameters, u is the manipulated input. The model orders na and nb are
    determined prior to the identification process. This model can also be expressed
    as follows: (16) where φi,j(m) = [−xi,j(m – 1), ..., −xi,j(m – na), u(m – 1), ...,
    u(m – nb), 1]T, and βi,j = [a1i,j, ..., anai,j, b1i,j, ..., bnbi,j, di,j]T. With
    respect to s1 (soil moisture), the linear models are combined together using Gaussian
    weighting functions as follows: (17) where y∗j is an intermediate variable, and
    the weighting function αi is given by (18) where with s1,i the soil moisture value
    of the i-th prespecified s1 working point, σi1 and σi2 being two parameters that
    need to be identified, which is related to the validity width of the linear model.
    (8) With respect to s2 (root length), the outputs obtained from eq 17 are further
    linearly interpolated to get the final output of the LPV model: (19) given that
    the root length at time m lies between s2,j and s2,j+1 (i.e., s2,j ≤ s2(m) ≤ s2,j+1).
    Note that the length of the roots grows according to the time after seeding and
    is considered as a function of time in this work. In eq 19, y is the average water
    content within the root zone given by the LPV model. Eq 19 is the model that will
    be used in the scheduler and may be written equivalently in the following state-space
    form: (20) (21) where A, B are composed of elements in βi,j (i = 1, 2, ..., H,
    j = 1, 2, ..., G), C depends on the two scheduling variables, d is composed of
    di,j, and us is composed of the current and previous daily irrigation amounts.
    The detailed identification of the above LPV model will be discussed in Section
    4. 3.2.2. Control Model Since the controller uses a relatively much smaller prediction
    horizon (a week), we consider an LPV model with only the soil moisture (s1) as
    the scheduling variable. In this model, we consider the root length of the crop
    is constant within each control prediction horizon. The output of the control
    model is also the average soil water content within the root zone as defined in
    eq 14. The sampling period of the LPV model for control purposes is also a day.
    The LPV takes the following form: (22a) (22b) where x̃i is the output of a submodel
    and ỹ is the final output of the LPV model, api (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi (q =
    1, 2, ..., nb), and di are model parameters, αi is a weighting factor determined
    following eq 18. At different crop growing stages, the above control model should
    be reidentified to account for the growth of the crop. The above model can also
    be written equivalently in the following state-space form: (23) (24) where Ã,
    B̃ are composed of api and bqi (i = 1, 2, ..., H), C̃ depends on the scheduling
    variable, d̃ is composed of di, and uc is composed of the current and previous
    daily irrigation amounts. The details will be discussed also in Section 4. 3.3.
    Design of Scheduler and Controller 3.3.1. Design of the Scheduler As explained
    earlier, the main objective of the scheduler is to minimize the crop yield deficiency
    while reducing the irrigation water usage. From eq 13, it can be seen that crop
    yield relates to the water stress factor . The stress factor characterizes the
    suppression of root water update due to either drought or insufficient aeration.
    Figure 3 shows a typical relation of and soil moisture. (28) When the soil moisture
    θ is between θL (limiting point) and θa (anaerobic point), there is no water stress
    (). When the soil moisture θ is below θL but larger than θw (wilting point), water
    stress takes place due to drought. When the soil moisture θ is above θa but less
    than θu, there is crop water stress due to insufficient aeration; when θ is above
    θu, crop transpiration stops. For all other soil moisture region, root water extraction
    is completely suppressed. Therefore, it is also important to ensure that the soil
    moisture is always between θw and θu. Specifically, the value of the water stress
    factor is determined as follows: (28) (25) Figure 3 Figure 3. Relation of soil
    moisture content and water stress factor. (28) The scheduler optimization problem
    is evaluated every week. It uses a prediction horizon from the current week to
    the end of the growing season T. Within each week, the irrigation is considered
    to be constant. For week k, the optimization problem is shown below: (26a) (26b)
    (26c) (26d) (26e) (26f) (26g) (26h) In the optimization problem (eq 26), eq 26a
    defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 26a, the first term indicates
    the crop yield deficiency at the end of the growing season, the second term measures
    the irrigation amount in the remaining growing season, the last summation term
    includes two slack variables that are used to handle constraints on the soil moisture
    in eq 26g, and Qs1, Qs2, Qs3 are positive weighting factors. Eq 26b is the model
    used to calculate the crop yield deficiency. Note that in eq 26b the first part
    on the right-hand side is calculated on the basis of actual soil water content
    measurements, and the second part is calculated on the basis of soil water content
    predicted in the scheduler. Eqs 26c and 26d are the LPV model for scheduling evaluated
    for a week with constant input. Note that the sampling period of the model identified
    in the previous subsection is a day. The scheduler optimization problem, however,
    evaluates once every week. Within a week, the input is held constant. Eq 26c reflects
    this type of consideration. Eq 26e defines the initial condition of the scheduling
    optimization problem, and x̅(k) denotes the current state measurement. Note that
    we assume that the state is measured. Eq 26f requires that all the irrigation
    should be non-negative and is less than the maximum allowed limit umax. Eq 26g
    imposes the constraint such that θw < y < θu as soft constraints through the introduction
    of two slack variables ε1 and ε2. Eq 26h implies that the two slack variables
    are non-negative. The weighting factors Qs3 and Qs4 should be tuned to be relatively
    higher to avoid constraint violation. The solution to the above scheduling optimization
    problem is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount from week k to T. Let us denote
    the optimal weekly irrigation as u*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1. Let us also denote
    the corresponding weekly optimal soil moisture as y*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1.
    The first two values of the optimal irrigation values u*(k|k), u*(k + 1|k), and
    the corresponding soil moisture values y*(k|k), y*(k + 1|k) are sent to the controller
    as references. At the next week, the scheduling optimization problem is re-evaluated
    with new soil moisture measurement. 3.3.2. Design of the Controller In the controller
    design, the control LPV model is first augmented with an output disturbance to
    account for model-plant mismatch. Then, an observer is designed to estimate the
    model-plant mismatch. The augmented model is as follows: (27) (28) (29) On the
    basis of the above augmented model, the following observer is designed to estimate
    the output disturbance: (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) where x̂, p̂, ŷ, and y̅ denote
    the estimated state, estimated disturbance, estimated output, and output measurement,
    respectively. The observer gains Lx and Lp are determined as discussed in Mao
    et al. (8) The primary objective of the controller is to track the soil moisture
    and total irrigation water consumption references calculated by the scheduler.
    The controller is also designed in the framework of MPC. The controller is evaluated
    every day with updated soil moisture measurements. The controller uses a fixed
    prediction horizon of a week (i.e., 7). At day m, the controller is formulated
    as follows: (35a) (35b) (35c) (35d) (35e) (35f) (35g) (35h) In the optimization
    problem (eq 35), eq 35a defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 35a,
    y* and u* denote the references from the scheduler. The first term requires that
    the predicted average soil moisture content within the root zone should be close
    to the reference from the scheduler, the second term requires that the total water
    consumption over a week is close to the predicted consumption of the scheduler,
    and the last terms contain two slack variables. In eq 35a, Qc, Qc1, Qc2, and R
    are positive weighting factors. Eq 35b is the LPV model for control. Eq 35c implies
    that a constant output disturbance is considered in the optimization of the controller
    and the disturbance value is given by the observer as specified in eq 35e. This
    constant output disturbance is added to the output equation as specified in eq
    35d. Eq 35e defines the initial condition of the control optimization problem,
    and x̂ is from the observer. Eq 35f requires that all the irrigation should be
    non-negative and is smaller than or equal to one-seventh of the weekly upper limit.
    Eq 35g imposes the constraint such that θw < ỹ < θu as soft constraints. Eq 35h
    implies that the two slack variables are non-negative. The solution to the optimization
    problem (eq 35) is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount for time l = m, ...,
    m + 6 denoted by u*(l|m), l = m, ..., m + 6. At time m, only the first element
    from the optimal daily irrigation input is applied to the field. The rest are
    discarded. At the next day m + 1, the optimization problem is solved again 4.
    Results and Discussion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 4.1. LPV Model Identification and
    Validation In the identification of the scheduling LPV model, three working points
    are considered for each of the two scheduling variables (H = 3, G = 3). In the
    input-output data generation, the three s2 working points are s2 = [s2,1, s2,2,
    s2,3]T = [10.3571, 55.3571, 99.881]T cm. These working points are picked according
    to the root length of maize at different growing stages (see Figure 4). Specifically,
    the first working point of s2 corresponds to the root length about 10 days after
    seeding and is picked to represent the baby plant. The second working point is
    the mean value of the root length of the rapid growing stage and the last working
    point is the root length at the fully matured stage. For each working point of
    s2, three different s1 working points are considered. For s2,1, the three s1 working
    points are s1{1} = [s1,1{1}, s1,2{1}, s1,3{1}]T = [0.0755, 0.0936, 0.1792]T. For
    s2,2, the three s1 working points are s1{2} = [s1,1{2}, s1,2{2}, s1,3{2}]T = [0.0789,
    0.1211, 0.1988]T. For s2,3, the three s1 working points are s1{3} = [s1,1{3},
    s1,2{3}, s1,3{3}]T = [0.0835, 0.1176, 0.1564]T. For each s2 working point, the
    three s1 working points are determined according to three (small, medium, large)
    steady-state irrigation amounts, which are picked based on extensive simulations
    and trail-and-error. In determining these irrigation amounts, one consideration
    is the possible soil moisture range of the system (about 0.05–0.35), and another
    consideration is the nonlinearity feature of the agro-hydrological system. The
    orders of the local models na and nb are both picked to be one based on the results
    of Mao et al. (8) Figure 4 Figure 4. Root length of maize according to time after
    seeding. The input and output data for the LPV identification generated from the
    agro-hydrological model is shown in Figure 5. In generating the data, the daily
    weather condition is kept constant with no rain. Binary input signals are used
    around the working points. During the transition from one working point to another
    of s1 (soil moisture), constant inputs are used. In the top plot of Figure 5,
    CS1, CS2, CS3 correspond to the three working points of s2 (root depth). During
    these regions, binary inputs are used. Region CV1 and CV2 correspond to transition
    periods from s2,1 to s2,2 and from s2,2 to s2,3. In these two regions, constant
    inputs are used to show the effect of crop root zone on soil moisture. As crop
    root length increases (from CS1 to CS3), more irrigation is required to maintain
    the soil moisture as shown in the top plot of Figure 5. Following the approach
    in Mao et al., (8) the parameters of the LPV model are identified and shown in
    Table 1. The bottom plot of Figure 5 shows the predicted trajectory and the actual
    trajectory generated by the agro-hydrological model. The LPV model overall has
    a good fit over the entire period with the percentage difference between the predicted
    value of the LPV model and the actual value of the agro-hydrological model about
    5% or less except in the region CV1, which corresponds to the rapid growing stage
    (whose percentage difference is about 18%). To further validate the developed
    LPV model over the crop growing season, an open-loop simulation of the agro-hydrological
    model is performed. Fixed weather condition is considered with no rain, and an
    input irrigation of 2.5 cm/day is considered. The result is shown in Figure 6.
    The overall percentage difference between the predicted value given by the LPV
    model and the value generated by the agro-hydrological model is about 27% with
    most of it contributed from the period between day 23 and day 45 which corresponds
    to the rapid growing stage. In the rest of the period, the percentage difference
    is around 15%. Given the complexity of the agro-hydrological system and the use
    of feedback, the mismatch between the LPV model and the agro-hydrological model
    is considered to be acceptable. Note that the performance of the LPV model may
    be improved by including more working points. Figure 5 Figure 5. Input–output

    6. Validation of the scheduling LPV model. In the controller, the three local
    linear models of each root length working point are weighted using the corresponding
    Gaussian weights in Table 1 and then are used in the controller design. For example,
    in CS1 and up to the middle of CV1, the local models of root length working point
    1 are weighted and used in the MPC controller. The switching between root length
    working points is based on the root length. 4.2. Scheduling and Control Simulation
    Results The proposed closed-loop scheduling and control is applied to the agro-hydrological
    system under different scenarios. The proposed closed-loop scheduling approach
    is compared with an open-loop scheduling scheme in which the scheduling optimization
    is only solved once at the beginning and applied throughout the growing season.
    In the open-loop scheduling scheme, the same closed-loop controller is used. The
    crop growing season is considered to be 23 weeks from seeding. The values of the
    crop sensitivity factor at different crop growth stages (from 0 to 2 with 0 indicating
    initial seeding stage and 2 implying mature stage) for maize are shown in Table
    2. (34) The weekly irrigation upper limit is umax = 70 cm/week, which implies
    that the daily irrigation limit is 10 cm. Table 2. Values of Crop Sensitivity

    Weather In the first scenario, we consider that the amount of rain in the current
    crop season is similar to that of the historical weather data. In this scenario,
    we consider that the actual total rain in the crop growing season is 164.05 cm
    but the historical weather data suggests the total rain over the season to be
    154.50 cm. In the closed-loop scheduling, the scheduler is updated at the end
    of each week with an update weather forecast for the next 2 weeks and the current
    soil moisture measurement. While in the open-loop scheduling, only the historical
    weather data is used at the beginning of the season. As for the controller, in
    both schemes, the field soil moisture is updated every day with field measurements
    and the weather data is also updated for the next 7 days. Uncertainties are considered
    in weather forecast. First, we consider a water conservation case. That is, in
    the scheduler design, more emphasis is put on water conservation. In this case,
    the weighting factors are chosen as Qs1 = 10002, Qs2 = 100, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4
    = 1. The value of Qs3 is chosen very high to ensure that the constraint on the
    lower soil moisture limit is not violated. The weight on the upper soil moisture
    limit is relatively low since it is less important and can be controlled to some
    extent by the irrigation amount. Compared with the next case to be studied, Qs2
    = 100 puts more weighting on water consumption. The values for θu and θw are taken
    as 0.41 cm/cm and 0.15 cm/cm. The wilting value θw for the system is considered
    to be 0.09 cm/cm. Since there is model-plant mismatch, a lower limit that is higher
    than the wilting point is used. For the MPC controller, the weighting factors
    are Qc = 100, Rc = 0.001, Qc1 = 1000, and Qc2 = 0.01. In the controller, a different
    lower limit 0.13 cm/cm on the soil moisture is used since the controller gets
    daily feedback of soil moisture from the farm and it can handle uncertainty better.
    The simulation results are shown in Figure 7 for the closed-loop scheduling scheme
    and in Figure 8 for the open-loop scheduling scheme. For simplicity, only 1 day
    weather forecast is shown in the figures. In both schemes, the MPC controller
    overall is able to track the soil moisture targets well. The over prediction by
    the LPV model subplot (c) of Figures 7 and 8 is relatively significant in the
    crop rapid growing stage, which is due the relatively big mismatch of the LPV
    model from the actual system in the rapid growing stage. The peak at around day
    15 is due to the sudden increase in the actual rain that is not captured in the
    weather forecast. Table 3 summarizes the results of this case. From the table,
    it can be seen that the open-loop scheme has a slightly (1.5%) better crop yield
    deficiency while the closed-loop scheme has a slightly reduced (1.9%) irrigation
    amount. Figure 7 Figure 7. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling scheme
    under favorable weather scenario with more weighting on water conservation. Figure
    8 Figure 8. Simulation results of the open-loop scheduling scheme under favorable
    weather scenario with more weighting on water conservation. Table 3. Simulation

    1242.00 Second, we consider a case that we put less emphasis on water conservation
    (i.e., more on crop yield reduction). In the scheduler, the weights are Qs1 =
    10004, Qs2 = 1, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4 = 1. The lower soil moisture constraint in
    the scheduler is decreased to θw = 0.13 cm/cm whereas for the controller the lower
    limit is increased and set to be the set-point from the scheduler. The weights
    in the controller cost function are kept same as in the previous case. Thus, the
    controller in this case tries to track the soil moisture set point from some higher
    values thereby ensuring less yield deficiency. A summary of the results is given
    in Table 3. In this case, we can see that the closed-loop and the open-loop schemes
    give very similar crop yield while the closed-loop scheme uses slightly (0.8%)
    less water. 4.2.2. Scenario 2: Dry Weather In this scenario, we consider that
    the amount of rain in the current crop season is significantly less than the total
    historical rain data. In this set of simulations, we consider that there is 79.44
    cm of rain in the crop growing season. As in the previous scenario, we first consider
    a water saving mode in the scheduler. The scheduler and controller settings are
    the same as in the previous scenario. A summary of the results is given in Table
    4. It can be observed that the closed-loop scheme saves more (2.3%) water relative
    to the open-loop scheme at the cost of (8.2%) less yield. Table 4. Simulation
    Results under Dry Weather Scenario   more water conservation less water conservation   closed-loop

    prescribed by scheduler (cm3/cm2) 1092.50 993.56 1273.70 1245.10 We also consider
    a similar case like in the previous scenario to put less weight on water conservation.
    The results are summarized in Table 4. From the table, a similar conclusion can
    be drawn. That is, the closed-loop scheme is able to use (2.5%) less water but
    at a cost of (5.9%) less yield. To understand the effects of weights in the scheduling
    optimization, let us look at the results of the same scheduling scheme (closed-loop
    or open-loop) in different operating modes (more water conservation and less water
    conservation). From Table 3 (columns 2 and 4), it can be observed that when the
    objective in the closed-loop scheduler is changed to consider less water conservation,
    an increase of 54.24% in yield can be achieved with the cost of a 23.46% increase
    of water usage under the favorable weather condition. From Table 3 (columns 3
    and 5), it can be seen that an increase of 53.52% in yield can be achieved with
    the cost of a 20.07% increase of water usage for the open-loop scheduler under
    the favorable weather condition. This may imply that the yield is more sensitive
    to the weights and a relatively smaller change in the consumption of irrigation
    water may result a much larger change in the yield. A similar pattern can be observed
    from the results of Table 4 for the dry weather condition. In addition to the
    above cases, we consider another case in which the water price varies. The water
    price is increased in the relatively dry season between week 10 and 15 corresponding
    to day 70 and 105. The corresponding Qs2 value changes according to the price
    as follows: (36) The results are shown in Figure 9 for the closed-loop integrated
    scheme and in Figure 10 for the open-loop irrigation scheme. A summary of the
    result is given in Table 5. The result shows that less water is used relatively
    to open-loop scheme. In the figures, it can be observed that a tendency to use
    more water when water price is low presents. The soil moisture set point before
    day 60 is around 0.3 cm/cm. This creates a water storage that later is used when
    the water price increases. It can be observed that the actual irrigation during
    day 59 drops to zero since the soil moisture set point gets reduced. In this case,
    the closed-loop scheme leads to a 5.3% water saving but at the cost of 5.2% crop
    yield reduction. Figure 9 Figure 9. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling
    scheme under dry weather scenario with varying water price. Figure 10 Figure 10.

    SECTIONSJump To In this work, we investigated closed-loop scheduling together
    with closed-loop control for agriculture irrigation. In the proposed design, LPV
    models were identified and used in the design of the scheduler and the controller.
    The designed hierarchical scheduling and control system is applied to a field
    with maize. In the simulations, a couple of different weather scenarios were considered.
    Within each scenario, a few different cases were studied including different weights
    on water conservation and varying water prices. From the simulation results, we
    can observe that the gain (either in water conservation or crop yield) in closed-loop
    scheduling in most of the cases comes with a cost (either lower crop yield or
    increased water consumption). The results in the simulations considered do not
    show a very clear benefit of using closed-loop scheduling. One possible reason
    for the results is that the crop maize considered in this work requires significant
    water in the growing season. It may have a much stronger impact on the irrigation
    pattern than the impacts of uncertainty in weather and model. This may have caused
    the irrigation to be high in most of the growing season, as can be seen in the
    simulation results, and thus makes the difference between closed-loop scheduling
    and open-loop scheduling not obvious. Moreover, in this work, the spatial heterogeneity
    is not considered, and the field only includes maize. When spatial heterogeneity
    and more types of crops are considered, the benefits of a closed-loop scheduling
    may be more obvious. Further, in this work, we have only considered the soil moisture
    as a controlled variable, when other manipulated inputs (e.g., salinity) are considered,
    closed-loop scheduling may bring more benefits. In our future work, we will consider
    different crops other than maize. Spatial heterogeneity and other manipulated
    inputs will also be considered. Author Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Corresponding

  description: The productivity and financial success of large-scale arable farming
    operations depends highly on how effectively resources are distributed among fields.
    Therefore, it is of interest to develop methods to determine (near optimal) resource
    inputs. In this paper we focus on computing the optimal irrigation policy for
    large-scale arable farming operations, where the number of irrigation machinery
    is much smaller than the number of fields that require irrigation inputs. We propose
    a model predictive control (MPC) framework that simultaneously computes the optimal
    division of irrigation over the fields and which irrigation machines should be
    allocated to which fields, such that the profit at the end of the season is maximized.
    The fact that the optimization of irrigation and allocation of irrigation machinery
    is done simultaneously makes our approach vastly different from strategies available
    in the literature. Another important novelty of our work is that we link short-Term
    effects of crop growth to long-Term effects on profit. The proposed framework
    has reasonable computation times when optimizing on a daily basis over many fields
    and irrigation machines and guarantees a feasible solution. The main principles
    of our approach are more widely applicable. Using simulations we demonstrate the
    robustness of the scheme with respect to changes in weather and benchmark it with
    respect to a heuristic approach.

    IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation
    quality is a crop performance indicator, its influence being realized both directly
    and indirectly. If we refer to the high quantity of water that crops need, we
    see it as a direct influence factor, as soon as its indirectly role could be seen
    in the influence on the other nutrients availability and on the timing of cultural
    operations. Irrigation requirements are very different from a region to another,
    thus energy efficiency and economic use of water resources depend on a function
    of soil and crop type, climate and moisture [20]. Many factors influence the potential
    water-use efficiency. The meaning of the word potential refers to the maximum
    water-use efficiency that can be achieved when the system is operated properly.
    Global temperature has increased with 0.2-0.3 [ºC] in the last 30 years. The growing
    season in viticulture is very influenced by high or low temperatures. [17] has
    shown that for a 1, 2 or 3 [ºC] rise of temperature, it will also be a crop water
    demand increase with 11%, 19% and even 29%. This paper presents an energy efficient
    proposed system for irrigation management in vineyards. To understand the system
    structure, section II presents the monitored parameters with a huge influence
    on crop productivity. Section III show the main advanced control methods currently
    used in irrigation management, due to the necessity of an advanced irrigation
    system able to manage the installation and receive alerts. The integrated automation
    and telemetry solution for irrigation management in precision agriculture considering
    criteria to energy efficiency and economics, along with the latest control technologies
    is proposed in section IV. SECTION II. Monitored Parameters in Irrigation Management
    Precision of measurements is of high importance in vineyards productivity, modern
    techniques frequently used is focused on the optimization of the oenological potential
    that vineyards have. Precision viticulture is characterized by a crop that is
    dependent of a specific region climate and soil type. This dependence expresses
    the weather influence in vineyards and some of the arguments that support this
    idea are: Daily temperature trend has a huge influence on the grape quality and,
    consequently, on wine [15]; Bunch temperature offers an information related to
    the phenolic compounds maturation [16]; Solar radiation has an impact on phenolic
    compound biosynthesis [18]. A. Air Moisture and Temperature Crop is certainly
    a function of temperature if water is available for optimum satisfaction [1].
    Temperature has a great influence on seeds germination. Due to the biochemical
    processes, the germination phases that include hydration and enzyme activation,
    its degradation and embryo growth are temperature dependent. Validated arguments
    that show the necessity of temperature monitoring are: From 5 to 37 [ºC], the
    rate of photosynthesis is doubled at every 10 [ºC] increase in temperature; The
    respiration rate becomes double at each 10 °C above the optimum temperature; The
    minimum threshold is the temperature below which no growth is possible. Relative
    humidity offers an information regarding the water vapor that is in the air, this
    parameter being in a strong dependence with temperature. Dew point temperature
    explains this dependence, because temperature goes down when the relative humidity
    increases and if the temperature gets cold enough, the air gets to the point in
    which it holds the highest quantity of water vapors. Due to these arguments, air
    moisture and temperature must be monitored in an irrigation management system.
    B. Soil Moisture and Temperature Soil is also very important in irrigation management
    as it is a major source of atmospheric C O 2 and a storage reservoir for carbon
    with soil moisture being a driving force. Some advantages of soil moisture monitoring
    are: The influence in temperature and weather forecasting, due to the fact that
    it has an rise of the evaporation rate that increases the temperature [3]; The
    increasement of the humidity caused by the evaporation rate of the soil moisture
    that increases the dew point; The dependence between temperature and precipitation.
    This is highlighted by the low pressure systems that will condense if air moisture
    is due to the soil moisture evaporation. The result is precipitation occurrence.
    Irrigation management is of high importance in a vineyard. In many regions, growers
    apply irrigations when soil moisture is above an established limit (for example
    50%). Soil moisture is also important because it indirectly influences irrigation
    (the water application and movement across the field, assuring the intake rate).
    The application rate depends of sprinkler and low-volume methods such as deep
    and micro-sprinkles that uses mechanical devices as nozzles [5]. Water that is
    lost by evaporation could be saved by an efficient irrigation appliance capable
    of reducing evaporation with 5 to 15 % depending of the frequency that is used.
    Irrigation without soil moisture monitoring is not indicated, due to the fact
    that this parameter has an influence in the balance between canopy size and fruitfulness
    [19]. The main objective of irrigation is to optimize the plant water stress and
    this could be done by an efficient soil moisture monitoring. The readings of soil
    moisture sensor are temperature dependent and field measured resistance needs
    correction when some differences appear between calibration and field measurements.
    Soil temperature monitoring is influenced in an important proportion by solar
    radiation and humidity. It is considered that soil temperature should be measured
    by sensors that have no moving parts and that do not need calibration. C. Evapotranspiration
    A very important parameter for crop growth and health is evapotranspiration. This
    irrigation management variable is computed based on weather information (air temperature
    and humidity, wind speed etc.). Explanation of the interdependence existing among
    evapotranspiration and meteorological data collected from on-site weather stations
    is offered by using Penman-Monteith method [13]. E T 0 = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900

    View Source SECTION III. Control Strategies for Irrigation Systems Based on the
    monitoring of several parameters, as seen in chapter II, different control strategies
    and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency of irrigation systems.
    Different approaches can be used for designing the control strategy in drip irrigation
    systems: constant open-loop control, open loop on/off, feedback control, [23].
    A. Classical PID Control Classical control methods such as proportional, integral
    and derivative methods show good results, Fig. 1. Figure 1. Classical control
    system Show All In [21] a discrete PID controller is used to control an open irrigation
    channel. The actuator is the opening gate and the controller provides the signal
    for position of this gate. PID control is used in [22] in a modified manner, with
    a constrained integral function, and the goal is supplying the appropriate amount
    of water to meet the needs of the plant during the diurnal cycle. A diagram of
    the PID control for soil moisture in dripping irrigation system is presented in
    Fig. 2. The controller computes the command signal based on the error between
    the measured soil moisture from the transducer and the reference one. The actuator
    is represented by a control relay that acts on the water supply valve. Considering
    the varying solar radiation levels, the controller can still follow the soil moisture
    reference, which proved this classical method gives good results. Figure 2. Soil
    moisture PID control Show All B. Fuzzy Control Systems Fuzzy control is a strategy
    used for irrigation management considering several controlled parameters: soil
    moisture, water supply, loss minimization etc. The general architecture for fuzzy
    control of soil humidity is presented in [24], Fig. 3. The water supply is assured
    through a reservoir house height acts as actuating variable h . The soil moisture
    error is the difference between measured soil moisture and the reference one.
    The system has a variable reference depending on the stage of growth of the plant.
    Figure 3. Fuzzy control architecture Show All The soil humidity error''s membership
    function assignment, which is of high importance in fuzzy control, is based on
    the rule that the higher sensitivity membership for little error and the fine
    stability membership for larger error. Totally, there were 16 fuzzy rules in this
    system. C. Decision Support Systems In [6], a decision support system (DSS) is
    proposed for water supply prediction and control. This system collects data from
    a specific weather station. Then, collected data and weather predictions from
    three different sources are analyzed and the result is an evapotranspiration prediction
    and an estimation of plant daily development forecast for the next 10 days. A
    water distribution planning solution is proposed in [8] for irrigation in an arid
    district. Optimal water delivery scheduling for irrigation canals is implemented
    through a DSS system. The DSS structure consists of a water demand module, a supply
    module and a planning module, Fig. 4. Figure 4. DSS architecture for water supply
    scheduling, [8] Show All D. Model Predictive Control Model predictive control
    (MPC) approach is common used in industry offering a number of features: is robust
    against uncertainty system constraints can be handled is easy to accomplish tuning
    is used in multivariable control applications In MPC control strategy the future
    evolution control sequence of the system is determined based on system model by
    minimizing a cost function. The cost function is obtained by minimizing the deviation
    from set points over the prediction horizon, Fig. 5. Figure 5. MPC control Show
    All In [25] a Model Predictive Control framework for real-time irrigation scheduling
    is developed. A state space formulation of the water balance model is developed.
    The accuracy of the water balance approach is affected by uncertain measurements,
    such as evapotranspiration and precipitation and constraints such as limited water.
    The soil moisture deficit set-point tracking is accomplished by the MPC controller.
    The MPC controller also incorporates input and output constraints. The controller
    successfully tracks the commanded set-point as well as meets the constraints.
    SECTION IV. Proposed System for Irrigation Control in Vineyards Irrigation control
    strategies should be integrated in complex automation and telemetry systems. There
    are several such systems in the world, adapted on specific crops and weather.
    Two of the implemented irrigation management systems are presented further. The
    Advanced Scientific Irrigation Management application is a complex SCADA systems
    used for optimization irrigation in an arid district in USA, [6]. In order to
    implement the irrigation program, it is used a 6 six days sample code for each
    of the 369 parcels. Then, code is transferred to the SCADA master system which
    controls the 93 RTU stations by radio communications. Irrigation channels are
    controlled by a Decision Support System (DSS), as described in section III. Advantages
    of this system should be summarized as the overcome of water infiltrations, water
    costs, water-supply shortages, some specific irrigation issues. In [7] an implementation
    of an automated irrigation system, installed in Australia is presented. Efficiency
    of the irrigation system can be improved by an information infrastructure including
    sensors, actuators and supervisory control and data acquisition communication
    network. The task of the supervisory control is to ensure that the physical flow
    capacities are not exceeded. An irrigation system model is constructed based on
    the interconnection of the individual pool models. In order to achieve an entire
    irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real
    time on demand, the research and development effort has focused on controlling
    water quantity and quality in open channels. Due to knowledge and existing technologies
    in the third wave of the information processing, communication and computing,
    a new telemetry system for precision agriculture should be integrated into the
    Cyber-Physical System (CPS) concept. The CPS paradigm has two connotations. On
    the one hand, it solves the issues related to the way in which inquiry is done,
    whereas the second one is a model that underpins all specific states of the components
    of the process [4]. Considering the analysis on the control systems implemented
    over the world and the specific conditions in the Romanian context, an energy
    efficient irrigation system for water supply control in vineyards is proposed,
    Fig. 6. The irrigation management system for the precision agriculture could be
    seen as a MIMO system. The control strategy follows a fuzzy approach and it considers
    soil moisture control and the disturbances can be air temperature and evapotranspiration,
    as it is a plant disease indictor. Thus, the system must be fully interconnected
    and decentralized, being equipped with the following: One or more telemetry stations
    that establish the irrigation necessity. Considering the arguments exposed in
    the 2nd paragraph, it is of highly importance to have sensors for air and soil
    temperature, air and soil humidity and evapotranspiration computation, [26]. With
    these parameters, they could be calculated the precipitations necessity and the
    irrigations efficiency. A SCADA system (a SCADA master and clients) that receives
    all information from process and, using some specific decision algorithms, sends
    commands to actuators. It must be done a software application that collects and
    processes data from sensors and that has the capability of displaying it in a
    logical format. The main characteristics that a SCADA system for irrigation management
    must have are presented in Fig. 7. A RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) that includes
    solar panels and batteries for independent operation is used for acquisition of
    other field parameters and actuators control. The actuators consist of pumps,
    valves and other Figure 6. Proposed irrigation control system Show All Figure
    7. Main characteristics of the SCADA system in irrigation management Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusions Irrigation management systems should be focused on the
    adequate supply of water in order to increase crop productivity. This study focuses
    at first on the main parameters that must be monitored in an irrigation management
    system to discover the advantages and effects of their control. Both soil and
    air moisture and temperature are monitored with specific measurement probes and
    evapotranspiration can be calculated using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor or
    Makkink method. The control strategies for irrigation systems are classified into
    4 categories, from classical to new trends equipment that operate directly to
    irrigate the vineyards. All these are chosen for energy efficiency of the system,
    but also for efficient water management. in irrigation control: PID control, fuzzy
    control systems, decision support systems for water supply prediction and control
    and model predictive control. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal
    of an irrigation control system for vineyards, from a Cyber-Physical Systems perspective.
    The SCADA architecture allows a CPS approach and the fuzzy control strategy is
    suitable for the Romanian context. Based on the high quality of measurements,
    the system computes the water supply necessity based on a fuzzy controller. The
    communication system based on GSM modules at the field level brigs flexibility
    and ease of use for the telemetry and automation system. The system architecture
    has many other benefits such as low energy consumption, low administration costs
    and forecasting and diagnosis functions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

  description: Globally, the irrigation of crops is the largest consumptive user of
    fresh water. Water scarcity is increasing worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation
    of its use for agriculture. This necessitates the development of irrigation practices
    that are more efficient in the use of water but do not compromise crop quality
    and yield. Precision irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal
    of precision irrigation is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely
    manner and as spatially uniformly as possible. However, to maximize the benefits
    of precision irrigation, additional technologies need to be enabled and incorporated
    into agriculture. This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive decision support
    systems into precision irrigation management will enable significant advances
    in increasing the efficiency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature
    review, it is found that precision irrigation can be applied in achieving the
    environmental goals related to sustainability. The demonstrated economic benefits
    of precision irrigation in field-scale crop production is however minimal. It
    is argued that a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing
    real-time data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that
    adaptive decision support systems based on model predictive control are able to
    adequately account for the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives in arriving
    at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that significant improvements
    in crop yield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive
    control into precision irrigation decision support tools. Further improvements
    in water savings can also be realized by including deficit irrigation as part
    of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future research is
    needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deficits, developing improved
    soil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop simulation
    frameworks that can be applied to evaluate adaptive decision support strategies
    related to irrigation.

    Introduction Globally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation of crops, making
    irrigation the largest consumptive user of fresh water [1]. Over 80% of freshwater
    withdrawals in developing countries is applied in irrigation [2]. Irrigated agriculture
    provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20% of the cultivated area highlighting
    the importance of irrigation in global food security [3]. Irrigated crop production
    globally extends over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual increase
    of 1.3% [2]. Global climate change may further increase irrigation water demand
    due to a greater variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested
    that irrigation will provide 46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025,
    which was computed as 28% in 1995, resulting in a decline of rain-fed agriculture.
    Food production in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast and East
    Asia, is at present heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in
    Asia is 230 million ha, which represents over 70% of the global irrigated area.
    Of the 230 million ha of irrigated land area, 60% is located in China and India
    [3]. It is estimated that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent on
    irrigation [2]. Sarma [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water
    to produce one unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This
    implies that an improvement in water use efficiency in the developing world would
    conserve at least half of the water presently applied in irrigation. It is estimated
    that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground water
    sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources in
    a number of communities has further increased the pressure on groundwater resources.
    This has resulted in the over-abstraction of global groundwater sources which
    is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per annum [2]. A global shortage in freshwater
    sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve water management and increase
    water use efficiency. This has necessitated greater regulatory demands for environmental
    protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported that only half of the total freshwater
    volume abstracted for irrigation globally reaches the targeted crops [2]. These
    have brought about the need to devise procedures to use the limited water more
    efficiently while maximizing crop yield and quality. Conventional irrigation practice
    involves applying water uniformly over every part of the field without taking
    into account the spatial variability in soil and crop water needs; this consequently
    leads to overirrigation in some parts of the field while other parts of the field
    are underirrigated [8]. The risks associated with overirrigation include surface
    runoff, deep percolation and leaching of nitrates and nutrients. Those associated
    with underirrigation are more subjective and include reduction in crop yields
    and quality, as well as inefficient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs
    for crop production [9]. The irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’
    in order to optimize the water input and crop response, while minimizing adverse
    environmental impacts. Precision irrigation is an evolving field with active interest
    by both industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by some researchers
    as the use of efficient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it
    as the variable application of irrigation based on predefined maps or sensor feedback
    [10]. Smith et al. [11] suggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate determination,
    quantification of crop water needs and the precise application of the optimal
    water volume at the required time. This implies that varying water application
    spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of ‘precision’ in the
    irrigation process. Hence, precision irrigation can be defined as the process
    of accounting for the field-scale spatial variability in crop water need and applying
    the right amount of water to match the spatial crop water need at the right time
    [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation include increased crop
    yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efficiency/savings, reduction
    of energy costs and reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12]. Pierce [13]
    viewed precision irrigation as a tool for improving sustainability in irrigated
    agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use efficiency and improved
    environmental quality of irrigated fields. The balance of several core aspects
    is however important for the successful implementation of a robust precision irrigation
    system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves efforts on real-time
    monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation and control of the
    irrigation application equipment. Research has been mainly focused on the sensing
    and control aspects of precision irrigation with much advancements in the last
    decade [12]. Research is limited, however, in the development of appropriate irrigation
    scheduling tools for the precision irrigation process [14]. Irrigation scheduling
    is the process by which a producer determines when to apply irrigation and the
    amount of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that
    the irrigation scheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision
    support system for irrigation management. A robust decision support system is
    important in the successful implementation of precision irrigation. The need for
    a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions of when, where
    and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in climatic inputs,
    the time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment and operational
    limitations cannot be overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17] noted that the development
    of an optimal decision support tool for precision irrigation will involve the
    combination of appropriate modeling and management tools. The decision support
    tools available for precision irrigation management are presently inflexible and
    difficult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios [18]. In recent years, there
    has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),
    and our intention is not to repeat the areas they addressed. Rather, our aim is
    to provide an in-depth technical analysis of the considerations necessary for
    the development of a practical and robust decision support system for precision
    irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated agriculture. To that end,
    the review will focus on the following critical aspects of precision irrigation:
    (1) monitoring considerations; (2) present limitations and state of the art in
    decision support; and (3) opportunities for improving sustainability. We will
    however include brief sections on the concept of spatial variability and the control
    of water application in precision irrigation. 2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term
    Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture The underlying argument for precision irrigation
    is the presence of within-field spatial variability that influences crop water
    demand. The spatial variability in crop water demand may have a direct influence
    on the crop yield, quality and the environmental quality of irrigated fields [19].
    The soil water presents the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake
    and therefore its spatial variability will have a direct influence on crop water
    demand. Soil and landscape characteristics like soil texture, topography, abiotic
    and management factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary
    spatially across a field [11]. These have a direct influence on the water-holding
    capacity of the soil. Hedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation
    in the soil water retention characteristics was strongly correlated with the spatial
    variation in soil texture across a field, noting that areas with heavier soils
    within a field had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with
    light textured soils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping
    soil properties, specifically electrical conductivity mapping, can reveal within-field
    variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation management. These have
    been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8]. Readers
    are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity
    mapping. The variability in yield across a field has also been found to be strongly
    correlated with the spatial variability in water available for crop use. The spatial
    variability in crop yield is a function of the interplay between water stress,
    nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24]. The yield
    map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map. These similarities
    can be explained through the spatial variability of soil properties that exists
    across a field. The water-holding capacity of the soil is a major factor affecting
    yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong correlation to soil EC [25].
    Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability in soil water retention characteristics
    played a dominant role in explaining the spatial yield variability observed in
    soybean. Martinez-Casasnovas et al. [27] suggested yield mapping as an important
    tool in variable rate irrigation management. A robust precision irrigation system
    will be able to meet the spatially varying crop water demand across a field at
    the right time. This requires accurate knowledge of the within-field variability.
    This is addressed by applying the concept of irrigation management zones/units
    in precision irrigation. The irrigation management zones are a group of homogeneous
    units with similar soil water retention characteristics [21]. It is however important
    that these management zones are large enough to be managed individually while
    remaining relatively homogeneous in order to reflect the spatial soil variation
    across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based on real-time
    sensor data has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying infrared
    thermometry/thermography to assess the spatial variation in crop canopy temperature
    across a field [28]. The crop canopy temperature of a healthy transpiring crop
    will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop transpiration is reduced
    as a result of water deficits, the crop canopy temperature is expected to increase.
    The characterization of crop water status as a function of the canopy and ambient
    temperature is the basis for using infrared thermometry/thermography as a mapping
    tool for precision irrigation [29]. Shaughnessy et al. [30] and Evett et al. [31]
    have successfully applied this procedure in generating dynamic maps to guide variable
    rate water application for field crops grown under a center pivot system. It should,
    however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements are usually taken over
    a short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected to experience the highest
    evaporative demand. Hence, this method is well suited for crop production systems
    in which the soil moisture dynamics has relatively long time constants. 3. Spatial
    Scales of Irrigation Management Centre pivot, lateral move and low energy precision
    application (LEPA) moving machines can be modified to apply spatially variable
    irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly suited to variable rate water
    application because of their current level of automation and large coverage area
    with a single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation systems also have potential to be
    deployed for variable rate water application as they can be very accurate and
    can be automated based on sensor feedback [2]. Implementing a spatially varied
    irrigation system requires an understanding of the characteristics of the irrigation
    application system deployed including the spatial scales covered by the water
    application equipment. The spatial scale associated with the variability in crop
    water requirements and its impact on yield should also be identified [32]. O’Shaughnessy
    et al. [33] suggested that the size and numbers of irrigation management zones
    that can be controlled in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall
    flexibility of the system. For moving application systems, the width of the management
    zone is dependent on the number of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled
    set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single solenoid valve) and the length will
    be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the traveling sprinkler.
    The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns between management
    zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume applied. Raine and McCarthy
    [32] noted that the spray diameter and overlap achieved by moving application
    systems make it impossible to target water applications on a single crop basis
    using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that the economic benefits of
    spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration even when the
    system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint. The spatial scales
    associated with moving and fixed irrigation systems is presented in Table 1. Smith
    et al. [11] concluded that the spatial resolution of a precision irrigation system
    will be influenced by the spatial scales associated with the application system,
    spatial resolution of the infield sensors and the spatial scales associated with
    the variability in crop water requirements. Table 1. Spatial scales of fixed and
    moving irrigation systems. 4. Control of Water Application in Precision Irrigation
    The water application system used in the precision irrigation process must be
    able to control the water application volume applied per unit time to each defined
    irrigation management unit within a field [13]. The development of variable rate
    water application systems has been mostly focused on continuous move systems [11].
    The control of water application on continuous move systems (centre pivot, linear
    move, boom and reel) is based on databases of spatially referenced data defining
    irrigation management units [20]. The volume of water applied to each management
    unit can be achieved by varying the application rate of sprinklers or controlling
    the ground speed of continuous move systems [13]. The application rate of sprinklers
    is mostly varied through the pulse modulation of the sprinkler nozzles. This involves
    the application of normally opened solenoid valves to control flow through an
    individual or group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the flow of water either
    on or off at a sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth
    within a specified cycle time. The cycle time is the total number of switching
    (either to on or off phase) required by the solenoid valves during a pulse cycle
    [34]. Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control on a linear
    move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems
    indicated a satisfactory performance over a range of water application rates.
    They however noted a problem with sprinkler overlap at the edge of the irrigation
    management units. The variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous move
    system can also be achieved by varying its travel speed. The sprinklers on the
    manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated at a specified flow rate
    and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the application
    depth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application depth [35].
    This type of system cannot be applied in situations where variable application
    depths are needed along the length of the irrigation system [34]. Al-Karadsheh
    [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving variable water application
    rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers was reported
    to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed to travel a
    minimum distance of 16 m before a desired change in application volume can be
    reached. This suggests that this system is not suitable for use in applications
    where the management units are small in scale. The adaptation of fixed irrigation
    systems for variable rate water application has been achieved (e.g., [36]). Variable
    water rate application in these systems is usually achieved either by individual
    nozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers are referred to [13]
    for a comprehensive review of such systems. Miranda et al. [37] described a distributed
    control system implemented to achieve variable rate water application in a fixed
    irrigation system operating in predefined management zones. Their results indicated
    that the system was able to apply the irrigation volume required in each zone.
    Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable rate water application setup
    for a fixed irrigation system capable of zone-specific irrigation of strawberries.
    Individual nozzle control in a micro-sprinkler system has been demonstrated by
    Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual control of 54 nodes in a vineyard
    with the system. The nozzle connected to each node was capable of achieving a
    unique water application volume. They concluded that the water requirements of
    each defined zone in the vineyard can be individually met by the irrigation system.
    The authors reported a payback period of between 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.
    5. Monitoring The routine or continuous monitoring of moisture fluxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere
    system is a fundamental aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture.
    Monitoring can essentially be viewed as the application of various sensing technologies
    in determining and characterizing the spatiotemporal field-scale moisture dynamics
    and plant water use. These sensing methods can be classified under three broad
    headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40]. Soil-based sensing
    typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture content or
    potential. This information is then used to infer the amount of water available
    for plant use and its temporal dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the
    use of the crop evapotranspiration to determine the temporal crop water use. The
    evapotranspiration is determined using climatic variables such as radiation, rainfall
    and wind speed [41,42]. The plant-based sensing involves the determination of
    plant water status which is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements
    of canopy temperature, stomatal resistance, sap flow, leaf turgor pressure, stem
    diameter and leaf thickness are used to infer plant water status [43]. Recent
    advances in remote sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial
    nature of both soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact
    technologies that are capable of sensing radiation reflected or emitted from agricultural
    fields. They are deployed using satellites, aerial platforms and tractors [44].
    These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited for regional
    soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies
    that can be applied in monitoring field-scale soil and crop water dynamics. Readers
    are referred to [44,46] for a comprehensive review of remote sensing technologies
    applicable in precision agriculture. 5.1. Soil-Based Sensing The knowledge of
    soil moisture fluxes comprising of the depletion and refill of soil water can
    be used to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool in irrigation
    scheduling and management decisions [47]. Several methods have been developed
    for measuring soil moisture content; they are indirect methods which rely on the
    strong relationship between a particular property of the soil and the soil moisture
    content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring and are non-destructive
    [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied method for monitoring the
    temporal dynamics of field-scale soil moisture is the dielectric-based method
    [20]. This is because of the ease of their deployment in large-scale soil moisture
    sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper deployment and management of this technology
    can optimize the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Consequently, this section
    will outline a brief description of this method including a consideration of the
    factors affecting sensor performance. For a more detailed description of other
    state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].
    5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors Dielectric soil moisture sensors operate
    by exploiting the dielectric properties of soil and its constituents [52]. The
    relative dielectric permittivity of a substance is used to describe the effect
    of an electromagnetic field on its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless
    constant greater than one, made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent
    relative dielectric permittivity of soil, ε′ soil is a function of its constituents
    majorly being water, air and solid particles. The relative dielectric permittivity
    of the other constituents except water has a negligible effect as they have small
    values in the range of 1–7. The one of water, ε′ water having a value of approximately
    80 has the most remarkable effect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric
    moisture content (VMC) to ε′ soil using empirical equations at a frequency range
    of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency range, ε′ soil is highly
    stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of soil
    [54]. A range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide a non-destructive
    in situ measurement of soil moisture contents. They include time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) sensors, time domain transmission (TDT) sensors and capacitance sensors.
    5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors The
    accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important in the precision irrigation
    process. Over estimation of soil moisture status may lead to a delay in irrigation
    scheduling decisions and consequently affect crop yield and quality. Underestimation
    of soil moisture status on the other hand may lead to application of irrigation
    too often or when not required by the crops. This will result in water/energy
    wastage and adverse environmental effects. Dielectric soil moisture sensors measure
    the soil moisture content for the soil volume corresponding to their sphere of
    influence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric soil moisture
    sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture, bulk density
    and temperature. A variation in any of these factors around the sphere of influence
    of the dielectric sensor will have an effect on its performance. These properties
    vary with location and depth in a soil profile and it is important to take them
    into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors [55]. These sensors
    often rely on site-specific calibration, but they often come with ‘universal’
    calibrations which can be used where absolute accuracy is not required. The accuracy
    of calibration equations supplied by manufacturers of these sensors are usually
    between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied in non-saline soils [56]. Site-specific
    calibration equations which are developed by comparing the sensor output to gravimetrically
    derived soil moisture content can be applied when a higher level of accuracy is
    required [57]. In addition, for capacitance type probes, it is essential that
    the probe access tubes are fitted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust
    soil water measurements. For a detailed technical description of factors affecting
    the performance of dielectric sensors, readers are referred to [58,59]. 5.2. Proximal
    Sensing and Mapping of Soil Moisture The recent advances in rapid mapping and
    positioning technologies enables the spatial characterization of soil moisture
    retention properties to inform precision irrigation decisions. The electromagnetic
    induction (EM) technique is used in combination with accurate positioning systems
    to quantify soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides
    a highly accurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2]. The EM sensor maps the soil’s
    apparent EC which is influenced by soil texture and moisture in non-saline soils
    [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.
    Based on the EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different parts
    of the field. Topographic features that are likely to influence field-scale soil
    moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60]. The EC maps enable the grouping
    of discrete units known as management units with similar available water-holding
    capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting soil moisture
    monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The data from soil moisture
    sensors located in the management units can also be used in generating dynamic
    application maps based on a relationship between the soil moisture depletion and
    the mapped EC values. These application maps serve as an input into the precision
    irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule [21] applied soil moisture sensors
    and an EC map in generating dynamic water status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated
    maize field. Daccache et al. [8] applied a similar method in producing dynamic
    soil moisture maps for various fields. The electric resistivity tomography technique
    can also be applied in deriving the EC map of a field. Hedley et al. [2] reported
    that the method has a good vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a
    moving platform for rapid non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et
    al. [62] in positioning soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.
    The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the field-scale
    soil moisture status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation
    system for mapping soil moisture in a field. The GPR is however affected by high
    clay content, is not amenable to automation and requires further development to
    improve its viability in precision irrigation applications [63]. The deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques
    enables the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate
    water application. 5.3. Weather-Based Sensing Weather-based sensing involves the
    use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative of the crops’
    daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to the
    air from the soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation or applied
    irrigation. Transpiration accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the
    subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves, required for
    metabolic cooling of the leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf overheating
    [41]. Evapotranspiration is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation
    of water from the soil, evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration
    [64]. The evaporation and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often
    difficult to distinguish. The predominance of each of these processes however
    varies at different crop growth stages. At the initial crop growth stage, water
    is lost mainly in form of evaporation from the soil surface. As the development
    of the crop progresses, transpiration becomes the major medium of water loss to
    the atmosphere [45]. The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor
    pressure deficit of the atmosphere at any given time and wind speed. It is also
    influenced by soil water content, the rate at which water can be taken up from
    the soil by the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth
    stage) [64]. Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET
    process. The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales
    is appropriate for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process.
    The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM)
    equation presents a procedure for computing hourly or daily ET values using standard
    climatological measurements of solar radiation, air temperature, humidity and
    wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass surface [41].
    These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on a specific
    field or from a metrological network. The equation provides a basis from which
    reference ET (ET from the well-watered grass surface) for different time periods
    can be calculated and to which ET from other crops can be computed using crop
    coefficients, K c [66]. The crop coefficients are specific to each crop and crop
    canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The K c curve defined
    for a crop over its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar climates.
    The K c is however dependent on the canopy dynamics including cover fraction,
    leaf area index and greenness which may vary across regions with similar climates
    [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using the standard FAO-PM
    crop coefficient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a relatively easy procedure
    for determining the temporal dynamics of crop water use. The crop coefficient
    used in determining the actual ET of a particular crop however needs to be estimated
    at each growth stage. It is noted in Allen et al. [41] that reference ET can be
    overestimated by as much as 20% during conditions of low evaporative demand. Remote
    sensing provides a means of overcoming the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefficient
    approach of estimating crop ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water
    use as influenced by actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and
    field spatial variability [68]. The remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) computed from crop canopy reflectance measurements in the red and
    near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in computing
    accurate crop coefficients for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70]
    has demonstrated the use of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed
    NDVI in estimating the water use of cotton. A similar procedure has also been
    demonstrated by Farg et al. [67] for estimating the daily water use of wheat.
    The surface renewal analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the
    real-time temporal dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method
    is used to determine the sensible heat which can then be applied to the energy
    balance equation to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is based on
    analyzing the temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in
    heat content of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel
    comes in contact with the crop canopy, the air temperature remains constant for
    a brief time period known as the quiescent period. The temperature of the air
    parcel however increases after this time period as energy is transferred to it
    from the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel
    is replaced by cooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature of
    the air shows a sharp drop [72]. A high frequency trace of this temperature renewal
    event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying structure function theory to the
    ramp function enables the determination of the sensible heat flux. The instrumentation
    requirement for an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter fine wire
    thermocouples or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data
    acquisition system (2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements
    are also required to obtain the other parameters in the energy balance equation.
    The SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above
    the crop canopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb
    all the momentum transferred to it by the ambient airflow [73]. This assumption
    introduces errors in ET estimates over fields with variable canopy structures.
    Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be applied for estimating
    ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from the environment.
    The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance system or a lysimeter.
    This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment. The SR methodology
    proposed by Castellvi [75], however, does not require calibration. Rosa and Tanny
    [76], Shapland and Snyder [72], and Rosa et al. [77] have reported highly accurate
    hourly ET estimates from various crops using a surface renewal analysis system.
    5.4. Plant-Based Sensing The importance of plant-based monitoring becomes emphasized
    when studying the effect of water deficit on plants and its relation to plant
    water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use can be monitored using a
    number of plant-based methods. They include methods that require direct contact
    with the plant and those that require only proximal contact with the plants [78].
    The contact sensors are useful in monitoring the temporal dynamics of the plant
    water status while the proximal sensors are capable of assessing the spatial nature
    of crop water status across a field and hence well suited for the precision irrigation
    process [11]. A good understanding of the various aspects of plant water status
    and plant drought physiology is important in the successful application of these
    systems. Readers are directed to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based
    sensing methods applicable in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems
    measure either the plant water content, plant water potential or the plant physiological
    response to moisture deficits. A summary of various plant-based sensing systems
    is given in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require skilled manpower
    and considerable management time for their operation. Table 2. Summary of plant-based
    monitoring methods. 5.5. Thermal Sensing Plant canopy temperature is a widely
    accepted variable indicative of plant water status. The stomata controls evaporative
    cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing environmental
    conditions. It closes due to increased water deficits and a reduction in plant
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement
    of the crop canopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized
    using an index such as the crop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining
    the plant water status and its response to water deficits [79]. The CWSI is a
    well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature
    as a function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deficits
    [92]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a function of atmospheric vapor
    deficit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper and lower
    temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop
    under the same prevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless
    value of between 0 and 1, with a value of 0 indicating a well-watered crop and
    a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93]. Biotic factors can
    also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water use
    and canopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and morphology
    which in turn affects the optical properties of the crop canopy [94]. In order
    to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a tool for assessing plant water
    status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as water stress)
    and biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation). Multiband optical
    sensors could be applied in detecting various crop diseases and crop infestation
    within a field by computing vegetation indices based on canopy reflectance measurements
    [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et al. [95] for detecting citrus greening
    and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting infestation of green bugs and aphids in
    wheat. It may be useful to outfit precision irrigation systems with these sensors.
    The main advantage of thermal sensing for precision irrigation application is
    related to the non-contact and real-time capability of the system. Infrared thermometry
    and thermography provide the opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop
    water status which can guide in variable rate irrigation management. The use of
    thermal sensing for guiding zone-specific water application has been demonstrated
    as noted in Section 2. A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach
    is the establishment of the baseline temperatures. In climates in which the air
    humidity is often high, variations in wind speed and net radiation introduce significant
    errors in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97]. A number
    of studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility
    of applying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water status
    in humid regions. Jones [98] provides an excellent summary of these research efforts.
    They include the use of well-watered plots to substitute for empirical non-water
    stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots are rarely available in
    practice. The use of artificial reference surfaces for measuring baseline temperatures
    has been proposed but it is reported that these artificial reference surfaces
    differ significantly in thermal and radiative properties in comparison to real
    leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy resistance of well-watered
    plants has also been investigated but this is limited by the difficulties encountered
    in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence canopy resistance. The possibility
    of including a wide range of metrological data including net radiation and vapor
    pressure deficit in deriving CWSI models for humid climates has also been investigated.
    The mathematical complexity typical of the models however limit their practical
    application. Another problem commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements
    of canopy temperature in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil
    temperature and other background temperature including the sky and stems in the
    measured canopy temperature. This usually leads to errors in estimation of the
    canopy temperature as the soil and background temperature are usually many degrees
    different from the canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow
    acceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned to view only single leaves
    as a solution to this problem. It has however been found that the temperature
    estimates of single leaves determined by this method is mostly not representative
    of the temperature of the plant canopy. A dense deployment of infrared sensors
    may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive in terms of cost for practical
    applications. The advancements in the field of thermal imagery and the recent
    availability of low-cost thermal cameras has presented the possibility of overcoming
    the problems associated with the inclusion of soil and background temperatures
    in the measured canopy temperature. Thermal imagery allows for the average temperature
    of a defined area to be obtained and also the separation of background temperature
    from the area of interest. The temperature of a large number of individual leaves
    making up a canopy can be included in an image while the soil and background temperature
    can be discarded by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al. [100] has demonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water
    status in a commercial orchard in Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping
    of field-scale crop water status by deploying thermal imaging equipment on an
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Plant-based sensing methods including thermal sensing
    only provide information on the need for irrigation and provide no information
    on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used in combination with
    soil-based sensing for this reason [19]. 6. Decision Support A decision support
    system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a framework for incorporating
    various tools and techniques for site-specific irrigation decisions. The widespread
    commercial adoption of precision irrigation will be predicated on the development
    of robust and optimal decision support systems [19]. A number of decision support
    systems schedule irrigation at predefined intervals and apply predefined irrigation
    volumes. They do not incorporate any form of sensor feedback on plant water status,
    soil water status and climatic variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely
    designed based on heuristics and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested
    that this is an inefficient approach often leading to overwatering and waste of
    fertilizer and other supplemental crop inputs. Closed-loop irrigation strategies
    aim to irrigate: when the soil moisture content reaches a certain threshold [103,104,105];
    when plant sensors indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback
    from crop simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological
    response or economic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies
    have been shown to improve water use efficiency in the production of horticultural
    crops under protected environments. Environmental conditions in such production
    systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the stochastic
    plant response often encountered in field-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh
    et al. [110] implemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors for
    closed-loop irrigation control in a pot-in-pot nursery. A significant reduction
    in water use was achieved by the system. The authors also reported a 2.7-year
    payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings of
    83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected crop
    production system. They noted that there was less occurrence of plant diseases
    in the nursery due to the elimination of over-watering. Saavoss et al. [112] reported
    a 65% increase in profit due to the implementation of a wireless sensor network-based
    closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors noted that the increase in
    profit was due to improvement in crop quality and yield resulting from the precise
    control of irrigation applications. In field-scale crop production, the crop needs
    vary over time and space due to both biotic and abiotic factors [9]. McCarthy
    et al. [113] noted that in these crop production systems, closed-loop strategies
    are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics, the stochastic nature of climatic
    variables and crop response, and the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere
    system. This last point is especially due to crop growth, crop management and
    infestation of pests and diseases. The closed-loop systems are also unable to
    consider equipment and other operational limitations. McCarthy et al. [114] concluded
    that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with the ability of
    accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the field. The decision
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions
    in response to crop physiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation
    systems and water supply limitations, economic considerations and the quality
    of sensor feedback. 6.1. Adaptive Decision Support The characteristics of a cropping
    system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties that will typically
    vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil properties (due to addition
    of nutrients and other management processes) and climate. This will have a direct
    influence on the irrigation timing and volume required for optimal crop growth
    [11]. An adaptive decision support system is able to continuously re-adjust the
    irrigation scheduling algorithm in order to retain the desired performance of
    the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive decision support system is able to utilize
    historical or real-time sensor data to arrive at irrigation timing and volume
    that adequately accounts for the temporal and spatial variability in the field
    [114]. In control theory an adaptive control system is generally accepted as a
    control system able to adjust its controller parameters based on sensor feedback
    from a process, such that the controlled process behaves in a desirable way [11].
    McCarthy et al. [108] noted that an adaptive decision support system for irrigation
    may either be sensor-based if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation
    strategy or model-based if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation
    decisions. The development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity
    to improve sustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and
    crop productivity. They will also enhance synergistic applications of data available
    from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at optimal irrigation scheduling
    decisions [108]. In this section we will present a brief discussion on state-of-the-art
    of adaptive decision support systems. We will thereafter discuss the opportunities
    these systems present in improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. Readers
    are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview on the application of advanced
    process control to irrigation, details on methods of operation and a consideration
    of fundamental control concepts as they apply to irrigation scheduling. 6.1.1.
    Mechanistic Models A number of irrigation decision support systems are based on
    complex physical models which closely resemble the actual physical system [115].
    They are able to incorporate the physiological and morphological representation
    of the plant into the decision support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116] described
    an irrigation scheduling system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model,
    MAESTRA (Multi-Array Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy
    photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics
    and environmental variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant
    transpiration. They reported that the model-based tool applied between 18% and
    56% more water than a sensing-based method for scheduling irrigation in four species.
    They, however, noted that the model-based approach produced greater tree growth.
    Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining
    the crop aerodynamic characteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith
    equation for calculating the actual crop ET. A major drawback of these mechanistic
    models is that they include static parameters which, once identified, are assumed
    to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as
    the cropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors. 6.1.2.
    Simulations Crop simulation models based on first principle physical models of
    crop phenology, soil physics and hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop
    response to irrigation and cropping system management [115]. These simulation
    models provide the opportunity to evaluate the benefit of several precision irrigation
    strategies as they eliminate the need for time-consuming field experiments [118].
    They can be interfaced with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors
    and weather data to determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can
    also be used in predicting the yield impact of an irrigation strategy. This is
    achieved by employing weather forecast data in computing a daily soil moisture
    balance and assessing the impact of soil moisture deficits on crop growth [118].
    DeJonge et al. [14] investigated the effect of variable rate irrigation management
    on corn production in Iowa using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared
    for a period of 28 years under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled
    uniform irrigation and precision irrigation. They reported no significant difference
    in corn yield and water use between the uniform irrigation and precision irrigation
    scenarios. Thorp et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing
    variable rate management practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield.
    The platform enabled the evaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop
    performance in predefined management zones. These systems are however incapable
    of real-time decision support and can only be applied using historical data. McCarthy
    et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time decision
    support in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable of incorporating
    real-time data input from field sensors in arriving at irrigation decisions. The
    combination of different sensor inputs into the simulation framework enables adaptive
    decision support with the system being able to re-adjust irrigation decisions
    based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies. Simulation
    models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration and
    validation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available for this
    endeavour often limit the use of the platforms to specific crops. 6.1.3. Artificial
    Intelligence Artificial intelligence presents the potential of solving problems
    in precision irrigation which are complex, non-linear and ill-defined [119]. Artificial
    intelligence algorithms are able to emulate the human decision-making process
    when applied to a particular problem domain. They have been deployed for implementing
    adaptive decision support in irrigation in form of artificial neural networks,
    fuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed success to date [118,119,120]. ● Artificial
    Neural Networks Artificial neural networks (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures
    employed in modeling when the underlying data relationship is not well defined.
    ANN are able to identify and learn correlations between input data and corresponding
    target output values. They are able to predict the outcome of new independent
    data sets making them a useful tool in predictive modeling [121]. ANN are well
    suited for the irrigation decision support problem that can often be complex and
    stochastic in nature. These networks are also adaptive in nature and are able
    to continuously learn in order to provide optimal solutions to target problems
    in dynamic systems. Karasekreter et al. [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling
    irrigation in a strawberry orchard using soil moisture and its physical properties
    as model inputs. The system was able to achieve water savings of 20.5% and an
    energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however require large datasets for training and are
    unable to describe the physical dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited
    in real-time decision support tools. ● Fuzzy Logic Fuzzy logic is an artificial
    intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate it to human
    experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made up of a set
    used to classify input data into membership classes, a decision rule that is applied
    to each set which culminates in a human-like decision output from the system [123].
    A detailed description of the process is given in [124]. Mousa and Abdullah [123]
    successfully applied a fuzzy logic model in scheduling irrigation in drip and
    sprinkler irrigation systems using ET, soil moisture data and crop growth stage
    as model inputs. Prakashgoud and Desai [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using
    soil moisture data, leaf wetness and climatological data as model inputs in order
    to implement irrigation scheduling decisions. The system was capable of maintaining
    soil moisture thresholds in the specified range. Giusti and Marsili-Libelli [125]
    described an adaptive irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy
    logic. The system incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an
    inference system for maintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold.
    The system was reported to adapt irrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty
    and produced water savings of 13.55% over a simulation period of 168 days. The
    accuracy of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the
    system. They also lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability
    limited to the range of training data used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.
    [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision making with a fuzzy system
    an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support. ● Expert
    Systems An expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process a human
    expert would employ in a decision-making process in his/her field of expertise.
    It captures the human decision-making expertise and heuristics representing it
    in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically consists of a
    knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning tool
    [127]. Expert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are of a
    complex nature. They are also well suited to dealing with incomplete and uncertain
    data [128]. This makes them well suited for irrigation decision support which
    often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions. Expert systems
    applied in irrigation decision support can be classified as either ‘expert systems
    proper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the application of expert
    systems in irrigation decision support is given in [128,129]. The ‘expert systems
    proper’ class of irrigation decision support tools schedule irrigation based on
    soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider the time-varying
    nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest infestation) to arrive
    at optimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable to account for the stochastic
    nature of climatic variables and are not well suited for real-time applications
    [129]. Hybrid expert systems which are also referred to as model-based expert
    systems combine algorithmic techniques and a knowledge-based component in solving
    problems relevant to its application domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that
    optimal irrigation decision can be made by combining expert knowledge with data
    feedback from infield sensors, data-driven models and crop simulation models [130].
    Thomson and Ross [131] described a model-based expert system designed for decision
    support in irrigation management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture
    sensors to adjust the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth
    simulation model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation.
    The system was reported to maintain soil moisture at the defined thresholds. Goumopoulos
    et al. [38] developed an expert system-based adaptive decision support platform
    for zone-specific irrigation of strawberry plants. The system includes a wireless
    sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback for the decision
    support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable of inferring
    new rules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets. The system was
    reported to reduce irrigation water consumption by around 20%. A hybrid expert
    system based on real-time soil moisture data with the capability of incorporating
    plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132]. The performance of an expert
    system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge acquisition
    process. An error in this process will drastically affect the system reliability
    and its performance. 6.1.4. Learning Control Learning control decision support
    strategies perform systems identification using sensor feedback without defining
    a mathematical model [113]. Systems identification models a dynamic system based
    on a time series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview
    on the theory of systems identification is presented in [134]. Iterative learning
    control can be applied in systems with ill-defined models that operate repetitively
    and assume the same initial condition after each iteration. It is well suited
    to the irrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive
    problem over the crop season. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere
    system can also be viewed as an ill-defined problem. The strategy is also able
    to improve system performance by eliminating the effects of a repeating disturbance
    with undefined dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured crop response
    that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes in crop water
    use and weather conditions are not considered [113]. McCarthy et al. [114] noted
    that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be the inefficient systems
    identification resulting from the slow system dynamics of the crop system in response
    to irrigation events. This results from the evaluation of the effect of only one
    irrigation volume on plant response at any water application event. They suggested
    that this drawback may be eliminated by applying the process of iterative hill
    climbing control. This learning control strategy employs an adaptive varied identification
    process. A range of irrigation volumes are applied at each irrigation event to
    a number of test cells on the field. The response in the test cell that best matches
    the desired system performance is identified as the optimal irrigation process.
    They reported that the iterative hill climbing control procedure was capable of
    maximizing cotton yield when used with a combination of plant and soil sensors
    to provide feedback for the identification procedure. Their conclusions were however
    based on results from a simulation study and a field-based validation of the procedure
    was not reported. The results of the learning control procedure are based solely
    on sensor measurements and may be largely affected by sensor drift as a model
    of the crop response is not developed from the identification procedure. This
    method can be considered more of a “brute force” approach than a scientifically
    based approach to scheduling irrigation. 6.1.5. Model Predictive Control Model
    predictive control (MPC) is an industrial control approach employed in decision
    support for large-scale multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has
    been successfully implemented in the food industry, petrochemical industry and
    power generation among others [135]. Model predictive control employs a plant
    model and optimization algorithm to calculate plant inputs in order to achieve
    a future value of a performance criterion. The system performance is predicted
    over a finite horizon subject to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of
    the plant [101]. Readers are directed to [135,136,137] for an in-depth review
    of the theory of model predictive control and its application in various industries.
    In the case of irrigation, applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input
    will be the irrigation amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deficit,
    and both crop ET and precipitation values will be considered as disturbances as
    they cannot be controlled. A prediction of future input values and disturbances
    is required in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system output [138].
    This highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the
    MPC framework for irrigation decision support. Model predictive control appears
    to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support. The irrigation
    problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output
    constraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds and the desired plant response
    to water deficits [135]. Ooi et al. [139], Lozoya et al. [101] and Saleem et al.
    [135] described a model predictive control framework for irrigation scheduling
    based on a soil moisture balance model. They employed a system identification
    procedure to generate a grey box model of the soil–plant–atmosphere system with
    a network of soil moisture sensors providing real-time feedback to the control
    algorithm. They all reported the ability of the MPC platform to sufficiently predict
    crop irrigation needs and also observations of significant water savings. The
    authors of the discussed systems however fail to account for the stochastic nature
    of rainfall and crop water use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138] noted
    that an adequate consideration of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into
    the water balance model employed in the MPC framework will improve the capability
    of the MPC system. Delgoda et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above
    MPC frameworks by employing disturbance affine feedback control, an uncertainty
    modelling technique widely applied in MPC to account for the stochastic nature
    of rainfall and crop water use. A simple order model of soil moisture dynamics
    is included in the system to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence
    accounting for the time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors
    reported an optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable
    uncertainties in climatic variables exist. 6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications
    in Adaptive Decision Support Manufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators
    are showing considerable interest in developing innovative tools that will further
    optimize irrigation water use. A sensor integration project is described by AgSmarts
    (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation systems are equipped with sensors which
    provide data on crop growth stage and soil profile. Aquaspy soil moisture sensors
    (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the field also provide data
    on soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing and calculation
    of irrigation volumes. These irrigation decisions are automatically adjusted based
    on the varying water requirements at each crop growth stage [140]. Omica, Italy
    has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental and soil moisture
    sensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support irrigation decisions.
    The sensors are interfaced to a geo-referenced decision support system which enables
    zone-specific irrigation management. The system is able to predict crop yield
    based on irrigation timing and application volumes combined with historical yield
    data. This can then be applied in optimizing the decision support system towards
    achieving a desired crop yield goal. Most decision support systems presently produced
    for commercial use provide on/off irrigation control based on specified thresholds
    and plant/crop sensor feedback. The incorporation of predictive models into these
    systems will enhance the possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop
    yield [141]. 7. Opportunities for Improving Sustainability Sustainability is premised
    on the principle of meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising
    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture
    is focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse
    impact on the environment [142]. Pretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture
    integrates the main goals of environmental health and economic profitability.
    The efficient and effective use of water is considered the main driver for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water
    for irrigating crops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional
    irrigation practices apply water uniformly over a field resulting in a high volume
    of water use. Overirrigation may also result from this practice which causes leaching
    of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important consideration
    would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and irrigation
    application equipment. Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability
    in irrigated agriculture. This can be eliminated by applying precise irrigation
    volumes to reduce surface runoff. Precision irrigation presents a promising platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This is especially hinged
    on the possibility of eliminating the adverse environmental impacts related to
    conventional irrigation practices with the adoption of precision irrigation. The
    economic profitability of the adoption of precision irrigation is however a very
    important point to consider. This will be manifested in terms of improved crop
    yields and increased water savings including the associated reduction in energy
    consumption resulting from the optimal matching of irrigation inputs to the spatial
    water demands of the field, thus reducing costs [11]. Precision irrigation is
    predicated on the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially across
    a field. In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also
    due to physiological factors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed
    that varying water application across the field to meet this spatial crop water
    need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs. Smith
    et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial crop
    production is not readily found in literature. Evans and King [18] reviewed much
    of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the improvements in crop yield
    and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested that the
    greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased utilization
    of stored moisture and in-season precipitation. Results from simulation- and field-based
    case studies they reviewed showed water savings of 0% to 26% for well-watered
    crop production employing precision irrigation strategies. No significant improvements
    in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision irrigation were reported.
    They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision irrigation is more
    suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may have greater potential
    in reducing irrigation water use in humid climates when irrigating to maximally
    utilize in-season precipitation. They further noted that the economic benefit
    of adopting precision irrigation for field-scale crop production is limited. This
    is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and management is much greater than
    the revenue improvements achieved as a result of improved yield and water savings.
    The payback period of implementing the technology may also exceed the useful life
    of the water application equipment, typically placed at 15 years. A payback period
    ranging from 5 to 20 years is noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision
    irrigation for crop production in New Zealand. Evans et al. [145] reviewed the
    adoption trends of spatially varied irrigation in the USA covering a period of
    20 years. They noted that about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems
    in the USA were fitted with variable rate water application technology. They suggested
    higher net returns on investment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation
    by growers. Growers that had adopted the technology reported no significant savings
    in water and energy use in non-limiting water situations. They noted that in more
    than 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management, the
    economic benefit was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal
    water savings (5%–15%) which is insufficient to realize a payback for the initial
    investment in the water application technology. They concluded that an economic
    strategy that optimizes net return rather than total returns for the technology
    should be adopted as a long-term investment goal. Heeren et al. [146] conducted
    a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs through the adoption
    of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated fields in Nebraska, USA.
    The study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining undepleted
    available water. They noted that the reduction in pumping costs achieved from
    the adoption of precision irrigation in all fields may be negligible in comparison
    to the cost of variable rate water application equipment. They concluded that
    the adoption of this technology will be economically justifiable only with an
    increase in energy costs. An economic evaluation of spatially varied irrigation
    applications is presented in Lee [147]. The study assessed energy savings resulting
    from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation on a 67-acre field in Wyoming.
    The cost of installing the variable rate water application equipment on the field
    was reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return
    for the equipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71, which
    equates to a payback period of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback will
    only be realized for the technology outside the useful life of the equipment.
    Precision irrigation offers the benefit of providing water conservation benefits
    by avoiding overirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts [18].
    Sadler et al. [148] discussed water conservation strategies where precision irrigation
    can potentially reduce the total water applied and improve the environmental quality
    of irrigated fields. They suggested that programing zero irrigation amounts to
    non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision irrigation.
    They also noted that adjusting spatial water application based on the infiltration
    rate of the soil and soil water storage capacity will reduce the occurrence of
    surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff and leaching were identified as
    the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They suggested the occurrence
    of this can be eliminated by spatial application of precise irrigation volumes
    based on the soil water-holding characteristics. They presented several case studies
    in which the adoption of precision irrigation has been demonstrated to enhance
    the environmental quality of irrigated fields. They concluded that precision irrigation
    has the capability of improving water use efficiencies while reducing the adverse
    environmental impacts associated with conventional irrigation practices. The results
    from the above studies show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health.
    Its economic justification in terms of significant yield improvements and water
    savings is however limited. Evans and King [18] suggested that the lack of significant
    improvements in yield response when employing precision irrigation may result
    from the fact that the yield response to the water curve near maximum yield (100%
    ET) is almost flat, with small changes in water applied using precision irrigation
    having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies
    have used only soil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate and
    crop genetics may however have a direct influence on the yield response of the
    crops. Soil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication of crop
    water status, rather the plant may be the best indicator of water availability.
    The decision support systems employed by current precision irrigation systems
    assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with time. The characteristics
    of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and optimal
    amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event. We argue
    that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and weather data)
    will enhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation decisions and hence
    an improvement in economic outcomes. This should be integrated with a decision
    support system that has the capability to adapt to the time-varying nature of
    the cropping system. The decision support system should also have the capacity
    to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience and a target
    crop production function. We discuss how this can be achieved by exploiting improvements
    in monitoring and management considerations. 7.1. Monitoring Considerations A
    precision irrigation system is designed to apply water at a differential rate
    in response to the temporal and spatial variation in crop water need across a
    field. This process is supported by a number of sensors providing data to a real-time
    decision support system. These sensors include weather stations, soil moisture
    sensors, environmental sensors, plant sensors and thermal sensors which may be
    integrated into a wireless sensor network. A careful design of these sensing systems
    including a consideration of factors affecting their performance is crucial in
    realizing the goal of improved water use through precision irrigation. Dielectric
    soil moisture sensors sense the water content of the immediate soil in their zone
    of influence. The zone of influence reported for most commercial dielectric soil
    moisture sensors corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149].
    It is therefore important to install the sensors in areas representative of the
    soil moisture available for plant use. The normal practice employed by most users
    is to place the sensors in the driest regions of the field or in the regions comprising
    of a soil profile with the lowest available water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting
    this approach will most likely lead to wetter regions in the field receiving more
    frequent irrigation which will consequently result in overirrigation. A more efficient
    approach is to define irrigation management zones and place a number of sensors
    in each management zone to give the average soil moisture estimate. This may however
    be limited by cost. A structured installation profile is also necessary in order
    to capture soil water movement and availability. It is recommended that sensors
    should be installed at each soil horizon along the plant rooting zone [151]. An
    accepted convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along
    the rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the
    uppermost soil profile is able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the
    deepest part of the profile is able to detect drainage and the other sensors located
    midway in the soil profile are able to capture soil moisture dynamics useful in
    supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing
    knowledge of the site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two depths
    and still adequately capture the soil moisture dynamics. The soil moisture sensors
    should also be deployed using soil-specific calibration equations to enable accurate
    estimates of soil moisture content. The actual crop evapotranspiration can vary
    spatially and temporally under conditions of unrestricted water supply. These
    variations can be the result of several factors including differences in crop
    genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability
    and stage of growth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a field may result
    in significant water savings. The accurate measurement of evapotranspiration is
    crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure
    for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation systems relies
    on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which
    is adjusted for specific crops using crop coefficients. This calculated ET is
    assumed to be uniform for every part of the field. This will however result in
    the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace crop water use, owing
    to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique
    in determining site-specific crop coefficients provides a platform for overcoming
    this challenge. The surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising
    tool for quantifying the actual crop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,
    short and dense canopies. Plant-based measurements provide the best indication
    of plant water status as they provide a direct measure of the plants’ response
    to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based monitoring
    system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in water deficits.
    Measurements of leaf water potential and sap flow are contact methods which give
    direct information on plant water status but their spatial resolution is limited
    as many samples are required to effectively monitor the dynamics of field-scale
    plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has provided a robust platform
    for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated from the infrared measurements
    of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify field-scale crop water status
    with high spatial and temporal resolution. This presents a robust and cost-effective
    tool for use in precision irrigation. Its application in humid regions is however
    marred with difficulties. A systems engineering approach can be applied in overcoming
    the difficulties encountered with applying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical
    model derived using this approach may adequately simulate the real-time dynamics
    of the baseline temperatures required for computing the index. A summary of the
    technology gaps and refinements necessary in monitoring tools in order to achieve
    robust precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the
    limited volume of influence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement
    accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The refinements recommended include the development
    of low cost soil measurement sensors with a wider volume of influence, low cost
    and resilient wireless communication networks able to link spatially deployed
    soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order
    to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The technology gaps identified
    in plant sensing technology include the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds
    and quantity, and low spatial resolution. The refinements recommended include
    the integration of plant-based sensing with soil moisture sensing tools in order
    to determine irrigation volumes, calibration of infra-red thermography against
    physiologically explicit plant measurements in order to determine critical thresholds
    and the deployment of IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance
    spatial coverage. A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density
    that captures spatial variability is therefore likely to yield the most robust
    and accurate solution for precision irrigation. This will ensure that the decision
    support system is robust to data availability, gaps and deficiencies. This will
    include data from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration
    will also include developing cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will
    enhance the adoption of these adaptive systems by farmers. 7.2. Management Considerations
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation
    system. Management acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,
    culminating into irrigation decisions. This enables the implementation of vital
    management decisions of when and where to apply irrigation and also the irrigation
    volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps the management backbone
    of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The adaptive decision support tools discussed
    have the capability of improving crop yield and water savings when deployed as
    part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al. [11] noted that the simulation
    of adaptive decision support strategies can be used in identifying optimal irrigation
    scheduling decisions. A simulation tool capable of representing a range of field
    conditions at different spatial and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such
    a simulation framework is presented in [114]. Model-based decision support systems
    using feedback from multiple sensors may present a platform for arriving at optimal
    water applications. MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the aim of
    improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based
    on MPC employs an optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the
    best performance. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision
    irrigation system could involve the use of real-time data from field sensors to
    calibrate a crop or soil model and then optimizing this calibrated model to arrive
    at optimal irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil moisture
    sensors, thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The
    data from the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are
    not required at a high temporal resolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment
    of these sensors is however required to account for the spatial nature of field-scale
    crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving platform for spatial
    data collection across the field. Equipment availability, irrigation system capacity
    and other operational considerations can be incorporated as system-level constraints
    in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints can be considered to
    arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113]. MPC uses a model’s simulation
    to determine the optimum irrigation application timing and volume. When combined
    with a soft sensing system, variables that are not directly measured can be controlled
    and optimized. This presents a possibility of applying decision support systems
    based on MPC in realising a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].
    There has been considerable research into water use procedures that can achieve
    improved water savings in irrigated agriculture, particularly deficit irrigation.
    Deficit irrigation (DI) is an irrigation strategy in which a crop is exposed to
    a level of water stress at certain growth stages in its development (regulated
    deficit irrigation) or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which
    the plant is subjected to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant
    stage. The goal of deficit irrigation is that there will be little adverse effect
    on yield and irrigation water can be conserved [154]. Evans and King [18] suggested
    deficit irrigation as a tool for improving water use in precision irrigation.
    They noted that it can be applied in maximizing net returns and conserve large
    amounts of water in arid and semi-arid regions. It is however important to investigate
    the response of different crops to water deficits including timing tolerances
    in order to develop optimal deficit irrigation strategies that can be integrated
    into the precision irrigation decision support framework. It is also important
    to investigate the economics of yield reduction associated with deficit irrigation
    strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that implementing deficit irrigation
    as part of precision irrigation management will involve the continuous assessment
    of crop stress and growth stage throughout the growing season. This will be instrumental
    in avoiding temporary severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction
    in crop yield or quality. The high cost of the component technologies of precision
    irrigation including soil, plant and weather sensors, decision support systems
    and variable rate water application systems is presently a constraint to the wide-scale
    adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield improvements and
    water savings currently achieved through field-scale precision irrigation may
    not justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh
    water resources become scarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed
    on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture. Regulatory agencies may also require
    farmers to continuously demonstrate the efficient use of water. These factors
    may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155]. A conceptual
    model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather
    and soil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is currently
    being developed by the authors. It involves the integration of various sensing
    systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning and model predictive control into
    an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation. Figure 1. Conceptual
    model-based decision support system for precision irrigation. Elements in blue
    represent novel ideas from the Authors and elements in orange are from the decision
    support system presented in McCarthy et al. [114]. 8. Conclusions Technological
    innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture form an important
    vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water resources. Precision
    irrigation has been demonstrated as such an innovation, though presently the economic
    benefit related to the adoption of this technology at field-scale crop production
    is minimal. This is because the potential for yield improvements and water savings
    may not cover the cost of technology required for its implementation. The application
    of adaptive control techniques to irrigation decision support and improvements
    in monitoring tools has the capability of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic
    nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere system while also considering operational
    limitations in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents
    a platform for actualizing the environmental and economic goals of sustainability
    in irrigated agriculture. A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper
    combination of soil, weather and plant sensors is however vital for the proper
    operation of an adaptive decision support system. The decision support system
    should be able to account for the varying crop water requirements within season
    as a result of both biotic and abiotic factors. The decision support system should
    also consider agronomic objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is
    delivered by the precision irrigation system. The high cost of sensors and the
    requirement for dense deployment in order to obtain data at high spatial resolutions
    is presently a constraint. The large dataset required for the calibration of crop
    simulation models is also another significant problem. Future research needs include
    the development of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of
    influence, identification of irrigation thresholds for plant-based sensors and
    the development of self-learning crop simulation models that are able to infer
    relationships from a limited data set. The field evaluation of adaptive decision
    support systems would also be beneficial in quantifying their sustainability improvement
    potential. Acknowledgments The authors wish to acknowledge John Oldacre Foundation

  description: In a soilless culture, water and nutrients must be frequently and precisely
    applied due to the reduced volume and low water holding capacity of the substrate.
    We describe a low-cost and efficient control system for the irrigation management
    of soilless culture based on an irrigation tray. Both irrigation and drainage
    volumes from the irrigation control tray are measured automatically. The proposed
    irrigation scheduling options were based on applying both variable timing and
    amounts. A Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm was used to establish
    the irrigation timing option while two different irrigation application options,
    based on measurements from the drainage hydrograph, were developed and tested.
    A field test performed on a tomato crop was carried out to assess the performance
    of the two irrigation application options. Both irrigation algorithms performed
    well as they fitted the leaching fraction for every irrigation event to the target
    value. The fruit yield and quality were comparable to results obtained from the
    control treatment of the tomato crop. The designed low-cost irrigation control
    system, if implemented on commercial farms, could prove to be economically very
    beneficial.

    Abstract Model-based control strategies applied to irrigation make decisions (on
    water application and/or timing) using a crop and/or soil production model. Decisions
    are made with respect to an optimisation objective which, for irrigation, can
    be either short-term (e.g. achieving/maintaining a set soil–water deficit) or
    predicted end-of-season (e.g. maximising final yield) by predicting how the crop
    will respond at the end of the season. In contrast, sensor-based irrigation strategies
    rely on achieving a performance that is measurable during the crop season to provide
    the feedback control, and may not necessarily optimise overall crop performance.
    Model-based control potentially avoids this limitation. This paper describes the
    application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology to the feedback control
    of irrigation via a model-based irrigation strategy implemented in the irrigation
    control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’. The requirement to also accommodate spatial
    and temporal differences in crop water requirement across a heterogeneous field
    is met by defining management ‘zones’ according to differing soil and crop properties
    across the field and separately applying the control algorithm for each of these
    zones. Case studies were conducted to evaluate MPC for a centre pivot irrigation
    machine-irrigated cotton crop (under typical Australian growing conditions) with:
    (i) different in-season performance objectives (maintaining soil–water deficit;
    maximising square count); (ii) different predicted end-of-season performance objectives
    (maximising yield; maximising water use efficiency); and (iii) maximising yield
    with different field data inputs for model calibration. The Model Predictive Control
    strategy produced significantly higher simulated yields and water use efficiency
    than an industry-standard irrigation management strategy; and (in most but not
    all situations) direct sensor-based adaptive control strategies. Previous article

    moveSchedulingIrrigation automationModel Predictive Control 1. Introduction The
    development of the control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ has enabled the evaluation
    of site-specific, spatially-variable irrigation control strategies on field crops
    (McCarthy et al., 2010a). VARIwise permits spatially and temporally varied simulation
    and accommodates sub-field scale variations in all input parameters down to metre-scale
    zone size. Simulations of ‘sensor-based’ strategies showed potential improvements
    in yield and water use efficiency (McCarthy et al., 2014). These strategies compared
    the field measurements with a desired response (e.g. soil–water deficit) and adjusted
    the irrigation volume applied according to the difference. 1.1. Model Predictive
    Control (MPC) applied to irrigation In contrast, an alternative ‘advanced process
    control’ approach to irrigation uses crop production models to aid the irrigation
    decision making process. These ‘model-based’ control strategies use the available
    field measurements to calibrate the crop model. The model is then repeatedly executed
    to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing that will achieve the desired
    performance objective (e.g. predicted end-of-season yield). The methodology of
    Model Predictive Control (MPC) involves using a model to predict the optimal input
    signal at the current time considering future events over a finite time period
    (Kwon and Han, 2005). This is referred to as a ‘control horizon length’. Only
    the first optimal control action is implemented after each time step. MPC is applicable
    to irrigation since a soil-plant-atmosphere model may be used to evaluate the
    application of various irrigation volumes on a fixed number of consecutive days.
    For example, the model may be used to, firstly, determine the best irrigation
    volume to apply on each zone for each of the next three days; and, secondly, determine
    which day resulted in the best overall performance. The future process outputs
    used to evaluate the irrigation scheme may be predicted daily with measurements
    of crop response (e.g. for cotton, square/boll count, leaf area index) or soil–water.
    Alternatively, the simulated final crop yield or water use efficiency may be used
    to evaluate the various irrigation schemes. From the control perspective, the
    ‘process model’ evolves during the growth of the crop such that the control must
    be adaptive. This requirement means that the model used by the MPC strategy must
    be continuously re-calibrated using the currently available field data. The plant
    growth and soil–water dynamics in the cotton model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992)
    implemented within VARIwise, can be accurately calibrated (McCarthy et al., 2011).
    The calibrated OZCOT model has also been found to accurately simulate yield (Richards
    et al., 2001). Using one season’s field experiment data McCarthy et al. (2011)
    found that OZCOT was most effectively calibrated (and therefore able to predict
    the soil and crop response to irrigation application) using full data input, whilst
    for situations where only two data inputs were available, the simulations suggested
    that either weather-and-plant or soil-and-plant inputs were preferable. Park et
    al. (2009) developed two MPC systems for centre pivot irrigation which both used
    measured soil and weather inputs to calibrate a soil–water model. Their first
    implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation volumes which
    would fill the soil profile for irrigation events on fixed days; whereas their
    second implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation timing
    for a fixed irrigation volume application which would fill the soil profile. Neither
    implementation incorporated the crop growth response. 1.2. MPC and crop production
    models The performance objectives set for MPC applied to irrigation can range
    from a short-term objective such as achieving a preset soil–water deficit following
    each irrigation to a ‘whole season’ objective such as maximising predicted end-of-season
    yield. In addition, crop production models (such as OZCOT for cotton, discussed
    below) have sophisticated prediction capabilities which may be utilised in the
    implementation of MPC. For example, a performance objective to maximise the number
    of plant fruiting sites during growth should maximise potential predicted end-of-season
    yield. This additional crop response capability typically requires measurements
    of the plant to calibrate the crop production model according to the measured
    plant growth parameters (e.g. fruiting), which in turn requires infield plant
    sensors to provide calibration data. To maximise uptake of the site-specific irrigation
    control system by growers it is desirable to minimise the sensor requirements.
    A reduction in measurements could be achieved by using only the data types that
    are more influential in the model calibration or by reducing the spatial or temporal
    resolution of data. However, the data used to calibrate the model should still
    enable sufficient accuracy of the model. An insufficient range of measurements
    to calibrate the model used by MPC will influence the accuracy of the model and
    the model’s ability to predict irrigation and crop performance. Hence, this paper
    aims to: • identify the optimal combination of performance objective and data
    input combination amenable to practical MPC strategies; and also • explore the
    impact of different control horizon lengths (period of time for forecasting future
    events) on the performance of MPC. The strategies simulated in this paper explore
    the viability of the use of MPC in the simulation of a ‘realistic’ irrigation
    situation with spatial and temporal variation across a heterogeneous field. Accordingly,
    this paper details the implementation of the MPC methodology in VARIwise and,
    for the example of cotton grown in Australia, presents results for a range of
    simulations having different performance objectives. The results are presented
    as three case studies, A, B and C, which, in order, evaluate the potential of
    MPC to optimise: A. short-term responses of square count or soil–water; B. predicted
    end-of-season crop yield or water use efficiency with (i) low and high soil nitrogen
    content, and (ii) crop seasons with and without rainfall; and C. predicted end-of-season
    crop yield with different combinations of sensory input data to calibrate the
    model. A comparison is then made between the MPC strategies and simulations of
    ‘sensor-based’ strategies for adaptive irrigation control (McCarthy et al., 2014).
    2. Implementation The simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ (McCarthy et al., 2010a)
    was created to develop, simulate and evaluate site-specific irrigation control
    strategies for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines on non-uniform
    (spatially and temporally varied) fields. The framework enables evaluation of
    strategies with different sensor data availability (both spatial and temporal);
    for example, the performance of the control strategies with spatial gaps in measured
    response is explored in McCarthy et al. (2010b). In addition, the framework can
    provide evaluation of different irrigation system capacity constraints and when
    supplied with real-time weather and/or other field data, the framework will provide
    direct machine actuation. For the simulation (and management) of cotton irrigation,
    the cotton production model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992) was used by VARIwise
    and was automatically and continuously calibrated according to the currently available
    weather, soil and plant data. Details are set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). To
    illustrate the VARIwise configuration used to evaluate MPC a general schematic
    is presented in Fig. 1, in which the central blocks and data flows are explained
    in the following sections. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The simulation
    framework VARIwise configured to evaluate (in simulation mode) the model-based
    adaptive control strategy Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this mode, the block
    ‘AcModel’ (also an OZCOT formulation) has replaced the field data measurements
    which would normally update ‘RefModel’. (This diagram is adapted from the full
    VARIwise flowchart presented as Fig. 2 of McCarthy et al., 2010a, McCarthy et
    al., 2010b). The MPC algorithm predicts how much each output (e.g. soil–water,
    fruit load) will deviate from a time series trajectory within the prediction horizon.
    A MPC cost function J(k) is calculated for each possible set of input actions
    in the current time step k using a least squares algorithm of the following form
    (Maciejowski, 2002): (1) where J(k) is the cost function at instant k, C the length
    of prediction/control horizon, N the number of system outputs, wj the weighting
    coefficient for output j, rj(k + i) the predicted value of jth output at future
    instant k + i, and xj(k + i) is the target value of jth output at future instant
    k + i. The control action that minimises the cost function (i.e. that produces
    the smallest deviation in performance from the desired trajectory) is implemented.
    This optimisation is repeated at each sample time step to update the optimal input
    trajectory after a feedback update. Hence, this MPC algorithm calculates the sequence
    of control action adjustments over a specified future time interval. In an irrigation
    context, the system outputs used to calculate the cost function will typically
    have different units and magnitudes, and the same percentage change in variables
    of different units and magnitudes may cause unintentional bias toward variables
    that are generally larger in magnitude. For example, a particular percentage difference
    in soil–water will produce a larger cost function than the same percentage difference
    in leaf area index. Hence, the MPC algorithm was modified (Eq. (2)) to calculate
    a performance index that represents a percentage difference in the predicted outputs
    rather than a least squares objective function (Eq. (1)). The control action that
    maximises the performance index PI(k) is then implemented in each time step, and
    is calculated using the equation: (2) The MPC methodology was implemented to determine
    irrigation timing and site-specific irrigation volumes on a daily basis by means
    of the following four-step procedure: 1. Update measured and forecast weather
    data. 2. Calibrate crop model. 3. Optimise irrigation volume for each zone. 4.
    Optimise day of next irrigation. The details of each step in relation to the following
    case studies are set out below. This procedure is independently applied to each
    ‘management zone’, where each zone in the field is defined according to differing
    soil and crop properties across the heterogeneous field. 2.1. Step 1: updating
    measured and forecast weather data For each day of the crop season, the meteorological
    data input file for the integrated crop model was updated to include the previous
    day’s weather and the updated weather forecast for the farm’s location. In a field
    implementation of MPC, the ‘previous day’s weather’ could be obtained from an
    on-site weather station and the ‘updated weather forecast’ could be obtained from
    the Bureau of Meteorology. However, to simulate the performance of MPC for a whole
    season (where there was no field implementation) both ‘previous day’s weather’
    and ‘updated weather forecast’ had to be obtained from historical data. Because
    of the high variability of Australian climate and the difficulty in picking a
    ‘typical’ year, an artificial daily meteorological dataset was created by averaging
    the day-to-day data of the five years (1999–2004 inclusive) appropriate to the
    location of Dalby (Latitude −28.18°N, Longitude 151.26° E), a major cotton-growing
    region of south-east Queensland, Australia, and this dataset was used for all
    simulations. Daily data comprised maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation
    and rainfall, and was sourced from Australian Bureau of Meteorology SILO patched
    point environmental dataset (QNRM, 2009). SILO is an enhanced climate database
    containing Australian climate data from 1889. Forecast weather data, to be used
    predictively during the simulations, was created by imposing a Gaussian distribution
    of variability on the daily values of the five-year-averaged dataset using standard
    deviations of ±5 °C, ±5 °C, ±5 W h/m2 and ±50% for maximum temperature, minimum
    temperature, daily solar radiation and rainfall, respectively; i.e. for any given
    day, the forecast one, two and three days ahead, then values for each variable
    randomly generated within each distribution by taking that day’s values as the
    mean. For each day, only three days of the forecast weather data were used. This
    is because the two Australian short-term numerical weather prediction models forecast
    three and seven days ahead and are combined to improve the prediction accuracy
    (Ebert, 2001). The three-day forecast would be more accurate than one model on
    its own because both models could predict weather to three days. A three-day forecast
    would ensure short-term prediction accuracy in the predictions, particularly as
    regards rainfall in south-east Queensland, Australia, where the summer rainfall
    is dominated by frontal bands of isolated cumulo-nimbus storms. 2.2. Step 2: calibrating
    the crop model – ‘actual’ and ‘reference’ models The crop model OZCOT is utilised
    by VARIwise and can be automatically and continuously calibrated according to
    the ‘currently’ available weather, plus soil and plant data, using the procedure
    set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). The procedure for calibrating the production/growth
    model OZCOT in a real-time implementation, i.e. for actual irrigation machine
    control, involves automatically and iteratively adjusting the parameters used
    to predict soil water status and plant growth until the difference between the
    predicted and sensed variables reached a minimum. For the cotton model OZCOT,
    the plant variables (leaf area index, boll count, square count), soil variables
    (soil moisture content and plant available water capacity) and weather variables
    (daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall and solar radiation in weather
    input file) are interdependent. The plant behaviour can be calibrated by adjusting
    parameters in a crop properties file, whilst the soil moisture behaviour was calibrated
    by adjusting parameters in a soil properties file. These parameters were adjusted
    between the minimum and maximum values of the corresponding parameters in the
    predefined soil properties and crop variety parameter profiles. The parameters
    adjusted in the crop properties file included squaring rate (the rate of new flower
    buds being produced), growth rate of leaf area and plant population constant;
    whilst the parameters adjusted in the soil properties file were the initial soil
    moisture content and drained upper limit in each soil layer. A ‘reference’ model,
    labelled ‘RefModel’, is used to provide the crop growth prediction scenario for
    MPC. However, for the present case studies there was no measured field data input
    to calibrate the model. To overcome this, a second OZCOT model of the cotton crop
    was used in place of ‘actual’ field conditions. This model is referred to as the
    ‘actual crop’ model, labelled ‘AcModel’ and the parameters were different to those
    in RefModel to emulate RefModel not exactly following the field conditions. In
    a field implementation the AcModel is not required as field measurements would
    be used. AcModel was then used to calibrate RefModel (Fig. 1). The crop and soil
    properties of AcModel were obtained from the user-specified soil and plant measurements
    (and these varied between simulations, as set out below). Within RefModel the
    crop variety was specified by the user at commencement. Likewise the soil properties
    of RefModel were user-specified, with the addition of areal variation in available
    soil–water imposed via a Gaussian distribution of variability having a standard
    deviation of ±25 mm (water depth equivalent). 2.3. Step 3: optimising irrigation
    volumes for each zone Optimal irrigation volumes were determined by iteratively
    simulating the daily application of sixteen different irrigation volumes at 1
    mm increments between 0 and 15 mm on each zone in the field. For each irrigation
    volume applied (for management zone k), a performance index PI(k) was calculated
    using Eq. (2). For variables that are maximised to achieve the optimal irrigation
    strategy (e.g. square count, yield, crop water use efficiency), the target value
    is taken to be the maximum realistic commercially attainable value (e.g. 15 bales/ha
    for cotton yield, 3 bales/ML for crop water use efficiency). The predicted process
    outputs used to calculate the PI were taken one day after the irrigation application.
    The optimal irrigation volume for each zone was the irrigation volume with the
    highest PI; however, if more than one irrigation volume had the same PI then a
    water-efficient approach was taken and the optimal irrigation volume was the lowest
    quantitative volume that achieved the maximum PI. The irrigation volume was then
    calculated for each zone in the order in which the irrigation machine was to pass
    over the field. 2.4. Step 4: optimising the timing (day) of the next irrigation
    The optimal day for the next irrigation event was determined using the calibrated
    RefModel. This involved performing the irrigation volume optimisation of the previous
    step for an arbitrary number of days (i.e. to a fixed horizon) and contained the
    assumption that the irrigation event could occur on only one of the days. The
    maximum horizon length was set to three days since three days of predictive weather
    were used. The sixteen irrigation volumes tested on each zone depend on the irrigation
    day being tested. This is because, unless rainfall occurs, it was assumed that
    the crop water requirement (and hence irrigation application volume) increases
    for each day the irrigation event is delayed. For the first day irrigation volumes
    of 0–15 mm were tested with increments of 1 mm; for the second day 0–31 mm were
    tested with increments of 2 mm; and for the third day 0–47 mm were tested with
    increments of 3 mm. A PI is calculated for each irrigation day by summing the
    individual PI values for each zone. The day with the highest total PI is taken
    to be the optimal day for the next irrigation event. The irrigation event is scheduled
    if the first day in the horizon had the highest PI and there are a minimum number
    of zones requiring irrigation greater than 0 mm. This ensures that the irrigation
    application is practical and irrigations are not initiated for only a small number
    of zones in the field. The threshold, i.e. the minimum proportion of zones requiring
    irrigation, was arbitrarily selected to be 15% for the case studies presented.
    2.5. Subsequent iteration After the optimal irrigation action – which may, of
    course, be a ‘nil irrigation’ action – was determined for the user-specified first
    day, the procedure described in the four subsections above was repeated every
    day throughout the crop season, with the irrigation events ending on a day specified
    by the user. 3. MPC Case Study A: optimisation of short-term responses using different
    combinations of daily input data The MPC strategy was evaluated with daily input
    data to predict and control irrigation applications to achieve either a short-term
    soil (e.g. deficit) or plant growth (e.g. leaf area index) target. A range of
    combinations of input variables for control were used to determine which input
    data stream was most useful for MPC. 3.1. Methodology for Case Study A The field
    was automatically divided into 44 zones, each of area approximately 0.3 ha, and
    the irrigations occurred daily. This number of zones enabled the simulations to
    be executed in a timely manner with spatially variable soil properties across
    the field. The MPC strategy was evaluated for ten combinations of data input (Table
    1). The input data combinations represent the data used both as input variables
    to calibrate RefModel and the variables used for control. For the simulations
    using both soil and plant data, the weighting on each variable was set to be 0.5.
    The strategies with soil data input aimed for soil–water deficit equal to 10%
    of the plant available water capacity in each zone. Table 1. Simulations (identified

    the RefModel (to be calibrated) used the Siokra V16RR cotton variety with the
    underlying variability in plant available water capacity (PAWC) and starting soil–water
    deficit as set out in Fig. 2. The starting soil–water deficit map was generated
    by assigning a starting soil–water deficit value of 30 mm across the field and
    imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability with standard deviation ±10 mm
    on each zone. The PAWC map was generating by assigning PAWC values of 60, 150
    and 200 mm on three zones of the fields, spatially interpolating the PAWC using
    ordinary kriging and by similarly imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability
    with standard deviation ±10 mm on each zone. The PAWC ranges from 60 to 200 mm
    in the simulated field to ensure the control strategies could deal with the different
    soil types that often exist within fields. Download : Download full-size image

    whilst Sicot 73 is a full season cotton variety with high yield potential (CSD,
    2009). The prediction horizon was one day and it was practical for irrigation
    events to occur daily. 3.2. Case Study A – results and discussion Table 2 sets

    of the control strategies are compared based on the average and variability of
    the yield, irrigation applied, Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI) and Crop Water

    in yield response according to spatially variable irrigation application. The

    soil–water deficit (simulation #19); and set (b): maximising square count (simulation
    #20). The simulated yield and water use efficiency increased as more data streams
    were included in the input data combination. This is shown in Table 2 as the single-input
    simulations produced the lowest yields and water use efficiencies (simulations
    #11 and #12) while the three simulations having three data inputs (simulations
    #18, #19 and #20) performed better than all of the five simulations having two
    data inputs (simulations #13 to #17 inclusive). The data combinations with soil
    data and no plant data (simulations #11 and #13) resulted in higher yields than
    those with plant data and no soil data (simulations #12 and #14). This result
    suggests that if only one data input is available then soil data input is most
    effective for calibrating RefModel and for irrigation control. The simulations
    using combinations of soil and plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes
    (simulations #15 and #18) generally produced lower yields and water use efficiencies
    than those using only plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes (simulations
    #17 and #20) with the same data available for RefModel calibration. For example,
    for the strategies with soil and plant data available to calibrate RefModel, a
    higher yield was simulated when the strategy maximised the square/boll count (simulation
    #17) than when the strategy attempted to both maintain soil–water and maximise
    square count (simulation #15). Hence, in this case there was no obvious benefit
    in the using multiple variables to determine the application volumes. The MPC
    strategy accurately maintained the soil–water deficit threshold during low rainfall
    periods of the crop season for simulation #19 (63 to 85 days after sowing, Fig.
    4(a)). For the MPC strategy that maximised square/boll count (simulation #20),
    the soil–water deficit was always higher than the soil–water deficit threshold
    that was approximately maintained in simulation #19 throughout the crop season
    (Fig. 4(b)). The soil–water deficit was also lowest in the sand zone (with the
    lowest plant available water capacity) and highest in the clay zone (with the
    highest plant available water capacity) throughout the crop season for the strategy
    optimising square count. This indicates that to maximise the square count, the
    soil–water deficit should be reduced in proportion with the plant available water
    capacity of the soil. The highest yield was achieved using weather-soil-and-plant
    input and maximising square count (simulation #20). The square count was higher
    throughout the crop season for this simulation compared with that for MPC maintaining
    soil–water deficit (simulation #19) (Fig. 5). Hence, the implemented MPC strategy
    successfully increased the simulated square count and improvements in yield (by
    14%) and crop water use efficiency (by 30%) were observed by maximising square
    count instead of targeting soil–water. 4. MPC Case Study B: optimisation using
    a predicted end-of-season yield or water use efficiency target The MPC strategy
    uses RefModel to forecast the response of cotton crop with specific environmental
    conditions and soil and crop properties; hence, the irrigation volume/timing may
    be adjusted to achieve a desired predicted end-of-season output, in this case
    a final yield or water use efficiency. This is in contrast to Case Study A in
    which the MPC strategy used daily input data (e.g. square count, soil–water) to
    predict the best short-term response to a range of irrigation volumes. 4.1. Methodology
    for Case Study B The field was automatically divided into 44 zones as per the
    previous case study and the irrigations could occur daily. The MPC strategy was
    evaluated for crop seasons with and without rainfall and with two levels of initial
    nitrogen content (120 kg/ha and 250 kg/ha). The same weather dataset was used
    for both these sets of simulations; however the daily rainfall was set to zero
    for the simulations without rainfall. In the simulations with rainfall there was
    high rainfall during days 63–85 after sowing. The MPC strategy was used to optimise
    the predicted Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI), Crop Water Use Index (CWUI) and
    yield assuming the machine capacity enabled the machine to traverse the field
    once every day. An algorithm maximising IWUI or CWUI may decide to apply no irrigation
    to minimise the irrigation volume but would also produce low yield. Hence, to
    ensure that the IWUI and CWUI optimisation would irrigate the crop, the minimum
    acceptable yield was arbitrarily set at 5 bales/ha in all optimisations. 4.2.
    Case Study B – results and discussion The simulation results are displayed in
    Table 3 and Fig. 6 and the spatially varied irrigation volumes applied are compared
    with different in-season rainfall and starting nitrogen content at commencement

    set (b) 250 kg/ha. For each set of field conditions (i.e. starting nitrogen content
    and in-season rainfall), the simulated yield was highest for the MPC strategy
    that optimised yield (simulations #21, #23, #25 and #28). Similarly, the strategies
    optimising IWUI (simulations #27 and #30) and CWUI (simulations #26 and #29) produced
    the highest respective IWUI and CWUI of the simulations with the same field conditions.
    This indicates that MPC strategy could adjust the irrigation application to improve
    either yield or water use efficiency. Increasing the starting nitrogen content
    significantly improved the simulated yield and water use efficiency. This is shown
    in Table 3 as the yield for the no-rainfall simulation with the higher nitrogen
    content of 250 kg N/ha (e.g. 17.9 bales/ha for simulation #23) was nearly double
    that of the simulation with the lower nitrogen content of 120 kg N/ha (e.g. 9.0
    bales/ha for simulation #21). Since the irrigation volumes applied were similar
    for these two simulations (Fig. 8), the CWUI and IWUI of the higher nitrogen content
    simulations were also nearly double that of the lower nitrogen content simulations.
    Hence, nitrogen application had a significant effect on the final yield without
    greatly affecting the irrigation volume required to be applied. Rainfall significantly
    affected the simulated yield and CWUI (Table 3). Table 3 shows that the yields,
    irrigation applications and CWUI of simulations #21−#24 (without rainfall) are
    higher than those of simulations #25−#30 (with rainfall). This suggests that the
    crop is easier to control with less rainfall in the season. The difference in
    yield and CWUI is most noticeable for simulations with high nitrogen content (e.g.
    simulation #28 with rainfall and simulation #23 without rainfall) because the
    simulated yields are higher and the differences between the yields are more apparent.
    It follows that during the period of the crop season with high rainfall (63–86
    days after sowing), lower irrigation volumes were applied compared to the periods
    of no rainfall (87–105 days after sowing) (Fig. 7). The rainfall did not generally
    affect the IWUI for the simulated set of field conditions (e.g. simulation #21
    with no rainfall versus simulation #25 with rainfall). This is because more rainfall
    caused both the yield and irrigation application (which are used to calculate
    the IWUI) to decrease by approximately the same proportion. 5. MPC Case Study
    C: optimisation using a predicted end-of-season target, with limited calibration
    data The MPC simulations of the Case Study B assumed that the full data input
    of weather, soil and plant information was available for RefModel calibration.
    However, all three data streams may not be available in a field implementation.
    Case Study C evaluates the usefulness of different data streams to calibrate RefModel
    in a MPC strategy with a predicted end-of-season target. 5.1. Methodology for
    Case Study C The seven possible input data combinations (Table 2) were separately
    evaluated as input for RefModel calibration. The datasets were obtained daily
    from the cotton model Sicot 71B and used to calibrate the Siokra V16RR cotton
    model. The field and weather conditions were as used in the earlier case studies,
    the MPC strategy optimised yield and the irrigations occurred daily. 5.2. Case
    Study C – results and discussion Table 4 and Fig. 9 set out a comparison of an
    MPC strategy that maximises yield with different combinations of input data to
    calibrate RefModel. The use of more information in the input data combination
    generally increased the average yield and water use efficiency (Table 4). Table
    4 shows that MPC performance with all three input variables (simulation #37/#28)
    was superior to that with any two variables (simulations #34−#36); and similarly
    performance with two input variables was superior to that with any single input
    variable alone, except plant input (simulation #33) versus soil-and-plant input
    (simulation #36). This suggests that the MPC calibration performs better with
    soil data input than plant data input. Table 4. Performance of the Model Predictive

    #31−#37 are in Table 4). The lowest yields and water use efficiencies were simulated
    with only weather data input (e.g. simulations #31). This is because the weather
    data (without field-specific soil or crop data) provides no information to adequately
    parameterise the crop model used by the MPC strategy. This could lead to insufficient
    model calibration and sub-optimal irrigation volumes being determined. The irrigation
    water use efficiency was higher using the weather and plant combination (simulation
    #35) than using the full data input (simulation #37/#28): this is because the
    yield was maximised rather than the water use efficiency in this case study. 6.
    General discussion A Model Predictive Control strategy was successfully implemented
    in VARIwise. The controller uses currently available field data to calibrate the
    OZCOT cotton production model and then evaluates a range of irrigation volumes
    and timings in each zone. The controller then implements the site-specific irrigation
    volumes on the day that achieves the highest water use efficiency or yield averaged
    over the field, as user specified. Three alternative optimisation possibilities
    were identified and explored, and the conclusions for each, and their comparison,
    are as set out below. In each case the MPC strategy performed successfully in
    the (simulated) task of controlling an automatic irrigation machine applying spatially-varied
    irrigation amounts. For convenience, Table 5 gathers together the particular simulation
    outputs referred to in this section. Table 5 also compares results of MPC with
    two sensor-based control strategies, namely Iterative Learning Controller (ILC)
    and Iterative Hill Climbing Controller (IHCC), simulated on fields with PAWC varying
    between 60 and 200 mm with 1266 zones, and the same weather profile and crop variety
    (as detailed in McCarthy et al., 2014). These sensor-based strategies refine the
    estimate of each successive irrigation volume applied by: Table 5. Control strategy

    [ILC] – iteratively adjusting the irrigation volume applied in each zone of the
    field using the incremental response, i.e. the OZCOT-determined plant growth arising
    from the change in particular field sensor information which has resulted from
    the previous water application, in each zone; or [IHCC] – similarly adjusting
    the irrigation volumes, but based on multiple sensor increment information, using
    a range of irrigation volumes applied within a group of homogenous zones. The
    performance of the MPC strategy was also compared with an industry-standard irrigation
    strategy (first line of Table 5). This strategy applied a uniform irrigation treatment
    (25 mm) across the field and initiated irrigation events when the soil–water deficit
    reached a set amount (30 mm) in one point in the field (in the cell with sandy
    soil). The soil–water deficit was taken in the cell with the lowest plant available
    water capacity, as this is the most limiting soil. To ensure validity of the comparison
    this simulation was executed using the same weather conditions and spatially variable
    plant available water capacity and starting soil–water, and crop variety as the
    reference model. The nitrogen content was set to 250 kg/ha. The MPC strategy was
    evaluated with different combinations of input data (Section 3 above). The predicted
    yield and water use efficiency were highest when the strategy maximised the square
    count and calibrated the model using all three streams of data input (weather,
    soil and plant, simulation #20). The yield and water use efficiency were also
    higher than those of the industry-standard irrigation management strategy (McCarthy
    et al., 2014), and also ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) with either
    weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil or weather-and-plant data input available
    (likewise refer McCarthy et al., 2014). However, the MPC (optimising daily input
    data) performed worse than the ILC and IHCC where there was only either soil input
    (simulation #11) or weather-and-plant (simulation #14) input data available. The
    controller successfully adjusted the irrigation to improve the yield, CWUI or
    IWUI, as appropriate (Section 4). The yield was higher with high nitrogen content
    (e.g. simulation #28) than with low nitrogen content (simulation #25) and with
    no rainfall during the crop season (simulation #23) compared with high rainfall
    (simulation #28). This is because the control strategy could better control the
    water applied in response to the other environmental factors. The simulated average
    yields and water use efficiencies were significantly higher than the industry-standard
    irrigation management strategy, ILC strategy (simulation #1) and IHCC strategy
    (simulation #9) (McCarthy et al., 2014). MPC was evaluated with different combinations
    of input data available to calibrate the model (Section 5). The controller performed
    best with input of weather-soil-and-plant data (simulation #28), but still produced
    higher yields and water use efficiencies with weather-and-soil (simulation #34)
    or weather-and-plant (simulation #35) input than the irrigation-standard irrigation
    management strategy, and ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) case studies
    (McCarthy et al., 2014). Higher yields and water use efficiencies were produced
    for MPC optimising predicted end-of-season data (simulation #28) than for MPC
    using daily input data to maximise square count (simulation #20). However, both
    of these control strategies required either the full data input, weather-and-soil
    or weather-and-plant data input to obtain yields higher than the ILC or IHCC strategies.
    7. Conclusion The Model Predictive Control strategy implemented in the control
    simulation software VARIwise performed successfully in the task of controlling
    an automatic irrigation machine applying water to a simulated cotton crop grown
    in typical conditions for south-east Queensland, Australia. In all simulations
    the MPC strategy specified ‘sensible’ irrigation amounts typical of irrigation
    practice in this region. Simulations using the MPC strategy indicated that the
    MPC strategy could be successfully used to either maximise crop yield, or crop
    and irrigation water use efficiencies. The MPC strategy produced significantly
    higher yield and crop water use efficiency than the sensor-based strategies for
    the same (simulated) field conditions (similarly simulated in VARIwise and reported
    in McCarthy et al., 2014). However, MPC required weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil
    or weather-and-plant information to accurately calibrate the crop model. This
    indicates (for cotton grown as stated) that whilst the MPC-based strategies are
    potentially superior, sensor-based strategies may be more appropriate for field
    implementations where there is limited data availability. Finally, we note here
    that direct field evaluation is particularly challenging, because direct comparison
    requires replicated plots having the same soil types and distributions, and with
    simultaneous operation such that each experiences the same weather conditions.
    In principal at least, an alternative to achieve such a comparison would be to
    determine variability of soil properties under an irrigation system, a priori,
    and then define plots of the same soil type such that the irrigation application
    could be adjusted according to different MPC strategies, and in comparison with
    industry-standard control (e.g. calculated using evapotranspiration or soil–water).
    Field evaluations would enable the sensing and control hardware requirements and
    performance of autonomous, adaptive control strategies to be compared with industry-standard
    irrigation. These control strategies would determine irrigation application and
    timing using a black-box control system based on sensed inputs and sends control
    signals to irrigation actuation hardware. This will potentially lead to the optimisation
    of irrigation water use and yield under different climate scenarios and water
    availability situations. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the Australian

    Control engineering approaches may be applied to irrigation management to make
    better use of available irrigation water. These methods of irrigation decision-making
    are being developed to deal with spatial and temporal variability in field properties,
    data availability and hardware constraints. One type of control system is advanced
    process control which, in an irrigation context, refers to the incorporation of
    multiple aspects of optimisation and control. Hence, advanced process control
    is particularly suited to the management of site-specific irrigation. This paper
    reviews applications of advanced process control in irrigation: mathematical programming,
    linear quadratic control, artificial intelligence, iterative learning control
    and model predictive control. From the literature review, it is argued that model-based
    control strategies are more realistic in the soil–plant–atmosphere system using
    process simulation models rather than using ‘black-box’ crop production models.
    It is also argued that model-based control strategies can aim for specific end
    of season characteristics and hence may achieve optimality. Three control systems
    are identified that are robust to data gaps and deficiencies and account for spatial
    and temporal variability in field characteristics, namely iterative learning control,
    iterative hill climbing control and model predictive control: from consideration
    of these three systems it is concluded that the most appropriate control strategy
    depends on factors including sensor data availability and grower’s specific performance
    requirements. It is further argued that control strategy development will be driven
    by the available sensor technology and irrigation hardware, but also that control
    strategy options should also drive future plant and soil moisture sensor development.

    © 2021 Introduction A control engineering approach is one solution being developed
    to automate irrigation management. Figure 1 illustrates a generic irrigation control
    system that uses the full range of plant, weather and soil data for irrigation
    management. In Fig. 1: Fig. 1 Generic control scenario for irrigation application
    (adapted from McCarthy et al. 2010a) Full size image the ‘decision support system’
    embodies the control strategy; ‘actuation’ is the action of adjusting the irrigation
    volume and/or timing; and ‘application’ is the resulting physical amount and timing
    of water and fertiliser applied to the crop. This process can be applied to both
    constant and spatially varied irrigation management at a range of time scales.
    Similarly, the actuation of the irrigation volume application may be either manual
    or automated. Control strategies can be either ‘open-loop’ if they do not use
    sensor feedback to adjust the control, or ‘closed-loop’ if the response of the
    system is monitored and used to adjust the control. Open-loop control strategies
    are outside the scope of this paper. Closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    in the literature have been developed using either infield soil sensors that aim
    to regulate the soil moisture content (Luthra et al. 1997; Smajstrla and Locascio
    2000; Dukes and Scholberg 2005); plant sensors to irrigate when the plant has
    reached a stress point (Evett et al. 2002; Peters and Evett 2008); or calibrated
    crop production models to achieve either a desired soil moisture deficit (Capraro
    et al. 2008), or maximise yield, profit or water productivity (i.e. water use
    efficiency, Brown et al. 2010). There are no published comparisons of performance
    between these approaches. The reported closed-loop irrigation control approaches
    do not typically consider uncertainties associated with unknown crop dynamics,
    nor robustness with respect to sensing requirements, irrigation delivery capability
    or water availability. These factors are known to be spatially varied and subject
    to change between and during crop seasons. In addition, the irrigation application,
    rainfall volumes, soil moisture content and crop response (e.g. plant condition,
    vegetative or reproductive growth) are likely to be stochastic in nature. An engineering
    approach generally labelled ‘advanced process control’ is now routinely applied
    for manufacturing and chemical process systems and combines elements from many
    disciplines spanning classical control engineering, signal processing, statistics,
    decision theory and artificial intelligence (Ikonen and Najim 2002). The application
    of advanced process control to irrigation presents opportunities to improve irrigation
    water use and crop performance. Advanced process control techniques can be used
    for irrigation systems that apply irrigation uniformly over a field, but also
    those that apply site-specific irrigation where the crops have spatially and temporally
    varying irrigation requirements. The variability can be caused by soil type, crop
    type, crop condition (stress, etc.) and meteorological conditions (e.g. rainfall).
    These factors are discussed further in Smith et al. (2009). Research into variable-rate
    irrigation technology for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines has
    spanned 20 years and produced a number of commercial systems (e.g. Farmscan, Valmont,
    Zimmatic). However, the greatest limitation to the adoption of variable-rate irrigation
    is associated with developing optimal irrigation schedules (i.e. volume and timing
    of irrigation) or irrigation prescriptions (Evans et al. 1996). Recent evidence
    (LaRue, J, pers. comm., March 2011) suggests that there is a poor adoption rate
    of variable-rate irrigation and that growers with these systems are not continuing
    to use them for variable-rate irrigation, e.g. only four out of 100 growers who
    purchased Farmscan systems in Georgia, USA in the previous 5 years are still using
    the variable-rate technology. Existing sensors developed for agricultural system
    control and specifically used in irrigation management include remote imagery,
    on-the-go plant measurement (i.e. continuous measurements from sensors mounted
    on on-farm vehicles/machines), soil moisture sensing arrays and infrared thermometry.
    However, the currently-developed advanced process control systems may not necessarily
    require these sensors. Similarly, these sensors may not be applicable to the best
    performing advanced process control strategies. Hence, it is important to identify
    both the most promising advanced process control strategies and their sensing
    requirements, and also the strategies that can be applied to the currently available
    sensors. Scope, structure and overview This paper reviews the existing literature
    of advanced process control in irrigation and their sensor requirements and ability
    to adapt to the infield conditions. Five general methods of advanced process control
    that have been applied to irrigation in the available literature are discussed
    here: mathematical programming; linear quadratic control; artificial intelligence;
    model predictive control; and learning control. Consideration of the requirements
    of control strategies for irrigation leads to the identification of three ‘advanced
    process control’ strategies capable of overcoming at least some of the limitations
    of existing irrigation control approaches. Each has different requirements of
    measurement information as well as temporal and spatial resolution. In this paper
    the strategies are described as ‘sensor-based’ if they directly use measurements
    to make irrigation decisions; and ‘model-based’ if they use a model (often with
    sensor input) to aid irrigation decisions. Sensor- and model-based irrigation
    control strategies often have different sensor data requirements because of the
    nature of the control. For example, a sensor-based control strategy could use
    feedback from infrared thermometers or soil moisture sensors, whilst a model-based
    control strategy requires soil properties and plant growth information to calibrate
    the crop model. The crop model is calibrated to improve the accuracy of the model
    and involves adjusting model parameters according to comparisons between modelled
    and measured data. The specific model calibration procedure would vary depending
    on the crop and model but may be automated. McCarthy et al. (2011) demonstrates
    the calibration of the Australian cotton model OZCOT. Hence, this paper also discusses
    the sensor requirements of the reviewed control strategies. Advanced process control
    in irrigation: progress to date Mathematical programming Irrigation events can
    be scheduled using linear programming (Holzapfel et al. 1986; Azamathulla et al.
    2009), nonlinear programming (Ghahraman and Sepaskhah 1997) or dynamic programming
    (Rao et al. 1988; Naadimuthu et al. 1999), either singly or in combination. These
    involve making irrigation decisions for each growth stage to maximise the farm’s
    income (Rao et al. 1992). The models used are typically either heuristic crop
    yield production formulae (Benli and Kodal 2003) or daily, physically-based soil–plant–atmosphere
    models (Sunantara and Ramirez 1997). Common objective functions (formulae) used
    in mathematical programming aim to optimise water allocation among a single or
    various crops, or maximise the profit of the irrigation. The constraints that
    were generally defined in the mathematical programming applications were water
    availability, agricultural land and cropping patterns. Dynamic programming is
    the most widely used mathematical programming approach to irrigation scheduling
    (Shang and Mao 2006). However, dynamic programming has considerable computational
    requirements. To help overcome this it is common to: (i) discretise the underlying
    water balance and prediction models; (ii) use both linear programming and dynamic
    programming models; and (iii) assume irrigation events are scheduled at regular
    (i.e. weekly) intervals (Yaron and Dinar 1982; Stoecker et al. 1985; Rao et al.
    1990). An exception of case (ii) is Sunantara and Ramirez (1997) where irrigation
    events could be scheduled on any set date rather than at regular intervals or
    by growth stage. An alternative approach to reduce the computational complexity
    of mathematical programming is to use neural networks to sample only a fraction
    of the state space without significantly simplifying the model (Schütze and Schmitz
    2009). There are often large uncertainties in weather (e.g. rainfall, evapotranspiration)
    and water supply during crop seasons. Stochastic approaches may potentially be
    applied to consider uncertainty in spatial variability of unmeasured variables.
    Stochastic rainfall input is of particular importance if rainfall is the major
    water supply source during the crop season. Ramirez and Bras (1985) and Sunantara
    and Ramirez (1997) demonstrated significant performance improvements by considering
    the stochasticity of rainfall inputs using stochastic dynamic programming for
    optimal irrigation scheduling. However, Yaron and Dinar (1982) found little uncertainty
    in rainfall during a field evaluation of a combined linear/dynamic programming
    model in Mediterranean conditions, because the rainfall occurred outside of the
    cotton growing season. Uncertainty in crop water demands (Ganji et al. 2006) and
    spatial variability of soil properties (Russo 1986) have also been considered
    in irrigation optimisation using mathematical programming. Yaron and Dinar (1982)
    speculated that water prices, water supply hydraulics, and measured soil moisture
    and crop response should all be calibrated within the model to adapt to the local
    conditions. Spatial variations of soil and climate have been incorporated into
    linear programming models used for corn, drybeans and soybeans (He 1999). Linear
    quadratic control Linear quadratic control is a branch of ‘optimal control theory’
    1 in which control is subject to quadratic costs (Lewis and Syrmos 1995). Protopapas
    and Georgakakos (1990) simulated an optimal control system which determined daily
    irrigation rates using a soil and plant state space model. The objective functions
    aimed to achieve a final state while minimising irrigation application and minimising
    salinity. Protopapas and Georgakakos (1990) noted that a field implementation
    would require the consideration of more types of constraints and considerations.
    This would be expected to include irrigation delivery constraints and consideration
    of infield measurements of soil and plant response to calibrate the model. Shani
    et al. (2004) implemented an optimal control system to determine optimal moisture
    dynamics during the crop season. This approach was limited to determining the
    general soil moisture curve throughout the crop season rather than discrete irrigation
    events on set dates. Fieldwork verified that this approach outperformed the policy
    of yield maximisation for sunflowers. Artificial intelligence The numerical optimisation
    of irrigation management is computationally intensive and often requires model
    simplification and discretisation. Neural networks (Schmitz et al. 2002) and evolutionary
    algorithms 2 (Schmitz et al. 2007) have been developed to determine irrigation
    volume and timing to minimise irrigation application and maximise yield. These
    systems used a subsurface flow model to calculate the wetting profiles and train
    a neural network to provide irrigation parameters to achieve the desired soil
    moisture profile. Schmitz et al. (2007) demonstrated a 92% higher simulated yield
    for corn using evolutionary algorithms than using a dynamic programming approach
    which used a simplified model. An alternative approach used an evolutionary algorithm
    to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing using a soil water balance
    model and a generic yield prediction model (de Paly and Zell 2009; de Paly et
    al. 2010). Model predictive control There has been significant research in using
    soil and crop models in irrigation management to forecast the process output (DeJonge
    et al. 2007). Model predictive control iteratively executes a model to optimise
    process inputs, rather than numerically operating on the model. Model predictive
    control forecasts the system performance over a finite horizon and uses an optimisation
    algorithm to determine which control action to take to achieve the desired performance
    (Mosca 1995). A model predictive control strategy was simulated to regulate soil
    moisture using a soil dynamics model (Park et al. 2009). The model parameters
    were calibrated using a genetic algorithm, real-time weather data and soil moisture
    measurements from capacitance probes. Learning control Control strategies that
    directly use sensor feedback without a model must perform system identification
    efficiently. This is because the optimisation procedure relies on field measurements
    and is not aided by predictions from a model of soil and crop response. One method
    of sensor-based control that has been applied to irrigation is iterative learning
    control (Moore and Chen 2006). Iterative learning control is used in systems that
    operate repetitively with the same initial conditions at each iteration (Ahn et
    al. 2007). Moore and Chen (2006) conceptualised such a controller to adjust the
    irrigation application flow rate to control the water or concentration of nutrients
    in the soil. This model did not consider temporal changes in crop water use or
    weather conditions; hence, the irrigation events were initiated at regular intervals
    to satisfy the condition that the same initial conditions are present before each
    irrigation event. The control strategy assumed that a sensor would be located
    in each cell of the field; however, in a field implementation this may not be
    practical. Discussion Mathematical programming and linear quadratic control use
    numerical methods to optimise irrigation application and/or timing. The computational
    requirements of these strategies were large even with the simplified crop model.
    This simplification resulted in temporal coarseness of the model, where irrigation
    was allocated to each growing stage or weekly time period. This lack of precision
    potentially results in sub-optimal performance and may restrict the application
    of numerical methods to real-time irrigation management. However, the mathematical
    programming strategies often considered uncertainty in rainfall and evapotranspiration
    which is practical in soil–plant–atmosphere systems. Artificial intelligence reduces
    the complexity of mathematical programming approaches while also optimising irrigation
    management at a daily time scale. Therefore, artificial intelligence-based control
    strategies are potentially more accurate than mathematical programming control
    strategies. Model predictive control iteratively executes crop models to optimise
    irrigation events over the prediction horizon. This strategy can use publicly
    available crop models (e.g. APSIM, McCown et al. 1996; DSSAT, Jones et al. 2003)
    rather than models in state space form. When used for this purpose, the crop models
    are ‘black-box’ because access is only provided to their inputs and outputs. The
    optimisation of irrigation using these ‘black-box’ models is inefficient compared
    with using numerical models; however, they are typically able to deal with complexities
    found in soil–plant–atmosphere systems (e.g. sprinkler spray patterns, English
    et al. 1992). Use of learning control requires that the variable being regulated
    be representative of overall plant status. This control strategy may require many
    irrigation events to achieve optimality because it is only learning from the measurement
    rather than also using prediction from a crop model. Hence, learning control is
    potentially less efficient than model-based control. In a real-time control system
    it is likely that model-based control systems would be integrated with weather,
    soil moisture and plant development sensing systems for model calibration. However,
    none of the strategies reviewed used this full data set to calibrate the model.
    Sensor considerations for advanced process control in irrigation Reviews have
    been conducted for soil moisture content sensors (Charlesworth 2004) and plant-based
    sensors (White and Raine 2008). These technologies either require direct contact
    or are non-contact and proximal (i.e. hand-held or machine mounted) or remote
    (e.g. airborne, satellite). Contact sensors provide a high temporal resolution
    of data for individual points in the field, whilst proximal sensors only provide
    information when the sensor passes over the field, either on an irrigation machine,
    tractor, aerial vehicle or satellite. Soil moisture sensors are typically fixed
    in the field, whilst plant sensors can be either fixed in the field or proximal.
    The combination of plant, soil and weather data that is used for irrigation control
    commonly depends on the sensor availability and grower preference. Similarly,
    the number of sensors that is required to monitor the in-field spatial variability
    depends on the type of sensor, amount of in-field variability and the grower’s
    preferences. No single sensor (either plant or soil) on its own will indicate
    the optimal water application volume for each irrigation event. Similarly, sensor-based
    irrigation control strategies that use only one data type (e.g. soil moisture
    or plant response) may not specifically optimise the water use or crop performance,
    but are required in situations of low data availability. In contrast, model-based
    control strategies using multiple sensors incorporate information from the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relationships that are defined in crop production models to identify optimal water
    applications. The spatial and temporal resolution of sensors required for site-specific
    advanced process control strategies is likely to depend on the type of control
    strategy. For example, model-based strategies may require measurements during
    each growth stage and following irrigation events to calibrate the model, whilst
    sensor-based strategies may require daily or sub-daily measurements to determine
    irrigation timing. Model-based strategies would be able to use the high spatial
    resolution and low temporal resolution data from proximal sensors. However, the
    higher measurement discrimination required by sensor-based strategies may only
    be achievable (at present) using fixed sensors. In a practical control system,
    a minimum number of fixed sensors would be installed in the field to minimise
    cost and labour but this might provide only low spatial resolution. Hence, soil
    sensors that are easy to install would potentially be appropriate for sensor-based
    strategies, e.g. the soil moisture sensor array reported by Vellidis et al. (2008),
    but such low-cost sensor arrays have yet to be proven adequate for sensor-based
    control. Model- and sensor-based control strategies typically have different data
    requirements. For example, the parameters of the models used by sections “Linear
    quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control” must
    be calibrated using measurements recognised by the model (e.g. soil moisture content,
    growth stage, plant height and crop coverage). In contrast, section “Learning
    control” uses measured responses to irrigation (e.g. soil moisture content, plant
    status measurements from infrared thermometers, Peters and Evett 2008). Development
    of sensors that measure parameters specifically for model calibration may be required,
    especially as the input parameters of models can vary depending on climate and
    crop type. Camera-based sensors have been proposed for irrigation management to
    measure plant parameters (McCarthy et al. 2009). Fundamental control concepts
    as they apply to irrigation The review of the current state of advanced process
    control systems for irrigation and sensor development in relation to control systems
    indicates that irrigation control strategies should be robust to (1) application
    hardware and water availability constraints; and (2) data availability limitations.
    Following Ogata (1990) the design of a control system that is practical in an
    irrigation environment requires consideration of stability, robustness and optimality,
    described below in order of significance in traditional control systems: 1. Stability
    is a primary requirement of control systems (Krstić et al. 1995) and characterises
    how a system reacts to disturbances (Hangos et al. 2001). A system is stable if
    the signals remain bounded (Isermann et al. 1992); however, stability is a difficult
    property to evaluate in adaptive control systems due to its dynamic nature (Friedland
    1996). 2. Robustness can be interpreted as stability under system disturbances
    (de Silva 2000). The robustness of a control system denotes the insensitivity
    to parameter changes, model errors (in model-based control) and disturbances (in
    input and control signals) (de Silva 2000). Robust control systems are able to
    account for uncertainty in the process parameters to guarantee the stability of
    the system (Landau et al. 1998). 3. The output of a control system should converge
    to the optimal value. Achieving optimality in control systems relies on optimisation
    techniques (Ogata 1990) and optimisation generally consists of searching the space
    of variable controller parameters as a function of the performance index to determine
    where the performance index is optimal (Ogata 1990). However, when considered
    in relation to the control of irrigation, the order of importance changes. Whereas
    control systems are traditionally designed with the greatest emphasis on stability
    (Åström 1990), it is anticipated that the most critical characteristic of systems
    designed for site-specific irrigation application will be robustness. This is
    because in any practical field implementation there are likely to be deficiencies
    in spatial and temporal data availability, and/or constraints on the irrigation
    system capacity or water availability. Optimality is likely to be the next most
    important principle in the design of an irrigation control strategy. To optimise
    automatic irrigation control, a performance index is typically optimised and the
    sensed variable/s used to calculate the performance index varies according to
    the strategy employed. For example, the irrigation applied may be optimised using
    daily measured data and for cotton this may involve determining the irrigation
    that maximises the square count (‘squares’ are flower buds on a cotton plant)
    or boll count after an irrigation event. Alternatively, predicted end of season
    characteristics (i.e. yield, water use efficiency) may be maximised using a process
    model. Stability is arguably the least significant of the control design principles
    in automatic irrigation control. This is because the soil–plant–atmosphere system
    has very slow dynamics compared with typical processes to which automatic control
    is commonly applied (namely electromechanical and many chemical processes) in
    which major changes often occur in less than a second. Although it is conceivable
    that an unusual change in the soil–plant–atmosphere system might cause some fundamental
    instability in the automatic control of irrigation, the system will not become
    unstable rapidly. Advanced process control approaches to irrigation The strategies
    of section “Advanced process control in irrigation: progress to date” and the
    control design principles of section “Fundamental control concepts as they apply
    to irrigation” can be applied to both uniform and site-specific irrigation control
    strategies. Smith et al. (2009) provides an introduction to the potential use
    of control systems to manage spatial and temporal variations in crop water requirements
    to improve the precision of irrigation applications. An advanced process control
    system utilised for irrigation must be robust to intermittent data availability
    and accommodate spatial variability. Irrigation control can be approached by adjusting
    the irrigation application either: (1) directly from the soil and/or crop response
    measurements (‘sensor-based control’); or (2) from responses simulated using a
    soil and crop production model (‘model-based control’). These strategies are suitable
    for both constant and site-specific irrigation, where the measurements taken represent
    the whole field or a smaller area of the field, respectively. Sensor-based irrigation
    control systems may be implemented as a simple feedback control system (e.g. iterative
    learning control: Ahn et al. 2007) which adjusts the applied irrigation volume
    according to the difference between the desired and measured response. An alternate
    implementation is to evaluate the response of multiple irrigation volumes and
    apply the irrigation volume with the best response (e.g. iterative hill climbing
    control, McCarthy et al. 2010a). There are a number of model-based control strategies
    that may be applicable to spatially varied irrigation. These include optimisation
    approaches (as reviewed in the foregoing sections “Mathematical programming”,
    “Linear quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control”).
    These are considered in this paper in the following sections. The irrigation control
    systems would be implemented in the field using the required sensors which may
    consist of one or a combination of the following: an automatic weather station,
    soil moisture sensors and plant sensors (possibly mounted on the irrigation machine).
    These sensors may transmit wireless data to a controller on the irrigation machine,
    or require manual upload and data transfer. Alternatively, the grower’s observations
    of the soil moisture and plant growth may be used in the control strategies. Similarly,
    the irrigation application may be adjusted at different spatial resolutions (where
    the management areas may be strips of the field or smaller sub-areas of the field),
    and either manually by the grower or automated by a controller. Iterative learning
    control Iterative learning control involves varying the irrigation application
    according to the error between the measured process output and desired process
    output after the previous irrigation. Because this strategy assumes the initial
    conditions are reset after each iteration, the irrigation events would be initiated
    when the crop water use since the previous irrigation event reaches a threshold
    value. The crop conditions would then be approximately the same before each irrigation
    event is initiated. For site-specific irrigation, the iterative learning control
    strategy can consider the irrigation system capacity by increasing the irrigation
    volume applied to cells (i.e. sub-areas) according to the additional crop water
    use (measured from soil moisture sensors or estimated from weather data) between
    the irrigation initiation and when the irrigation is actually applied. Iterative
    learning control also requires data input from each cell in the field; hence,
    measured field data must be kriged in situations of sparse input data to increase
    the spatial resolution of the input data (McCarthy et al. 2010b). Soil moisture
    or leaf area may be used as feedback to measure the system performance for an
    irrigation iterative learning control strategies. The crop water use must be measured
    or estimated each day to determine the irrigation timing. Hence, sensors with
    a high temporal resolution are required. Variable structure control concepts (Åström
    and Wittenmark 1989) may be applied to iterative learning control to ensure that
    the control system is robust to data gaps and deficiencies. This involves adjusting
    the irrigation decision method depending on the input data available. For example,
    if soil data input is not available in one area of the field then plant or weather
    data input may be used to determine the irrigation timing and/or volume. The control
    actions of the iterative learning control strategy use responses from every irrigation
    event in the season rather than from only one irrigation event. This would prevent
    major changes in application during by one irrigation event; hence, stability
    is not likely a major issue for iterative learning control. Iterative learning
    control determines irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop
    response to target the desired soil and/or crop response. These objectives may
    not necessarily optimise final crop yield, profit or water use efficiency. Hence,
    iterative learning control may not reach optimality. Iterative hill climbing control
    A drawback of the iterative learning control strategy is the potentially inefficient
    system identification. This is because there are a limited number of irrigation
    events that occur during a crop season and only one irrigation volume is being
    evaluated in each cell during each irrigation event. Adaptive spatially-varied
    identification may be achieved by utilising site-specific combinations of plant,
    soil and weather data in different zones of the field. Likewise, adaptive system
    identification may be incorporated into an irrigation control system to account
    for the slow speed of crop dynamics and the frequency of irrigation events. The
    efficiency of control systems may be improved for irrigation by evaluating a range
    of inputs to the system at each irrigation event. This would be implemented for
    an irrigation control system by applying and evaluating a range of irrigation
    volumes on different cells in the field. This is similar to the dual adaptive
    control concept (Wittenmark 2002) where perturbation signals are used to learn
    more about the process. This method has been adapted to irrigation and named ‘iterative
    hill climbing control’. ‘Hill climbing’ involves changing the state of the system
    into one that is closer to the goal in the direction of steepest gradient (Russell
    and Norvig 1995). The strategy involves the following process (McCarthy et al.
    2010a): 1. The field is divided into zones according to a pre-measured variability
    map. 2. ‘Test cells’ are selected in each zone to evaluate different irrigation
    volumes. 3. Test irrigation volumes are applied to each test cell. 4. Before the
    next irrigation is applied the crop response to the previous irrigation volume
    is evaluated. A performance index is calculated for each test cell in each zone
    to evaluate the response of the soil and/or plant to the irrigation volume. Using
    plant data in the performance index calculation may involve maximising the square
    count and this is similar to the extremum adaptive control concept. The irrigation
    volume that was applied to the test cell with the highest performance index is
    then applied to the whole zone. 5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for each irrigation
    event. New test cells are also randomly selected in each zone after each irrigation
    event to ensure that the response of a test cell is indicative of the rest of
    the zone. Possible objectives of the iterative hill climbing control are to achieve
    a set soil moisture content or vegetative growth, or maximising yield indicators
    (e.g. square count for cotton). As per iterative learning control (section “Iterative
    learning control”), measurements to determine irrigation volume are only required
    before each irrigation event. However, irrigation timing may be determined after
    a set crop water use which requires data at a higher temporal resolution. Spatial
    data unavailability is generally not important for iterative hill climbing control
    as data input is only required for the test cells. However, if field measurements
    of a test cell are missing, kriging the available data would not show the response
    of the test cells to the test irrigation volumes. Hence, kriging is not appropriate
    for iterative hill climbing control and if critical data input is missing the
    control procedure will fail. As per the iterative learning controller, the irrigation
    system capacity may be considered by increasing the irrigation application according
    to the crop water consumed since the irrigation was initiated. The strategy should
    also be robust to data gaps by using the available streams of data if the desired
    data stream input is unavailable. For example, if plant measurements are not available
    for a strategy that aims to maximise square count, then the strategy will determine
    irrigation application to achieve a set soil moisture content. Also similar to
    iterative learning control, the irrigation volumes applied would have stability.
    This is because the crop coefficients evaluated in the test cells are offset from
    the crop coefficient of the previous irrigation. Hence, only progressive changes
    are made to the irrigation volume applied throughout the crop season, effectively
    dampening any changes to the irrigation application. Iterative hill climbing control
    can potentially aim to maximise plant variables (e.g. square count for cotton)
    which should lead to near-optimality. However, such variables may only be measurable
    towards the end of the crop season and the strategy used at the start of the season
    may not necessary optimise the irrigation application. Model predictive control
    Model predictive control involves using a calibrated model to evaluate a range
    of inputs and implement the input strategy with the best performance. For irrigation,
    model predictive control could involve using real-time field data to calibrate
    a crop and soil model (McCarthy et al. 2011) and then using the calibrated model
    to determine the optimum irrigation timing and volume. Soil and/or plant measurements
    are required to calibrate the model, ideally during each growing stage and in
    response to known irrigation volumes for accurate model calibration. Proximal
    plant sensors would be appropriate for model predictive control because the measurements
    are not necessarily required daily to calibrate the model. Mounting these sensors
    on an irrigation machine or farm machinery also enables data collection at a high
    spatial resolution. Model predictive control can be used to incorporate system
    level constraints into the optimisation algorithm. For example, the limitations
    of irrigation system capacity and seasonal water availability can be considered
    in determining the appropriate volume and timing of irrigation future irrigation
    applications. The model predictive control strategy may produce the same optimal
    crop water use and yield for various distributions of water during the crop season.
    If more than one irrigation volume has the same performance, then a water-efficient
    approach could be taken by selecting the irrigation volume and timing with the
    lowest quantitative volume to achieve the optimal simulated performance. An alternate
    approach is to use grower-specific preferences for the irrigation distribution.
    For example, the grower may have a preference for using lower amounts of water
    early in the season to provide soil water capacity for rainfall during the season.
    Because model predictive control uses a model’s simulations to determine irrigation
    application, variables that are not directly measured (e.g. final crop yield and
    water use efficiency) may potentially be controlled and optimised. In contrast,
    the iterative learning and iterative hill climbing control strategies determine
    irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop response to target
    the desired soil and/or crop response. The performance objective that the controller
    uses depends on the specific objectives of the grower/manager. Model predictive
    control could be robust to cells with data gaps by spatially interpolating the
    available measurements and using these measurements to calibrate the unknown model
    parameters. Because the model is calibrated over the crop season and not just
    from one measurement, model predictive control would not be susceptible to major
    instability. Conclusion Advanced process control is applicable to irrigation which
    has slow dynamics, even though it was developed for relatively fast mechanical
    and chemical processes. This control technique has the capability to deal with
    the complexities of managing the soil–plant–atmosphere system using a range of
    irrigation systems and configurations (i.e. either constant or site-specific irrigation
    with manual or automatic actuation). This has been demonstrated by identification
    of three advanced process control strategies and their application to irrigation:
    iterative learning control, iterative hill climbing control and model predictive
    control. Investigation of the sensor requirements for each control strategy should
    be conducted in the development and analysis of any advanced process control system
    for irrigation. Irrigation control strategies should have minimal sensor requirements
    to ensure the system is practical for growers and enhance the future uptake of
    the technology. Sensor availability is at present a constraint on the automation
    of irrigation control, and it is expected that the requirements of advanced process
    control for irrigation will also drive sensor development. Future research needs
    identified include control strategy development and field evaluation with different
    irrigation systems and field conditions. Notes Optimal control is used to derive
    differential equations which determine the control action to be taken at any time
    for a given system to achieve the desired optimality criterion (Burns 2001). The
    fundamental derivation approach for optimal control is the ‘calculus of variations’
    which finds the path, curve or surface (in the form of differential equations)
    for which a given function has a stationary value which corresponds to the maximum
    or minimum, as required. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by the process of
    biological evolution and involve an iterative procedure whereby a population of
    trial solutions (irrigation application schemes) is evaluated and each solution
    is assigned a fitness that indicates the performance. The population is then evolved
    and a new generation of solutions is created from the solutions of the previous
    generation with the highest fitness (Filippidis et al. 1999). References Ahn HS,

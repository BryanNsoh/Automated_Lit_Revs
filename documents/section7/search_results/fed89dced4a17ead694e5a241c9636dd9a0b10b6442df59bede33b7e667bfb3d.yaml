    low-cost IoT-based control and monitoring system for hydroponics greenhouses.
    The system is based on three types of sensor nodes. The main (master) node is

    Remote monitoring for the greenhouse keepers is facilitated by monitoring these
    parameters via connecting to a website. An innovative fuzzy inference engine determines

    Keywords: IoT; wireless sensor networks; hydroponics; smart agriculture 1. Introduction
    Water shortage and pollution are environmental threats affecting large parts of
    the EU, as well as the rest of the world. Climate change is expected to further
    increase the water shortage and threaten food production. This problem cannot
    be solved by a single effort but must be addressed on many levels. Food security
    is dependent on several environmental conditions, such as water quality and availability,
    soil condition and energy availability. Due to the extensive and exhausting practice
    of agriculture during the last decades, several environmental issues have arisen.
    Climate change is expected to affect water quality and quantity that are already
    in decline [1,2]. Smart farming is a capital-intensive and hi-tech system based
    on the application of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs)
    in agriculture. In IoT-based smart farming, a system is built for monitoring the
    crop field with the help of sensors and automating the irrigation system. Solutions
    for measuring environmental conditions and water quality based on electronic sensors
    and microcontrollers include ATLAS Scientific [3] and Libelium Waspmote [4]. Several
    research papers demonstrate such solutions, as shown in the surveys of [5,6].
    Leveraging other important ICTs that have been successfully employed in other
    similar environments, such as big data [7], blockchain [8] and neural networks
    [9] is important for achieving precise and efficient agriculture [10]. Regarding
    IoT applications in agriculture, approaches range from open field cultivation
    [11,12] to greenhouses [13,14]. Typical parameters are temperature and humidity
    [11,12], but other conditions, such as light [13], are often monitored, as well
    as crop-specific parameters [11]. Greenhouse monitoring and control IoT systems
    are presented in [14,15]. In [13,16], the authors monitored parameters such as
    soil moisture, temperature, humidity and light in order to automate the irrigation
    system. The above solutions are geared toward general greenhouse architectures
    or use generic parameters, such as temperature and humidity only. Hydroponic growth
    has additional monitoring requirements since the hydroponic irrigation system
    is different than the one used in soil cultivation. The complexity of hydroponic
    growth requires precise control, as well as monitoring parameters, such as pH
    and electrical conductivity, through specialized sensors and has only been automated
    in the case of large greenhouses with high cost, which is prohibitive to small-scale
    farmers. The iPONICS system attempts to leverage some of the technologies discussed
    above to provide a scaled-down, low-cost, yet innovative hydroponic solution that
    can be adopted by even hobby-type hydroponic systems. Specifically, we present
    the design and implementation of a novel, low-cost hydroponics monitoring and
    control system based on IoT technologies. In particular, the system is composed
    of a specialized wireless sensor network for monitoring the essential parameters
    for hydroponics and control for the irrigation process. It provides the user with
    a user-friendly web-based tool to monitor their crops, as well as being appraised
    by appropriate alarms and warnings. This greatly facilitates the observation of
    multiple hydroponics greenhouses with minimal effort and need for intervention.
    Unlike the systems discussed above, the proposed system targets hydroponic cultivation
    specifically. Furthermore, we describe the design and implementation of a fuzzy
    inference engine (FIE) system for determining the system irrigation duration.
    A fuzzy set is defined by a membership function that can be any real number in
    the interval [0, 1], expressing the grade of membership for which an element belongs
    to that fuzzy set. The concept of fuzzy sets enables the use of fuzzy inference,
    which, in turn, uses the knowledge of an expert in a field of application to construct
    a set of “IF–THEN” rules. Fuzzy logic becomes especially useful in capturing a
    human expert’s or operator’s qualitative control experience into the control algorithm
    using linguistic rules. Fuzzy logic control (FLC) has been applied successfully
    for controlling numerous systems in which analytical models are not easily obtainable
    or the model itself, if available, is too complex and possibly highly non-linear
    in several applications ranging from network routing [17] to task mapping and
    scheduling [18,19]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes
    the background and Section 3 describes the proposed system in detail. The paper
    concludes with Section 4, which summarizes the results and discusses future work.
    2. Background and System Requirements Hydroponics [20] relies on fertilized and
    aerated water, which provides both nutrition and oxygen to a plant’s root zone.
    It often involves sophisticated mechanization processes, which can be daunting
    to casual hobbyists, as well as small-scale commercial farms. Nutrient solutions
    must usually be below the temperature at which pathogen growth can begin, yet
    not so cool that root activity is suppressed. In hydroponics, as in conventional
    agriculture, nutrients should be adjusted to satisfy Liebig’s law of the minimum
    for each specific plant variety [21]. As it can be seen from Table 1, certain
    crops are tolerant to a wide range of conductivity and pH values, such as spinach,
    asparagus and tomato, while others, such as strawberry, are very sensitive, especially
    to pH changes. This requires close monitoring of the above variables to adjust
    the nutrients. Table 1. Crops’ ideal pH and electrical conductivity values [21].
    Especially in low-cost hydroponics systems, the monitoring is done manually using
    specialized pH/EC meters, which is time consuming and requires constant proximity
    to the greenhouse. The iPONICS system facilitates remote monitoring of the values
    at low cost. Since it takes time for the plants to absorb the nutrients, a low
    sampling rate (as low as once per day) is sufficient for the water quality parameters,
    such as electrical conductivity and pH. In practice, we use a higher sampling
    rate to compensate for sensor and communication errors, as discussed in Section
    4. Ambient temperature and humidity in the greenhouse are also monitored to ensure
    optimal growth. Furthermore, since the purpose of the system is to achieve remote
    monitoring, additional monitoring requirements besides water quality arise. Specifically,
    the ability to generate alarms in cases of unexpected and possibly catastrophic
    conditions must be considered. To that purpose, we need frequent monitoring of
    ambient temperature to generate an alarm in the case of a fire in the greenhouse.
    For that reason, the ambient temperature is read every 8 seconds, but as long
    as it is normal, it is only recorded hourly. Finally, since the greenhouse containing
    the equipment can be situated at a remote location, we have need of some rudimentary
    security. While security is not essential to crop growth per se, we need to be
    at least notified of, if not prevent, unauthorized entry. The most important iPONICS
    system requirements are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. iPONICS system requirements.
    3. iPONICS System Design Given the requirement of monitoring the temperature and
    humidity inside the greenhouse and the great variation in area between various
    types of greenhouses, the environment sensing system must be distributed across
    various nodes, the number of which will depend on the specific greenhouse dimensions.
    On the other hand, for monitoring the water quality and controlling the pump,
    one central node is sufficient. The iPONICS system concept is shown in Figure
    1. Figure 1. iPONICS system concept. The iPONICS sensing and control system is
    a wireless sensor network with a star topology, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2.
    iPONICS WSN topology. The system is composed of three types of nodes: the sensing
    and control unit (SCU), the environment sensing unit (ESN) and the greenhouse
    security unit (GSN). The greenhouse unit (GHU) is a greenhouse containing one
    SCU, which is the master node and several ESN and GSN “slave nodes”, the number
    of which depends on the dimensions of the greenhouse. 3.1. Sense and Control Unit
    (SCU) The SCU is the main (master) node, as well as the central node in the star
    topology of the WSN. It is responsible for measuring the circulating water quality
    through four sensors, namely, temperature, pH, water electrical conductivity (EC)
    and dissolved oxygen (DO). Furthermore, it is responsible for controlling the
    pump in an efficient manner by conserving energy while maintaining the required
    water flow for crops growth and requesting and receiving data from the slave nodes.
    The sensors used were from Atlas Scientific [22,23,24,25]. The reasons for selecting
    these particular sensors were the following: First, they require infrequent recalibration,
    which is convenient while being deployed in a greenhouse during plant growth,
    which requires weeks to months. Second, they are easily integrated into an Arduino-based
    microcontroller system, reducing the development time and time-to-market. Third,
    they are long lasting at a reasonable cost, which are essential attributes in
    order to keep the overall cost of the system an attractive investment for farmers.
    The SCU processing unit used was an Arduino Mega 2560, providing the required
    processing power, program memory and number of pins to support the following connections:
    the Xbee shield, the RTC shield, the Atlas Scientific EZO circuits, the GSM shield,
    the voltage sensor and, finally, the relay module to control the ON/OFF switching
    of the water pumps. All the shields and modules were supplied by the power drawn
    out of the Arduino by the 5v and GND pins. Figure 3 depicts the schematic of the
    SCU, while Figure 4 illustrates its operation using a flowchart. Figure 3. Sense
    and control unit annotated schematic diagram. Figure 4. SCU flowchart. As shown
    in Figure 4, the SCU starts by initializing the serial and I2C communications
    and verifying that all modules are connected. In order to preserve energy, the
    microcontroller is put to sleep, along with the GSM shield since it is the highest
    power-consuming module. The microcontroller awakes in the following cases: An
    “Alarm_Interrupt” that signals abnormal and possibly hazardous temperature/humidity
    readings in which the SCU activates the GSM to send an alarm SMS/email and upload
    these readings to the server. In this case, the system demands operator intervention
    and does not return to sleep or activate the pump. A “Security_Interrupt” that
    signals unauthorized access to the site in which the SCU activates the GSM to
    send a security SMS/email and upload the captured images to the server before
    returning to sleep. The SCU reaches the sampling time of water quality sensors
    in which it collects those readings temporally in the EEPROM. Afterwards, it activates
    the GSM shield and proceeds uploading the water quality readings, and then wakes
    up one ESN at a time and uploads its readings to the server. It returns to sleep
    afterward. The SCU wakes up at fixed intervals for the pump control in which the
    state of the battery, along with the latest water quality readings, dictate the
    powering decision before returning to sleep. Since the entire system is meant
    to be off-grid, it is crucial to minimize the power consumption of the units connected
    to the solar-charged battery whenever possible to guarantee uptime. The use of
    the sleep mode and intelligent control of the water pumps ensures moderate usage
    of the power resources. We measured the current drawn by the SCU under the operating
    conditions listed in Table 3 using both a multimeter and a current clamp. As it
    can be seen in Table 3, the SCU consumed around 1.25 W while sleeping, where the
    GSM was off and the microcontroller was in deep sleep mode. Other connected modules
    were still powered including the Xbee shield, as interrupts are asynchronous.
    In the idle state, the Arduino was awake to regularly do the water quality readings
    or control the water pump, where it consumed about 1.35 W. The power consumption
    almost doubled when the GSM shield was activated for transmission, where it consumed
    about 2.75 W. This could rise to 11.5 W given that the transmission is occurring
    under extreme weather conditions or a weak network connection, which caused the
    GSM to draw higher currents. On the positive side, without interruption, the GSM
    stayed off until the upload time, which happened a few times a day. Figure 5 shows
    an SCU prototype. Figure 5. SCU early prototype. Table 3. SCU power ratings. The
    maximum power (last entry in Table 3) was only consumed when the GSM module is
    first registered to the network. During normal operation, the SCU slept and consumed
    1.25 W while consuming 2.75 W when transmitting data. Therefore, the SCU energy
    consumption per cycle was 𝐸=1.25𝑇+2.75 𝑡 𝑒   (mJ) (1) where T is the sleep period
    and t is the execution time of the main loop (Appendix A). Essentially the sleep
    mode power was multiplied by the duration of the sleep period and the transmission
    power was multiplied by the time it took to transmit the data. The execution time
    was measured in milliseconds by counting the processor cycles. The execution of
    the main loop with no ESNs present was 19,170 ms. With one ESN, the main loop
    execution time was 145,090 ms. Since all ESNs transmitted the same amount of data,
    the execution time was given by the formula: t = 19,170 + 125,920 × ESN (ms) (2)
    Equation (2) also indirectly defines an upper bound in the sampling rate of the
    system, depending on the number of ESNs available. However, such a high sampling
    rate is not required since it takes at least hours for the water quality parameters
    to significantly change (when plants absorb nutrients) and, at most, days when
    most nutrients have been absorbed. 3.2. Environment Sensing Node (ESN) Environment
    sensing nodes are slave nodes that are responsible for monitoring greenhouse environmental
    conditions, such as the ambient temperature and humidity. The necessity behind
    the ESNs is that abnormal temperature and humidity could imply a hazard, such
    as a fire. Therefore, the temperature is monitored every few minutes, but temperature
    and humidity readings are permanently stored on an hourly basis in an SD card.
    The ESN is interrupted by the SCU and then transmits the data to the SCU using
    Zigbee unless there is an alarm (high temperature), in which case, the ESN does
    not wait for an interrupt. This allows for effective monitoring of the greenhouse
    environment while minimizing data transmission and, therefore, power consumption.
    The number of ESNs present in each greenhouse is dependent on the greenhouse dimensions.
    Each ESN has its own ID number and Zigbee address. Figure 6 depicts the schematic
    diagram of the ESN circuit. Figure 6. Environment sensing node annotated schematic
    diagram. The ESN initialization procedure includes initializing the serial and
    SPI communication (Figure 7) and verifying the connection to all modules. After
    initialization, the ESN awakes on fixed intervals to collect the ambient temperature
    and humidity readings and record them on the SD card. If no abnormal readings
    are present, the ESN remains asleep until interrupted by the SCU when it is time
    for data collection. On the occurrence of the abnormal readings, the ESN interrupts
    the SCU with a Zigbee packet payload “Alarm_Interrupt_XX”. The “XX” is a code
    representing either “FIRE” or “Connection” to distinguish whether the alarm is
    due to high temperature due to a possible fire in the greenhouse or just a connection
    problem. Figure 7. ESN flowchart. The ESN power consumption in sleep mode was
    approximately 0.4 W compared with approximately 0.55 W during data transmission.
    However, as mentioned earlier in the SCU subsection (Section 3.1), the transmission
    only occurs a few times a day, unless there is an alarm. In both modes, the Xbee
    module stays active as it is an end device to be interrupted by the SCU. 3.3.
    Greenhouse Security Node (GSN) As discussed in Section 2, the GSN was developed
    as a rudimentary security node and is not essential for the operation of the iPONICS
    system. It comprises a microcontroller with a motion sensor, camera, SD card and
    Zigbee transmitter/receiver. The reason such a node may be used is that a greenhouse
    could be in an isolated area, and we wish to prevent unauthorized entry. It is
    not meant to be a robust security solution, merely a low-cost warning system.
    The node spends the majority of time sleeping to conserve energy under normal
    circumstances. It is woken up by an external interrupt from the motion sensor,
    in which case, it activates the camera to take pictures and sends an alarm to
    the SCU through Zigbee. In the case of an authorized user accessing the system,
    the RFID is used to cancel the alarm. GSNs can also be deactivated and reactivated
    when receiving a command from the SCU. The microcontroller used for the implementation
    of the GSN was Arduino UNO, similar to the ESN. Figure 8 depicts the schematic
    diagram of the node’s circuitry. Figure 8. Greenhouse security node annotated
    schematic diagram. Figure 9 shows a flowchart of the GSN operation. As shown in
    Figure 9, the node starts by initializing the I2C and SPI communications and ensures
    proper wiring of the modules. Then, the node falls into sleep mode and remains
    in that state until motion is detected. After such an event, the node expects
    an authorized ID tag swap. If no such verification of the identity of the user
    occurs in the next few seconds, the GSN interrupts the SCU and signals a “Security_Interrupt”
    inside the first payload, followed by the images that are data captured by the
    node. The GSN draws power of about 0.53 W in sleep mode and about 0.68 W during
    transmission depending on the distance from the SCU. Figure 9. GSN flowchart.
    3.4. SCU Fuzzy Inference Engine An important novelty of the iPONICS method is
    the SCU FIE [26]. We describe here the design of the control algorithm separately
    from the rest of the SCU for clarity. There are several reasons for using FLC
    in iPONICS. First, we have to manage imprecision from sensor errors. Second, the
    ideal values for pH and electrical conductivity vary slightly between plants (Table
    1), and we can accommodate several crops with the same controller by fuzzifying
    the inputs. The architecture of the FIE is shown in Figure 10. It accepts three
    inputs: pH, EC and power supply voltage level. Since the power supply is from
    the battery being charged by a solar cell, the voltage level reflects the battery
    level according to the voltage/charge curve. The DO and water temperature are
    not used for two reasons: first, they are not documented in the literature to
    have a significant effect on efficient hydroponic culture, and second, using five
    or six outputs would require a large number of rules, most of which would be redundant.
    The FIE determines the irrigation duration based on the critical hydroponic parameters
    and the available energy. The general premise behind the knowledge base of the
    proposed scheme is to provide the available nutrients to the plants while being
    conservative with watering when energy and nutrients are low. Figure 10. Fuzzy
    inference engine architecture. According to hydroponics guidelines, the irrigation
    duration is given as follows [21]: 𝑡 𝑖 = 𝑄×3600 𝑚×𝑞  (seconds) (3) where 𝑡 𝑖 :
    irrigation duration in seconds, Q: irrigation dose (lt/bucket), m: number of drip
    lines per bucket and q: drip emission (lt/h) (Appendix A). We applied this formula
    as our baseline duration to determine our fuzzy set membership functions. The
    rationale behind using FLC for controlling the pump stems from the use of an expert
    system based on linguistic if–then rules for the pump on/off duration, coupled
    with inherent uncertainty and errors in sensor readings and different parameters
    for different crops. The above constitute fuzzy modeling as an ideal fit for the
    proposed system. By abstracting the inputs and outputs using fuzzy sets, more
    robust control can be achieved. Figure 11 shows the fuzzy membership functions.
    In order to maintain computational simplicity, we selected trapezoidal and triangular
    membership functions in the proposed control scheme to describe the linguistic
    values of the fuzzy input and output variables. The amount of overlap between
    the membership functions areas was chosen to have at most two membership functions
    overlapping; thus, we will never have more than six rules activated at a given
    time. This offers computational simplicity in the implementation of the proposed
    scheme, which was a design objective. Furthermore, it does not make intuitive
    sense to have a parameter such as pH being considered as both high and low according
    to hydroponics guidelines. The EC and pH membership functions were determined
    based on hydroponics guidelines, while the voltage was based on extending battery
    life. The irrigation duration membership functions were based on multiples of
    the baseline irrigation duration from Equation (3). In the case of clearly erroneous
    sensor values (Section 4.2), the values are not fed to the FIE; instead, the last
    valid values are used. If the pH and EC values seem correct they are fed to the
    FIE and the last valid values are updated for the next sensor reading. Figure
    11. Fuzzy membership functions. The fuzzy rule base was determined based on hydroponics
    guidelines. As mentioned, three inputs are used, with three membership functions
    per input. Therefore, there are a total of 33 = 27 rules. The rules were determined
    empirically according to the principle that when conditions are ideal, the irrigation
    period is the one determined by Equation (3). When conditions are suboptimal,
    especially when the input voltage is low, indicating the battery is discharged,
    the irrigation duration is shortened in order to conserve energy. When EC and
    pH indicate that there are few nutrients to be absorbed, then the irrigation period
    is also shortened. The forms of the rules with some indicative cases are shown
    in Table 4. Table 4. Fuzzy rule structure with examples. The execution time of
    the FIE was measured to be 3326 ms, which is included in the SCU main loop execution
    time reported in Section 3.1. 4. Deployment and Evaluation 4.1. System Deployment
    The iPONICS system was operated in a lab environment for over a year (Figure 12)
    and was installed in a pilot hydroponics greenhouse in order to grow crops. The
    monitoring website is shown in Figure 13. The ubidots platform was used to upload
    the data, and our application was built using an API to transfer the data in .csv
    format and display them. The application was built using javascript, css and html.
    The user can monitor multiple greenhouses at a glance. It provides a dashboard
    for monitoring the water quality and a sidebar for alerts and warnings, such as
    sensor and SD card errors. The user can generate temperature, humidity, pH, EC,
    DO and water temperature graphs created using the D3.js library, with the default
    being the past 24 h. The water quality sensor readings are also shown as doughnut
    graphs that are color-coded the same way as the sensors (Figure 13) for ease of
    monitoring. Figure 12. iPONICS system deployed in lab conditions. Figure 13. iPONICS
    monitoring page. 4.2. Preliminary Reliability Analysis Since the above components
    are meant to operate continuously in greenhouse conditions for long periods in
    order to grow crops, we aimed to analyze their reliability at as early a stage
    as possible. We performed preliminary reliability analysis based on the errors
    and failures observed since they were operational, both in laboratory and greenhouse
    conditions. Reliability analysis was important in the iPONICS system because electronic
    failures could lead to crop failure, as well as a waste of energy and water. We
    performed the analysis on the SCU and ESN nodes since the GSN nodes operated infrequently
    and were aimed at outside threats, which are irrelevant to the plant growth process.
    The central role of the SCU makes it the most critical unit in the subsystem.
    The ESN nodes have redundancy that allows fault tolerance, while there is a single
    SCU in each GHU. We had two SCUs and four ESNs operate continuously for close
    to 1000 h. Using that continuous operation as a basis, we observed errors and
    measured the mean time between them (MTBF). The errors are summarized in Table
    5. They can be categorized as follows. Table 5. Error summary. Sensor errors—Generally,
    sensor errors can be divided into two main categories: hard failure (complete
    failure) and soft failure, such as bias, drift and outliers [27]. We observed
    no hard failures, but we observed both drift and outliers. Transmission errors—We
    noticed occasional GPRS transmission failures. Some were corrected by retransmission
    and we added automatic retries that generally solved the problem, but there was
    one occasion that required manual intervention by communicating with the internet
    service provider in order to be resolved. Since the system remains on all the
    time but sampling and transmission are done with a specific sampling rate, we
    used two approaches to model the system reliability. Specifically, we use a Poisson
    distribution assuming λ is equal to the MTBF: 𝑃(𝑛)= 𝑒 −𝜆𝑡 (𝜆𝑡) 𝑛 𝑛! (4) Regarding
    sensor errors, we also use a binomial distribution with a failure probability
    equal to the error rate: 𝑃(𝑋=𝑛)=( 𝑁 𝑛 ) 𝑝 𝑛 (1−𝑝) 𝑁−𝑛 (5) We noticed that when
    the sampling rate was constant, the two distributions yielded identical results,
    which is to be expected as the Poisson distribution is a limiting case of a binomial
    distribution when the number of trials is large and the probability is small [28],
    which holds for our case (Table 6, column 2). We estimated the probability that
    there will be zero errors during a day at the highest sampling rate (no error
    events in all 24 samples), as well as the probability that there will be an error
    event in all samples in that day at a low sampling rate (4 samples/day). We were
    particularly interested in the case when there were errors in all pH and EC measurements
    since it is then impossible to monitor the system, as well as correctly decide
    on the irrigation duration. Table 6. SCU error analysis. As shown in the table
    above, the probability of single or multiple errors, including transmission errors,
    at the lowest sampling rate (worst case) was less than 7 in 100,000 or about 1
    in 39 years, which is longer than the expected lifetime of the system. Furthermore,
    the probability that there will be only erroneous measurements in either pH or
    EC was less than the sum of respective probabilities since the events were not
    disjointed, which was only approximately 1 in 200,000. 5. Conclusions and Future
    Work A novel hydroponics monitoring and control system based on IoT technologies
    was introduced. In particular, the system is composed of a specialized wireless
    sensor network for monitoring the essential parameters for hydroponics and control
    for the pump. It provides the greenhouse keeper with a user-friendly web-based
    tool to monitor their crops, as well as alarms and warnings, allowing for the
    observation of multiple greenhouses with minimal effort and need for intervention.
    Our future work will focus on two directions. First, further reliability analysis
    by forcing errors and stress testing the system and, second, data analytics. Specifically,
    we are interested in predicting nutrient values based on the original concentrations
    and the water quality sensor values. In general, monitoring specific nutrients
    is a challenging problem for both terrestrial and space applications, even though
    several technologies exist [29]. Most of these technologies require costs that
    may be prohibitive to small-scale farmers, who often add nutrients empirically.
    This could lead to either plants being starved for nutrients or reaching toxic
    levels of nutrient absorption. For now, we are using specialized nutrient monitoring
    equipment [30] to obtain data points daily, as shown in Figure 14. Generally,
    EC is the aggregate of all ions in the plant nutrient solution. The nutrients
    are added to the water (day 1), increasing EC, and they are gradually absorbed,
    typically within 24 h. While the general trend is clearly visible in Figure 14,
    the individual nutrient absorption depends on the pH, the presence of competing
    nutrients, as well as other factors. The ion-specific electrode used requires
    frequent (daily) recalibration, limiting the ability to be used remotely. Accurately
    predicting the nutrient values only from the SCU readings would save the cost
    of such expensive equipment, as well as the need for recalibration, while protecting
    from possible empirical errors. It can also be used to lower the SCU sampling
    rate to conserve energy, even if it increases the probability of erroneous measurements.
    We are currently exploring our obtained data using machine learning models. At
    the time of this writing, given the low data rate since the nutrient values do
    not change rapidly and the fact that EC reflects the aggregate of all nutrients
    and is expected to be highly linear, we are exploring a simple regression model,
    but this is still under investigation. Figure 14. pH, EC and concentrations of
    various nutrients during a typical nutrient cycle: before nutrients are added
    or replenished (day 0) and after (day 1). Most nutrients are absorbed within one
    day (by day 2), depending on the pH. Author Contributions Conceptualization, K.T.

    India SECTION I. Introduction Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a large set of
    embedded devices, called sensors [1]. These sensor nodes sense the information
    from the physical surroundings and send it to the Base Station (BS) to fulfill
    the requirements of the system applications [2]. Sensors used in wireless sensor
    networks have resource limitations such as available memory for storage, processing,
    energy and transmission capability. Nowadays, WSN has invaded every part of our
    daily lives, such as health monitoring [3], home automation [4], environmental
    monitoring, battlefield monitoring [5], and industrial monitoring [3]. In such
    applications, the quality of service (QoS) offered by the WSN in terms of information
    confidentiality, data consistency, and timely transmission functionality has increasingly
    attracted attention from researchers and network designers. Though, sensor nodes
    in WSN are more likely to fail due to the limitation of resources. Fault tolerance
    is one of the most important issues at WSNs. Fault tolerance is a system''s ability
    to carry a required level of functionality whenever faults occur. Many fault tolerance
    schemes have been projected and studied. However, existing fault tolerance schemes
    either exhaust lots of energy to detect and repair failures, or even required
    additional hardware and software resources. In this paper, we propose a game theory-based
    fault tolerance routing scheme for WSNs. The proposed algorithm enhances the existing
    fault tolerance schemes, such as the Clustered Routing for Selfish Sensors (CROSS)
    [6] scheme in the regard that it decreases energy expenditure, increases the network
    endurance, and transfers more data packets in the state when node faults occur.
    The paper''s organization is as follows. We describe related literature in Section
    2. In Section 3, we describe the preliminary and energy model. In Section 4, we
    present a game theory-based fault tolerance routing protocol. The evaluation results
    of the proposed fault tolerance mechanism are presented in Section 5. Finally,
    we concluded this paper in Section 6. SECTION II. Related Work There have been
    various studies that consider clustering and fault tolerance in the wireless sensor
    network. The most famous approach for clustering is the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering
    Hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm [7]. In this method, the cluster head''s position
    is rotated in a probabilistic manner between the nodes. Therefore the energy consumption
    is spread among all network nodes. After LEACH, the number of clustering approaches
    is proposed to increase the network lifetime. However, existing clustering approaches
    are unable to balance the energy expenditure of the deployed sensor node that
    causes premature death of the network. Game theory has emerged as a powerful tool
    in the area of network formation over the past few years. The author in [6] first
    utilizes game theory to analyses the clustering problem and proposed a clustering
    mechanism called Clustered Routing for Selfish Sensors (CROSS) [6]. Every sensor
    node is acting as a player in this approach. Accordingly, each player calculates
    a probability which decides whether or not a player declares to be head of a cluster.
    For providing the fault tolerance, A dynamic energy aware fault tolerant routing
    (DEFTR) [8] protocol is proposed which utilizes equal-sized network subdivision
    based on the size of the network. It is based on a multi-facet mechanism, the
    optimized routing path is established at multilevel and provides fault tolerance.
    This algorithm utilizes the geographical location of each node, but it does not
    consider topological changes of the network. The failure of nodes and the quality
    of links affect the stability and reliability of data transmission. Le et al.
    [4] proposed a Best and Worst Ant System (BWAS) based multipath establishment
    and immune algorithm for multipath transmission. The first phase of the algorithm
    constructed all the links from the sender node to the receiver node with the help
    of information generated by artificial ants which help to select the optimized
    path. The immune algorithm for multipath transmission used the generated paths
    as the input to execute the mutation on the first variant on the population and
    then generates an optimum path with good convergence. The aim of this method is
    transmission reliability and fault tolerance, the BWAS algorithm considers the
    path quality and considers the factor of hop besides energy exhaustion. It does
    not consider the load balancing mechanism for reliable transmission. In [9], the
    virtual cluster head (CH) development and flow graph system is used to efficiently
    handle CHs failure. To provide the standard substitute of all faulty nodes, the
    possible resources of all failure-free CHs are reasonably structured as a virtual
    CH. Fault tolerance is achieved by using the flow graph modeling, with low energy
    exhaustion. But this approach provides fault tolerance only on CH failure. In
    [2], Lanlan et al. presented a routing algorithm named Self Adaptive Fault Tolerance
    (SAFT) which is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Micro Grid (MG).
    PSO is used to construct the routing and the micro grid includes the inter-cluster
    and intra-cluster communication. This approach mainly considers the failed sensors
    and cluster heads. This approach tries to reconnect failed nodes and affected
    nodes using a routing mechanism. This approach has shown better performance in
    terms of data delivery ratio. However, it has data delaying issues. Another work
    to increase the reliability of WSN is done in [3]. To enhance the reliability
    of packet transmission, the author proposed a communication protocol called μNet
    which uses acknowledge messages in peer-to-peer transmissions and minimizes the
    storage capacity of the network and energy depletion of each node. This protocol
    is good for delivering the end to end data, but it is not faster in peer to peer
    transmission. Table 1 shows a comparison between the above existing fault tolerance
    algorithm. SECTION III. Preliminaries and Model In this section an energy model
    of a wireless sensor network is first described. Then, a brief introduction of
    the game theory is given. Here game theory based clustering approach with multipath
    data routing is used to achieve fault tolerance. A. Energy Model The energy consumed
    for data transmission and receiving data is computed using a radio transmission
    model for wireless sensor networks [7]. The transmitter uses the power to operate
    the electronic radio and the power amplifier. The energy needed to convey the
    data message is: E T ={ L( S i )× E elec +L( S i )× E f f × d 2 L( S i )× E ekc
    +L( S i )× E m p × d 4 d< d 0 d> d 0 (1) View Source TABLE I A Comparative Table
    of Fault Tolerance Approach in WSNS. Where Eelec is the amount of energy consumed
    to transmit or receive a single bit message, L(Si) is the number of bits, E f
    f and E m p is the number of bits for the free space model and multi-path model.
    d is the distance of the transmitter-receiver and d0 is the measured threshold
    distance as follows: d 0 = E fs / E mp − − − − − − − √ (2) View Source The energy
    absorbed by the radio to get L(Si) bits of data is represented by: E R i =L( S
    i )× E elec (3) View Source B. Game Model The Game Theory (GT) is widely used
    in commerce to enhance the results by utilizing the strategical game approach
    for the distinctive information economy [10]. In recent years, Game Theory is
    intensively employed in wireless sensor networks for different applications, for
    instance, transmission security, energy efficiency, data gathering. This segment
    reviews the GT used to improve the preservation of energy and increase network
    endurance. The GT can be characterized into two principal divisions: cooperative
    game theory and non-cooperative game theory. 1) Cooperative game theory-based
    approach Sensor nodes cooperate to make a coalition to lessen the energy exhausted
    in the network. Coalition game is deemed one of the most prominent types of the
    theory of the cooperative game. To identify the overlying society in social-networks,
    a novel method is proposed [11]. This method is based on the shapely-value process.
    It stimulates to find the stable coalitions of the grid''s underlying group structure
    with a weight function. Using the local information, a group detection algorithm
    updates the shapely values and weight function. 2) Non cooperative game theory-based
    approach In the theory of non cooperative games, sensors act selfishly to conserve
    their remaining energy by declining to obtain and forward data in the multi-hop
    network [12]. The optimal acknowledgments are achieved while all sensors develop
    their strategy to optimize their use provided the strategies of other players
    with sensors. SECTION IV. A Game Theory Based Clustering Approach for Fault Tolerance
    The proposed approach can be divided into two phases: Cluster formation and selection
    of cluster heads using game theory and Multi-path data transmission phase. A.
    Game theory model for cluster formation and selection of cluster heads Game theory
    is a very effective statistical method for the study and interpretation of moral
    and selfish entities'' behavior. The principle of game theory is used to increase
    power conservation and prolong the network life. 1) Game Model for Cluster head
    selection A distributed clustering algorithm based on non cooperative game theory
    is proposed for cluster head selection. This algorithm is having two-phase, one
    is responsible for the construction of clusters and other is responsible for the
    selection of cluster head according to utility function of the sensors. The model
    for the game may be described as: G = 〈N, S, U〉 ,Where N is number of nodes, s
    = {Si} is the possible strategies and U = {Ui} is the node utility functions.
    The sensor decision can be expressed as: x i (j)={ 1, 0, S i declareasCH S i notdeclareasCH
    (4) View Source As far as payoffs are concerned, if a sensor node decides not
    being a CH moreover if no other sensor becomes a CH either, its payoff will be
    zero. If at least one other neighbor claimed to be CH, then its payoff is r. Eventually,
    if the sensor declares itself CH, its payoff for transmitting the data, r effectively
    will be decreased by a sum equivalent to the charge c of becoming a cluster leader.
    Therefore, the final payoff in that situation will be r-c. For a sensor node the
    utility function can be expressed by: U i (s)= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ 0, r−c, r,  if  S j =0,∀j∈N
    if  S j =1  if  S i =0 and ∃j∈N s.t.  S j =1 (5) View Source where r is residual
    energy and c is cost. For the Nash Equilibrium, the nodes need to play mixed strategies.
    It means the nodes randomly select their tactics using the distribution of probabilities.
    In other terms, each node now has a possibility of announcing itself as CH and
    a likelihood of not doing so. The equilibrium probability PE to enter the game
    for Nash equilibrium with a mixed strategy as follows: P E =1− (1− (r−c) (r) )
    1 N−1 (6) View Source The location of each sensor and its energy level is considered
    in each round of cluster head selection. All the clusters have unique CH that
    can be changed after each round according to their remaining energy. Algorithm
    for the cluster head selection is given below: Algorithm 1: Game Theory based
    CH selection algorithm TABLE II Simulation Parameters B. Fault Tolerance Mechanism
    To provide fault tolerance, reliable and efficient data transmission is important.
    Energy consumption must be less during data transmission. The proposed methodology
    mainly concern the energy consumption and fault tolerance during the transmission.
    Fault tolerance can be achieved by using multipath routing algorithm. Every sensor
    node chooses k disjoint data routing paths during the clustering process, based
    on the energy status of the neighboring nodes. The multipath routing algorithm
    is used to find the alternate paths between the source to the destination. In
    a fault tolerance domain whenever a source node can not forward its data to the
    destination, it can exploit the availability of alternate paths between the source
    to destination. Fig. 1. Cluster Formation in wireless sensor network Show All
    Fig. 2. Number of Nodes Alive versus Number of Rounds Show All SECTION V. Simulation
    Results The performance of proposed approach is evaluated via simulation using
    MATLAB. Proposed approach is compared with the other protocol from the literature.
    The parameters that adopted in simulations are given in Table 2. Fig. 3. Number
    of Dead Nodes versus Number of Rounds Show All TABLE III ENTERING GAME PROBABILITY
    FOR THE NASH EQUILIBRIUM Figure 1 represents the cluster formation between the
    nodes over a wireless sensor network. Table 3 shows the probability for a sensor
    to enter a game given in equation (6) with a growing number of neighbors from
    0 to 30. When the number of neighbor nodes reduces from 30 to 0, entering the
    probability of game raises. To show the performance of the network, number of
    alive nodes is calculated in each rounds and compared with LEACH [7] and CROSS
    [6] as shown in figure 2. The results shows the proposed approach increase the
    life of the network beyond the 1400 rounds which is better than LEACH and CROSS.
    Figure 3 shows the number of dead nodes with respect to each round for LEACH,
    CROSS and proposed approach. The proposed approach uses multipath to provide the
    fault tolerance and game theory based clustering helps to maintain the energy
    consumption of the network. Figure 4 shows the comparison between DEFTR [8], SAFT
    [2] and proposed approach. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, the cluster-based
    fault tolerance routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks is presented to
    tolerate node failures and increases the network lifetime. Firstly, a non-cooperative
    game theory based cluster head selection scheme is built for prolonging network
    life. Secondly, a multi-path based fault tolerance approach is presented, which
    selects k number of disjoint data routing paths for data transmission from sensor
    nodes to the base station. Thirdly, the performance of the proposed fault tolerance
    routing algorithm and some previous routing algorithms are evaluated via extensive
    experiments. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms LEACH, CROSS,
    DEFTR, and SAFT. Fig. 4. Energy consumption of the Network per round Show All

    issue when the effluent is reused or discharged to water resources. Main factors
    affecting the performance of the wastewater treatment plant are the variation
    of the influent, inherent variability in the treatment processes, deficiencies
    in design, mechanical equipment, and operational failures. Thus, meeting the established
    reuse/discharge criteria requires assessment of plant reliability. Among many

    is one of the popular and efficient methods. FTA is a top down, deductive failure
    analysis in which an undesired state of a system is analyzed. In this study, the
    problem of reliability was studied on Tehran West Town wastewater treatment plant.
    This plant is a conventional activated sludge process, and the effluent is reused
    in landscape irrigation. The fault tree diagram was established with the violation
    of allowable effluent BOD as the top event in the diagram, and the deficiencies
    of the system were identified based on the developed model. Some basic events
    are operator’s mistake, physical damage, and design problems. The analytical method
    is minimal cut sets (based on numerical probability) and Monte Carlo simulation.
    Basic event probabilities were calculated according to available data and experts’

    and Qualitative Framework for Reliability Assessment of Waste Water Treatment
    Plants Under Coastal Flooding Article 24 September 2018 Introduction Nowadays,
    due to increasing demand and limited water resources, the direct reuse of reclaimed
    wastewater is so important. It has been practiced in many countries where reuse
    is necessary to face the water demand for different purposes. Yang and Abbaspour
    (2007) studied an analysis of wastewater reuse scenarios in Beijing. The results
    suggest that the wastewater reuse potential is high at competitive prices. Also,
    they concluded that the main users of the treated wastewater are agricultural
    irrigation and urban recreation sectors. Agrafioti and Diamadopoulos (2012) studied
    reuse of treated municipal wastewater for crop irrigation on the Greek island
    of Crete. The study showed that water recycling during summer could reserve approximately
    19.16 Mm3 of fresh water which corresponds to 4.3 % of total irrigation requirements.
    Pedrero et al. (2010) reviewed the status of municipal wastewater reuse in Greece
    and Spain for agricultural purpose. They discussed the effects of the treated
    wastewater on soil and plant growth according to the past studies and concluded
    that the possibility of using reclaimed wastewater mixed well with water is a
    good solution for improving the agronomic quality of treated wastewater. Also,
    the high salinity and boron concentrations are the main problems associated with
    treated wastewater use. Due to shortage of water resources, direct potable reuse
    is also implemented in some regions. The city of Windhoek is the capital of Namibia,
    the most arid country in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1968, Windhoek has been adding
    highly treated reclaimed water to its drinking water supply system. The project
    is operated whereby intermediate treated water criteria have to be maintained
    at certain unit process. Failure to meet these criteria precludes the delivery
    of final reclaimed water into the distribution system (Tchobanoglous et al. 2011).
    In another project, in the period from 1985 to 1992, the city of Denver, CA, conducted
    a potable reuse demonstration project. The objective of the project was to examine
    the feasibility of converting secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant
    to water of potable quality that could be piped directly into the drinking water
    distribution system. No adverse health effects were identified based on extensive
    toxicity and carcinogenicity studies (Tchobanoglous et al. 2011). In all water
    reuse projects, insufficient treated wastewater can cause serious problems for
    the public health and the environment. Therefore, the quality of treated wastewater
    is a significant issue and should be evaluated before the reuse. The reliability
    of a system is to achieve good performance in specific time and under specific
    conditions. Achieving the effluent standard depends on several factors including
    variations in loads and flow, potential failures in the treatment processes, and
    equipment. These factors cause uncertainty in the performance of a treatment plant.
    This uncertainty or risk of failure is inevitable. Thus, wastewater treatment
    plant should be designed and operated based on acceptable risk. Evaluation of
    the reliability performance of a wastewater treatment plant and effluent quality
    is closely related (Oliveira and Sperling 2008). Reliability is defined as the
    probability of success in the proper performance of wastewater treatment plant
    that should meet the effluent quality standards. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is
    one of the most effective methods in system reliability analysis. FTA is a deductive
    failure analysis whereby an undesired state of the system is specified. The faults
    in a system can be the events associated with mechanical failures, human errors,
    or any other related events that can lead to the undesired event. In FTA, the
    sequence of events leading to the probable occurrence of the undesired event is
    systematically divided into basic events whose failure probabilities can be estimated.
    Therefore, a fault tree illustrates the logical interrelationships of basic events
    that lead to the undesired event which is the top event of the fault tree (Haimes
    2009). Methods developed in reliability analysis are divided into two groups,
    namely quantitative and qualitative methods. The qualitative method is defined
    as an analysis of events and factors affecting the system errors without numeric
    values while quantitative method is based on Boolean algebra, where the events
    either occur or do not occur. However, a qualitative review is needed in the quantitative
    analysis. To date, few studies have been performed about the reliability analysis
    of water and wastewater treatment plant based on FTA method or similar procedures.
    Oliveira and Sperling (2008) examined the reliability of a number of wastewater
    treatment plants in Brazil using coefficient of reliability (COR). This coefficient
    was calculated using statistical parameters of effluent data. Then, the reliability
    of wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs) was evaluated regarding the effluent discharge
    standards. Al Saleem (2007) developed a probabilistic reliability model applying
    gamma distribution to analyze the influent and effluent data of flow and concentration.
    Then, the future performance of a wastewater treatment plant was predicted. Using
    statistical methods in reliability analysis require influent and effluent data
    of treatment plant while in case of lacking data, systematic methods such as FTA
    are more efficient. Kelley and Allison (1981) applied FTA to assess the violation
    of residual chlorine in the effluent of chlorination process in a wastewater treatment
    plant with trickling filter process. The process chain includes primary clarifier,
    trickling filter, nitrification tank (aerated), secondary clarifier, denitrification,
    tertiary clarifier, and chlorine contact. The findings showed that the residual
    chlorine was directly affected by mixing time. It was also concluded that the
    number of sensors, reliable monitoring, and preparation was not sufficient. The
    study did not refer to biological process reliability. In another study, Mercer
    and Hrudey (1990) applied FTA to assess the reliability of the production of drinking
    water. They quantitatively assessed the risks created by operators in the water
    treatment plant. Andreas et al. (2009) applied the FTA method in risk analysis
    of water distribution network system. Beauchamp et al. (2010) developed a method
    for technical and operational hazard identification of the water treatment plant
    based on FTA. The main objective of this survey was to develop a systematic approach
    to improve the perception of the effect of operational and technical factors on
    the removal of the pathogen Cryptosporidium pavum through an ultrafiltration membrane
    train. Also, Bourouni (2013) used FTA and reliability block diagram for operational
    assessment of a reverse osmosis system in water treatment. In another study, Li
    Jun (2008) assessed the reliability of a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant
    using FTA method. The factors considered in the survey were failure of mechanical
    and electrical facilities, human errors, and automotive control system. The study
    did not consider biological process factors effective in the operation of treatment
    system. In the previous studies, the reliabilities of the WWTPs were mostly assessed
    based on statistical methods requiring a complete set of data. FTA technique was
    used in the analysis of some water treatment plants, but seldom used in analysis
    of WWTP systems. In those studies of WWTP, the biological process chain of the
    treatment system was not considered in the fault tree. The reliability of the
    plant was analyzed based on the electrical and mechanical system and human factors.
    In this paper, reliability of Tehran West Town (TWT) WWTP is analyzed for effluent
    biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) violation as the top event in the FTA diagram.
    The WWTP system is conventional activated sludge, and the effluent is reused for
    landscape irrigation. Methodology The risk of a system is defined as the probability
    of failure over the specified system lifetime under specified operating conditions
    (P f ). System reliability is the complementary probability of nonfailure or success
    as in Eq. (1) (Kottegoda and Rosso 2008). $$ \\mathrm{Reliability}=1-{P}_f $$
    (1) Fault tree is a deductive method based on the defect started with an undesired
    event. Fault tree as a qualitative model provides extremely useful information
    about the causes of unwanted events and as a quantitative model gives good information
    about the probability of occurrence of the top event and importance of basic event
    (Valadkhani 2004). Fault tree shows interaction between events by using logic
    gates and describes how the system faces the failure. Steps of FTA are as follows
    (CCPS 2000): 1. Recognizing the system and its operation which clarify communications
    and interactions between system components. 2. Identifying top event as a unique
    event that represents crisis state of system which may cause system failure. 3.
    Construction of fault tree diagram and reasonable development of failure. In this
    stage, the causes of top event are connected to each other with logic gates like
    “AND,” and “OR.” 4. Qualitative analysis, including ranking of basic events by
    determination of their probabilities using available data and experts’ opinions.
    5. Quantitative analysis to calculate probability of top event. There are some
    limitations in using FTA. There is probable weakness in recognition of all possible
    events that lead to the top event. Also, determination of failure probabilities
    especially human errors is very complicated (Wu et al. 2011). Generally, a cut
    set is a combination of basic events that can be used for occurrence of top event.
    Minimal cut set is the smallest subset of cut sets that is necessary for occurrence
    of top event. The minimal cut set is obtained using Boolean algebra techniques.
    These techniques involve representing the gates in a fault tree with the equivalent
    Boolean expressions. The Boolean variables in an expression will represent the
    gates and basic events in a fault tree. It moves downward from the top event level
    by level, and the upper events are replaced by the lower events. AND and OR gates
    Gates are standard logic symbols that represent the interconnection between the
    contributory events. AND gates describe the events that must coexist to cause
    the top event. Alternate events that can individually cause the top event are
    described using the OR relationship. In the fault tree diagram, AND gate develops
    the horizontal propagation and OR gate develops the vertical propagation. Based
    on the assumption that events are statistically independent, AND gates are replaced
    with the product of their inputs as shown in Eq. (2): $$ {P}_T\\left(\\mathrm{top}\\kern0.5em
    \\mathrm{event}\\right)={\\displaystyle \\prod_{i=1}^n{P}_i} $$ (2) where P T
    represent the probability of failure at the output of the gate and P i indicates
    the probability of input defects. The OR gate is replaced with the sum of the
    inputs as shown in Eq. (3): $$ {P}_T\\left(\\mathrm{top}\\kern0.5em \\mathrm{event}\\right)={\\displaystyle
    \\sum_{i=1}^n{P}_i} $$ (3) The parameters are the same as in Eq. (2). Generally,
    the probability of events union is obtained using Eq. (4) (Ross 2010). $$ P\\left({O}_i{\\displaystyle
    \\cup }{O}_j\\dots {\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_n\\right) = {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n}P\\left({O}_i\\right)
    - {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=2}^n}\\ {\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}}\\ P\\left({O}_i{\\displaystyle
    \\cap }{O}_j\\right) + {\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=3}^n}\\ {\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=2}^{i-1}}\\
    {\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}}\\ P\\left({O}_i{\\displaystyle \\cap }{O}_j{\\displaystyle
    \\cap }{O}_k\\right) - \\dots +{\\left(-1\\right)}^{i-1}P\\left({O}_1{\\displaystyle
    \\cap}\\dots {\\displaystyle \\cap }{O}_n\\right) $$ (4) Since the events are
    assumed statistically independent, the probability of intersection of events equals
    their product. The value of product is very small, so it is assumed P(A ∩ B) ≅ 0
    (Dhillon and Singh 1981). Monte Carlo algorithm in FTA In the FTA of complex systems
    with large number of minimal cut sets, the Monte Carlo approach can be used to
    evaluate the top event probability. It is used as a supplementary means to verify
    the results of the minimal cut set approach (Ejlali and Miremadi 2004). Monte
    Carlo simulation is in the class of computational algorithms that are based on
    repeated random sampling to compute results. Usually, Monte Carlo simulation is
    used when the exact value of results cannot be computed with deterministic algorithms.
    This is one of the most effective methods for reliability assessment due to its
    ability of good expression of statistical nature of the events. The principle
    behind the Monte Carlo methodology is to simulate the occurrences of the primary
    events using a random number generator. In this section, an algorithm for Monte
    Carlo sampling is presented to evaluate the top event probability of a fault tree.
    The algorithm consists of determining the state of each event randomly and calculating
    the state of the top event. The top event of a fault tree can be expressed as
    a function of a basic event as follows: $$ T=f(E)=f\\left({E}_1,\\ {E}_2,\\ {E}_3,\\dots,
    {E}_n\\right) $$ (5) where T is the top event of the fault tree and E is a vector
    of a basic event in which E i is the ith basic event of the fault tree. The state
    of all basic events and its occurrence probability are defined as S in the Eq.
    (6): $$ S=\\left({S}_1,\\ {S}_2,\\ {S}_3,\\dots, {S}_n\\right) $$ (6) where S
    i is the state of the ith event that can be “true” or “false” (Han and Lim 2012).
    In the Monte Carlo method, the probability of top event (P T ) is stochastically
    determined by sampling the state of basic events based on their occurrence probability,
    and propagating their states until the state of the top event is determined. The
    state of S is determined by random sampling. Figure 1 illustrates the process
    of Monte Carlo simulations in the FTA. P i is the probability of ith basic event
    which is determined according to experts’ opinions or available data, N is the
    total number of trials, and m is the number of top event failure. For each trial,
    each primary event is simulated by generating a random real number (r i ) in the
    range 0–1. If this number is less than or equal to the probability of the primary
    event (P i ), the event is considered to have occurred and the state of the event
    (S i ) is set to true. Otherwise, it is assumed not to occur and the state value
    is set to false. Fig. 1 Flowchart of Monte Carlo process in the fault tree analysis
    Full size image The fault tree is then evaluated with these values for the primary
    events to see if the top event occurs. The number of top event occurrences is
    stored, together with the corresponding failure mode. Failure mode is the list
    of primary events that occurred to cause the top event (Yevkin 2010). Finally,
    the probability of the top event (P T ) is obtained by Eq. (7). $$ {\\mathrm{P}}_{\\mathrm{T}}=\\frac{m\\times
    {P}_m}{N\\ } $$ (7) where m is the number of top event failure, N is the number
    of total trail, and P m is the probability of at least one component (primary
    event) failure. The propagation of the state of a basic event can be performed
    recursively in the structure of a fault tree. Usually, in a fault tree, there
    are a large number of intermediate gates to handle the relation among basic events
    and the top event. Therefore, the state of the intermediate gate should be determined
    to find out the state of the top event. The state of a gate (S g ) is calculated
    based on the states of its inputs. If the states of all inputs for an OR gate
    are false, S g becomes false; otherwise, it becomes true. If the states of all
    inputs for an AND gate are true, S g becomes true; otherwise, it becomes false
    (Han and Lim 2012). The calculations are performed using OpenFTA software (Formal
    Software Construction Ltd 2005). Case study TWT WWTP serves 85,000 people equivalent
    to an average flow rate of 30,240 m3/day which corresponds to about 356 L/(day
    person equivalent). The process is conventional activated sludge process including
    screening, grit chamber, primary sedimentation, aeration, secondary sedimentation,
    and disinfection for liquid process. Sludge process includes aerobic digestion
    and sludge drying bed. Flow diagram of the plant is shown in Fig. 2. Treatment
    plant effluent is reused for landscape irrigation. In this study, BOD5 is considered
    as the main parameter for the assessment of effluent quality. Fig. 2 Flow diagram
    TWT WWTP Full size image According to the Iranian standard of wastewater reuse
    in landscape irrigation, limits of BOD, Total suspended solids (TSS), and fecal
    coliform are, respectively, 31 mg/L, 40 mg/L, and 1000 MPN/100 mL (IVPSPS 2010).
    A 3-year data set of TWT WWTP shows that the most critical parameter violating
    the standard limit is BOD. In other words, in all records, the parameters such
    as TSS and coliform do not violate the standard limit unless BOD exceeds 31 mg/L.
    Therefore, BOD is considered as an index parameter and its violation from the
    standard limit is selected as the top event of fault tree. Results According to
    the flow diagram and process chain of the treatment plant, the logical relation
    of the performance of different units to the top event occurrence (violation of
    effluent BOD) is analyzed. This analysis is made based on the literature and opinions
    of the experts and plant operators. Finally, the hierarchy of the factors leading
    to the occurrence of top event is illustrated as the fault tree diagram. Figures
    3, 4, and 5 depict the fault tree diagram of the TWT WWTP. In these figures, symbol
    for “AND” gate is “ ” and symbol of OR gate is shown as “.” According to Figs.
    3, 4, and 5, BOD violence may occur mainly due to the failures in the performance
    of secondary sedimentation, aeration tank, primary sedimentation, and sludge returning
    and disposal systems. These failures are categorized as human and mechanical errors,
    climate factor, and sewer system factor. Human errors include operator absence
    and operator errors. Mechanical errors consist of equipment damages like (baffle,
    weir, and rotary bridge). Climate factors refer to atmospheric factors and high
    infiltration/inflow in sewer system which may upset the plant operation. The fault
    tree diagram is divided to three figures (Figs. 3, 4, and 5) due to its large
    size and numerous components; the connection of each figure to the next one is
    shown by a triangular symbol. In these figures, letter “O” stands for basic events;
    “N” for top event; letters “A,” “B,” “C,” and “X” are symbols for events in levels
    1 to 4, respectively. Fig. 3 Wastewater treatment plant fault tree (part 1) Full
    size image Fig. 4 Wastewater treatment plant fault tree (part 2) Full size image
    Fig. 5 Wastewater treatment plant fault tree (part 3) Full size image As shown
    in Fig. 3, the top event (level 1) is connected directly to the failure events
    in secondary sedimentation and aeration tank (level 2). Subset events in secondary
    sedimentation (level 3) are such as effluent weir performance, hydraulic and shock
    loads, short circuiting, rising, bulking, and increase of sludge blanket thickness.
    All events in level 3 (B1 to B6) are interconnected with OR gate. Equipment failure
    (O3) or design problem (O4) may cause fault in weir performance (B6). High infiltration/inflow
    (O6) or operator error (O8) is the cause of hydraulic and shock loading (B5).
    Short circuiting is an event which can be caused by improper inlet and outlet
    design or geometry of the basin. So the sub-events considered for short circuiting
    are design problem and equipment failure connected with OR gate. Sludge rising
    is another problem in the operation of secondary sedimentation that results from
    simultaneous occurrence of reduction in sludge disposal rate and high retention
    time with nitrification. The basic events in this category are operator absence
    (O1), sludge pump malfunction (O2), and design problem (O4). Sludge bulking is
    a common problem in most of activated sludge processes. It is caused by presence
    of a complete mix regime without application of a biological selector at the entrance
    of aeration tank. It is finally related to design problem (O4). Increase of sludge
    blanket thickness may occur due to equipment failure and reduction of sludge disposal
    rate. The latter results from sludge pump malfunction and operator absence. Failure
    events in aeration tank as shown in Fig. 4 include toxic entry, foaming, irregular
    rate of return, and waste sludge with respect to MLSS, F/M, and SRT values and
    malfunction of primary sedimentation. Foaming occurs due to operator error, sludge
    pump malfunction with operator absence results in irregular rate of return and
    waste sludge, design problem, operator absence, and equipment failure are the
    basic events that cause failure in aeration system. In the primary sedimentation,
    as shown in Fig. 5, events that are considered for the failure of the system are
    effluent weir performance, short circuiting, failure in proper sludge disposal,
    increase of influent TSS, and malfunction of scum skimming. These events at the
    second level of fault tree diagram are interconnected with OR gate. As shown in
    Fig. 5, basic events at the bottom level of diagram are equipment failure (O3),
    operator absence (O1), design problem (O4), atmospheric factors (O7), and high
    infiltration/inflow (O6). According to the fault tree diagram in Figs. 3, 4, and
    5 and using Boolean algebra, the minimal cut sets are determined as follows: $$

    sets are (O 1 O 2 , O 3 , O 4 , O 5 , O 6 , O 8) To calculate the probability
    of top event, the probabilities of basic events must be known. Determination of
    these values is based on literature, available data, and experts’ opinions. In
    this regard, a fault tree evaluation team was established consisting of experts
    in plant operation, process design, mechanical equipment, and one faculty member.
    The mean values of the given opinions are used in the probability estimations.
    Therefore, the probabilities of basic events in minimal cut sets are estimated
    as follows: Sludge pump malfunction According to the previous reports and operators’
    opinions, the sludge pumps are regularly out of service 10 days a year. Therefore,
    $$ P\\left({O}_2\\right)=\\frac{10}{365}=0.027 $$ Equipment failure like baffles,
    weirs, and rotary bridge are evaluated, and according to the mean value of evaluation
    team’s opinions, this event happens 8 days in a year. So, we have $$ P\\left({O}_3\\right)=\\frac{8}{365}=0.02
    $$ Climate factors Due to infiltration/inflow in the sewer network and increase
    of the plant inflow during rainy days, the probability of failure is calculated
    according to the local precipitation data. Based on a 15-year period (1996–2010)
    average meteorological data of Mehrabad station (the nearest station to the plant),
    the annual average number of rainy days is about 55 days a year. According to
    the past experiences in the plant and the evaluation team’s opinions, it is assumed
    that in 30 % of rainy days the plant is disturbed. Therefore, $$ P\\left({O}_6\\right)=P\\left({O}_7\\right)=0.3\\times
    \\frac{55}{365}=0.045 $$ Design problems Based on the evaluation team’s opinions,
    the share of design problems in each unit malfunction is considered about 3 %
    or P(O 4) = 0.03 Toxic entry Based on the evaluation team’s opinions and according
    to the existence of small industrial plants, the probability of discharge of toxic
    wastes to main sewer is considered 3 % or P(O 5) = 0.03 Operator error The probability
    of operator error that causes the failure is considered about 15 % equal to the
    average of evaluation team’s opinions (P(O 8) = 0.15). Operator absence Assuming
    12-h operator presence in wastewater treatment plant, the probability is calculated
    as follows: $$ P\\left({O}_1\\right)=\\frac{12}{24}=0.5 $$ Quantification of fault
    tree Using Boolean algebra and replacing probabilistic values from the previous
    section, the occurrence of top event is evaluated as follows: $$ \\begin{array}{l}P(N)=P\\left(\\left({O}_1{\\displaystyle
    \\cap }{O}_2\\right){\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_3{\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_4{\\displaystyle
    \\cup }{O}_5{\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_6{\\displaystyle \\cup }{O}_8\\right)\\hfill
    \\\\ {}P(N)=P\\left({O}_1.{O}_2\\right)+P\\left({O}_3\\right)+P\\left({O}_4\\right)+P\\left({O}_5\\right)+P\\left({O}_6\\right)+P\\left({O}_8\\right)=0.02+0.03+0.03+\\hfill
    \\\\ {}0.045+0.15+\\left(0.5\\times 0.027\\right)=0.289\\hfill \\end{array} $$
    (8) So, the reliability of WWTP based on Eq. (1) will be $$ \\mathrm{Reliability}=1-P(N)=1-0.289=0.711=71.1\\%
    $$ Therefore, the probability of violation of effluent BOD from the standard limit
    for landscape irrigation is 28.9 % and reliability of WWTP is 71.1 %. To better
    evaluate and rank the factors influencing the reliability, basic events are categorized
    to four groups including human factors, mechanical factors, and climate and sewer
    system factors. To determine the importance degree of each basic event, an improvement
    factor is defined based on Eq. (8) (Gharachoorlo 2005). $$ \\mathrm{IF}=\\frac{P(N)-P\\left({N}_0\\right)}{P(N)}\\times
    100 $$ (9) where IF is the improvement factor for a specified event, P(N) is the
    probability of top event with all basic events present, and P(N o) is the top
    event probability when the specified event is absent. The results of IF according
    to Eq. (8) regarding P(N) = 0.289 is presented in Table 1. Results show that operator
    error in the category of human factors has the greatest impact on the occurrence
    of the top event. High infiltration/inflow and design problems are in the subsequent
    order. Table 1 Basic event improvement factors Full size table Monte Carlo simulation
    Quantitative analysis of wastewater treatment fault tree with Monte Carlo simulation
    performed by OpenFTA software, with N = 10,000 trials. The results are as follows:
    $$ \\begin{array}{l}\\mathrm{Number}\\ \\mathrm{of}\\ \\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{ystem}\\
    \\mathrm{failure}\\ \\left(\\mathrm{top}\\ \\mathrm{event}\\right)=m=4066\\hfill
    \\\\ {}\\mathrm{Probability}\\ \\mathrm{of}\\ \\mathrm{at}\\ \\mathrm{least}\\
    \\mathrm{one}\\ \\mathrm{component}\\left(\\mathrm{primary}\\ \\mathrm{event}\\right)\\
    \\mathrm{failure}={P}_m=0.6522\\hfill \\\\ {}\\mathrm{Number}\\ \\mathrm{of}\\
    \\mathrm{failure}\\ \\mathrm{when}\\ \\mathrm{one}\\ \\mathrm{of}\\ \\mathrm{the}\\
    \\mathrm{primary}\\ \\mathrm{event}\\mathrm{s}\\ \\mathrm{is}\\ \\mathrm{occurred}=m\\times
    {P}_m=2651\\hfill \\end{array} $$ Therefore, the top event probability is calculated
    based on Eq. (7) as P T  = 0.265. According to Eq. (1), the reliability is calculated
    as follows: $$ \\mathrm{Reliability}=1-{P}_T=1-0.265=0.735=73.5\\% $$ In Monte
    Carlo simulation, the importance of basic events in the top event occurrence is
    calculated based on Eq. (10) and failure contribution is calculated based on Eq.
    (11) as follows: $$ {I}_e=\\raisebox{1ex}{${n}_f$}\\!\\left/ \\!\\raisebox{-1ex}{$m$}\\right.
    $$ (10) $$ {F}_c={I}_e\\times {P}_T $$ (11) I e : The importance of ith basic
    event in the top event occurrence n f : Number of failure for the ith basic event
    F c : Failure contribution of ith basic event P T : Top event probability Monte
    Carlo simulation results are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, operator
    error with a failure contribution of 0.14 has the highest impact on occurrence
    of top event. It is in accordance with the results of the improvement factor.
    Comparing sum of failure contribution of the factors shows that human factors
    have the greatest impact on the failure event of the treatment plant. It also
    corresponds to the results of improvement factor obtained through minimal cut
    set approach. On the other hand, operator absence and sludge pump malfunction
    have the minimum failure contribution. Table 2 Basic event importance in top event
    occurrence—Monte Carlo simulation Full size table To improve the plant reliability
    and reduce the risk, mitigation measures must be considered. According to the
    above results, the first priority is improvement in human factors. Therefore,
    the most important measure could be management of operators by developing the
    training programs and increasing the technical knowledge of the operators. Also
    measures such as increasing the level of supervision, precision, and automation
    are essential in improvement of the plant effluent quality regarding the standard
    level. In this analysis, the mechanical factors have the minimum priority in comparison
    with other factors due to the existence of spare parts and regular equipment service
    and repair. Among the treatment units, according to the role of basic events in
    the failure event of each unit, secondary sedimentation has the highest priority
    in controlling the WWTP effluent quality. Therefore, the precise and sensitive
    operation of this unit is crucial in the reliability of the treatment plant. According
    to the Fig. 3, the events such as rising and bulking are considered as causes
    of design factor; therefore, measures such as construction of biological selector
    unit before aeration tank or altering the hydraulic regime of the aeration tank
    from complete mixed to the plug flow is necessary. If sludge rising happens in
    the secondary sedimentation, nitrification control in aeration tank and detention
    time of sludge in the tank will be important. Comparing the results with current
    researches that have used FTA in environmental engineering problems shows the
    significant contribution of this survey in risk analysis of WWTPs. The corresponding
    research studies in recent years are done in different fields such as mechanical
    reliability of a treatment system, risk of water supply systems, and pollution
    spill in water resources. Using FTA for assessment of mechanical reliability of
    a RO system showed that the high pressure pump had a high influence on the total
    availability of the system. It was concluded that particular attention should
    be taken on the selection and the maintenance of the high pressure pump in RO
    system (Bourouni 2013). Lindhe et al. (2012) used dynamic fault tree to analyze
    risk of drinking water systems. Results of dynamic fault tree were compared to
    the results from Markov model simulations which showed a good agreement between
    two methods. Jian et al. (2011) assessed the risk of sudden water pollution using
    fuzzy fault tree technique. The assessment was based on the statistical analysis
    of historical sudden water pollution data and analysis of risk sources. The results
    showed that the abnormal discharge of sewage was the main risk factor in the studied
    zone. Landquist et al. (2014) used fault tree model to assess the risk of pollution
    discharge from shipwrecks. The model was applied for a hypothetical example including
    two shipwrecks. Tchorzewska et al. (2012) analyzed the failure of a water supply
    system using FTA in two situations of water shortage and water contamination.
    In another study, FTA model was applied to failure assessment of a rural drinking
    water system in Buyamba, Uganda (Saavedra 2011). Thus, due to rare study in risk
    analysis of WWTPs, the results of this survey helps the plant operators and decision
    makers improve the reliability of a WWTP with an effective tool. Fault tree gives
    a better insight into the causal chain of plant failure events and shows how to
    improve a plant performance especially when the quality of reclaimed water for
    reuse is critical. Conclusion In this research, capabilities of fault tree in
    reliability analysis of the TWT WWTP were presented. The aim of the reliability
    analysis was assessment of the violation of effluent BOD from the standard limit
    for landscape irrigation. It was assigned as the top event in the fault tree diagram.
    A systematic approach was applied to investigate the factors influencing the failure
    of the system. Using Boolean algebra, the minimal cut sets were derived and the
    probabilities of basic events were determined based on the previous data and expert
    team’s opinions. Finally, the reliability of the system was calculated 0.71. Applying
    Monte Carlo simulation in which the state of each event is randomly determined
    to calculate the state of the top event, the reliability was derived 0.73. The
    improvement factor was defined to show the share of each basic event in the probability
    occurrence of the top event. The results showed that human factors have the greatest
    impact on failure of the system. In the subsequent order, there are climate factors,
    mechanical factors, and sewer system. Among the basic events, operator’s error,
    high load of influent, design problem, and equipment failure are the most effective
    factors in the top event occurrence. To improve the reliability of the plant,
    the human factor should be considered as the first priority so the measures such
    as training, sufficient supervisions, and development of personnel income, along
    with other actions such as increase the automation level, are the most influential
    factors. Since very few research studies are available in risk analysis of WWTPs
    based on FTA method, this survey has a significant contribution in improvement
    of insight into causal failure analysis of a conventional activated sludge process.
    The developed FTA model remarkably provides an effective tool in upgrading the
    reliability of a WWTP. References Agrafioti, E., & Diamadopoulos, E. (2012). A

  description: 'In view of the comprehensive governmental policies on the grounds
    of exploitation developments from the South Pars Gas Field, on one hand and the
    impacts of the plan implementation on the environment on the other hand, the performance
    of impact assessments and consequences arising from regional building operations,
    taking into consideration the coastal strip is the principle objective of this
    research. In addition to which, the survey of abiding to environmental criteria,
    the rendering of modes to decrement and prevent the adverse impacts of activities,
    the preparation of monitoring environmental programs and establishing compatibility
    between regional activities and the environment, is another aim of this research.
    The distinguished economic region of Pars Energy in southwestern Iran encompasses
    10,000 hectares of land, was established in the year 1998. The South Pars Gas
    Field consists of 6.8 percent of the total global gas reserves and more than 38
    percent of the entire gas reserves of the Country. It is one of the largest resources
    of the Country''s energy, located on the common frontier of Iran and Qatar and
    is accounted for being, one of the major energy resources, of the Country. The
    minimum elevation at sea level is zero at the coast and its maximum altitude is
    approximately 1,400 meters, in the northern heights of the region. The region
    is situated in the coastal drainage basin and the only regional surface water,
    is the Gavbandi River. Similarly, the general direction of groundwater flow is
    towards the sea and its surface level is high. The only active fault present in
    the region is the Gavbandi Fault, which is situated at a distance of less than
    5 kilometers, northeast of the Naieband National Park. In this phase of the research,
    with the aid of geological maps and types of rocks, in accordance with reference
    to the Special National Strategy Plan, seismic diagrams and land slides (drifts),
    in three appropriate zones of durability, semi-suitable and unsuitable have been
    prepared. In concern with the ground cover conditions, the regional plants are
    of the Polygonaceae, Leguminesae and the palmaceae families, including a few classifications
    of weeds and scrubs, small trees, ornamental and fruit bearing trees. Likewise,
    in the area of study, the bird community is of an acceptable diversity. The presence
    of several terrestrial and aquatic habitats has lead to a high diversity of birds
    in the region in having environmental potentials in the area. In the South Pars
    region, the Naieband National Marine Park and two creeks which are known as Basatin
    and Bidkhoon are vital environmental banks and suitable locations for spawning
    and the breeding of aqua life. The proximity with oil and gas installations in
    the Asalooyeh region can be precarious in two ways. One, in an indirect mode,
    due to development activities that take place in the area, such as, constructions
    and littoral structures etc., and in a direct form, due to the perpetual and probable
    leakage of oil, gas and their derivatives into the regional waters, is possible.
    According to the census in the year 1996, the township of Kangan had a population
    of 78,318 persons and with due attention to the economic structure and migration,
    the area is confronted with a rise in population on the whole. In order to assess
    and survey the consequences, arising from the South Pars constructional activities
    on the coastline, as well as the appraisal of the relative potentials and the
    vulnerability of the various sections, of the implementation location of the project,
    from a list to recognize occurrences and the matrix, so as to determine and gain
    an absolute reliability as to the results, two other methods have been utilized.
    In this study, with the help of determining the slope, soil conditions (from the
    viewpoint of depth), bed rock (from the viewpoint of durability), ground cover
    (from the point of view of density), sensitive ecosystems (creeks, the Naieband
    Gulf and Naieband National Park) and by taking into consideration the specifications
    and conditions of the limits, proportionate ecological, industrial and residential
    model surveys of constructions have been prepared in these three aspects and they
    have been utilized in zoning. After executing the zoning, so as to evaluate and
    specify the amount of damages caused, due to the various activities, the checklist
    method was resorted to. The utilization of this method took place in the two phases
    of construction and exploitation, in 6 of the major or principle regional activities
    such as, the refinery, petrochemicals, airport, port and docks, gas transition
    line and transportation. In the checklist used with respect to each of the activities,
    only the negative consequences as to the exploitation impacts of the environmental
    factors have been distinguished. These consequences, from the point of view of
    being a collection of impacts, retrievable and likewise, its impacts on the coastline
    were surveyed and then the results gained were totalized. In continuation, so
    as to analyze and appraise the regional environmental impacts and consequences
    and with due attention to the results of the list, (estimations of the initial
    impacts), for the recognition of the intensity and importance of the impacts,
    as well as totalizing the quantitative facets of the impacts and a final decision-making,
    the impacts predicted in the list method, is in the form of a matrix, in two macro
    and micro proportions, in which they have been categorized and totalized. With
    due attention to the results obtained from assessing the capacity, the ecological
    limits were divided into three zones, the first zone is of 200 hectares, the second
    zone is of 19,200 hectares and the unsuitable zone, is allocated to 26,300 hectares.
    In comparing the ecological capacity role of the area, with the special regional
    development role, illustrates that, approximately 56 percent of the development
    is in the semi-suitable zone, and 44 percent of the development shall be conducted
    in the unsuitable zone. With due attention to the fact that since that the development
    in the region under study, shall be executed in the unsuitable environmental bed,
    though, due to the vast importance and aptness of the region, in continuance with
    more accurate surveys of the limits under study with the aid of other methods
    in connection with the project implementation was taken into discussion. The results
    of the checklist show that from between the 6 main activities present in the South
    Pars Development Plan Region, the refinery and petrochemicals, followed by the
    gas transfer pipelines, has the highest percentage of adverse impacts on the environment.
    Similarly, the results of the implementation matrixes of the project in the region
    do not qualify. Due to the outstanding economic benefits of the South Pars region
    and the joint participation issue, as well as the exploitation of this resource
    by the southern neighbors of Iran, a termination of the plan activities is not
    feasible. Therefore, in the continuation of this research, modes to decrease the
    impacts and environmental monitoring under influence, with due attention to the
    regional conditions have been rendered. After surveying the impacts of the mentioned
    plan, on the various environmental components, as well as with emphasis on pollution
    and environmental destruction as an adverse impact of the project on the environment,
    the manner to decrement the negative impacts of the project in the region has
    been given in brief, as follows: Means to reduce the adverse impacts of the project
    on the physical environment: Conservation and restoration of the regional lands,
    reducing the impacts arising from the occurrence of inundation in the region,
    abiding to the 60 meter perimeter from the coast, for several constructional activities
    in the area, preparing the required equipments for the collection of coastal sand,
    polluted with oil products, the utilization of suitable chemical compounds for
    purging oil pollution in the region Manner to decrease the oil impacts on the
    biological environment: Utilizing recycled water and surface runoffs, utilizing
    brackish or fresh water resources, Use of irrigation systems prone to slighter
    consumption, prevention of industrial development in the direction of the Naieband
    National Park, prevention of the discharge of untreated urban, industrial and
    agricultural sewage and wastewaters into the sea, abiding to the standards and
    controlling the temperature of sewage released into the marine water (sea), controlling
    the leakage from oil pipes and installations, including the particular oil tankers
    utilized for the replacement of oil produce Method to reduce the adverse impacts
    on the socio-economic and cultural environment: Performing population scanning
    studies, executing special tutorial programs, so as to establish coordination
    between the indigenous populace, abiding in rendering priority to indigenous individuals,
    in relative to employing manpower Modes to decrement the environmental pollution
    impacts: Accurate designing of chimneys utilized for pollutants, utilization of
    filters to decrease pollution in the flares of industrial chimneys, Siting the
    approved or correct industrial development, with due attention to the direction
    of wind in the region, sanitary burial of wastes, controlling the infiltration
    of pollutants into the surface waters and the utilization of sensing equipment,
    in regards the leakage of pipes. The monitoring program taking into consideration
    the South Pars region comprises of: Survey of the quality of water resources by
    sampling and testing the specifications under view, topographical and landform
    monitoring, in order to control and regulate development procedures, measuring
    and monitoring sound level. Monitoring air pollution, sample taking of aqua life,
    taking statistical account of the amount and dispersion of terrestrial fauna and
    aqua life listed in environmental studies, survey.'

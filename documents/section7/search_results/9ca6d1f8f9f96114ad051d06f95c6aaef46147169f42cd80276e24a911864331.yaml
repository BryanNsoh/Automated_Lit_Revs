  description: This study proposes an IoT-based smart irrigation management system
    that can optimize water-resource utilization in a smart agricultural system. The
    system uses unsupervised learning-based clustering to predict the irrigation needs
    of a field based on the ground parameters sensed by automated monitoring devices.
    These parameters include soil moisture, light intensity, temperature, and humidity.
    The system extracts feature such as the maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation
    of four soil moisture sensors from the primary dataset of plants. Then, it applies
    lag features to enhance the accuracy of the classification model. The system uploads
    the dataset of 108 features to the Orange GUI and performs k-means clustering
    to assign cluster labels to the data as meta-attributes in a new dataset. The
    study evaluates the system using a month’s worth of data and demonstrates its
    functionality and effectiveness. The system employs machine learning techniques
    such as Random Forest, Neural Network, and kNN, which achieve 100%, 99.9%, and
    99.8% accuracy respectively.

    Review on Advances in IoT-Based Technologies for Smart Agricultural System Chapter
    © 2022 1 Introduction India’s population is continuously increasing and, after
    some years, food problem will be very serious. Therefore, agricultural development
    is very neccessary. Today, water scarcity and lack of rain is the main cause of
    worries of the farmers. The main objective is to have an automatic irrigation
    system that consume less time, money and power of the farmer. There are many convectional
    techniques. The old irrigation techniques need manual hardwork. But, with the
    help of an automatic crop monitoring and irrigation system, human efforts will
    be minimized [1]. Earlier, Indian farmers used techniques that are based on manual
    observations that resulted in either more watering or more use of pesticides that
    directly harm the productivity of crop and fertility of the lands [2]. Here, a
    system is proposed that would have smart monitoring and automatic irrigation control.
    The system is connected with the cloud with the help of sensing devices and the
    sensed data is then monitored via mobile application. Along with crop monitoring,
    an urgent need is there for a good irrigation system. The lack of rain and unpredictability
    in the environment generate an_urgent_need for proper utilization of water. Therefore,
    sensors are used to check the moisture in the soil and temperature of the surrounding
    in order to check the water level. According to the level, the motor is switched
    on or off. With the help of technology, it will increase the production and reduce
    the man power. It will create a system that is low in cost and efficient in finding
    the sensored data that will help the user to turn the motor on and off. One of
    the efficient irrigation method is the drip irrigation system where the water
    is allowed to drip slowly to the roots of the plants. Here, we are using a Smart
    Drip Irrigation and Monitoring System that basically works in two conditions,
    the first is under Irrigation and the second is over irrigation. It monitors the
    field. It can be operated in two modes: i. Power Supply Mode: Power Supply Mode
    comes into use when there is bad weather condition and the battery does not have
    the stored energy. ii. Solar Energy Mode: Solar Energy Mode uses solar panel for
    the working of the system. The energy consumed by the solar panel is stored in
    a rechargeable battery that could be further utilized. The working modes are available
    that can be switched according to the needs. “Solar Energy mode is applicable
    for conserving electricity by reducing the usage of grid power and conserves water
    by reducing water losses. It is the best utilization of solar power. But, if there
    is no solar energy available then power supply mode is turned on. This System
    not only presents an Automated Irrigation System but comforts the user with extraordinary
    features also. The user is provided with an user interface i.e. an android application
    that can be easily operated on mobile phones. It helps in providing data visualization,
    data understanding, and the predictive analysis. It also facilitates farmers to
    look forward to advanced data in the future. This system works using wi-fi module
    that transmits the data to the cloud and notifies the user regarding field condition.
    Due to this alert, the user can improve the condition of field by taking some
    improvement measures. 2 Related Works The related work explains the use of the

    Agriculture IoT first-rate agriculture products are designed to assist show crop
    fields victimization sensors and via automating irrigation systems. As a result,
    farmers and associated producers will, without a doubt, show the sphere conditions
    from everywhere with none hassle. Take a glance at the several uses of IoT in
    agriculture via technique that of varied IoT solutions: 3.1 Drones in Agriculture
    Drones are uncrewed ethereal vehicles (otherwise called UAVs), which are utilized
    for reconnaissance in different enterprises. Till now, they were principally utilized
    by organizations working in modern areas like mining and development, armed force,
    and specialists. Presently, drone innovation is progressively accessible for use
    in different areas of farming too. However the innovation is as yet early in India,
    many organizations are attempting so it is effectively accessible to Indian ranchers
    and fit to be utilized to increment proficiency in farming creation. A ton of
    robot based horticultural undertakings are going through in India. Think about
    the accompanying genuine situations: On 26th January 2022, the Government of India
    has likewise delivered a certificate plot for rural robots, which can now convey
    a payload that does exclude synthetic compounds or different fluids utilized in
    showering drones. Such fluids might be showered by adhering to material guidelines
    and guidelines. On 23rd January 2022, to advance the utilization of robots for
    rural purposes and diminish the work trouble on the ranchers, the public authority
    of India has as of late offered, a 100% endowment or 10 lakhs, whichever is less,
    up to March 2023 to the Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institutes, ICAR Institutes,
    Krishi Vigyan Kendras and State Agriculture Universities. Moreover, a possibility
    asset of Rs. 6000/ha will likewise be set in the mood for recruiting Drones from
    Custom Hiring Centers (CHC). The endowment and the possibility subsidizes will
    help the ranchers access and embrace this broad innovation at a reasonable cost.
    On sixteenth November 2020, the Indian government conceded the International Crops
    Research Institute (ICRISAT), for utilization of robots for farming examination
    exercises. With this move, the public authority desires to energize maturing scientists
    and business visionaries to check out at financial plan well disposed drone answers
    for more than 6.6 lakh Indian towns. However the use will be contingent, yet it
    is a progressive step. Golden Dubey, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation,
    stressed that robots are ready to assume a major part in horticulture, particularly
    in regions including accuracy farming, improvement in crop yield, and beetle control.
    3.1.1 Benefits of Using Drones in Agriculture The utilization of robot innovation
    in agribusiness is digging in for the long haul. As indicated by ongoing examination,
    the worldwide robot market inside farming would develop at 35.9% CAGR and reach
    $5.7 billion by 2025. The utilization of robot innovation in agribusiness is digging
    in for the long haul. This arising innovation can assist with decreasing time
    and increment the efficiencies of the ranchers. The utilization of robots in the
    agrarian area is simply expected to ascend as the business develops, thus it is
    great to know how to sensibly utilize this innovation. 3.1.2 Soil and Field Examination
    For effective field arranging, horticultural robots can be utilized for soil and
    field examination. They can be utilized to mount sensors to assess dampness content
    in the dirt, landscape conditions, soil conditions, soil disintegration, supplements
    content, and fruitfulness of the dirt. 3.1.3 Crop Observing Crop observation is
    the management of yield progress from the time seeds are planted to the ideal
    opportunity for gather. This incorporates giving manures with flawless timing,
    checking for bug assault, and observing the impact of weather patterns. Crop observation
    is the main way that a rancher can guarantee an ideal gather, particularly while
    managing occasional yields. Any mistakes at this stage can bring about crop disappointment.
    Crop reconnaissance helps in understanding and making arrangements for the following
    cultivating season. Robots can help in powerful yield observation by reviewing
    the field with infrared cameras and in light of their constant data, ranchers
    can go to dynamic lengths to work on the state of plants in the field. 3.1.4 Estate
    Robots can help in establishing trees and yields, which was finished by ranchers
    previously. This innovation won’t just save work yet in addition will help in
    saving fills. 3.1.5 Animals the Board Robots can be utilized to screen and oversee
    tremendous domesticated animals as their sensors have high-goal infrared cameras,
    which can identify a debilitated creature and quickly make moves in like manner.
    Thus, the effect of robots on accuracy dairy cultivating is soon to turn into
    another ordinary effect. 3.1.6 Crop Showering Agri-robots can be utilized to splash
    synthetics as they have repositories, which can be loaded up with composts and
    pesticides for showering on crops in almost no time, when contrasted with conventional
    techniques. Subsequently, drone innovation can introduce another period for accuracy
    horticulture. 3.1.7 Actually Take a Look at Crop Wellbeing Cultivating is a huge
    scope action that happens over sections of land. Consistent overviews are important
    to screen the strength of the dirt and the yield that has been planted. Physically,
    this might require days, and, surprisingly, then, there is space for human mistake.
    Robots can do similar work surprisingly fast. With infrared planning, robots can
    accumulate data about both the strength of the dirt and the harvest. 3.1.8 Stay
    Away from Abuse of Synthetic Substances Robots can end up being particularly powerful
    in decreasing the abuse of pesticides, insect poisons, and different synthetics.
    These synthetics without a doubt help to safeguard the yield. Be that as it may,
    their abuse can end up being negative. Robots can distinguish minute indications
    of bug assaults, and give exact information with respect to the degree and scope
    of the assault. This can assist ranchers with working out the necessary measure
    of synthetics to be utilized that would just safeguard the harvests as opposed
    to hurting them. 3.1.9 Plan for Climate Misfires Weather patterns can end up being
    a rancher’s dearest companion and most horrendously terrible foe. Since these
    can’t be precisely anticipated, it turns out to be very hard to get ready for
    any change in designs. Robots can be utilized to recognize impending atmospheric
    conditions. Storm drones are now being utilized to improve expectations. Also,
    this data can be utilized by ranchers to be more ready. Early notification of
    tempests or absence of downpour can be utilized to design the harvest to be established
    that would be most ideal to the season, and how to deal with established crops
    at a later stage. 3.1.10 Screen Development In any event, when everything is working
    out as expected, crops should be studied and observed to guarantee that the perfect
    proportion of yield will be accessible at the hour of collect. It is likewise
    significant for future preparation, whether it is tied in with deciding the right
    cost for the open market, or reaping repeating crops. Robots can give exact information
    about each phase of yield development, and report any varieties before they become
    an emergency. Multispectral pictures can likewise give exact data about inconspicuous
    contrasts among solid and undesirable harvests that might be missed by the unaided
    eye. For instance, focus on harvests will mirror less close infrared light when
    contrasted with solid yields. This distinction can''t be recognized by the natural
    eye generally. Yet, robots can give this data in the beginning phases. 3.1.11
    Geofencing The warm cameras introduced over robots can without much of a stretch
    distinguish creatures or people. In this way, robots can monitor the fields from
    outside harm brought about by creatures, particularly around evening time. For
    security purpose, the robots are worked via prepared drone pilots. 3.2 Remote
    Sensing in Agriculture Remote sensing in agriculture refers to the acquisition
    of data from agricultural material or product while not touching them. It becomes
    a really valuable tool in monitoring, evaluation and management of agricultural
    resources. The development has several applications that admire geology, surveying,
    forestry, photography and many additional ones. However, the sphere of agriculture
    has more uses for remote sensing than most sectors. The foremost common tool that
    you will use for remote sensing is craft or a satellite. Besides, the recent advancements
    in technology have led to the event of refined drones with high-end cameras and
    sensors. The drone will travel at a high speed whereas necessary information is
    obtained from the farms. Furthermore, drones can take shut the aerial footage
    that shows elaborate information on the plants. For instance, a drone can go terribly
    low to require an attempt while planes cannot. However, that doesn’t render those
    tools useless within the agricultural sector. For example, satellites and aircrafts
    can collect additional information over a good space which might be terribly helpful
    in Agriculture. A decent example is once finding out the patterns of weather.
    3.2.1 Applications of Remote Sensing in Agriculture There are few applications
    of remote sensing: i. Assessment of crop progress or harm Remote sensing technology
    is generally utilized in Agriculture to access progress or damage. It helps to
    asses, particularly within large farms. All data is saved in storage that researchers
    and farmers use to check the crops. ii. Crop identification has been created straightforward
    by the remote sensing technology. As an example crops beneath observation may
    show mysterious characteristics. Information is collected from such instances
    and sent to the laboratory for more studies. Within the lab, new aspects are studied
    to induce correct results. One example of such a side is finding out crop culture.
    iii. Crop yield estimation and modelling consultants and farmers can simply predict
    the number of yield which will be created by sure resources. Furthermore, they
    will predict the amount of your time to be taken when alternative resources to
    be used. Remote sensing data permits farmers to model and develop higher strategies
    which will probably improve the yield. iv. Pests and sicknesss infestation identification
    Remote sensing has contended a significant role once it involves the management
    of pests in agriculture. It helps with the identification of disease and pests
    thus returning up with the proper mechanisms. Information collected over time
    is compared to match diseases victimization the symptoms. v. Soil wet estimation
    measurement for detecting soil moisture couldn’t be easier than using remote sensing
    techniques. It works by exchanging data with the soil moisture thus determining
    the quantity. Information drawn from such activities is analyzed to see the proper
    crops to grow. vi. Crop production prognostication: Farmers can predict their
    production comeback over an calculable space in an exceedingly given season. regardless
    of what the season is, they will simply acquire data of their projected returns.
    Besides, consultants are ready to predict the standard that yields will turn out
    beneath any conditions. vii. Planting and harvesting date identification in the
    past harvesting, and date estimation was done by guesswork. However, with remote
    sensing, there''s enough data to predict the exact harvest data. Due to the prognosticative
    feature of this technology farmers can prepare on time. It is able to do that
    by finding out weather patterns and considering alternative factors admiring soil.
    viii. Soil mapping is incredibly necessary once it involves the assembly of high
    yields during this field. Higher soil mapping results in high-quality yields.
    Remote sensing provides important information that may be accustomed to match
    crops with the simplest soils. ix. Irrigation management-Since remote sensing
    provides details of the soil moisture, farmers manage irrigation with ease. With
    this information, one may also establish elements that haven’t received proper
    amounts of water. x. Drought monitoring involves measuring changes in temperature,
    precipitation, and surface and groundwater supplies, among other factors. Draught
    patterns aren’t excluded and thus the information is analyzed and transmitted
    to farmers for awareness. Rain patterns are monitored in such a simple way that
    you just can tell the distinction between two rainfalls. xi. Crop condition assessment
    of the health of every crop is simple to hold out victimization remote sensing.
    If any crop is stressed, remote sensors collect information and send it to the
    personnel in charge. Consultants use this data to see the standard of the crops.
    xii. Crop area estimating the farmland on that crops are planted manually may
    be a terribly arduous task. However, with remote sensing techniques, one can simply
    puzzle out such details at intervals in a brief time. xiii. Land mapping may be
    utilized in many various ways in Agriculture. Remote sensing collects information
    that helps to map lands for agricultural functions. For instance, it can be for
    landscaping or crop growth. As a result if different soils are helpful for various
    purposes then the land mapping is incredibly necessary. xiv. Preciseness farming:
    Remote sensing has helped with the development of precision farming over the years.
    Preciseness farming is very important because it produces healthy crops. Furthermore,
    the crops grow at intervals in the given period thus optimum harvests are realized.
    xv. Temperature change: Watching temperature change can have an effect on agriculture
    in each a positive or negative way. However, farmers can capitalize victimization
    remote sensing techniques. They track climatical changes and use them to their
    advantage. For instance, they plant crops that may perform well betting on the
    climate. Furthermore, they will devise ways to build some drought resistant crops.
    Consultants observe the climate to determine crops which will perform higher within
    the affected areas. 3.3 Computer Imaging in Agriculture Computer imaging entails
    the employment of detector cameras installed at exclusive corners of the farm
    or drones prepared with cameras to offer photographs that bear virtual photo manner.
    Digital photo processing is the primary theory of processing Associate in Nursing
    enter photo victimization compter algorithms. Farming can be one in all of the
    oldest trades in the world, despite the fact that growing technology are turning
    agriculture right into an exact science. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
    andComputer Vision programs are presently used to choose under discipline situations,
    soil moisture, set up crop disease, are expecting climate and crop yields. Computer
    Vision in agriculture helps farmers to shape better understanding of selections
    and accumulate big quantities of data that wasn’t accessible even multiple years
    ago. Satellite imaging additionally as UAV pictures assist to examine considerable
    tracts of landand enhance farming practices. Let’s take a look abut the maximum
    current technology make farming extra productive, good value and less hard work
    in depth. Growing Crop Yields by making use of AI andComputer Vision fashions
    farmers can display crop boom in close to-actual time. 4 Proposed Automated System

    The sensors are collecting the data from the environment which is processed by
    a micro controller. The processed data is then put on cloud through wifi. Now,
    this data can be accessed from anywhere via android app. There is a relay that
    works as the switch for operating the motor. With the help of the relay, turning
    on and off of the motor takes place. Hardware Used: (a) Sensor: The first hardware
    that comes into use is the Sensor. Sensor is the key part of the project. It senses
    the data. The sensed data is then put on cloud so that it could be accessed via
    any device from anywhere. Device could be a mobile phone, laptop or any machine
    with internet.Sensor can also be grouped inorder to monitor a device thoroughly.
    A soil moisture sensor (shown in Fig. 2) is a device used to measure the amount
    of water present in soil. The sensor works by measuring the electrical resistance
    between two or more electrodes that are inserted into the soil. The resistance
    of the soil is directly related to the moisture content, so by measuring the resistance,
    the sensor can determine the moisture level of the soil. Soil moisture sensors
    are commonly used in agriculture and horticulture to ensure that plants receive
    the proper amount of water. By monitoring soil moisture levels, farmers and gardeners
    can avoid overwatering or underwatering their plants, which can lead to poor growth,
    disease, and other problems. There are various types of soil moisture sensors
    available, including capacitance-based sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    sensors, and gypsum block sensors. Each type of sensor has its own advantages
    and disadvantages, depending on factors such as the soil type, the application,
    and the desired level of accuracy. Fig. 2 Soil moisture sensor Full size image
    (b) Micro Controller Chip: A micro controller is a small computer on a single
    IC. It contains one or two CPUs along with memory and programmable i/p o/p peripherals.
    A microcontroller chip, also known as a microcontroller unit (MCU), is a small
    computer on a single integrated circuit (IC) that contains a processor core, memory,
    and input/output (I/O) peripherals. Microcontrollers are commonly used in embedded
    systems to control devices or processes. Microcontroller chips are designed for
    low-power and low-cost applications, making them suitable for a wide range of
    applications, including automotive, medical, industrial, consumer electronics,
    and more. They typically have a limited amount of memory and processing power
    compared to general-purpose computers, but they are optimized for real-time processing
    and control tasks. There are many different microcontroller architectures available,
    with the most popular being based on the 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit instruction
    sets. Some common microcontroller manufacturers include Atmel, Microchip, Texas
    Instruments, and STMicroelectronics. Arduino Uno (shown in Fig. 3) is an open-source
    microcontroller board based on the Atmel AVR microcontroller. It is a popular
    platform for creating electronic projects and prototypes due to its ease of use
    and wide availability of sensors, actuators, and other components. The board has
    digital input/output pins, analog inputs, and can be programmed using the Arduino
    software. It is often used in a variety of applications such as robotics, home
    automation, and Internet of Things (IoT) projects. Fig. 3 Arduino uno Full size
    image (c) Relay: A relay (shown in Fig. 4) is a switch that is electromagnetically
    operated. A switch is meant for telling the actual stage of the device. It shows
    whether the device is in on mode or off mode. Fig. 4 Relay Full size image (d)
    Actuators: Actuators (shown in Fig. 5) is a component of a machine that is responsible
    for moving and controlling a mechanism. Fig. 5 Actuator Full size image 5 Work
    Flow of System Model The Proposed workflow (shown in Fig. 6) is divided into two
    parts: Fig. 6 Proposed workflow methodology of system model Full size image Field
    quality analysis Irrigation System 5.1 Field Quality Analysis In Fig. 7, we have
    discussed the field quality analysis. In this, the System starts and the crop
    is selected. For selecting the crop, the data is compared. The actual data is
    compared from the ideal data that is stored in the database. If ideal value is
    equal to the actual value then success alert is received, otherwise Quality mismatch
    alert is generated and the system is stopped. Fig. 7 Proposed flow chart for field
    quality analysis Full size image 5.2 Irrigation System In the second part, irrigation
    of the field (shown in Fig. 8) is done. The system starts and the sensor value
    is fetched from the database. Then this value is compared, and if irrigation is
    required then motor will be on. Otherwise, it will be checked if motor is on or
    off. If on, the switch off the motor and if already off then delay will be generated
    so as to recheck the motor. Fig. 8 Proposed flow chart for irrigation system Full
    size image 5.3 System Design The system model (shown in Fig. 9) is framed in such
    a way that the energy consumed by the solar panel is stored in the battery and
    this rechargeable battery is capable of being used with solar energy and extra
    battery power. The Arduino uno is operated via a rechargeable battery and the
    data that is sensed by sensor is stored in the database and is put on cloud and
    accessed by the user via mobile application. Fig. 9 System design of proposed
    sysem model Full size image This is the system design that comprises of the following
    parts: Battery It is a device that has two electrochemical cells that give power
    to other devices. Here, it is a rechargeable battery that can be used for charging
    other devices and can also store the power. Solar Panel It is a device that takes
    sunlight as an input and generates electricity. A 6V solarpanel is used to charge
    a 3.4 V battery. This takes light energy to convert into electrical energy. NodeMCU
    1.0 NodeMCU 1.0 is the open source platform that is used as software and hardware
    for the easy use. Here, it is used as the software for reading inputs through
    sensors and serve it as output such as turning on the led, activating a motor
    etc. Sensors The first hardware that comes into use is the Sensor. The Sensor
    is the key part of the project. It senses the data. The sensed data is then put
    on cloud so that it could be accessed via any device from anywhere. Device could
    be a mobile phone, laptop or any machine with internet.Sensor can also be grouped
    inorder to monitor a device thoroughly. 5.4 Irrigation System This is the second
    section of the system where water level of the field is determined using the soil
    moisture sensor. Irrigation is done according to the amount of water required
    by the crop fields. And depending on that, the motor is turned off or on. The
    data is collected via the sensor that tells the actual value of moisture present
    in the soil which in turn operates the motor. Due to automatic Irrigation System,unnecessary
    use of water does not take place.It helps in providing the required amount of
    water to the fields at the correct time. 6 Hardware Setup for Proposed System
    Model Hardware setup (shown in Fig. 10) involves NodeMcu, DH11 Sensor, Soil moisture
    Sensor, relay and water motor. The sensors are connected to the board and relay
    lower terminal is connected to the board and No and COM are connected to motor
    wire. There are two samples: (i) Dry soil (ii) Wet soil. The board is powered
    by USB cable and motor is charged through electricity. Two soil samples are taken
    to measure the soil moisture through soil moisture sensor. Fig. 10 Hardware setup
    for proposed system model Full size image 7 Android Mobile Application for Monitoring
    the Work Flow The sensored data is shown in the mobile application (shown in Fig.
    11). All the values regarding field can easily be monitored via application. User
    can easily monitor the motor on/off via app only. If the value shown is 1 then
    the motor is on. And if the value shown is 0 then the motor is off. Fig. 11 Home
    screen of mobile application Full size image This Home page involves the Information
    about Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity and Irrigation System. The major adavantages
    of this anroid mobile application are: The sensed data will be depicted. This
    data is refreshed after every 10 s. It will help the user to have real time information.
    8 Getting Alerts for Motor On/Off via Mobile Application User could get the alerts
    about the functioning of motor via android application. This feature of app can
    help in reducing the wastage of water. Motor off: This is the condition where
    the column of irrigation system is occupied by value ‘0’. It shows that the motor
    is off, which will help the user to have real time information aboutthe water
    supply. Motor on: This is the condition where the column of irrigation system
    is occupied by value ‘1’. It shows that the motor is on, which will help the user
    to have real time information about the water supply. Crop Data: Crop Data (shown
    in Fig. 12) consists of data of crops that is taken as sample input in the system.
    User can grow through this data for the sake of knowledge. Fig. 12 Crop data Full
    size image Proposed Algorithms Used for Data Analysis Algorithm for Sensing Soil
    Moisture Step 1: Start Step 2: Initialise variable soil_moisture, output_value.
    Step 3: Set soil_sensor pin to output. Step 4: Set baud rate to 9600. Step 5:
    Provide delay of 2000 ms. Step 6: Read the output values. Step 7: Print the Moisture
    value. Step 8: Provide delay of 1000 ms. Step 9: Go to step 6. Step 10: End Algorithm
    for Sensing Temperature and Humidity Step1: Start Step 2: Initialize variable
    dht, humidity, temperature. Step 3:Set baud rate to 9600. Step 4: Set Output pin
    to D5. Step 5: Set Low to D5. Step 6: Provide delay of 2000 ms. Step 7: Read the
    humidity and temperature value. Step 8: Print the humidity and temperature value.
    Step 9: Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit. Step 10: Provide delay of 1000
    ms. Step 11: Go to step 7. Step 12: End. 9 Conclusion The main focus is to study
    theField Monitoring and Automation in Agricuture using IoTto aid the user in having
    a good idea of the crop field and have good control over the irrigation system.
    This system is responsible for monitoring the fields parameter such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidty, etc. which lets the user go through a good quality check
    of crop fields. It also involves controlling of irrigation. Earlier, systems were
    developed that either worked as the Automatic Irrigation System or Field Monitoring
    System. They were operated using battery. They were not affordable and stopped
    working in case of power cut. Solar Energy Monitoring Systems were also developed
    that analysed the renewable energy usage. It only monitored the solar energy usage
    and provided the analysis for further expension. But,“Field Monitoring And Automatic
    Irrigation system using IoT” serves as both Automatic Irrigation System and Field
    Monitoring System where it is operated in the power supply mode and solar power
    mode. Using solar energy makes the system afforadable. And, it solves the problem
    of regular power cut that usually happens in villages. It helps in monitoring
    the crop field paramaters which determine the quality of the field. After knowing
    the parameter values, the user can put efforts in lacking quality of the field
    so as to make the crop field appropriate for growth. Monitoring of fields is done
    on a regular basis. Along with monitoring, there is an automatic irrigation system
    that helps in providing appropriate amount of water to the fields. Automatic on/off
    of motor is taking place according to the field conditions. When there is enough
    water in the fields then motor will be in switched off state otherwise it will
    be on. The automatic irrigation of fields helps in reducing unneccassary use of
    water and it supports the farmers in good irrigation of crop fields. Field Monitoring
    and Automatic Irrigation system using IoT is easily accessible via mobile application.
    It could be easily used by the user. It depicts all the data that is sensed by
    the sensor. The major advantage of developing a mobile app is that the user can
    access the field information and data from anywhere, just via a mobile application
    downloaded on his phone. The Mobile app comprises of the crop data that will aid
    the user in getting knowledge about the crops. This information helps in having
    more cultivative and productive fields. SMS alerts are sent to the user incase
    crop field quality is mismatched. Notification alerts let the user get real time
    information about the crop fields. References Vineela, T., NagaHarini, J., Kiranmai,

  description: Over the past decade, there has been sustained research in the Internet
    of Things (IoT), significantly contributing to health, retail, transport, logistics,
    security, and agriculture. Device-enabling platforms have an incredibly strategic
    advantage of enabling related IoT growth. This technology is largely handled through
    cloud computing, where the raw generated data from IoT sensors are stored and
    computed for decision making, irrespective of the application areas. The adoption
    of IoT in agriculture faces numerous challenges such as latency, energy, bandwidth,
    and storage cost. These issues will affect sustainable agricultural activities
    such as live decision making, prediction, monitoring, and controlling of farming
    activities. These issues can be addressed by integrating edge computing technology
    with IoT-enabled monitoring devices. The edge computing framework needs to be
    designed for the rapid identification of methods for deployment in the field.
    The edge computing agricultural framework will act as middleware between the cloud
    and IoT sensors; it would serve as a medium to fulfill the demands of a real-time
    monitoring system. In the proposed framework, an edge server is designed to predict
    the rainfall locally using the microcomputer Raspberry Pi through the analysis
    of the local environmental and weather parameters. The system is constructed with
    two edge nodes, where one handles the monitoring of the live data such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, humidity, and wind. The other node
    takes care of artificial irrigation according to the local and global weather
    data controlled by the edge server. The edge server stores live data locally and
    sends the average daily analysis data to the ThingSpeak server. Data stored in
    the edge and cloud can be used in the future to increase plant growth, leading
    to increased yield. The proposed framework helps in accurate watering considering
    the local environmental conditions, leading to the sequential evolution of plants
    until the vegetables are fully grown and available for harvest. In this way, an
    edge-based framework for an agricultural system can be used to fill the gaps in
    precision agriculture.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bangladesh SECTION I. Introduction The Rainfall
    and Climate change have been erratic over the past few decades. Where 80% of water
    is used in agriculture for irrigation purposes[1], this percentage can rise due
    to increased population growth and demand for food. And one of the world''s biggest
    challenges is water shortage[2]. The hour''s need is to make efficient utilization
    of available human resources, water, and fertilizers, which can lead to cost optimization
    of the annual crop production. That''s why the efficient use of water is essential.
    These days, in the field of agriculture, farmers are facing various problems,
    for example, soil fruitfulness and in watering their plants. Because they don''t
    have an appropriate plan to make an agribusiness advancement, particularly for
    the availability of power. Regardless of whether it is accessible, they need a
    huge time to water by hand or to pump water and hold up until the field is watered
    effectively, which forces them to quit doing forth different attempts which are
    essential for them as well. Accordingly, they lose valuable time and other activities.
    That''s why automatic irrigation is very important for efficient farming and best
    production. Knowing the specific supplement found in the farm soil and the pH
    is the initial step of any healthy crop production program, and that is the reason
    soil testing is significant for Agriculture. By testing soil, the farmers can
    know about the land and can take necessary steps to improve the production. Knowing
    the specific deficiency that the land is experiencing will result in zero wastage
    of such farm inputs. Soil testing results in limited over fertilisation. Farmworkers
    can effectively prevent land depletion, and they can lead to feeding the world''s
    increasing population by fertile soils. This paper plans to structure and execute
    such an inventive innovation for farming application. Irrigation happens here
    only where soil testing needs water and the soil content can be analyzed and calculated
    by Mobile App and the App will recommend necessary nutrient by data analysis of
    Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. Already many creative applications are available.
    But most of the case used Arduino Uno or Mega as master device or microcontroller
    unit (MCU) and used Liquid Crystal Display as monitoring device, that is costly.
    To make the device more cost-effective, we used here ATtiny MCU as a master device,
    which is comparatively lower cost then Arduino. As monitoring device, we used
    an Android Application, which will make the device more cost-effective. SECTION
    II. Literature Review The automated irrigation control system was built to promote
    the automated supply of sufficient water in all agricultural seasons from a reservoir
    to field or domestic crops. The approach used is to measure the level of soil
    moisture continuously to determine whether irrigation is necessary and how much
    water is needed in the soil. [3] Automatic plant watering system is known as one
    of the automatic systems most widely used. The unit uses microcontroller and other
    components as well as sensor technologies. It detects the level of soil moisture,
    and if necessary, irrigates the vine. The aim of this research is to demonstrate
    how anyone can easily render automatic plant watering device of their own and
    inexpensive. [4] [9] This paper describes a low-cost Automatic Irrigation System
    based on Arduino using a Soil Moisture Sensor. Depending on the conditions of
    the soil, the soil moisture sensor gives its production. This machine involves
    an Arduino-UNO that contains an ADC converter inside it.[5] [8] The Indian economy
    is predominantly farm-based. To obtain high yield from soil, some important soil
    parameters such as ph, moisture, humidity and temperature are measured. The method
    is based on soil sampling of chemical processes.[6] Proposed irrigation device
    with pic (16F887) microcontroller to senses soil moisture content. Once soil moisture
    level exceeds a given threshold level, it was automatically programmed for on
    and off the motor[7]. Many farmers can''t afford to test soil moisture by means
    of high-cost instruments. In this paper, they proposed a method for developing
    soil moisture sensor to estimate the amount of moisture in soil. This sensor is
    checked with many soil samples and is capable of satisfying significant accuracy
    [9]. This paper primarily applies water-saving irrigation automated form and composition
    control method to the city landscape. This also offers information on the structure
    and role of the water-saving irrigation display and controller[10]. The design
    proposed is an automated system which helps the farmers in the irrigation cycle.
    It keeps notifying the farmer that an on-board LCD and messages that are sent
    on the cellular number of the farmer. The plant is conveniently accessible by
    the country''s farmers.[11] An optical transducer is developed for the calculation
    and detection of soil concentration of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) , and Potassium
    (K). For improve soil fertility, it is important to determine how many extra contents
    of these nutrients need to be added to the soil. [12] SECTION III. System Model
    Fig. 1. System architecture of the system Show All The total system is divided
    into two portions. First one is the hardware portion, and the second one is the
    software portion. The Bluetooth network will do the interconnection between the
    hardware and the software portion. ATtiny84 Microcontroller will be used here
    as the master device for Hardware portion. The Soil Hygrometer is used for the
    quantification of soil moisture content. The consistency of the soil is often
    checked by sensors pH/ NPK and so on. Thus, using the color sensor, which ends
    up being an economically efficient, reliable and more unaffected technique, is
    accomplished in the proposed work. The sensors provide the ATtiny with voltage
    input which is based on the measured value. Then ATtiny analyzes the NPK and humidity
    data inputs and takes the Water pump decision turning on or off and will control
    the flow of water depending on the current soil moisture content. At the same
    time, the input data will be sent to the Bluetooth connected mobile application.
    The application will analyze the data and can display the Soil Moisture rate,
    NPK rate and the motor state and the app will suggest the fertilizer based on
    the present situation of land if it needs. Fig. 2. Flow chart of the proposed
    system Show All SECTION IV. Design Methodology The system design is divided into
    two sections: the Hardware section and the Software section. A. Hardware Section
    1) FC-28 Soil Hygrometer (Moisture) Sensor Soil moisture is very significant for
    irrigation and garden plants. A simple breakout for estimating soil moisture is
    the FC28 Soil Moisture Sensor. The sensor for soil moisture is relatively easy
    to use. Sensor for soil moisture has two conductive plates that serve as a detector
    and together reflect a variable resistor. The more water the soil contains, the
    stronger would be the conductivity between both the probs, resulting in lower
    resistance, as well as a higher Signal performance. This module likewise incorporates
    a potentiometer that will fix the threshold value, and the comparator-LM393 can
    evaluate the value. A soil moisture sensor is shown in Fig. 3.[13] Fig. 3. Soil
    moisture sensor Show All 2) NPK Sensor The primary source of nutrients needs for
    plants growth is Soil. The three primary nutrients required for plant growth are
    nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), as well as the three known as
    NPK. Many fertilizers used in agriculture are dependent on the soil''s NPK content.
    Which is why it''s really important to learn about NPK material in the Soil. The
    main objective of this paper is an efficient, cost-effective system. So that,
    Colourimetric methods is used to detect the NPK contents. As the sensor element,
    Color sensor TCS230 is used. This sensor senses the color of the solution for
    sample soil. ATtiny Microcontroller conducts sensor calibration with respect to
    NPK material. Colourimetry is used to calculate the compounds that reside in the
    soil, such as nitrogen(N), phosphorus(P) and potas-sium(K) can be used to determine
    how much nutrient the soil needs. The Colorimetric determination of phosphorus
    has been checked to track the processes of transfer from the soil to other water
    sources. Studies also use Colorimetry in the measurement of ammonium nitrogen
    in the soils and plants. In the measurement of potassium chloride, Colorimetry
    is used and commonly used in soils as an organic nitrogen extractant. A TCS230
    color sensor is shown in Fig. 4.[14] Fig. 4. Color sensor tcs230 Show All Soil
    pH is determined by the soil sample color. The equivalent pH to NPK content was
    done using standards Color Chart from BDH Soil Indicator as shown in the Fig.
    5.[15] Fig. 5. Color chart BDH soil indicator Show All The color ranges of the
    soil solution are classified using an Arduino code which runs on the output of
    the color sensor. So the color range of the soil solution is defined by the color
    sensor, which determines the soil pH. The relative NPK material of the soil is
    estimated by pH to the table of conversion of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
    where the value is given as medium, moderate and minor. Further filtering was
    performed to improve the accuracy of very low, medium, moderate and very small
    volumes between the midranges. Conversion chart with pH to NPK is shown in Fig.
    6.[16] Fig. 6. Conversion chart with ph to npk Show All 3) Attiny The ATtiny84
    is a microcontroller with an Arduino-like dash but with much less I / O pins,
    a compact form factor and a compact memory. Attiny Microcontroller uses Arduino
    software to write and burn the code. We used the Arduino UNO and Arduino IDE to
    burn the code into Attiny84. Attiny84 was used as Master Operator here. 4) Relay
    Relais are switches that electromechanically or electronically open and shut the
    circuits. Relay is used for operating water pumps here. 5) HC-05 Bluetooth Module
    This is a Bluetooth module used for remote communications. The HC-05 module may
    be of full-duplex or two-way remote use. Can be used with this HC-05 in a master-slave
    arrangement. Bluetooth serial modules require all serial compatible devices if
    they connect with each other. HC-05 is used as a master-slave contact medium for
    many devices. Fig. 7. Hardware schematic diagram of the proposed system Show All
    B. Software Section The data from the hardware portion is sent to the Android
    Application or software portion by the Bluetooth network. Then the App will analyze
    the data and will display some features. The features are Soil Moisture Rate,
    Soil NPK Rate, Soil pH, Fertilizer needs, Water Pump States. The App is implemented
    by using MIT App Inventor and its a simple and shallow size Android App. SECTION
    V. Results and Analysis A. Soil Moisture Detection The volumetric percentage of
    soil sample water content is measured, And raw sensor data collected are reported
    and displayed in TABLE I. The soil weight is equivalent to 400 g, and the soil
    weights 10 ml of water. SoilMoisture(%)=((W1−W2)/W1)∗100 (1) View Source W1= Weight
    of sample soil after water is applied W2= Weight of sample soil before water is
    applied Fig. 8. Moisture sensor output graph Show All Table I Soil moisture sensor
    calibration The function of the sensor corresponds to its data table. Operations
    range between 10–80 percent moisture content where the graph is nearly linear.
    It is linearized piece by piece, and translated into functional code using map
    function. If the device is shut down and thus the automatic irrigation works well
    to the percent volumetric moisture content can be seen on the Smartphone Application
    and the water pump is started to turn on since the level of water is well below
    35 percent, because most crops require a minimum water content of 30–40 percent
    and the volumetric moisture contents data had been in pa. B. NPK Detection The
    color sensor panel reflects the colors contained in the RGB Setup that has values
    from 0 to 255. For a specified amount of pHs TABLE 11 shows the RGB range. The
    respective NPK content is derived from the pH collection as shown in TABLE II.
    The research is conducted with a sample collected from the soil. The sample is
    thoroughly mixed in a small transparent box with 200 ml of water, and allowed
    to settle. Instead the water is diluted to remove the dissolved hard particulate
    soil at the bottom. The soil solution box is installed with ATtiny, Bluetooth
    Module, Soil Hygrometer, in front of the integrated TCS230 color sensor. The first
    test of identity with the NPK is achieved by turning the switch ON. The concentration
    of minerals in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium is shown on the Mobile
    Phone App when the solution color is detected. The amount of NPK for the soil
    sample obtained and the App will analyze the collected data and will recommend
    fertilizer if it will need and the App will show the motor state as it is ON/OFF.

    All SECTION VI. Future Scope and Conclusion Next to the control panel is the NPK
    sensor successfully designed and installed. It helps to minimize the time of human
    observation and the processing of the soil by the laboratory. This process utilizes
    a color sensor to detect color of the soil solution with which to determine the
    pH and NPK details. The conductivity-type, Moisture detector is used for irrigation
    optimization. For monitoring the water pump, calculated volumetric percentage
    of the water content has been used to determine when to be off and rely on plant
    form and water demand. Small farms are easy to mount and need very little money.
    Considering the educational and financial past of the average Bengali farmer,
    NPK model user interface and percent volumetric water quality were made. Not only
    does it save time, but also chooses to use the type of fertilizer which is often
    helpful for small farmers as, at low initial cost, the system is automatic. We
    need more tests before we demonstrate efficiency, durability and reliability.
    Through making few small changes and improvements, this paper model template can
    be made modular, customizable and user friendly; It is possible because the MCU
    here used another one analog input and a digital pin still unused. Authors Figures

    IEEE Conference Location: New Delhi, India SECTION I. Introduction Soil moisture
    is one of the most fundamental considerations in agriculture because plants rely
    on water available in the soil. Soil moisture indicates the water content in the
    soil, which makes it a critical parameter for decision making in smart irrigation
    systems that leverage sensor data [1]. For measuring soil moisture, time domain
    reflectometry (TDR) [2] is currently considered as one of the most accurate continuous
    monitoring methods. However, the cost of the measurement equipment is $3000 or
    more. Since a high sampling rate is required to obtain detailed characteristics
    of the reflected signal, it is difficult to reduce cost. Alternatively, capacitive
    soil moisture sensors are relatively inexpensive compared to TDR [3], and they
    can be used for soil moisture sensing by correlating the volumetric water content
    (VWC) of the soil and the capacitance of sensor electrodes covered by the soil.
    For instance, the METER Group (previously known as Decagon Devices) commercialized
    capacitive soil moisture sensors that are reasonably accurate and widely used
    in research areas [4]. However, they are still too expensive for farmers to deploy
    on a large scale. Although a prototype of the capacitive-touch-IC-based soil moisture
    sensor has been established [5], it has several issues with regard to size, practical
    operability, and extensibility’ i.e., it has fixed measurement depths and the
    probe cannot be easily exchanged when damaged. In this study, a cost-efficient
    soil monitoring device and network with a small package and detachable sensor
    probe was developed (Fig. 1). This device collects soil moisture data at multiple
    depths and uploads these data to a cloud using a wireless sensor network. By leveraging
    common IC and printed electronics, the cost of the proposed device is reduced
    to 1,000USdollars,whileover 3.000 US dollars will be required with market-available
    sensors and loggers for the same functionality. Fig. 1. Detachable sensor probe
    design incorporates extensibility and quick repairs when the electrodes are damaged.
    Show All SECTION II. Soil Moisture Sensor Design A. Capacitive Sensing Using Constant
    DC Current Source One key idea to fabricate a low-cost soil moisture sensor is
    leveraging the capacitive sensing module for touch sensors in soil moisture sensing.
    Previously, soil moisture was measured at a high frequency, i.e., 70 MHz, for
    high accuracy [6]; this measurement required a high-frequency capacitance measurement
    circuit, which is expensive. On the other hand, capacitive sensing techniques
    are commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and other touch-enabled devices. Owing
    to the rapid growth of the touch interface, the capacitive touch ICs have become
    commodities and relatively inexpensive components. Even if the measurement frequency
    of the capacitive touch IC (50 kHz-3 MHz) is not as high as the desired frequency
    for soil moisture sensing, it is applicable to practical measurements. Thus, capacitive
    touch ICs can be used for affordable soil moisture sensing with reasonable accuracy.
    The sensor measures capacitance with a constant DC current. In this approach,
    the charge time measurement unit (CTMU, Microchip PIC24) works as a constant DC
    current source. It supplies current ( I C ) for a short time (T) to sensor electrodes
    that work as capacitors, and the microcontroller (MCU) measures the corresponding
    voltage ( V T ) . The capacitance of the sensor electrodes C T can then be calculated
    by C T = I C T V T (1) View Source Fig. 2. Sensor electrodes design for 10 and
    20 cm depths. Show All B. Thin Film Sensor Probe A low-cost soil moisture sensor
    was fabricated by printed electronics. Traditional fabrication tools for printed
    circuit boards (PCB) are usually small, and it is costly to produce a large PCB.
    As the proposed sensor is intended to measure depths from 10–20 cm with a single
    probe, the probe length is around 40 cm, including the margin and the above-ground
    part. This is not the desired length for most PCB fabrication processes, and thus,
    it would not be suitable for mass production. Further, printed electronics enable
    roll-to-roll fabrication, which is cost efficient in fabricating large electrical
    circuits on flexible substrates. With this, the sensor electrodes for the soil
    moisture sensor is designed to exploit the potential of printed electronics. As
    shown in Fig. 1, the sensor probe is designed to be easily exchangeable. Since
    the electrodes can be possibly damaged by stone or other soil components, the
    sensor electrodes should be easily exchangeable. During the experimental deployments,
    some of the sensor probes were damaged. However, they could be used again with
    the proposed design. Moreover, when users want to change measurement depths, it
    is easy to exchange the sensor probe with another one. C. Design of Sensor Electrodes
    Capacitance-based soil moisture sensing is employed, and therefore, sensor electrodes
    should be sufficiently large because smaller values of capacitance (e.g., around
    picofarads) are difficult to measure precisely. As far as the measurement frequency
    is not high (<100 MHz) , the size of the electrodes decides the maximum capacitance
    that occurs under a fully wet condition, i.e., in water. On the other hand, the
    electrode pattern affects the minimum capacitance that occurs under a fully dried
    condition, i.e., in the air. Detailed patterns, such as in interdigital capacitors,
    contribute mostly to the minimum capacitance; however, for the maximum capacitance,
    the value does not deviate largely from a capacitor with two plates [7]. Hence,
    regardless of the electrode pattern, electrode size is more important in designing
    sensor electrodes. As shown in Fig. 2, the electrode height and width of the sensor
    probe is 25 mm and 35 mm, respectively. The probe was made by attaching the fabricated
    film with resist coating (50μm PET substrate and 12μm copper) to the 5 mm PET
    board and cutting the outlines. Fig. 3. Calibration results and polynomial approximate
    curves. Show All SECTION III. Sensor Calibration For calibration, the sensor probe
    was inserted into a package filled by a soil sample, which is Andisol from a greenhouse
    in Mashiki, Kumamoto, Japan. The package and sensor were then weighed, and the
    soil weight was continuously monitored every 10 min. Soil moisture measurement
    using the developed sensor was also carried out every 10 min. The setup was placed
    in a dry chamber and the temperature was maintained at 50 °C. Then, water was
    added to the soil until the soil was saturated. After five days, the soil moisture
    level was constant, and it was considered a dried condition ( (VWC=0%) . Using
    the obtained weights of the dry soil and the sensor, the amount of water in the
    soil can be calculated from the current weight since the most of weight change
    is caused by the evaporation of water. As the soil volume was fixed by the package
    size, the VWC can be calculated from the amount of water in the soil sample. Fig.
    3 shows a calibration result. The sensor cannot respond to low VWC (<8%) because
    the capacitance of electrodes remains constant at 60.3 pF under the moisture level.
    Note that the capacitance is the same as when the probe is left in the air. On
    the other hand, the soil sample was saturated at around 60%, and the sensor value
    was mostly identical to when the sensor electrode is in water. Thus, the measurable
    range of soil moisture in VWC is around 8-60%. Fig. 3 shows the estimated equations,
    where y is the VWC (m3m−3), and x (pF) is the measured capacitance. The 95% confidence
    intervals for each derived equation were 2.91% and 2.55 % for 10 cm and 20 cm
    depth, respectively. Moreover, the sensor was tested with soil samples collected
    in an experimental farm field in Hyderabad, India, where experimental deployments
    have been running. The soil in Hyderabad shrinks in volume when dried up; thus,
    the calibration process mentioned above is not applicable as it would cause an
    air gap between the sensor electrodes and the soil during the drying process.
    Then, the sensor would no longer correctly respond to soil moisture changes. Instead
    of the drying process, three (3) soil samples with different VWCs (13.6%, 24.0%,
    and 39.1%) were prepared, and the capacitance was measured for each soil sample.
    The result is not significantly different from the test result with the sample
    collected in Kumamoto, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, applying the calibration
    curve created from the calibration experiment is acceptable. Fig. 4. Sensor deployment
    setups in the experimental field at prof. Jayashankar telangana state agricultural
    university, hyderabad, india Show All SECTION IV. Experimental Deployments A.
    Experiment Settings The developed sensors were deployed in real situations where
    farmers want to optimize irrigation to conserve water. Plots with different irrigation
    strategies were prepared in an experimental field in Hyderabad. Note that the
    target crop used was maize. Iterative experiments were planned in the maize field
    for both the rainy and dry season. The deployment was started on August 9, 2017,
    and it finished in late October, which is the rainy season. A total of 12 sensor
    nodes and a gateway were prepared for deployment. In this experiment, 2 different
    irrigation levels, (i) 11 - rain-fed and (ii) 12 - 0.8 IW/CPE were prepared. Note
    that IW/CPE means irrigated water per cumulative pan evaporation. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the plot setup with eight ridges that have an interval of 60 cm and sowing interval
    of 20 cm. Ridge irrigation, wherein water is supplied through the water channel
    between the ridges, is applied manually. The sensor probes were inserted on the
    top of the ridge, and the measurement depth was set at 10 and 20 cm from the top
    of the ridge. B. Comparison on Plots Fig. 5 presents the soil moisture data collected
    by the deployed sensors, and the precipitation data and occurrence of rain and
    thunderstorm provided by Weather Underground (https://www.wunderground.com/).
    The expected soil moisture differences according to the plot settings were observed.
    In plot I1, the soil moisture level is initially low. The soil retained sufficient
    water and did not dry up at 20 cm depth in plot I2 but the soil at the 10 cm depth
    dried up around 9/6 and 9/14. As it was the rainy season, soil moisture changes
    due to precipitation were clearly seen in plot I2. However, the water supply from
    the rain seemed to be quickly absorbed by the dry soil in I1. Once enough water
    was supplied by thunderstorms around 9/27, plot I1 started responding to precipitation.
    Note that in case no precipitation amount was recorded despite having rain and
    thunderstorm, then there was a hit-or-miss circumstance. Thus, actual precipitation
    amount would be different from the representative data. Therefore, it is necessary
    to deploy a precipitation sensor in the real field for a more detailed analysis
    of the water supplied by precipitation. Since it was confirmed that the sensor
    was able to detect irrigation level differences and soil moisture changes, comparison
    with crop growth data, which will be obtained through remote sensing, should be
    done and the appropriate amount of water to be irrigated should be investigated.

    SECTION V. Conclusion A cost-effective soil moisture monitoring device was developed
    to optimize irrigation activities. Cost reduction was achieved by leveraging a
    capacitive touch sensing module of the MCU and fabricating easily exchangeable
    sensor electrodes with printed electronics. Through experimental deployments,
    the sensors reasonably captured soil moisture changes and irrigation level differences
    in a practical environment in India. It was also confirmed that the monitoring
    network has sufficient performance to monitor soil conditions. For future studies,
    crop growth and soil moisture in the dry season-where water supply by precipitation
    is rarely expected-will be evaluated. The result will then be applied to irrigation
    strategies. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by SICORP Collaborative Hub

  description: 'This article is an introduction to the "Advances in Irrigation" Special
    Collection in this issue of Transactions ASABE and the next issue of Applied Engineering
    in Agriculture, consisting of 14 articles selected from 88 papers and presentations
    at the ASABE 5th Decennial National Irrigation Symposium, which was held in December
    2010 in Phoenix, Arizona. This symposium followed the objectives of the previous
    four decennial events to provide a forum to assess the progress of research endeavors
    to advance the effectiveness of irrigation practices during the past ten years,
    leading to further research priorities in light of future challenges. The articles
    in this Special Collection address a wide range of topics grouped into broad categories:
    microirrigation, center-pivot irrigation, crop water use for improved irrigation
    management, and smart irrigation controllers for landscape irrigation. While these
    articles are not inclusive of all irrigation work since the last decennial symposium,
    they provide an example of work considered important by researchers, funding agencies,
    and other stakeholders. Many aspects of irrigation have changed since the first
    symposium in 1970. Although microirrigation is a small proportion of irrigated
    acreage, it will continue to increase in highly technical commercial food and
    fiber production as well as in subsistence farming. Center-pivot irrigation systems
    have been an important tool to deliver water more efficiently in diverse settings.
    Advanced telemetry and control systems, developed during the past ten years, are
    now common options for center pivots, but challenges remain in integrating these
    hardware developments into crop management practices. Possibilities are emerging
    for adding monitoring devices to center pivots to match crop water needs with
    water delivery. Energy balance models continue to be refined as tools to estimate
    crop water use from both ground-based and satellite-based data. Evapotranspiration
    estimates are evolving from single-location weather stations to whole-field or
    regional scopes. Finally, smart irrigation controllers have coupled evapotranspiration
    estimation or soil water sensing with automated irrigation system water delivery.
    These controllers can increase the precision of irrigation to match crop or landscape
    water needs. Irrigation will continue to be an important practice for producing
    the world''s food. The irrigation research and education professions will need
    to respond to food production challenges with even more refined irrigation systems
    and water management in the next ten years. However, research investment in irrigation
    continues to decline while important issues exist, such as maintaining agricultural
    profitability with declining water supplies, integrating sensor-based information
    for real-time autonomous or semi-autonomous management, competition for limited
    water supplies between agriculture and other sectors, increasing energy cost,
    environmental impacts of irrigation, and use of alternative (i.e., lower quality)
    water sources for irrigation. © 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological

    was designed by using self-designed irrigation control devices and soil moisture
    monitoring devices, as well as data transmission with GSM network. The system
    has the functions of soil moisture monitoring, alltomatic irrigation control and
    expert decision support, and advantage of saving irrigation water, more efficient
    utilization of water resource. It consists of three parts, the onsite control
    cabinet, data collection system and automatic control software. The system can
    realize real-time soil moisture monitoring, expert knowledge management, and automatic
    irrigation control based on parameters of water demand by different crops in different
    growth phases. Application in demonstration areas proved that, the system is stable,
    reliable and easy to operate. It can be widely applied in such fields as large-scale
    planting, greenhouses and precision agriculture. It is of great significance for
    the implementation of water-saving agriculture.
